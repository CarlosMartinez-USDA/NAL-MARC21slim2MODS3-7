  1 aRuan, Yong-Ling14aThe delayed initiation and slow elongation of fuzz-like short fibre cells in relation to altered patterns of sucrose synthase expression and plasmodesmata gating in a lintless mutant of cotton  ap. 977-984.  aCotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) seed develops single-celled long fibres (lint) from the seed-coat epidermis at anthesis. Previous studies have shown that the initiation and rapid elongation of these fibres requires the expression of sucrose synthase (Sus) and, potentially, a transient closure of plasmodesmata. This study extends the previous work to examine the patterns of Sus expression and plasmodesmata gating in fuzz-like short fibres of a mutant that shows delayed initiation and much slower and reduced elongation of the fibre cells. Immunolocalization studies revealed delayed expression of Sus in the mutant seed-coat epidermis that correlates temporally and spatially with the initiation of the fibre cells. Anatomically, these short fibres differed from the normal lint in that their basal ends enlarged immediately after initiation, while the majority of the normal lint on wild-type seed did not show this enlargement until the end of elongation. Suppression of Sus expression in the seed-coat epidermis of the transgenic plants reduced the length of both lint and short fuzz fibres at maturity, suggesting that the growth of short fibres also requires high levels of Sus expression. Confocal imaging of the membrane-impermeant fluorescent solute carboxyfluorescein (CF) revealed no closure of plasmodesmata during the entire elongation period of short fibres from the mutant seed. These results show (i) the delayed initiation of fuzz-like short fibres from the mutant seed correlates with delayed or insufficient expression of Sus in a subset of seed-coat epidermal cells destined to become fibres and (ii) the much shortened elongation of the fibres from the mutant may be related to their inability to close plasmodesmata. 3aGossypium hirsutum 3acotton 3amutants 3asucrose synthase 3aplasmodesmata 3aactive transport 3aepidermis (plant) 3atesta 3alength 3agene expression 3aimmunohistochemistry 3atransgenic plants 2aCotton Fiber 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmentalxphysiology 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxphysiology 2aGlucosyltransferasesxbiosynthesis 2aGossypiumxcytologyxenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aMutation 2aPhenotype 2aPlasmodesmataxphysiology 2aSeedsxgrowth & development1 aLlewellyn, Danny J.1 aFurbank, Robert T.1 aChourey, Prem S.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2005 Mar., v. 56, no. 413 p.977-984x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a20060228b20060302c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/02/10  aNon-US 7aarticle02406naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100002100136245015100157300001800308500002400326520156400350650001201914650001101926650001101937650000901948650001301957773011001970852000902080856003902089655001202128IND4417435920221119112552.0090306e20090330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441743592DNAL7 a10.1002/hyp.72062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMolotch, Noah P.10aReconstructing snow water equivalent in the Rio Grande headwaters using remotely sensed snow cover data and a spatially distributed snowmelt model  ap. 1076-1089.  aIncludes references  aSnow covered area (SCA) observations from the Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) were used in combination with a distributed snowmelt model to estimate snow water equivalent (SWE) in the headwaters of the Rio Grande basin (3,419 km²) - a spatial scale that is an order of magnitude greater than previous reconstruction model applications. In this reconstruction approach, modeled snowmelt over each pixel is integrated over the time of ETM+ observed snow cover to estimate SWE. Considerable differences in the magnitude of SWE were simulated during the study. Basin-wide mean SWE was 2·6 times greater in April 2001 versus 2002. Despite these climatological differences, the model adequately recovered SWE at intensive study areas (ISAs); mean absolute SWE error was 23% relative to observed SWE. Reconstruction model SWE errors were within one standard deviation of the mean observed SWE over 37 and 55% of the four 16-km² intensive field campaign study sites in 2001 and 2002, respectively; a result comparable to previous works at much smaller scales. A key strength of the technique is that spatially distributed SWE estimates are not dependent upon ground-based observations of SWE. Moreover, the model was relatively insensitive to the location of forcing observations relative to commonly used statistical SWE interpolation models. Hence, the reconstruction technique is a viable approach for obtaining high-resolution SWE estimates at larger scales (e.g. >1000 km²) and in locations where detailed hydrometeorological observations are scarce. 3aLandsat 3abasins 3amodels 3asnow 3asnowmelt0 tHydrological processes.g2009 Mar. 30, v. 23, no. 7 p.1076-1089dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0885-60877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.7206 7aarticle02964naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245008300173300001600256520151700272650002401789650004101813650000901854650001201863650001201875650001201887650001501899650001801914650001301932650001301945650001701958650001901975650001401994650000902008650001302017650001602030650001002046653002202056653002402078653002002102653002402122700002602146700002302172773011602195852000902311856009202320930003302412946001302445655001202458IND4439642420221119112407.0100709e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443964242DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1526-100X.2009.00634.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBruel, Betina O.10aSurvival and Growth of Tree Species under Two Direct Seedling Planting Systems  ap. 414-417.  aDirect tree planting restoration systems are frequently used for recovering degraded tropical landscapes. Although manual planting tends to be more viable economically and logistically over small areas, in large restorations the use of agricultural equipment that optimizes effort is preferable. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficiency of the two native tree species planting systems--manual and mechanized--used in the restoration of Atlantic Forest landscapes that have been converted to pasture. In recently abandoned grazing areas with abundant cover of the exotic grass Brachiaria humidicola, 393 seedlings of 6 species were planted in two treatments: a mechanized planting system (soil prepared with a rotary tiller attached to a tractor; seedlings in polypropylene tubes) and a manual planting system (holes dug with a manual excavator; seedlings wrapped in polyethylene bags). After 12 months, survival (manual: 85%; mechanized: 71%) and growth rates (RGRheight: manual = 0.88 ± 0.06 and mechanized = 0.98 ± 0.06 cm/cm; RGRdiameter: manual = 0.77 ± 0.05 and mechanized = 0.86 ± 0.05 cm/cm) were high in both treatments, but no differences were found between them. Both planting systems proved efficient for planting native tree seedlings in pastures. The excellent results demonstrated in this study by the mechanized planting system are important because this cheap and readily available technique provides a good, but less frequently used, alternative to the manual planting system. 3aUrochloa humidicola 3aagricultural machinery and equipment 3abags 3aforests 3agrasses 3agrazing 3alandscapes 3amechanization 3apastures 3aplanting 3apolyethylene 3apolypropylenes 3aseedlings 3asoil 3atractors 3atree growth 3atrees 0aabandoned pasture 0aAtlantic Rainforest 0amanual planting 0amechanized planting1 aMarques, Márcia C.M.1 aBritez, Ricardo M.0 tRestoration ecology.g2010 July, v. 18, no. 4 p.414-417dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1061-29717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1526-100X.2009.00634.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100709b20100807c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02760naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001700171245006700188300001600255520114100271650001201412650001101424650002101435650002001456650002201476650001301498650000901511650001401520650003301534650001001567650001201577650002201589650002501611650002701636650003001663651001101693651001101704653002001715653003001735700001701765700001501782700002101797700002101818700001701839700002001856700002001876700002101896773013201917852000902049856009202058930003302150946001102183655001202194IND4434536120221119112809.0100326e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443453612DNAL7 a204384932pmid7 a10.1111/j.1740-0929.2009.00723.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTashi Dorji.10aSheep genetic diversity in Bhutan using microsatellite markers  ap. 145-151.  aGenotype data from eight microsatellite markers were used to assess genetic diversity and relationships among five indigenous Bhutanese sheep populations, Sakten, Jakar, Sarpang, Sipsu and Tsirang. Estimates of mean observed and expected heterozygosities, mean number of alleles per locus/population were obtained. The highest observed heterozygosities were found in Jakar (0.657) and Sakten (0.647), while the lowest one was found in Tsirang (0.539). Genetic distances, pairwise proportion of different alleles, UPGMA tree, and principal component analysis indicate close relationship among Tsirang, Sipsu and Sarpang populations, while Jakar and Sakten populations are located in one cluster. These two clusters are separated geographically, and show distinct phenotypic as well as molecular characters. We therefore recommend that the Bhutanese native sheep populations be classified into at least two distinct breeds, Jakar-Sakten sheep and Sipsu sheep. Since Jakar and Sakten sheep have different morphological phenotypes, further analyses will be required to understand the genetic differences between these two sheep populations. 3aalleles 3abreeds 3agenetic distance 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3aloci 3aphenotype 3aprincipal component analysis 3asheep 2aAnimals 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenetics, Population 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 2aSheep, Domesticxgenetics 3aBhutan 0aBhutan 0aBhutanese sheep 0aphylogenetic relationship1 aJianlin, Han1 aWafula, Po1 aYamamoto, Yoshio1 aSasazaki, Shinji1 aOyama, Kenji1 aHanotte, Oliver1 aLin, Bang-Zhong1 aMannen, Hideyuki0 tAnimal science journal =.g2010 Apr., v. 81, no. 2 p.145-151dMelbourne, Australia : Blackwell Publishing Asiax1344-39417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1740-0929.2009.00723.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20120413b20120504c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02541naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245010700182300001600289500002400305520098500329650002601314650002401340650001001364650001401374650001501388650002201403650009301425650002101518650002501539650001801564650002801582650001401610650002601624650002301650650002501673650002701698650002701725650003601752651001601788651001601804700001801820700001901838773009601857852000901953856008501962655001202047IND4434960620221119112914.0100402s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443496062DNAL7 a203522122pmid7 a10.1007/s00705-010-0604-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarper, S.

In this study, five known and suspected RB isolates were separated from field mixtures, and their genomes were sequenced in full. It was found that the RB isolates are members of a single phylogenetically distinct clade with an average of 90.3% genomic nucleotide sequence identity to the closest extant isolate, T36. These isolates also show evidence of multiple recombination events throughout their evolutionary history, with T36, T30 and VT-like isolates, and with each other. Finally, the genomic sequences of these isolates show that several genes contain unique polymorphisms that may or may not be involved in overcoming resistance. These data will aid in the understanding of host-virus interactions, and the mechanism of resistance in P. trifoliata. 3aCitrus tristeza virus 3aPoncirus trifoliata 3agenes 3aphylogeny 3arootstocks 3asequence analysis 2aClosterovirusxclassificationxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 2aCluster Analysis 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGenome, Viral 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aPoncirusxvirology 2aRNA, Viralxgenetics 2aRecombination, Genetic 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 3aNew Zealand 0aNew Zealand1 aDawson, T.

We demonstrate the temporal differential expression levels of the PBAN receptor (PBAN-R) gene, reaching peak levels at a critical period of 5 h post-eclosion. Previous studies implied a possible regulatory role for juvenile hormone (JH). We herein demonstrate that PBAN-R expression levels increase normally when females are decapitated or head-ligated, removing the source of JH, before peak transcript levels are reached. Similarly, sex pheromone production can be induced by PBAN in such decapitated females. These results indicate that up-regulation, at this critical time, is not dependent on JH originating from the head. Conversely, JH injected in vivo at this critical period significantly inhibits PBAN-R transcript levels. 3aG-protein coupled receptors 3aHelicoverpa armigera 3abiosynthesis 3afemales 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahead 3ajuvenile hormones 3aneuropeptide receptors 3apheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide 3asex pheromones 2aAnimals 2aDecapitation 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmental 2aInsect Proteinsxmetabolism 2aInsecticidesxdiagnostic use. 2aJuvenile Hormonesxmetabolism 2aMale 2aMothsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aNeuropeptidesxmetabolism 2aPhenylcarbamatesxdiagnostic use. 2aReceptors, G-Protein-Coupledxmetabolism 2aSex Attractantsxbiosynthesis 0areal-time PCR 0apheromone gland 0aaedeagus1 aAzrielli, A.1 aRafaeli, A.0 tInsect molecular biology.g2010 Feb., v. 19, no. 1 p.77-86dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2583.2009.00937.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100111b20100205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03849naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245011700146300001600263500001500279520166400294650001601958650001301974650001201987650000901999650002902008650001602037650001002053650001002063650003502073650002402108650002502132650002002157650002402177650001702201650001302218650001402231650002702245650000902272650004202281650005602323650002402379650002502403650002802428650001702456650001102473650001302484650001102497650002502508650006402533650003002597650002602627650004602653650001802699650003602717650001002753650001402763653001802777653001402795653003102809653003102840700002002871700001802891700001802909773009602927852000903023930003303032945001303065946001303078655001203091IND2327339720221119112637.0020531e200111  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232733972DNAL7 a116845402pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRapuri, P.B.10aCaffeine intake increases the rate of bone loss in elderly women and interacts with vitamin D receptor genotypes  ap. 694-700.  a2019-12-05  aBackground: The role of caffeine as a risk factor for bone loss is controversial. Objective: Our goals were 1) to compare in both a cross-sectional study and a 3-y longitudinal study the bone mineral density (BMD) of postmenopausal women consuming high or low amounts of caffeine and 2) to study the interaction between caffeine intake, vitamin D receptor (VDR) polymorphism, and BMD in the longitudinal study. Design: The results are derived from cross-sectional measurements of BMD in 489 elderly women (aged 65-77 y) and from longitudinal measurements made in 96 of these women who were treated with a placebo for 3 y. Changes in BMD were adjusted for confounding factors and were compared between groups with either low (less than or equal to 300 mg/d) or high (> 300 mg/d) caffeine intakes and between the VDR genotype subgroups of the low- and high-caffeine groups. Results: Women with high caffeine intakes had significantly higher rates of bone loss at the spine than did those with low intakes (-1.90 +/- 0.97% compared with 1.19 +/- 1.08%; P = 0.038). When the data were analyzed according to VDR genotype and caffeine intake, women with the tt genotype had significantly (P = 0.054) higher rates of bone loss at the spine (-8.14 +/- 2.62%) than did women with the TT genotype (-0.34 +/- 1.42%) when their caffeine intake was > 300 mg/d. Conclusions: Intakes of caffeine in amounts > 300 mg/d (approximately equal to 514 g, or 18 oz, brewed coffee) accelerate bone loss at the spine in elderly postmenopausal women. Furthermore, women with the tt genetic variant of VDR appear to be at a greater risk for this deleterious effect of caffeine on bone. 3aosteocalcin 3acaffeine 3aelderly 3adiet 3a25-hydroxyergocalciferol 3ablood serum 3aurine 3awomen 3anutrition-genotype interaction 3aalcoholic beverages 3alongitudinal studies 3asmoking (habit) 3aparathyroid hormone 3abone density 3agenotype 3areceptors 2aAbsorptiometry, Photon 2aAged 2aBone Densityxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aCaffeinexadministration & dosagexadverse effects. 2aCalciumxmetabolism 2aCase-Control Studies 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDiet Records 2aFemale 2aGenotype 2aHumans 2aLongitudinal Studies 2aOsteoporosis, Postmenopausalxchemically inducedxgenetics. 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 2aPostmenopause 2aReceptors, Calcitriolxgenetics 2aSpine 2aVitamin D 0an-telopeptide 0avitamin D 0asites testing osteoporosis 0aprevention or intervention1 aGallagher, J.C.1 aKinyamu, H.K.1 aRyschon, K.L.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2001 Nov., v. 74, no. 5 p.694-700x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a20020630b20020705c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle03796naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001800171245011100189300001600300520204900316650001602365650001002381650005602391650004602447650005102493650004402544650004602588650003802634650001102672650001102683650004102694650004102735650000902776650001602785650001502801653003102816653001702847653003002864700001602894700001602910700001602926700001802942700001402960700001802974700001402992773010303006852000903109856009203118930003303210946001103243655001203254IND4434812320221119112619.0100402e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443481232DNAL7 a199513752pmid7 a10.1111/j.1398-9995.2009.02280.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVultaggio, A.10aAnti-infliximab IgE and non-IgE antibodies and induction of infusion-related severe anaphylactic reactions  ap. 657-661.  aTo cite this article: Vultaggio A, Matucci A, Nencini F, Pratesi S, Parronchi P, Rossi O, Romagnani S, Maggi E. Anti-infliximab IgE and non-IgE antibodies and induction of infusion-related severe anaphylactic reactions. Allergy 2010; 65: 657-661. Infliximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody against TNF-α useful in the treatment of many chronic inflammatory diseases. Severe anaphylaxis has been reported during therapy, although the exact mechanism has not been fully defined. The reactions have been related to the infliximab immunogenicity and development of specific antibodies. Evaluation of the development of IgE and non-IgE antibodies to infliximab and their relationship with infusion reaction. Seventy-one patients (11 reactives, 11 therapeutically nonresponders, and 49 unreactive therapeutically responders) and 20 non-infliximab-exposed control subjects (ten rheumatoid arthritis, five spondyloarthropathies, five vasculitis) were evaluated for the presence of IgE (ImmunoCAP assay), IgM, and non-isotype-specific (ELISA assays) anti-infliximab antibodies. Sera were obtained at baseline and during the course of treatment, before each infliximab infusion. Eleven out of 71 patients had a hypersensitivity reaction to infliximab. Non-isotype-specific anti-infliximab antibodies were detected in eight reactive and two nonresponder patients. Three patients with severe reactions displayed anti-infliximab IgE antibodies and positive skin testing. Detectable levels of anti-infliximab IgM antibodies were shown in three additional IgE- and skin testing-negative patients. IgE and IgM antibodies to infliximab were not detectable in the two nonresponder patients. Antibodies developed before the 2nd and the 3rd infusion, and their appearance was strictly related to the timing of the reaction. This report indicates that in some patients with infliximab-related severe reactions, IgE or IgM antibodies against infliximab were detectable. The majority of reactions could be predicted by the appearance of anti-infliximab antibodies. 3aanaphylaxis 2aAdult 2aAnaphylaxisxbloodxchemically inducedximmunology. 2aAnti-Inflammatory Agentsxadverse effects 2aAntibodies, Anti-Idiotypicxbloodximmunology. 2aAntibodies, Monoclonalxadverse effects 2aDrug Hypersensitivityxbloodximmunology. 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aImmunoglobulin Exbloodximmunology. 2aImmunoglobulin Mxbloodximmunology. 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aSkin Tests 0aanti-infliximab antibodies 0adrug allergy 0adrug-specific IgE and IgM1 aMatucci, A.1 aNencini, F.1 aPratesi, S.1 aParronchi, P.1 aRossi, O.1 aRomagnani, S.1 aMaggi, E.0 tAllergy.g2010 May, v. 65, no. 5 p.657-661dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0105-45387nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1398-9995.2009.02280.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100402b20100501c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02915naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245012600162300001600288520157100304650001301875650001601888650001301904650002201917650001201939650001401951650001301965650001201978650001401990650002002004650002602024650001102050650001602061650001902077650002102096653001102117653002002128653002702148700001802175773012602193852000902319856008502328930003302413946001102446655001202457IND4432504420221119112718.0100205e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443250442DNAL7 a10.1134/S10674136100101942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXia, Jigang 10aEffect of temperature on blood parameters of the salamander Batrachupems tibetanus (Schmidt, 1925) (Amphibia: Hynobiidae)  ap. 102-106.  aTo better understand how Batrachupems tibetanus responds to different temperature regimes in the blood parameters and to estimate the change in plasma cortisol level in this species exposed to different temperatures, the animals were stochastically divided into three groups and exposed respectively to 4.6°C, 14.6°C and 19.6°C for 12 days. The concentrations of glucose, total protein, albumin, triacylglycerol, Ca²⁺, K⁺, Na⁺, Cl⁻, and plasma cortisol level were measured respectively. There was no significant difference between the plasma cortisol level of the control group and the experiment groups. Glucose level at 4.6°C and 19.6°C was significantly lower than glucose level at 14.6°C. The plasma triacylglycerol level was significantly influenced by acclimation temperature. The concentration of total protein, albumin, globulin and the ratio between albumin and globulin were not significantly influenced by temperature when compared with control group. There was no significant change in concentration of Ca²⁺ at different temperatures. The concentration of K⁺ was significantly influenced by temperature. Plasma K⁺ level significantly increased at 19.6°C. The plasma Na⁺ level and Cl⁻ were significantly influenced by temperature. Na⁺: Cl⁻ ratio was significantly influenced by temperature. Therefore, glucose, triacylglycerol, Na⁺ and Cl⁻ levels could be considered as indicators of thermal stress in B. tibetanus; plasma cortisol, albumin, globulin levels, and albumin/globulin ratio are not influenced by temperature. 3aAmphibia 3aacclimation 3aalbumins 3ablood composition 3acalcium 3achlorides 3acortisol 3aglucose 3apotassium 3aprotein content 3asalamanders and newts 3asodium 3atemperature 3athermal stress 3atriacylglycerols 0astress 0ablood parameter 0aBatrachupems tibetanus1 aLi, Xiaochen 0 tRussian journal of ecology.g2010 Jan., v. 41, no. 1 p.102-106dDordrecht : SP MAIK Nauka/Interperiodicax1067-41367nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S10674136100101943Available from publisher's Web site  a20100205b20100305c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02301naa a2200541 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001700097040001800114100002900132245009900161300001600260300003000276520071500306650001601021650000801037650001101045650001101056650003201067650002301099650001001122650001801132650002901150650003101179650001601210650001001226650002101236650002401257650001101281650003601292650002801328650001101356650001101367650005001378650002301428650000901451650002301460650002301483650006601506651001601572773009601588852000901684939003301693945000801726946001301734655001201747991562849590742620221119112750.0800516e197904  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI800006252DNAL7 a1077832pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrowbridge, Frederick L.10aClinical and biochemical characteristics associated with anthropometric nutritional categories  ap. 758-766.  ap. 758-766. ill., charts.  aExtract: Clinical nutrition status as well as selected biochemical characteristics, levels of parasitic infection and aspects of family and health history were assessed in rural El Salvadoran children categorized as severely malnourished by anthropometric measurements.

Intragastric feeding with ketoanalogues of the branched-chain amino acids did not alter thymidine incorporation into DNA significantly. The finding that intragastric feeding depresses DNA synthesis after partial hepatectomy contrasts with studies indicating increased synthesis of albumin in partially hepatectorized animals receiving similar feeding and indicates different control mechanisms for DNA and albumin synthesis. 3aanimal experimentation 3aamino acids 3aliver 3arats 3aDNA 3aforced feeding 2aAmino Acidsxpharmacology 2aAmino Acids, Branched-Chainxpharmacology 2aAmino Acids, Essentialxpharmacology 2aAnimals 2aDNAxbiosynthesis 2aEnteral Nutrition 2aHepatectomy 2aLiverxphysiology 2aLiver Regenerationxdrug effects 2aMale 2aRats 2aStructure-Activity Relationship 2aThymidinexmetabolism1 aSaunders, S.J.1 aFrith, L.O'C.1 aRawlings, E.1 aWoodburn, V.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1979 Apr., v. 32, no. 4 p.738-740x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19800516c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02751naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245011300166300001800279520133400297650001601631650001501647650004301662650001301705650003801718650001901756650002201775650002101797650001201818650001301830650001201843650001201855650002001867650001901887650002301906650001101929650001501940650001101955650001201966700001401978700001401992700001402006700001602020773017302036856005102209852000902260655001202269IND60580801220221119112742.0171002e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058080122DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-12-0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlthaus, D.10aBacteriological Survey of Ready-to-Eat Lettuce, Fresh-Cut Fruit, and Sprouts Collected from the Swiss Market  ap. 1338-1341.  aThe consumption of ready-to-eat fresh vegetables has increased significantly in the recent decades. So far, no data are available on the bacteriological burden and the prevalence of foodborne pathogens in ready-to-eat lettuce, fresh-cut fruit, and sprouts on the Swiss market. This study was based on investigations carried out during 2 months of the summer season in 2011. Samples of 142 salads, 64 fresh-cut fruit, and 27 sprouts were included in this study. Escherichia coli, an indicator microorganism for fecal contamination, was only found in 5 lettuce samples, with amounts ranging between 2 and 3 log CFU/g. No Salmonella spp. were detected from any of the 233 samples analyzed in this study, and a low occurrence was found for contamination with L. monocytogenes, Shiga toxin–producing E. coli, enteropathogenic E. coli, and Cronobacter. From the results of the present study, we conclude that even in a country where the use of chlorine solutions to sanitize fruits and vegetables in the fresh-cut industry is not allowed, it is possible to produce ready-to-eat lettuce, fresh-cut fruit, and sprouts with high microbiological standards. Strict maintenance of good practices of hygiene at preharvest, harvest, and postharvest levels is of central importance to ensure both public health protection and product quality. 3aCronobacter 3aSalmonella 3aShiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli 3achlorine 3aenteropathogenic Escherichia coli 3afood pathogens 3afresh-cut produce 3ahealth promotion 3ahygiene 3aindustry 3alettuce 3amarkets 3aproduct quality 3araw vegetables 3aready-to-eat foods 3asalads 3asanitizing 3asummer 3asurveys1 aHofer, E.1 aCorti, S.1 aJulmi, A.1 aStephan, R.0 tJournal of food protection.g2012 July, v. 75, no. 7 p.1338-1341dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-12-022  aDNAL 7aarticle01845naa a2200445 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001700097040001800114100002300132245006200155300001600217300002300233500001500256520066700271650002500938650001300963650000900976650002400985650001501009650001601024650001201040650001001052650002101062650001101083650003801094650002701132650000901159651001301168651001101181651001301192700002301205773009601228852000901324939003301333945000801366946001301374655001201387991562849200742620221119112602.0800516e197904  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI800006272DNAL7 a5819252pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJackson, Robert T.10aLactose malabsorption among Masai children of East Africa  ap. 779-782.  ap. 779-782. chart.  a2019-12-05  aExtract: Data are presented that show that 1) the Masai regularly drink considerable quantities of milk without apparent symptoms, 2) milk is an important constituent of the Masai diet, and 3) 62 percent of 21 Masai examined were malabsorbers of lactose as measured by the lactose tolerance test. This finding of lactose malabsorption in a nomadic cattle raising and milk drinking people is interesting and is contrary to the views often expressed by anthropologists and others. An ability to drink nutritionally useful quantities of milk does not, however, necessarily mean that milk production or imports should be encouraged in the Lesser Developed Countries. 3adeveloping countries 3achildren 3amilk 3alactose intolerance 2aAdolescent 2aAge Factors 2aAnimals 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aHumans 2aLactose Intolerancexepidemiology 2aLactose Tolerance Test 2aMilk 3aTanzania 0aAfrica 0aTanzania1 aLatham, Michael C.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1979 Apr., v. 32, no. 4 p.779-782x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19800516c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle01962naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002200134024001900156040001800175100002200193245009500215300001400310520094100324653003501265653001001300653001001310653000901320700001901329700002601348773011701374852000901491856009201500930003301592946001101625655001201636IND4431068720221119112624.0100111e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443106872DNAL7 a10.1111/j.0105-2896.2009.00864.x2doi7 aPMC29207302pmcid7 a201929942pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBiswas, Partha S.10aIRF4 and its regulators: evolving insights into the pathogenesis of inflammatory arthritis  ap. 79-96.  aAccumulating evidence from murine and human studies supports a key role for interleukin-17 (IL-17) and IL-21 in the pathogenesis of inflammatory arthritis. The pathways and molecular mechanisms that underlie the production of IL-17 and IL-21 are being rapidly elucidated. This review focuses on interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4), a member of the IRF family of transcription factors, which has emerged as a crucial controller of both IL-17 and IL-21 production. We first outline the complex role of IRF4 in the function of CD4⁺ T cells and then discuss recent studies from our laboratory that have revealed a surprising role for components of Rho GTPase-mediated pathways in controlling the activity of IRF4. A better understanding of these novel pathways will hopefully provide new insights into mechanisms responsible for the development of inflammatory arthritis and potentially guide the design of novel therapeutic approaches. 0ainterferon regulatory factor 4 0aIL-17 0aIL-21 0aDef61 aBhagat, Govind1 aPernis, Alessandra B.0 tImmunological reviews.g2010 Jan., v. 233, no. 1 p.79-96dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0105-28967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0105-2896.2009.00864.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100402b20100501c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02922naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159072000900168100001500177245014500192300001600337500002400353520151800377650002001895650001801915650002101933650002301954650001701977650001001994650001302004650001702017650001602034650002102050650002802071650003602099651001002135700002302145700002002168773009602188852000902284856009002293930003302383945002502416946001102441655001202452IND4388668820221119112926.0070308s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438866882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2006.08.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aL500 0aM0011 aKalita, P.10aEvaluation of the nutritional quality of four unexplored aquatic weeds from northeast India for the formulation of cost-effective fish feeds  ap. 204-209.  aIncludes references  aA study was conducted to evaluate the nutritional potential of four commonly available, unexplored aquatic weeds namely, Salvinia cuculata, Trapa natans, Lemna minor and Ipomoea reptans from northeast India for ascertaining their suitability for utilization as supplementary fish feed with the aim to reduce the cost of commercial feeds. Results of proximate analysis showed that the crude protein content of the aquatic weeds ranged between 11.0% and 32.2% (w/w), whereas crude fibre and ash contents varied between 4.2% and 20% (w/w), and 13.3% and 31.2% (w/w), respectively. Protein to energy ratio (P/E) of these weeds ranged between 30.7 mg/kcal and 95.3 mg/kcal and the highest value was displayed by I. reptans. All these aquatic weeds contained high amounts of vitamins E and C and mineral elements required for the normal growth and development of fish. Analysis of antinutritional factors showed that the concentration (g%) of trypsin inhibitor (TIA) ranged from 1.1% to 1.5%, calcium oxalate concentration ranged from 0.6% to 3.5%, tannin concentration ranged from 0.25% to 0.93% and phytate concentration ranged from 0.004% to 0.005% in these plant samples, and the amounts of these antinutritional components were within the tolerable limits of fish, particularly for carp. The present study demonstrates that commercial exploitation of these aquatic weeds, particularly I. reptans and L. minor, for the formulation of cost-effective and balanced artificial fish feeds appears to be highly promising. 3anutritive value 3aaquatic weeds 3afeed formulation 3acost effectiveness 3afish feeding 3afeeds 3aSalvinia 3aTrapa natans 3aLemna minor 3aIpomoea aquatica 3aantinutritional factors 3achemical constituents of plants 3aIndia1 aMukhopadhyay, P.K.1 aMukherjee, A.K.0 tFood chemistry.g2007, v. 103, no. 1 p.204-209dApplied Science Publishersx0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2006.08.0073Available from publisher's Web site  a20070820b20070902c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/07/31  aNon-US 7aarticle02277naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150100001600159245013500175300001600310500002400326520109000350650002701440650001801467650002001485650001601505650001301521650002101534650002001555651002101575700001601596700001501612773009601627852000901723856009001732930003301822945002501855946001101880655001201891IND4388669320140723000000.0070308s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438866932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2006.08.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5061 aÖzogul, Y.10aFatty acid profiles and fat contents of commercially important seawater and freshwater fish species of Turkey: A comparative study  ap. 217-223.  aIncludes references  aThe fat content and fatty acid compositions of edible muscle of commercially important seawater and freshwater fish species were investigated. The fatty acid compositions of seawater fish species were found to be 25.5-39.4% saturated (SFA), 13.2-29.0% monounsaturated (MUFAs) and 25.2-48.2% polyunsaturated acids (PUFAs), whereas the fatty acid compositions of freshwater fish from Lake Seyhan consisted of 28.0-34.6% saturated (SFA), 10.7-22.7% monounsaturated (MUFAs) and 23.2-43.7% polyunsaturated acids (PUFAs). The proportions of n3 PUFAs of seawater fish (ranging from 22.6 for waker to 44.2% for blue fish) were higher than those of n3 PUFAs of freshwater fish (ranging from 11.5% for North African catfish to 28.4% for zander). However, the levels of n6 PUFAs of seawater fish (ranging from 0.43% for blue fish to 14.4% for sea bass) were lower than those of n6 PUFAs of freshwater fish (ranging from 5.27% for kutum to 16.8% for tench).

Fetal age was estimated from fetal crown-to-rump length. Fetal alpha-tocopheral concentration ranged from 0 to 31.4 micrograms/g dry wt with a mean of 7.1 micrograms/g dry wt and from 0 to 0.92 micrograms/ml with a mean of 0.29 microgram/ml for liver and serum, respectively. Mean maternal liver (12.5 micrograms/g dry wt) and serum (2.16 micrograms/ml) alpha-tocopherol concentrations and vitamin E to cholesterol ratio (1.45) were 1.8, 7.4 and 3.5 times greater (P less than 0.0001) than fetal means, indicating limited placental transfer of vitamin E to the fetus. Gestational age had no effect on maternal vitamin E concentration, however, fetal tissue alpha-tocopherol concentration declined (P less than 0.05) with fetal age. Maternal serum alpha-tocopherol concentration and fetal age were found to best predict fetal alpha-tocopherol concentration in serum. Interrelationships between selenium and vitamin E status were minimal. These data suggest inefficient placental transfer of vitamin E, resulting in minimal protection of the neonate from vitamin E-deficiency disease as a result of prepartal maternal supplementation. 3adairy cattle 3adams (mothers) 3afetus 3avitamin E 3aselenium 3aplacenta 2aAnimals 2aCattlexmetabolism 2aCholesterolxblood 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxveterinary 2aFemale 2aFetal Bloodxanalysis. 2aFetusxmetabolism 2aGestational Age 2aLiverxmetabolism 2aMaternal-Fetal Exchange 2aModels, Biological 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy, Animalxmetabolism 2aSeleniumxmetabolism 2aVitamin Exmetabolism 0ainteractions 0atissues 0aplacental transfer1 aHerdt, T.H.1 aStowe, H.D.0 tJournal of nutrition.g1989 Aug., v. 119, no. 8 p.1156-1164x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03657naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152100002400170245010400194300001800298500002400316500001500340520166300355650001602018650001802034650000902052650002002061650000902081650001202090650001902102650002002121650001502141650001502156650000702171650002902178650002102207650001102228650001702239650003502256650003302291650003302324650002902357650001302386650002702399650002402426650003102450650004002481650004202521650001702563650002002580650004202600650003102642651001102673653001102684700001902695700002002714700001602734700003202750773011302782852000902895856009102904655001202995IND4434850120221119112617.0100402s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443485012DNAL7 a202063762pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2010.02.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeier, Lene Sørlie10aShort-term temporal variations in speciation of Pb, Cu, Zn and Sb in a shooting range runoff stream  ap. 2409-2417.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis study was designed to explore the changes in physico-chemical forms of Pb, Cu, Zn and Sb in a stream draining a contaminated shooting range, located at Steinsjøen in the South-Eastern part of Norway, during a period of 21days. To obtain information on the element species distribution, an interphased size and charge fractionation system was applied, where membrane filtration (0.45µm) and ultrafiltration using hollow fibre (nominal cut off 10kDa) were performed prior to charge fractionation using chromatography (cationic and anionic exchange resins). The results show that Pb mainly was present as particulate and colloidal high molecular mass (HMM) species, Cu as colloidal (HMM) and low molecular mass (LMM) species, while Sb and Zn were mainly present as LMM species. The total element concentrations of Pb, Cu, Zn and Sb were positively correlated to water flow and dissolved organic carbon (DOC), suggesting these are important factors in controlling the run-off of the investigated elements in this catchment. During episodes of higher water flow, the increase in element concentration was mainly in the colloidal fraction. Partial redundancy analysis (pRDA) revealed that variations in pH, HMM organic carbon (HMM OC) and LMM organic carbon (LMM OC) explained 47% of the variation in size distribution of the elements, while variations in precipitation and water flow explained 48% of the variation in the charge distribution of the elements. The variation in concentrations during the period varied by a factor of 4, also stressing the importance of frequent sampling opposed to spot sampling in environmental surveys and risk assessments. 3acorrelation 3afractionation 3azinc 3aultrafiltration 3alead 3asurveys 3achromatography 3arisk assessment 3awater flow 3awatersheds 3apH 3adissolved organic carbon 3amolecular weight 3arunoff 3abiogeography 2aAntimonyxanalysisxchemistry. 2aChromatography, Ion Exchange 2aCopperxanalysisxchemistry. 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aFirearms 2aFresh Waterxchemistry 2aIon Exchange Resins 2aLeadxanalysisxchemistry. 2aMetals, Heavyxanalysisxchemistry. 2aSoil Pollutantsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aTime Factors 2aWater Movements 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxchemistry 2aZincxanalysisxchemistry. 0aNorway 0acarbon1 aMeland, Sondre1 aLjønes, Marita1 aSalbu, Brit1 aStrømseng, Arnljot Einride0 tScience of the total environment.g2010 May 1, v. 408, no. 11 p.2409-2417dElsevier Sciencex0048-96977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2010.02.0193Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02600naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245007900165300001600244500002400260500001500284520133200299650001101631650002201642650001701664650002301681650001301704650001101717650004901728650003701777650002401814650002501838650001201863650001301875653001701888700001801905700002301923700001701946700002001963773012601983852000902109856004802118655001202166IND4393934320221119112645.0070812e199705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439393432DNAL7 a10.1007/s11746-997-0180-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOgata, Masahiro10aAntioxidant activity of Magnolol, honokiol, and related phenolic compounds  ap. 557-562.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe antioxidant activity of 10 Japanese and Chinese crude drugs (Kampo drugs) was determined in vitro. Extract of Magnolia cortex, which had the highest antioxidant activity, contained phenolic compounds magnolol and honokiol. However, inhibitory effects of these compounds on lipid oxidation were weaker than that of α-tocopherol as measured by thiobarbituric acid assay. The structure-activity relationship of phenolic compounds showed that antioxidant activities were in the order 4-allyl-2,6-dimethoxyphenol >= p,p'-biphenol > eugenol > 2-allyl-6-methylphenol > honokiol > magnolol > caffeic acid > p-ethylphenol > guaiacol. As expected, these results showed that an electron donor and/or bulky groups at the ortho- or para-position of the phenol were required for inhibition of lipid oxidation. Electron spin resonance spin trapping experiments showed that phenol compounds with an allyl substituent on their aromatic rings directly scavenged superoxide (O ₂ - ), and that only eugenol trapped hydroxyl radicals. These findings suggest that phenolic compounds that contain allyl groups may be effective antioxidants because of the scavenging ability of O ₂ - or hydroxyl radical, whereas other phenols, without an allyl moiety such as α-tocopherol, may play a role in the termination of free radical chain reactions. 3acortex 3ahydroxyl radicals 3acaffeic acid 3alipid peroxidation 3aguaiacol 3aphenol 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3astructure-activity relationships 3athiobarbituric acid 3aantioxidant activity 3aeugenol 3aMagnolia 0aantioxidants1 aHoshi, Midori1 aShimotohno, Kumiko1 aUrano, Shiro1 aEndo, Toyoshige0 tjournal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g1997 May, v. 74, no. 5 p.557-562dSpringer-Verlagw36205x0003-021X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11746-997-0180-3 7aarticle02400naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245021900172300001800391520109200409650002801501650002701529650001501556650001501571650001901586650003101605650001801636650002601654650002501680650002901705700002201734700002101756700002801777773017301805856005101978852000902029655001202038IND60580801620221119112601.0171002e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058080162DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-11-5552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshinari, Tomoya10aDevelopment of a Purification Method for Simultaneous Determination of Deoxynivalenol and Its Acetylated and Glycosylated Derivatives in Corn Grits and Corn Flour by Liquid Chromatography–Tandem Mass Spectrometry  ap. 1355-1358.  aWe developed a purification method based on liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry for the identification of deoxynivalenol (DON), its acetylated derivatives (3-acetyl-deoxynivalenol and 15-acetyl-deoxynivalenol), and a glycosylated derivative (deoxynivalenol-3-glucoside [D3G]) in corn-based products. The analytes were extracted from samples with acetonitrile-water (85:15, vol/vol) and then purified with multifunctional columns. Evaluation of five kinds of multifunctional columns revealed that DON and its acetylated derivatives were recovered well (96 to 120%) by all columns, but D3G was recovered adequately (93.5%) by only one column, InertSep VRA-3. Samples of corn grits and corn flour were analyzed using the purification method with InertSep VRA-3. DON, D3G, and 15-acetyl-deoxynivalenol were the major contaminants in the samples harvested in 2009, but only DON was detected in the samples harvested in 2010. These results suggest that the purification method using InertSep VRA-3 is effective for identification of DON and its derivatives in corn-based products. 3a15-acetyldeoxynivalenol 3a3-acetyldeoxynivalenol 3acorn flour 3acorn grits 3adeoxynivalenol 3adeoxynivalenol-3-glucoside 3aglycosylation 3aliquid chromatography 3apurification methods 3atandem mass spectrometry1 aOhnishi, Takahiro1 aKadota, Tomoyuki1 aSugita-Konishi, Yoshiko0 tJournal of food protection.g2012 July, v. 75, no. 7 p.1355-1358dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-11-555  aDNAL 7aarticle03397naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245010700172300001800279520187800297650002002175650002602195650002702221650001502248650002602263650001202289650003602301650002802337650002202365650001902387650000902406650001502415650002102430650001902451650002002470650001002490651001802500700002002518700001802538700002202556700002002578700002402598700002502622700002302647773017302670856005102843852000902894655001202903IND60580801820221119112650.0171002e20120801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058080182DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-11-5482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJackson, Emily E.10aDetection and Enumeration of Four Foodborne Pathogens in Raw Commingled Silo Milk in the United States  ap. 1382-1393.  aA nationwide survey was conducted to obtain qualitative and quantitative data on bacterial contamination of raw commingled silo milk intended for pasteurization. The levels of total aerobic bacteria, total coliforms, Enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus were determined using the TEMPO system. The prevalence rates and levels of presumptive Bacillus cereus, E. coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, and Salmonella spp. were determined in 214 samples. B. cereus was detected in 8.91% of samples, at 3.0 to 93 CFU/ml. E. coli O157:H7 was detected in 3.79 to 9.05% of samples, at <0.0055 to 1.1 CFU/ml, depending on the assay utilized. Salmonella spp. were recovered from 21.96 to 57.94% of samples, at <0.0055 to 60 CFU/ml. L. monocytogenes was detected in 50.00% of samples, at <0.0055 to 30 CFU/ml. The average log-transformed counts of total viable bacteria were slightly lower in samples containing no pathogens. No correlation was observed between the levels of organisms detected with the TEMPO system and the presence or levels of any pathogen except E. coli O157:H7. A higher average log-transformed count of total viable bacteria was observed in samples positive for this organism. The high prevalence rates of target pathogens may be attributed to a variety of factors, including detection methods, sample size, and commingling of the milk in the silo. The effects of commingling likely contributed to the high prevalence rates and low levels of target pathogens because of the inclusion of milk from multiple bulk tanks. The high prevalence rates also may be the result of analysis of larger sample volumes using more sensitive detection methods. These quantitative data could be utilized to perform more accurate risk assessments and to better estimate the appropriate level of protection for dairy products and processing technologies. 3aBacillus cereus 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aSalmonella 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aaerobes 3aappropriate level of protection 3abacterial contamination 3acoliform bacteria 3afood pathogens 3amilk 3amilk tanks 3anational surveys 3apasteurization 3arisk assessment 3asilos 3aUnited States1 aErten, Edibe S.1 aMaddi, Neeraj1 aGraham, Thomas E.1 aLarkin, John W.1 aBlodgett, Robert J.1 aSchlesser, Joseph E.1 aReddy, Ravinder M.0 tJournal of food protection.g2012 Aug., v. 75, no. 8 p.1382-1393dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-11-548  aDNAL 7aarticle02409naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100002300168245011700191300001600308500002400324520108700348650002501435650002301460650001801483650001101501650001101512650002001523650001101543650001701554650003601571650002501607700001501632700001701647700001701664700001801681773009601699852000901795856009001804930003301894945002501927946001101952655001201963IND4388668020140723000000.0070308s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438866802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2006.08.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aS2001 aFerreira, I.C.F.R.10aAntioxidant activity and phenolic contents of Olea europaea L. leaves sprayed with different copper formulations  ap. 188-195.  aIncludes references  aOlive trees (Olea europaea L. Cv. Cobrançosa) from the northeast of Portugal were sprayed with three different copper formulations [bordeaux mixture (copper sulphate + calcium hydroxide - 20% Cu), copper hydroxide (40% Cu) and copper oxychloride (50% Cu)] to control olive fungal diseases. The residues of copper in olive leaves, harvested at different times, were evaluated by atomic absorption spectrometry. At all the collection times, treated olive leaves had significantly higher copper contents, compared to the control. The different copper amounts in pesticide formulations lowered the leaves contents in total phenols and hence their antioxidant properties. Olive leaves sprayed with copper oxychloride possessed the highest copper levels and the lowest content in phenols, which influenced its antioxidant activity (higher EC₅₀ values for reducing power, scavenging effect on DPPH radicals and inhibition of erythrocyte hemolysis). Leaves without copper residues proved to be a good natural source of antioxidants, giving values comparable to the reference compounds. 3aantioxidant activity 3aphenolic compounds 3aOlea europaea 3aolives 3aleaves 3afoliar spraying 3acopper 3aantioxidants 3achemical constituents of plants 3achemical composition1 aBarros, L.1 aSoares, M.E.1 aBastos, M.L.1 aPereira, J.A.0 tFood chemistry.g2007, v. 103, no. 1 p.188-195dApplied Science Publishersx0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2006.08.0063Available from publisher's Web site  a20070820b20070902c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/07/31  aNon-US 7aarticle02531naa a2200397 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002000115245009300135300001600228300003000244500001500274520140200289650002001691650001901711650001401730650001701744650001701761650003601778651001101814651001001825653000901835653003101844700002501875700001601900700002101916700002501937773009601962852000902058939003302067945000802100946001302108655001202121991562843660742620221119112553.0831219e198306  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI830035252DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHankin, Jean H.10aReproducibility of a diet history questionnaire in a case-control study of breast cancer  ap. 981-985.  ap. 981-985. ill., charts.  a2019-12-05  aExtract: The reproducibility of a diet history questionnaire was assessed as part of a case-control breast cancer study in caucasian and Japanese women in Hawaii. The method was designed to estimate the intakes of total and saturated fat, cholesterol, and animal protein during a usual week before symptoms or diagnosis of disease in cases, and during a usual recent week in controls. Except for the period of reference, the dietary technique was identical for all cases and controls. A subsample of 61 Japanese women (19 cases and 42 controls) and 56 caucasian women (23 cases and 33 controls) participated in the dietary reinterview, conducted within 3 months of the first interview. The mean difference in intake between the 2 interviews was small and not statistically significant for all 4 nutrient items among Japanese cases and controls, and caucasian cases. The mean difference for all 4 nutrients was substantial and statistically significant among the caucasian controls. The intra-class correlation and the product-moment correlation were moderately high for all 4 nutrient items among Japanese cases and controls, and caucasian cases, but not among caucasian controls. These findings indicate that the diet history method is reasonably reproducible in 3 of the 4 groups of studied subjects. Possible reasons for the poor reproducibility among caucasian controls are discussed.

Design/methodology/approach - Two experiments were performed. In the first experiment, two artisanal Provolone del Monaco having different ripening times and two industrial Provolone cheeses were evaluated. A total of 95 subjects, divided into three homogeneous groups, first rated the samples in blind condition, then, after having received information about typicality; price, and both sets of information. In the second experiment, the quantitative descriptive profiles of eight Provolone del Monaco samples aged six months and made by different dairies were compared with the quantitative descriptive profiles of the same cheese aged ten months and provolone cheeses made by industrial dairies. Findings - Consumer results revealed that consumers knowing typicality information gave a better score to cheeses markedly different. The price together with typicality information, represented a quality indicator. Cluster analysis of descriptive scores revealed homogeneity between the equally aged Provolone del Monaco samples. Moreover descriptive data showed that cheese was characterized by several specific attributes, that the consumer, probably, recognized as typical. Research limitations - It must be noticed that once it was performed in Campania, the results extrapolation to other regions or countries should not be made unless similar results are found. Originality/value - This study will contribute to better addressing consumer needs and enhancing the competitiveness of traditional foods. 3aProvolone cheese 3acheese ripening 3acluster analysis 3adairies 3apasta 3aprices 3atraditional foods 3atraditional technology 3aItaly 3aMonaco1 aDi Marzo, Sabrina1 aCavella, Silvana1 aMasi, Paolo0 tBritish food journal.g2005, v. 107, no. 2 p.98-110x0007-070X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1108/000707005105791713Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03294naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245015700123300001600280500011800296500002400414520169100438650003002129650001902159650002302178650000902201650001102210650001802221650001502239650001402254650001302268650001802281650001002299650002702309650002402336650001402360650001402374650001102388650001602399650001202415650001102427650002202438650001102460700002102471700001602492700001802508700001502526773014002541852000902681856008602690655001202776IND4463036020221119112625.0120416s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446303602DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Ming10aGene transfer strategy for kiwifruit to obtain pure transgenic plant through inducing adventitious roots in leaf explants with Agrobacterium tumefaciens  ap. 495-499.  aPaper presented at the Fifth International Symposium on Kiwifruit, held September 15-20, 2002, Wuhan, P.R. China.  aIncludes references  aOwing to regeneration usually occurred via an intermediate callus phase and no adventitious buds directly regenerated from leaves in vitro in kiwifruit genetic transformation, kanamycin-resistant calli selected from leaf explants were usually chimeras with transformed and untransformed tissues. Reports have shown that adventitious roots were usually originated from a single cell in leaf explants. Based on these results, we attempted to obtain pure kiwifruit transgenic plants via inducing adventitious roots in leaf explants with Agrobacterium tumefaciens. The best regeneration of adventitious roots from leaf explants of kiwifruit was observed on MS medium with 2.0 mg/L IBA in continuous dark. Large adventitious roots were regenerated at the cut surface of each leaf explants in three weeks. In addition, rooting was observed in medium with 500 mg/L carbenicillin better than 500 mg/L cefotaxime. No adventitious roots were induced in medium with over 6 mg/L kanamycin. The leaf explants were co-cultivated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain A281 containing gus gene in medium with 2 mg/L IBA and 20 mg/L acetosyringone for 3 days in dark, then transferred to selective medium containing 2 mg/L IBA, 500 mg/L carbenicillin and 10 mg/L kanamycin, cultured in continuous dark. Kanamycin-resistant adventitious roots formed on leaf explants were excised and transferred to medium containing 2 mg/L zeatin, 0.1 mg/L IBA, 500 mg/L carbenicillin and 50 mg/L kanamycin to form calli and shoots, cultured under a 14h photoperiod. From 96 leaf explants we obtained 12 kanamycin-resistant calli. GUS histochemical staining assay indicated that these calli were pure transgenic tissues. 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3aacetosyringone 3aadventitious roots 3abuds 3acallus 3acarbenicillin 3acefotaxime 3achimerism 3aexplants 3agene transfer 3agenes 3agenetic transformation 3aindole butyric acid 3akanamycin 3akiwifruit 3aleaves 3aphotoperiod 3arooting 3ashoots 3atransgenic plants 3azeatin1 aHuang, Zhenguang1 aHan, Lixing1 aZhao, Gairong1 aLi, Yuhong0 tActa horticulturae.g2003 June, , no. 610 p.495-499dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/610/610_66.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02254naa a2200385 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002500115245007200140300001300212300002700225500001500252520116300267650001801430650002201448650001701470650002201487650002301509653000901532653001901541653002701560700002301587700002801610700002101638700002101659700002001680773009301700852000901793930003301802945000801835946001301843655001201856991562841490742620221119112708.0831020e198307  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI830029702DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchweizer, Thomas F.10aMetabolic effects of dietary fiber from dehulled soybeans in humans  ap. 1-11.  ap. 1-11. ill., charts.  a2019-12-05  aExtract: The normal diet of 6 healthy volunteers was supplemented with 21 g of dietary fiber from 2 different soybean seed fiber preparations (either a nonpurified and never-dried soya pulp A containing 39% dietary fiber or a purified soya fiber B containing 79% fiber) for 3 weeks each. Mean daily fecal wet weight was increased by 19 and 38% in the fiber periods A and B as compared to a 2-week control period. Stool frequency and transit time remained unchanged. Fecal fiber increased by 52% only during period B. Fecal calcium, magnesium, and iron were increased. Oral glucose tolerance was slighly improved after period B. Neither fiber changed serum triglycerides, but fiber B increased low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol by 19% and low-density lipoprotein-phospholipids by 16%. The ratio high-density/low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, however, did not change significantly. Thus, dietary fibers from soybean do not seem to contribute to the hypocholesterolemic effect of soya. The resulst of this study also demonstrate that apparently similar dietary fibers, coming from a single source, can exert distinctly different metabolic effects.

The between- and within-sample variability of capillary determinations was about 3 times higher than with venous measurements, but the difference was reduced considerably by using capillary serum rather than plasma. With both serum and plasma, the mean ferritin in capillary specimens was 3 to 5% higher than in venous blood. These minor drawbacks with capillary measurements are outweighed by the benefit of improved compliance in prevalence surveys when finger-stick sampling can be used in place of venipuncture.

Influenza matrix protein 2 (M2) is highly conserved in all influenza A strains. In this study, we deleted the transmembrane domain of the M2 of the avian influenza virus (AIV) A/Chicken/Jiangsu/7/2002 (H9N2) strain to create an M2 without a transmembrane domain, named sM2, which was efficiently expressed in Escherichia coli. The sM2 protein was administered intranasally to mice in combination with chitosan adjuvant three times at an interval of 3 weeks. Three weeks after the last immunization, the mice were challenged with a lethal dose (5 × LD₅₀) of A/Chicken/Jiangsu/7/2002 (H9N2) virus, PR8 (H1N1) virus and A/Chicken/Henan/12/2004 (H5N1) virus. The protective immunity of the vaccine was evaluated by determining the survival rates, residual lung virus titers, body weight, and the serum antibody titers of the mice. Nasal administration of 15 μg sM2 in combination with chitosan completely protected mice against the homologous virus and protected 90 and 30% of the mice against the heterologous H1N1 and H5N1 viruses, respectively. The study indicated that the sM2 protein was a candidate antigen for a broad-spectrum influenza virus vaccine and that the adjuvant chitosan improved the efficacy of the sM2 vaccine. 3aEscherichia coli 3aInfluenza A virus 3aantigens 3abody weight 3achickens 3achitosan 3aimmunity 3aimmunization 3ainfluenza 3aintranasal administration 3alethal dose 50 3amice 3avaccines 3aviruses 2aAdjuvants, Immunologicxadministration & dosage 2aAdministration, Intranasal 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Viralxblood 2aBody Weight 2aChitosanxadministration & dosage 2aCross Protection 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aFemale 2aGene Expression 2aInfluenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtypeximmunology 2aInfluenza A Virus, H5N1 Subtypeximmunology 2aInfluenza A Virus, H9N2 Subtypexgeneticsximmunology. 2aInfluenza Vaccinesxadministration & dosagexgeneticsximmunology. 2aLungxvirology 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aOrthomyxoviridae Infectionsxprevention & controlxvirology. 2aSurvival Analysis 2aViral Load 2aViral Matrix Proteinsxadministration & dosagexgeneticsximmunology.1 aChen, Quanjiao1 aWu, Rui1 aZhang, Hongbo1 aZheng, Mei1 aWang, Hanzhong1 aChen, Ze0 tArchives of virology.g2010 Apr., v. 155, no. 4 p.535-544dSpringer Viennax0304-86087nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-010-0621-43Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03335naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002400164245010300188300001600291500002400307500001500331520129900346650001601645650002801661650002201689650001501711650002201726650002501748650001001773650001201783650002701795650002301822650003201845650001201877650002501889650002101914650006901935650006402004650002002068650003302088650002802121650001402149650001502163650005202178650005202230650002702282650002202309651001302331651002802344653001602372653001702388653001802405700001902423700001902442700001702461700001702478773009602495852000902591856008502600655001202685IND4434961020221119111104.0100402s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443496102DNAL7 a202171552pmid7 a10.1007/s00705-010-0612-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRihtarič, Danijela10aIdentification of SARS-like coronaviruses in horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus hipposideros) in Slovenia  ap. 507-514.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBats have been identified as a natural reservoir for an increasing number of emerging zoonotic viruses, such as Hendra virus, Nipah virus, Ebola virus, Marburg virus, rabies and other lyssaviruses. Recently, a large number of viruses closely related to members of the genus Coronavirus have been associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and detected in bat species. In this study, samples were collected from 106 live bats of seven different bat species from 27 different locations in Slovenia. Coronaviruses were detected by RT-PCR in 14 out of 36 horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus hipposideros) fecal samples, with 38.8% virus prevalence. Sequence analysis of a 405-nucleotide region of the highly conserved RNA polymerase gene (pol) showed that all coronaviruses detected in this study are genetically closely related, with 99.5-100% nucleotide identity, and belong to group 2 of the coronaviruses. The most closely related virus sequence in GenBank was SARS bat isolate Rp3/2004 (DQ071615) within the SARS-like CoV cluster, sharing 85% nucleotide identity and 95.6% amino acid identity. The potential risk of a new group of bat coronaviruses as a reservoir for human infections is highly suspected, and further molecular epidemiologic studies of these bat coronaviruses are needed. 3aRhinolophus 3aepidemiological studies 3asequence analysis 3aEbolavirus 3aNipah henipavirus 3aMarburg marburgvirus 3afeces 3aviruses 3amolecular epidemiology 3aHendra henipavirus 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 2aAnimals 2aChiropteraxvirology 2aCluster Analysis 2aCoronavirusxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aCoronavirus Infectionsxepidemiologyxveterinaryxvirology. 2aFecesxvirology 2aGene Products, polxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPrevalence 2aRNA, Viralxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology 3aSlovenia 0aSloveniaxepidemiology. 0aNipah virus 0aHendra virus 0aMarburg virus1 aHostnik, Peter1 aSteyer, Andrej1 aGrom, Jože.1 aToplak, Ivan0 tArchives of virology.g2010 Apr., v. 155, no. 4 p.507-514dSpringer Viennax0304-86087nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-010-0612-53Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02277naa a2200517 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002100133245007800154300001600232300002400248520079800272650002501070650001101095650001001106650002801116650000901144650001801153650001601171650001601187650003901203650001101242650000901253650001601262650004001278650002201318650002601340650002401366650001601390650003201406653002401438653002101462653003201483653002601515700002201541700002501563773009601588852000901684939003301693945000801726946001301734655001201747991562836920742620221119110958.0830829e198302  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI830023392DNAL7 a68238962pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarn, Stanley M.14aThe Bony chest breadth as a frame size standard in nutritional assessment  ap. 315-318.  ap. 315-318. charts.  aExtract: As shown in 2201 males from western Scotland, the roetgenorgrammetric bony chest breadth measurements provide a useful indication of frame size. Bony chest breadth is more highly correlated with weight than is true for stature. Weight corrections approximate 3.7 kg/cm of bony chest breadth and weight differences of 12 kg separate the average weight of males in the "small," "medium," and "large" bony chest breadth categories. Virtually unrelated to fatness per se, the bony chest breadth measurement provides a useful indication of fat free mass and (expressed as the weight/bony chest breadth ratio) it provides an independent estimate of relative fatness. Differences in frame size as measured by the bony chest breadth also relate to the 16-yr cardiovascular mortality.

The present study examines both biochemical and morphological changes of the exocrine pancreas in nutritional copper deficiency. Groups of mature female rats were fed a purified diet either deficient (less than 0.5 micrograms/g) or sufficient (6.2 micrograms/g) in copper for 6 wk. Copper deficiency resulted in distinct ultrastructural changes in acinar cells, including marked variability in zymogen granule content, autophagic vacuoles and dilation of acinar lumen. Pancreatic weight and total DNA, RNA and protein content of the pancreas were similar in both groups of rats, whereas pancreatic amylase, trypsin and chymotrypsin activity was significantly lower in the copper-deficient group. In addition, secretagogue-induced release of these enzymes from dispersed acini isolated from copper-deficient rats was significantly reduced in comparison to enzyme secretion from normal controls. Pancreatic Cu-Zu and Mn superoxide dismutase activity was also found to be significantly lower in the copper-deficient rats than in normal controls. We conclude that nutritional copper deficiency in adult female rats reduces the responsiveness of the pancreas to secretagogues and may increase the susceptibility of the pancreas to oxidative damage. 3apancreas 3afemales 3acopper 3anutrient deficiencies 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aamylases 3atrypsinogen 3arats 2aAnimals 2aBody Weight 2aCopperxdeficiency 2aDNAxmetabolism 2aFemale 2aL-Lactate Dehydrogenasexmetabolism 2aOrgan Size 2aPancreasxenzymologyxpathologyxultrastructure. 2aProtease Inhibitorsxbloodxmetabolism. 2aRNAxmetabolism 2aRadioimmunoassay 2aRats 2aRats, Inbred Strains 2aSuperoxide Dismutasexmetabolism 2aTrypsinogenxmetabolism 0aanatomy and morphology1 aYu, G.S.M.1 aMajumdar, A.P.N.0 tJournal of nutrition.g1989 Aug., v. 119, no. 8 p.1165-1172x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02218naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245009500126300001400221500014900235500002400384520111300408650001001521650001201531650002301543650001401566650001201580650002901592700001301621700001301634700001301647773013801660852000901798856008501807655001201892IND4463038120221119111201.0120416s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446303812DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKishima, Y.10aDifferentiation of transposon-inducible variegation pattern in crossed lines of snapdragon  ap. 67-71.  aPaper presented at the International Symposium on Classical versus Molecular Breeding of Ornamentals, held August 25-29, 2003, Munchen, Germany.  aIncludes references  aTwo lines of snapdragon, HAM2 and HAM5, have an identical allele, nivea(recurrens:Tam3), that causes flower variegation due to excision of transposon Tam3. The Tam3 copy is inserted 64 bp upstream of the transcription start site. Despite of the same allele, HAM2 gives a light crimson in the petal background, while HAM5 shows white petals. We crossed each of the two lines with 8 lines of snapdragon carrying different genetic backgrounds. In the F2 progenies of each of the crossed lines, we selected plants that showed novel variegation patterns. After successive selfing for five generations, we produced 38 stable lines possessing novel variegation features in the petals. The characteristics of these lines were observed in the number of the spot, the spot colour, the localization of the spot and the form of the variegation. These petal phenotypes clearly differed from those of HAM2 and HAM5. The facts suggest that transposition of the element at nivea(recurrens:Tam3) are differentially controlled by the host genetic factor(s), and modification of the variegation pattern is potentially feasible. 3acolor 3acorolla 3agenetic background 3aphenotype 3aselfing 3atransposition (genetics)1 aItoh, Y.1 aNoro, Y.1 aSano, Y.0 tActa horticulturae.g2003 July, , no. 612 p.67-71dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/612/612_8.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02405naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002200134024001900156040001800175100001200193245011600205300001400321506007600335520100000411506003701411650002901448650002401477650002201501650001301523653002601536653004401562653002001606653003201626653003001658700001401688700001301702773013501715852000901850856009201859930003301951946001101984655001201995IND4431148720221207113627.0100111e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443114872DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1467-9868.2009.00725.x2doi7 aPMC29587802pmcid7 a209759302pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKai, Bo10aLocal composite quantile regression smoothing: an efficient and safe alternative to local polynomial regression  ap. 49-69.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLocal polynomial regression is a useful non-parametric regression tool to explore fine data structures and has been widely used in practice. We propose a new non-parametric regression technique called local composite quantile regression smoothing to improve local polynomial regression further. Sampling properties of the estimation procedure proposed are studied. We derive the asymptotic bias, variance and normality of the estimate proposed. The asymptotic relative efficiency of the estimate with respect to local polynomial regression is investigated. It is shown that the estimate can be much more efficient than the local polynomial regression estimate for various non-normal errors, while being almost as efficient as the local polynomial regression estimate for normal errors. Simulation is conducted to examine the performance of the estimates proposed. The simulation results are consistent with our theoretical findings. A real data example is used to illustrate the method proposed.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aprobability distribution 3aregression analysis 3asimulation models 3avariance 0aAsymptotic efficiency 0aComposite quantile regression estimator 0aKernel function 0aLocal polynomial regression 0aNon-parametric regression1 aLi, Runze1 aZou, Hui0 tJournal of the Royal Statistical Society.g2010 Jan., v. 72, no. 1 p.49-69dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1369-74127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9868.2009.00725.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100112b20100205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03206naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245006800130300001400198500014900212500002400361520191900385650001302304650002502317650001002342650001402352650001402366650002202380650001702402650001802419650002102437650001602458650001702474650001202491650001302503650002202516650001502538651001102553773013802564852000902702856008502711655001202796IND4463037920221119111228.0120416s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446303792DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchum, Annegret10aMutation breeding in ornamentals: an efficient breeding method?  ap. 47-60.  aPaper presented at the International Symposium on Classical versus Molecular Breeding of Ornamentals, held August 25-29, 2003, Munchen, Germany.  aIncludes references  aScientific interest in mutation breeding has drastically decreased during the last 15 years. Interest in research has shifted towards development and application of molecular techniques as tools in breeding and transformation of plants. Such strategies allow a more directed approach in pursuance of the breeding goal. Molecular techniques, however, generate high developmental costs and require sophisticated equipment and a highly trained staff. The investment in such expensive methods does not seem adequate in case of many ornamental species with their limited economic importance as compared to agricultural crops and their sometimes very short marketing periods in consequence of permanent demand for new fashionable products. In addition, genetically modified ornamental plants are not marketed in Europe at the time being due to low acceptance of consumers and the uncertain legal situation. On the other hand, ornamental plants appear to be ideal systems for mutation breeding as many characters of economic interest, i.e. flower traits or the growth habit are easily monitored after mutagenic treatment. Furthermore, many ornamental species are heterozygous and often propagated vegetatively thus allowing the detection, selection and conservation of mutants within the M1-generation. Appropriate strategies in mutation induction as application of fractionated doses and recurrent irradiation combined with in vitro culture techniques may lead to rapid success also in homozygous, polyploid species. Inspite of its accidental character, mutation induction continues to be an attractive method for creating genetic variability in ornamentals whenever the desired characters can be expected within the genetic scope of a given species. Practical mutation breeding nowadays has become a routine technique in many vegetatively propagated ornamental plants and is being used by commercial breeding companies. 3abreeding 3abusiness enterprises 3acrops 3aequipment 3aflowering 3agenetic variation 3agrowth habit 3agrowth traits 3ain vitro culture 3airradiation 3amutagenicity 3amutants 3amutation 3aornamental plants 3apolyploidy 3aEurope0 tActa horticulturae.g2003 July, , no. 612 p.47-60dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/612/612_6.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01984naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002900145245017100174300001400345520091300359650001901272650002701291650002401318650001201342650001001354650001401364650001701378700002601395773009901421852000901520856008501529930003301614946001101647655001201658IND4430396920221119111007.0091225e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443039692DNAL7 a10.1007/s10164-009-0151-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález-Tokman, D.

We experimentally explored the relationship between the expression of a male ornamental trait (wing pigmentation) of the damselfly Hetaerina titia and survival after a bacterial challenge. We infected males with Serratia marcescens (a Gram-negative bacteria typical of insects) and compared survival against a group infected with dead bacteria and a noninfected group. Wing pigmentation was entered as a predictor of survival in this comparison. Our study indicated that wing pigmentation was not a good predictor of immune ability against bacteria. This result contradicts previous findings in the same and other calopterygid species in which wing pigmentation intensity inversely correlated with gregarine infection levels. It also contradicts the general idea that ornaments are honest indicators of pathogen defense. 3aCalopterygidae 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aSerratia marcescens 3ainsects 3amales 3apathogens 3apigmentation1 aCórdoba-Aguilar, A. 0 tJournal of ethology.g2010 Jan., v. 28, no. 1 p.29-33dJapan : Springer Japanx0289-07717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10164-009-0151-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20091225b20100101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01504naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245007800168300001600246520062500262650001800887650001500905650001400920650002200934700001900956773010100975852000901076856008501085930003301170946001101203655001201214IND4430396320221119111033.0091225e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443039632DNAL7 a10.1007/s10164-009-0169-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMargalida, Antoni 10aCopulatory behaviour in the colonial Eurasian Griffon vulture Gyps fulvus  ap. 179-182.  aWe examined copulation patterns and associated sexual behaviour in the colonial Eurasian Griffon vulture Gyps fulvus during the pre-laying period.

Low copulation frequencies compared to other raptors and absence of mate-guarding suggest that this species does not possess adaptive behaviour aimed at increasing paternity assurance.

Ryan10aExtraterritorial Movements of a Forest Songbird in a Fragmented Landscape  ap. 729-736.  aIncludes references  aForest isolation resulting from fragmentation is thought to impede the movement of forest songbirds. Because of the difficulty of tracking birds continuously, however, few data exist documenting the influence of isolation and landscape features on avian movements. During the breeding season, male Hooded Warblers ( Wilsonia citrina ) leave their small (<2.5 ha), isolated forest patches to travel between forest fragments. We documented a total of 106 forays ( n = 20 males) and found that individuals traveled up to 2.5 km away from their resident forest patch, primarily to solicit covert extra-pair copulations. Forays occurred despite the absence of forested corridors connecting fragments; even when corridors were present, males most often chose to fly directly across open fields. Resident patch size and distance to forests visited were not correlated with the frequency of forays. The maximum distance males flew over open fields did not exceed 465 m, and longer distances likely inhibit males from traveling outside their woodlots. If territorial establishment depends on the availability of extra-pair partners, then higher degrees of isolation between forests could explain why some species avoid settling in extremely fragmented landscapes. Conservation efforts should limit isolation between forest stands, thereby preserving the ability of animals to move within fragmented landscapes during the breeding season. 3abreeding season 3aforest stands 3aforests 3ahabitat fragmentation 3amales 3asongbirds 3aterritoriality1 aStutchbury, Bridget J.M.0 tConservation biology.g2001 June, v. 15, no. 3 p.729-736dBlackwell Science Incw5389x0888-88927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1523-1739.2001.015003729.x 7aarticle02048naa a2200469 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002500133245012300158300001800281300002600299520061500325650002700940650001300967650001400980650001000994650001201004650002301016650003701039650004601076650002701122650003101149650002001180650003001200650000901230650000901239650002401248650001301272650003201285650003801317653002701355700002301382773009801405852000901503939003301512945000801545946001301553655001201566991562831190742620221119111019.0820201e198006  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI820001732DNAL7 a69925602pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStoltzner, Gordon H.10aLife-long dietary protein restriction and immune function: Responses to mitogens and sheep erythrocytes in BALB/c mice  ap. 1264-1271.  ap. 1264-1271. charts.  aProtein restriction in BALB/c male mice does not delay onset of aging patterns normally found in the immunological system.

The disregard for these traditional checks and balances especially among Christians has adversely affected their enforcement at this time. The environment and culture preservation in Awka-South were investigated. The faithful observance of the traditional laws in the study area was attributed to the fact that Awka-South area had remained occupied by the same people for centuries. The study showed that the preserved forests and their shrines in Nibo town have largely remained intact. In Nise town, however, with nine shrines still in existence, the rules have relaxed a little, mainly because they embraced modernization. In this town, the fringes of the forests may be used for farming but no felling of trees would be allowed. The "god'' of the shrine in Obunagu village was much revered until the advent of Christianity. This religion has had an eroding effect on the taboos, which were put in place to protect their forests and streams. The abandonment of traditional cultural practices is doing harm that goes beyond the abrogation of traditional cultural practices to serious threat to natural environmental structures. The cultures of the different tribes in Nigeria need to be revisited for evaluation and studies to enable their integration into modern practices that will make the environment more sustainable. This will be more productive than the unilateral introduction of programs, execution, and maintenance methods that are completely new, or in many cases run contrary to the cultural practices of the local people and tribes of Nigeria. 3aChristianity 3afarming systems 3afelling 3aforests 3alocal government 3amodernization 3apeople 3astreams 3atrees 3aNigeria1 aIsikhuemhen, O.S.1 aOchije, N.R.0 tJournal of agricultural and environmental ethics.g2003, v. 16, no. 3 p.281-296dKluwer Academic Publishersx1187-78637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A10236801177173Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02320naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245014100165300001200306520127900318653002301597653002001620653000801640700002501648700002801673700002301701700001801724773012601742852000901868856008501877930003301962946001101995655001202006IND4430412720221119111202.0091225e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443041272DNAL7 a10.1007/s10654-006-9085-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoreno, Teresa 10aAirborne particulate matter and premature deaths in urban Europe: the new WHO guidelines and the challenge ahead as illustrated by Spain  ap. 1-5.  aTwenty first century epidemiological publications on urban air pollution are confirming that inhalation of fine, airborne particulate matter (PM) has serious chronic human health effects and is a major cause of premature death worldwide. Recently updated recommendations by WHO identify three “Interim Targets” for the stepped reduction in PM levels within world cities in the quest to achieve an annual mean Air Quality Guideline (AQG) concentration of 20 μg/m³ for particles less than 10 microns in size (PM₁₀). In this paper we offer a perspective from Spain, a country with the longest record of reporting pollution data from large numbers of urban traffic sites to a central European database (AIRBASE). We can demonstrate that average annual PM concentrations at urban traffic monitoring stations in many European cities continue to be 50-100% above the WHO AQG, a situation exacerbated by high urban PM₂.₅/₁₀ ratios which indicate a dominance of finer, more deeply inhalable particles potentially more detrimental to health. Given that WHO has estimated in 2000 there were well over 250,000 premature deaths in Europe attributable to PM inhalation, such continuing high urban pollution levels are placing a huge burden on European medical resources. 0aParticulate Matter 0aUrban pollution 0aWHO1 aQuerol, X.q(Xavier)1 aAlastuey, A.q(Andrés)1 aBallester, Ferran.1 aGibbons, Wes 0 tEuropean journal of epidemiology.g2007 Jan., v. 22, no. 1 p.1-5dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0393-29907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10654-006-9085-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091225b20100101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02760naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002400110245008600134300001600220500002400236520153400260650002001794650002701814650001801841650002501859650001001884650001501894650001101909650001001920650001501930650001301945650001301958650002801971650000901999650002002008650001502028650002202043650001602065700001902081773012902100852000902229856010002238655001202338IND4465861220221119111031.0130411s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446586122DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMyhr, Anne Ingeborg10aGenetically Modified (GM) Crops: Precautionary Science and Conflicts of Interests  ap. 227-247.  aIncludes references  aRisk governance of GM plants and GM food products is presently subject to heated scientific and public controversies. Scientists and representatives of the biotechnology industry have dominated debates concerning safety issues. The public is suspicious with regard to the motives of scientists, companies, and political institutions involved. The dilemmas posed are nested, embracing value questions, scientific uncertainty, and contextual issues. The obvious lack of data and insufficient information concerning ecological effects call for application of the Precautionary Principle (PP). There are, however, divergent opinions among scientists about the relevance of putative hazards, definition of potential ``adverse effects,'' and whether actions should be taken to prevent harm. The reliance on the concept of substantial equivalence in safety evaluation of GM food is equally controversial. Consequently, value assumptions embedded in a scientific framework may be a barrier for employment ofthe PP. One of our major conclusions is that precautionary GMP usage requires risk assessment criteria yet undeveloped, as well as broader and more long-term conceptions of risk, uncertainty, and ignorance. Conflicts of interest and public participation are other issues that need to be taken into consideration. GMP governance regimes that are justifiable from a precautionary and ethical point of view must transcend traditional scientific boundaries to include alternative scientific perspectives as well as public involvement. 3aadverse effects 3aattitudes and opinions 3abiotechnology 3abusiness enterprises 3acrops 3aemployment 3aethics 3afoods 3agovernance 3aindustry 3apolitics 3aprecautionary principle 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3ascientists 3atransgenic plants 3auncertainty1 aTraavik, Terje0 tJournal of agricultural and environmental ethics.g2003, v. 16, no. 3 p.227-247dKluwer Academic Publishersx1187-78637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A10236869008793Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01901naa a2200493 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001600133245005900149300001800208300003200226500001500258520054700273650002200820650001300842650001600855650001900871650001600890650001600906650001600922650002600938650000900964650001800973650002200991650002101013650001101034650001601045650003601061650002901097650002101126650002201147650001901169653001601188653003001204773009801234852000901332939003301341945000801374946001301382655001201395991562828730742620221119111058.0820201e198006  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI820001782DNAL7 a73864172pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWebb, Paul.14aThe measurement of energy exchange in man: An analysis  ap. 1299-1310.  ap. 1299-1310. ill., charts.  a2019-12-05  aEntropy exchange in man as an open thermodynamic system should be included in equations of energy balance.

Methods: A total of 12,681 white and African-American participants provided information on SES (via education and social class) and place of residence in childhood and adulthood. Residences were linked to census data for neighborhood SES information. Multiple imputation was used to impute missing data. Hierarchical and linear regression were used to estimate the effects of SES and possible mediation by adult cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Findings: Low childhood social class and education were associated with elevated levels of CRP, fibrinogen, WBC, and vWF (increments of 17%, 2%, 4% and 3% for lowest versus highest education in childhood, respectively) among whites. Findings were less consistent among African-Americans. Adult SES was more strongly associated with inflammation than childhood SES. Individual-level SES measures were more consistently associated with inflammation than neighborhood-level measures. Fibrinogen and WBC showed the most consistent associations with SES; the largest changes in inflammation by SES were observed for CRP. Covariate adjustment strongly attenuated these associations. Mediation of the SES-inflammation associations by BMI, smoking and HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) are suggested by these data. Conclusion: Low individual- and neighborhood-level SES in childhood and adulthood are associated with modest increments in adult inflammatory burden. These associations may operate through the influence of low SES on traditional CVD risk factors, especially BMI, smoking and HDL-C. 3ainflammation 3asocioeconomic status 2aBlack or African Americanxstatistics & numerical data. 2aBiomarkersxblood. 2aC-Reactive Proteinxanalysis 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxdiagnosis 2aChild 2aEducational Status 2aWhite Peoplexstatistics & numerical data. 2aFemale 2aFibrinogenxanalysis 2aHumans 2aInflammationxbloodxdiagnosisxethnology. 2aLeukocyte Count 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aProspective Studies 2aResidence Characteristicsxstatistics & numerical data 2aRisk 2aSocial Class 2avon Willebrand Factorxanalysis 0aChildhood 0aCRP 0aLife-course 0aSES1 aKaufman, Jay S. 1 aRose, Kathryn M. 1 aDiez-Roux, Ana V. 1 aZeng, Donglin 1 aHeiss, Gerardo 0 tEuropean journal of epidemiology.g2007 Jan., v. 22, no. 1 p.55-66dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0393-29907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10654-006-9082-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20091225b20100101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03399naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245009100132300001400223500014900237500002400386520182000410650001702230650001802247650001402265650001102279650001602290650000902306650001902315650002202334650001602356650001302372650001802385650001402403650001102417650001502428650001902443650001702462650001202479650002602491650003202517650001802549650001202567650002202579650001902601650001102620700001802631773013802649852000902787856008502796655001202881IND4463037420221119110659.0120416s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446303742DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTuyl, Jaap M. van10aInterspecific hybridisation and polyploidisation as tools in ornamental plant breeding  ap. 13-22.  aPaper presented at the International Symposium on Classical versus Molecular Breeding of Ornamentals, held August 25-29, 2003, Munchen, Germany.  aIncludes references  aInterspecific hybridisation and polyploidy are recognized as the most important sources of evolution and domestication of flowering plants. In ornamental plant breeding these phenomena go hand in hand and can be observed in the breeding history of many ornamental crops (Rosa, Chrysanthemum, Gladiolus, Alstroemeria, Lilium, orchids etc). With lily as model crop techniques developed for overcoming pre- and post-fertilisation barriers are reviewed. For overcoming F1-sterility mitotic and meiotic polyploidisation are applied and can result in fertile allopolyploids. The mechanism of viable pollen production of mitotic and meiotic polyploidisation is quite different. Mitotic polyploidisation possess one homologous chromosome set. They undergo normal meiotic division like diploid cells. However, meiotic polyploidisation often show irregular chromosome division resulting in two of unreduced chromosome number instead of reduced chromosome number in tetrads. In contrast to mitotic doubling homoeologous recombination can occur. There are two significant mechanisms, FDR and SDR, for the formation of 2n-gametes. The FDR-gamete increase heterozygosity while SDR-gamete increase homozygosity. Genomic in situ hybridisation (GISH) has been used to discriminate parental chromosomes and to detect homoeologous recombination. Mitotic polyploidisation showed no homoeologous recombinations between the parental genomes whereas in meiotic polyploids it can detected frequently. The use of 2n-gametes is therefore the most promising way for the introgression of desirable characters in the breeding with interspecific hybrids. Although spontaneous occurring in the domestication of many ornamental crops the systematically detected unreduced gametes proved to be highly efficient tool for introgression of characters. 3aAlstroemeria 3aChrysanthemum 3aGladiolus 3aLilium 3aOrchidaceae 3aRosa 3aallopolyploidy 3achromosome number 3achromosomes 3adiploidy 3adomestication 3aevolution 3agenome 3agerm cells 3aheterozygosity 3ahomozygosity 3ahybrids 3ain situ hybridization 3ainterspecific hybridization 3aintrogression 3ameiosis 3aornamental plants 3aplant breeding 3apollen1 aLim, Ki-Byung0 tActa horticulturae.g2003 July, , no. 612 p.13-22dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/612/612_1.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02405naa a2200517 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002000133245012400153300001400277300002200291520093800313650001001251650002301261650001301284650001301297650000901310650001401319650001801333650002001351650001001371650002401381650002301405650004301428650002101471650001001492650001101502650002601513650000901539650001601548650002501564650005101589650001601640650001501656650002101671700002601692773009401718852000901812939003301821945000801854946001301862655001201875991562824120742620221119111028.0831020e198307  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI830029712DNAL7 a63051852pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKelsay, June L.10aMineral balances of human subjects consuming spinach in a low-fiber diet and in a diet containing fruits and vegetables  ap. 12-19.  ap. 12-19. charts.  aExtract: The effects of spinach in the diet on mineral balances were examined in 12 men who consumed 3 controlled diets for 4 weeks each.

The nutrients for which dietary intakes were most apt to fall below 100% of the 1980 Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) were: calcium, in both sexes, energy, in males; and iron, thiamin, riboflavin, and niacin in females. With the exception of calcium, few subjects had intakes below 2/3rds of the RDAs. These findings are similar to those reported in previous dietary surveys of the elderly. Vitamin and mineral supplements were consumed by 72% of the subjects; such consumption was unrelated to dietary intake. Supplemental vitamin C was consumed by 67% of the subjects, in amounts ranging from 30 to 5200 mg daily; supplemental vitamin E was taken by 51%, with amounts ranging from 8 to 1000 IU daily. Supplement use by this population is 1 of the highest reported among the elderly, an effect that may result from the affluence of the community, its geographic location, and from a high level of nutritional consciousness among its residents.

The first step was to determine where and how frequently cheeses are purchased and consumed, along with different aspects relating to the recognition of cheeses certified by a denomination of origin (DO). The second step consisted in determining how consumer preferences are structured. Design/methodology/approach - The methodology consisted of a survey of 412 consumers in the Castilla-La Mancha Region who were buying food items for their homes. In order to process data related to the first step, a descriptive analysis was undertaken. For the second step, a conjoint analysis was carried out, with three types of attributes (price, certification and type). Findings - The results show that cheese is a food which is present and also consumed within Spanish homes, while being bought in supermarkets at least once a week. Consumers value most the DO labels as a guarantee of quality and food safety. The cheese that is best known to consumers is the Manchego DO. Consumers prefer cheeses which are well-priced, aged and, if possible, certified. Originality/value - This paper analyses current consumer behaviour and, by means of conjoint analysis, identifies consumer preferences for cheeses in Spain. Internationally, conjoint analysis has rarely been used for cheeses, and this would appear to be the first time it has been applied in Spain. 3acase studies 3acertification 3acheeses 3aconsumer preferences 3afood purchasing 3afood quality 3afood safety 3aprices 3asupermarkets 3asurveys 3aSpain1 aBernabéu, Rodolfo0 tBritish food journal.g2005, v. 107, no. 2 p.60-73x0007-070X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1108/000707005105791443Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01781naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002400184245006000208300002000268506007600288520064100364506003701005650002401042650001501066650002301081650001201104700002201116700002401138773017601162852000901338856008301347946001301430655001201443IND4443597020221207095428.0101015e20101012xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444359702DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10115111072doi7 aPMC29551372pmcid7 a208761352pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTribello, Gareth A.12aA self-learning algorithm for biased molecular dynamics  ap. 17509-17514.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA new self-learning algorithm for accelerated dynamics, reconnaissance metadynamics, is proposed that is able to work with a very large number of collective coordinates. Acceleration of the dynamics is achieved by constructing a bias potential in terms of a patchwork of one-dimensional, locally valid collective coordinates. These collective coordinates are obtained from trajectory analyses so that they adapt to any new features encountered during the simulation. We show how this methodology can be used to enhance sampling in real chemical systems citing examples both from the physics of clusters and from the biological sciences.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBiological Sciences 3aalgorithms 3amolecular dynamics 3aphysics1 aCeriotti, Michele1 aParrinello, Michele0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Oct. 12, v. 107, no. 41 p.17509-17514dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10115111073Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02819naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245014300124300001400267500002400281520169200305650000901997650001202006650001902018650001302037650001502050650002702065650001402092650003502106650001302141700001902154700001202173700002502185700001402210700002102224773010402245852000902349856008702358655001202445IND4465860320130411000000.0130411s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446586032DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, J.14aThe diploid origins of allopolyploid rose species studied using single nucleotide polymorphism haplotypes flanking a microsatellite repeat  ap. 85-92.  aIncludes references  aThe taxonomy of the genus Rosa is complex, not least because of hybridisations between species.We aimed to develop a method to connect the diploid Rosa taxa to the allopolyploid taxa to which they contributed, based on the sharing of haplotypes. For this we used an SNPSTR marker, which combines a short tandem repeat (STR; microsatellite) marker with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the flanking sequences. In total, 53 different sequences (haplotypes) were obtained for the SNPSTR marker, Rc06, from 20 diploid and 35 polyploid accessions from various species of Rosa. Most accessions of the diploid species had only one allele, while accessions of the polyploid species each contained two-to-five different alleles. Twelve SNPs were detected in the flanking sequences, which alone formed a total of 18 different haplotypes. A maximum likelihood dendrogram revealed five groups of haplotypes. Diploid species in the same Section of the genus Rosa contained SNP haplotypes from only one haplotype group. In contrast, polyploid species contained haplotypes from different haplotype groups. Identical SNP haplotypes were shared between polyploid species and diploid species from more than one Section of the genus Rosa. There were three different polymorphic repeat regions in the STR region. The STR repeat contained eight additional SNPs, but these contributed little to the resolution of the haplotype groups. Our results support hypotheses on diploid Rosa species that contributed to polyploid taxa. Finding different sets of haplotypes in different groups of species within the Sections Synstylae and Pimpinellifoliae supports the hypothesis that these may be paraphyletic. 3aRosa 3aalleles 3aallopolyploidy 3adiploidy 3ahaplotypes 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aparaphyly 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3ataxonomy1 aEsselink, G.D.1 aChe, D.1 aFougére-Danezan, M.1 aArens, P.1 aSmulders, M.J.M.0 tJournal of horticultural science & biotechnology.g2013 Jan., v. 88, no. 1 p.85-92x1462-03167nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.jhortscib.org/Vol88/88_1/index.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01946naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245007900123300001600202500011800218500002400336520074100360650001401101650001401115650001401129650001401143650001301157650003201170650001301202650001201215650002401227651001001251700001401261700002501275700001401300700001101314773014001325852000901465856008601474655001201560IND4463033320221119110807.0120416s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446303332DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, S.10aConservation and utilization of germplasm resources of the genus Actinidia  ap. 365-371.  aPaper presented at the Fifth International Symposium on Kiwifruit, held September 15-20, 2002, Wuhan, P.R.

Pots containing different proportions (0 to 100%) of composted biosolids were used to grow lettuce plants under greenhouse conditions, Dry and fresh weight, leaf area and Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn uptake were determined after harvest. It was found that the dry and fresh matter productions of the plants were significantly lower in the control treatment. The addition of composted biosolids caused a 20 and 40% increase in biomass accumulation, Cd and Pb concentrations in leaves were below detection limits (0.05 mg kg-I) in all treatments. Zn concentration in leaves increases as compost proportion decreases, ranging from 57.2 to 80.4 mg kg-1. Composted biosolids application increased the Cu and Ni plant concentrations, ranging from 5.1 to 9,8 mg Cu kg-1 and 2.3 to 3.7 mg Ni kg-1. In all treatments the proportions of heavy metals in plants were below the international standards of toxicity. The results allow us to suggest that, in short-term applications, composted biosolids could be used as soil amendment for lettuce production, without toxic effects in the chemical composition of the plant. 3abiomass production 3abiosolids 3acadmium 3achemical composition 3acomposts 3acopper 3acrop production 3adetection limit 3agreenhouses 3aheavy metals 3alead 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3alettuce 3anickel 3asoil amendments 3atoxicity 3azinc1 aLavado, Raul S.0 tCompost science & utilization.g2002 Autumn, v. 10, no. 4 p.363-3677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1065657X.2002.107020993Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02752naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100001500150245005100165300001600216500002400232520167500256650001201931650001501943650001801958650001101976650001801987650001502005650001302020650002102033650001702054650001002071650000702081650001302088650001602101650001802117700001502135700001502150773007802165852000902243856009002252655001202342IND4465859620221119110705.0130410s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446585962DNAL7 a10.1080/1065657X.2002.107020982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, K.J.10aControl of composting odor using biofiltration  ap. 356-362.  aIncludes references  aWhile composting transforms manure wastes into useful fertilizer, it also produces odors during the decomposition process. Biofiltration is a desirable method to control composting odor. This study was conducted to investigate the efficiency of using compost as a biofilter. A mixture of cattle manure and fresh compost was composted in a bin equipped with a suction-type blower. The exhaust gas was filtered through the biofilter of fresh compost. The composting temperature affected the ammonia emission. When the composting temperature was relatively high, the highest ammonia emission appeared in two experiments. The biofiltering properties were investigated according to flow rates and filter depths for two different types of fresh composts (experiment I and II). At the flow rate of 30 Limin, ammonia removal rate was 80.5% for biofilter A(detention time 56.5 s) and 99.9% for biofilter B (detention time 113 s). At the flow rate of 50 L/min, the ammonia removal rate was 82.5% for biofilter A (detention time 33.9 s) and 97.4% for biofilter B (detention time 67.8). The fresh compost could be used as a biofilter medium for odor control during composting process. The moisture content(MC) of the biofilter material increased by absorbing moisture from the exhaust gas, while the pH was decreased due to the degradation of nitrogenous compounds. As the moisture in the exhaust gas increased the MC of the biofilter, there was no need to spray water to the biofilter medium to control moisture content. While the total nitrogen(T-N) of the biofilter increased by absorbing ammonia, the total carbon (T-C) remained unchanged resulting in decrease of the C/N ratio. 3aammonia 3abiofilters 3abiofiltration 3acarbon 3acattle manure 3acomposting 3acomposts 3anitrogen content 3aodor control 3aodors 3apH 3aspraying 3atemperature 3awater content1 aChoi, M.H.1 aHong, J.H.0 tCompost science & utilization.g2002 Autumn, v. 10, no. 4 p.356-3627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1065657X.2002.107020983Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02467naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001400152245011600166300001800282520137300300650002101673650002001694653003101714653002201745700001401767700001901781700001601800700001201816700001701828700002001845773010701865852000901972856009201981930003302073946001102106655001202117IND4426983420221119110635.0091011e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442698342DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1398-9995.2009.02060.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFaith, A.10aCounter regulation of the high affinity IgE receptor, FcεRI, on human airway dendritic cells by IL-4 and IL-10  ap. 1602-1607.  aImmunoglobulin E is a signalling molecule within the environment of the respiratory tract, the high affinity receptor for which, FcεRI, is expressed by dendritic cells (DC). Little is known, however, of the expression and function of FcεRI on DC in the human respiratory tract. CD1c⁺ DC were purified from surgically resected nasal turbinates of 11 atopic and 12 nonatopic patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. Expression of FcεRI was determined by flow cytometry. Cytokine production by DC was determined by cytometric bead array. Expression of FcεRI was significantly elevated on respiratory tract dendritic cells (RTDC) from atopic as compared to nonatopic patients. Activation of RTDC through FcεRI induced production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α, and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. The production of IL-6 and TNF-α was elevated in atopic compared to nonatopic patients studied. Conversely IL-10 production was elevated in nonatopic patients. Concomitant activation of FcεRI and stimulation of RTDC with IL-4 inhibited production of IL-10 by RTDC. Neutralization experiments with anti-IL-10 Ab enhanced whereas addition of exogenous IL-10 to RTDC inhibited FcεRI-mediated inflammatory cytokine production. The function of FcεRI on RTDC from patients with rhinosinusitis is susceptible to counter regulation by IL-4 and IL-10. 3ahypersensitivity 3adendritic cells 0ahigh affinity IgE receptor 0arespiratory tract1 aSingh, N.1 aChevretton, E.1 aRoberts, D.1 aLee, T.1 aCorrigan, C.1 aHawrylowicz, C.0 tAllergy.g2009 Nov., v. 64, no. 11 p.1602-1607dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0105-45387nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1398-9995.2009.02060.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091012b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01934naa a2200433 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001500133245007600148300001600224520055900240650002200799650002600821650001100847650001000858650003500868650001200903650002300915650006200938650000901000650002501009650000901034650002701043650005201070653001001122653002501132653002401157700001701181700001301198773021601211852000901427939003301436945000801469946001101477655001201488991562819080742620221119110731.0840724e198109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR840045342DNAL7 a71978612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWerner, H.10aLatent Toxoplasma-infection as a possible risk factor for CNS-disorders  ap. 368-375.  aToxoplasma gondii, latent infection in mice (brain), metabolic products (exoantigens) of encysted parasite were found by immunofluorescence in direct vicinity of cysts particularly in perivascular region of blood vessels, resulting inflammatory granulomatous changes of perivascular areas which can later lead to obstruction and sclerosis of vessels, histopathological central nervous system (CNS) changes were identical to those described in humans, discussion of lattent Toxoplasma-infection as possible risk factor for CNS disorders in early childhood 3aToxoplasma gondii 3acardiovascular system 3atoxins 3abrain 3afluorescent antibody technique 2aAnimals 2aAntigensxanalysis 2aBrainxblood supplyximmunologyxparasitologyxpathology. 2aMice 2aNeurogliaxpathology 2aRats 2aToxoplasmaximmunology 2aToxoplasmosis, Animalxparasitologyxpathology. 0acysts 0aNervous system, Host 0aPathology, Protozoa1 aMasihi, K.N.1 aSenk, U.0 tZentralblatt fur Bakteriologie, Mikrobiologie und Hygiene : 1.

Legume seeds are classified as being physically dormant (Baskin and Baskin, 1998). Most temperate woody legumes display only physical dormancy, but eastern redbud also has a physiological dormancy that requires chilling stratification for germination (Geneve, 1991). Alleviation of physical dormancy in tree seeds usually involves scarification to mechanically abrade the seed coverings or more commonly seeds are treated with concentrated sulfuric acid to scarify the seed surface (Hartmann et al., 2011). Alternatively, redbud seeds respond to hot water treatments to relieve physical dormancy (Geneve, 2009). Young and Young (1992) in the Seeds of Woody Plants in North America recommend treating redbud seeds in boiling water (100Â°C) for 60s. They also indicate that seeds have been placed in 82Â°C water and allowed to cool overnight, but do not indicate how effective the treatment was for alleviating physical dormancy. Hot water treatment would be preferable for scarification of large quantities of seeds because it avoids safety and disposal issues associated with sulfuric acid scarification. However, it is not known if heat treating redbud seeds to relieve physical dormancy impacts subsequent release from physiological dormancy during chilling stratification or seedling vigor during germination. The major objective of the current study were to compare the effects of physical, hot water, and acid scarifications on seed germination and embryo growth in eastern redbud prior to and after chilling stratification. 3aboiling 3aseed germination 3atesta 3avigor 3alandscapes 3aseedlings 3asulfuric acid 3aheat 3atrees 3awoody plants 3acold treatment 3alegumes 3adormancy 3ahot water treatment 3aseed scarification 3aCercis canadensis var. canadensis 3aNorth America 0aseeds1 aHolton, Sarah1 aGeneve, Robert L.1 aCalyskan, Servet0 tActa horticulturae.g2014 Oct. 30, , no. 1055 p.347-349dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/1055/1055_72.htm  aDNAL 7aarticle02823naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100001700150245010700167300001600274500002400290520165700314650001301971650002301984650000802007650001302015650001202028650001202040650001902052650001502071650001402086650001802100650001102118650001502129650001202144650002002156650001602176700001502192700001702207773007802224852000902302856009002311655001202401IND4465858720221119110726.0130410s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446585872DNAL7 a10.1080/1065657X.2002.107020742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElwell, D.L.10aCompensating hog manure/sawdust mixtures using intermittent and continuous aeration: ammonia emissions  ap. 142-149.  aIncludes references  aOdorous emissions from manures have become a significant problem. Preliminary work on composting hog manure with sawdust had indicated that intermittent aeration could reduce ammonia emissions during this process. This paper presents results from four additional runs with a total of 22 pilot-scale vessels that have confirmed that ammonia emissions are affected by aeration. The pilot-scale vessels consisted of insulated, stainless steel, 205 L drums that either received continuous (high/low rate, thermostatically controlled blowers) or intermittent (5 min on high rate, 55 min off) aeration. Ammonia emissions, air flow rates, carbon dioxide production, oxygen utilization, and temperatures at four locations in each vessel were monitored. Ammonia emissions under intermittent aeration were roughly 50% less than those from the continuously aerated vessels. However, this appeared to result more from total air flow than from the aeration technique used. A linear regression of emissions versus total air flow data for all vessels yielded a fit of y = 0.1309x + 29.385 (y being total ammonia emitted [in g of N] and x being total air flow [in kg]) with an R2 = 0.6808. Since air flow termination was relatively arbitrary, this only means basically, that ammonia emissions were doubled for a quadrupling of air flow. Under intermittent aeration, the minimum oxygen level in the exhaust air occasionally dropped to as low as 1 %. So the aeration pattern used probably represents the lowest one suitable for maintaining aerobic conditions. Within this constraint, however, lower air flow appears to be suitable for reducing odorous ammonia emissions. 3aaeration 3aaerobic conditions 3aair 3aair flow 3aammonia 3ablowers 3acarbon dioxide 3acomposting 3aemissions 3alinear models 3aoxygen 3apig manure 3asawdust 3astainless steel 3atemperature1 aHong, J.H.1 aKeener, H.M.0 tCompost science & utilization.g2002 Spring, v. 10, no. 2 p.142-1497nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1065657X.2002.107020743Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02232naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119072000900128100001800137245006600155300001600221500002400237520084300261650002201104650002401126650002301150650001201173650003701185650000801222650002001230650002301250650001401273650001201287650002001299650001901319650002301338651001901361653003301380700002101413700001901434700001801453700001801471773008901489852000901578856006801587930003301655945002501688946001301713655001201726IND4434111220221119110606.0100318s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443411122DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aX100 0aE5001 aKeelan, Conor10aPredicted Willingness of Irish Farmers to Adopt GM Technology  ap. 394-403.  aIncludes references  aIn this article, we use a probit model to assess the factors that will influence the decision of Irish farmers to adopt genetically modified (GM) technology should they be given a choice in the near future of selecting between GM and non-GM varieties of crops. The results from the probit model indicate that among the likely early adopters of GM technology in Ireland are farmers with large farm acreage who are specialist crop farmers and who have formal agricultural education together with access to high-quality soils. Contrary to expectations and theory, the farmer’s age was insignificant in the final specification of the model. Neither tenure nor profitability had any influence in determining the likelihood of adoption once farm size was accounted for, indicating that farm size may dominate other farm-level characteristics. 3atransgenic plants 3ainnovation adoption 3afarmers' attitudes 3afarmers 3asociodemographic characteristics 3aage 3aprobit analysis 3astatistical models 3aequations 3asurveys 3acrop production 3aland ownership 3aeducational status 3aIrish Republic 0aTeagasc National Farm Survey1 aThorne, Fiona S.1 aFlanagan, Paul1 aNewman, Carol1 aMullins, Ewen0 tAgbioforum.g2009, v. 12, no. 3-4 p.394-403dUniversity of Missourix1522-936X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.agbioforum.org/3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100414b20100501c00000000  aINDdLYNe2010/04/14  aOther US 7aarticle01104naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001400115245008400129300001600213500001500229520009500244650003100339650001300370653002500383653001800408653003900426700001500465700001500480700001500495773020700510852000900717939003300726945000800759946001100767655001200778991562816850742620221119110526.0830610e198108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830058122DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorii, T.14aThe fine structure of the merozoites and gametocytes of Leucocytozoon caulleryi  ap. 198-205.  a2019-12-05  aLeucocytozoon caulleryi, fine structure of merozoites and gametocytes, electron microscopy 3aanimal parasites and pests 3aProtozoa 0aMorphology, Protozoa 0aanimal health 0aLeucocytozoon caulleryi (Protozoa)1 aMatsui, T.1 aIijima, T.1 aFukuda, M.0 tZentralblatt fur Bakteriologie Mikrobiologie und Hygiene. 1.

After iron plaque on rice roots was induced in solutions containing 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 mg Fe2+ I-1, seedlings were transplanted into nutrient solution with 0.5 mg As I-1. The formation of iron plaque was clearly visible as a reddish coating on the root surface after 12 h induction. Fe2+ concentrations in the pretreatment solution and 0.5 mg As I-1 in the treatment solutions did not significantly affect rice growth. There was a significant correlation between the concentrations of Fe and As in iron plaque on the root surface for the three genotypes. About 75-89% of total As was concentrated in iron plaque (DCB-extracts). There were no significant differences in As concentrations in the roots between the three genotypes; however, As concentrations in shoots differed significantly between them. Arsenic concentrations in shoots were positively correlated with iron concentrations in the shoots. The results suggest that iron plaque may act as a 'buffer' for As in the rhizosphere. 3aOryza sativa 3arice 3aseedlings 3agenotype 3aarsenates 3anutrient solutions 3asoilless culture 3atranslocation (plant physiology) 3airon 3aroots 3ashoots 3aarsenic 3auptake mechanisms 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aArsenatesxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aBiological Transport 2aGenotype 2aIronxanalysisxpharmacology. 2aOryzaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Rootsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aPlant Shootsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aSeedlingsxchemistryxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 0airon plaque1 aZhu, Y.G.1 aSmith, F.A.1 aSmith, S.

But how can disease persistence be explained? We developed a spatially-explicit individual-based model that takes into account both ecological and viral traits as well as variable space to test disease persistence hypotheses under debate. We introduce a novel concept of modeling alternative disease courses at the individual level, causing transient infections or killing infected animals, with the lethally infected having a variable life-expectancy. We systematically distinguish between disease invasion and persistence. We use classical swine fever (CSF), an economically very important livestock disease in a social host, the wild boar, as a reference system to test and rank the persistence hypotheses under debate. Parameter values for host population demographics and CSF epidemiology reflect current knowledge. Sensitivity analysis of the model parameters revealed that the most important factor for disease persistence is a disease profile with mostly transient, i.e. surviving individuals requiring immunity, and some chronically, long-term infected animals. Immune individuals can constantly produce susceptible offspring, while some chronically infected individuals act as 'super spreaders' in time. Thus, variations in the course of the disease at the individual level are important factors determining persistence, which is usually not taken into account in the prominent measure of epidemiology, i.e. the basic reproductive number R₀, which reflects the 'reproductive potential' of the infected sub-population. We discuss our results with regard to the general issues of modeling epidemics and disease management issues. 3ademographic statistics 3adisease control 3adisease course 3adisease models 3adisease reservoirs 3ahog cholera 3ahosts 3aimmunity 3alivestock 3aprogeny 3apublic health 3awild boars 3awildlife diseases1 aFernández, Néstor1 aEisinger, Dirk1 aGrimm, Volker1 aThulke, Hans-Hermann0 tOikos.g2009 Feb., v. 118, no. 2 p.199-208dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0030-12997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0706.2008.16582.x 7aarticle02206naa a2200553 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001400133245004000147300001600187520047600203650002200679650001200701650002600713650005800739650001400797650004500811650003600856650001500892650003000907650004700937650001100984650001100995650002001006650003001026650002801056650000901084650000901093650002501102650003201127650003101159650000901190650002501199650003101224650003601255653002601291700001501317700001701332700001501349773021501364852000901579939003301588945000801621946001101629655001201640991562814610742620221119110806.0840605e198403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR840034272DNAL7 a63287952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOsaki, H.10aAntimicrobial activity of Obioactin  ap. 328-334.  aactivity of an enzyme-hydrolyzed toxoplasma-hyperimmune bovine serum preparation (Obioactin) against heterologous protozoa, bacteria, and viruses both in vivo and in vitro; results in part show appreciable efficacy of Obioactin in combination with nifurtimox (Lampit) against experimental Trypanosoma cruzi infections in mice, but prophylactic applications of agent alone or with nifurtimox were in vain in mice; role of Obioactin as immune activator remains to be solved 3aTrypanosoma cruzi 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agents 2aAnti-Infective Agentsxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aCell Line 2aChagas Diseasexdrug therapyxmortality. 2aChikungunya virusxdrug effects 2aCricetinae 2aDrug Therapy, Combination 2aEncephalitis Virus, Japanesexdrug effects 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aImmunoglobulins 2aListeriosisxdrug therapy 2aMacrophagesximmunology 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred Strains 2aNifurtimoxxtherapeutic use 2aPhagocytosisxdrug effects 2aRats 2aRats, Inbred Strains 2aSimplexvirusxdrug effects 2aVirus Replicationxdrug effects 0aTreatment and control1 aFuruya, M.1 aNagasawa, H.1 aSuzuki, N.0 tZentralblatt fur Bakteriologie, Mikrobiologie und Hygiene : 1.

Two experiments utilizing the two-alternative forced-choice (2-AFC) procedure generated 6-point psychometric functions plotting percentage correct as a function of sucrose concentration. In both experiments, the judges were divided into two groups and tested in either purpose-built sensory booths or on open tables situated in a laboratory. In the first experiment, the influence of a confounding variable was apparent, with nonmonotonic psychometric functions being obtained. In experiment II, the confounding variable was eliminated, permitting the estimation of absolute thresholds. In both experiments, there was no main effect of gender or session, though there was an effect of testing locality (P < 0.05). Data are reported to emphasize the importance of controlling extraneous variables and to demonstrate the robustness of the 2-AFC procedure. This research contributes to an otherwise impoverished database on the detection of sucrose in a solution. The uses of the research include estimates of sucrose detection thresholds for comparative purposes; confirmation of the stability of the two-alternative forced-choice procedure; the utility of using formal testing areas as opposed to ad hoc testing stations; and the dangers of utilizing substandard experimental equipment while conducting research of this nature. 3aaqueous solutions 3adatabases 3adetection limit 3agender 3aresearch equipment 3asucrose1 aQuek, Siew Young1 aPathirana, Sreeni0 tJournal of sensory studies.g2008 Oct., v. 23, no. 5 p.600-613dBlackwell Publishing Incx0887-82507nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-459X.2008.00175.x 7aarticle02734naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245013300168300001600301520121300317650001601530650001901546650001701565650001101582650002601593650001101619650000701630650000901637650001601646650001701662653003101679653002601710653000901736653002001745653003201765653000701797700002001804700002301824700002201847700002301869700003801892700002301930700002001953773011701973852000902090856008502099930003302184946001102217655001202228IND4398518020221119110747.0071209e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439851802DNAL7 a10.1007/s11120-007-9216-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLambrev, Petar H. 10aTrapping of the quenched conformation associated with non-photochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence at low temperature  ap. 321-332.  aThe kinetics of non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) of chlorophyll fluorescence was studied in pea leaves at different temperatures between 5 and 25°C and during rapid jumps of the leaf temperature. At 5°C, NPQ relaxed very slowly in the dark and was sustained for up to 30 min. This was independent of the temperature at which quenching was induced. Upon raising the temperature to 25°C, the quenched state relaxed within 1 min, characteristic for qE, the energy-dependent component of NPQ. Measurements of the membrane permeability (ΔA₅₁₅) in dark-adapted and preilluminated leaves and NPQ in the presence of dithiothreitol strongly suggest that the effect of low temperature on NPQ was not because of limitation by the lumenal pH or the de-epoxidation state of the xanthophylls. These data are consistent with the notion that the transition from the quenched to the unquenched state and vice versa involves a structural reorganization in the photosynthetic apparatus. An eight-state reaction scheme for NPQ is proposed, extending the model of Horton and co-workers (FEBS Lett 579:4201-4206, 2005), and a hypothesis is put forward concerning the nature of conformational changes associated with qE. 3achlorophyll 3adithiothreitol 3afluorescence 3aleaves 3amembrane permeability 3amodels 3apH 3apeas 3atemperature 3axanthophylls 0aChlorophyll a fluorescence 0aConformational change 0aΔpH 0aLow temperature 0aNon-photochemical quenching 0aqE1 aTsonev, Tsonko 1 aVelikova, Violeta 1 aGeorgieva, Katya 1 aLambreva, Maya D. 1 aĬordanov, Ivanq(Ivan Ĭordanov)1 aKovács, László.1 aGarab, Győző 0 tPhotosynthesis research.g2007 Nov., v. 94, no. 2-3 p.321-332dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0166-85957nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11120-007-9216-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20071209b20080102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02430naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245006000166300001600226500002400242500001500266520151600281650002501797650001301822650002201835650002101857650001601878650001201894651001901906653001101925773007401936852000902010856008502019655001202104IND4465863820221119110743.0130412s2005    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446586382DNAL7 a10.1108/000707005105864892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWorsfold, Denise10aProtecting consumers: A review of hygiene award schemes  ap. 162-172.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aPurpose - Hygiene award schemes are intended to promote excellent food safety standards. They should encourage food premises to raise standards and provide consumers with more information. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) is considering a national hygiene award scheme as part of its strategy to improve food safety management in food businesses throughout the UK. This paper seeks to review four hygiene award schemes that are currently operating in the UK. Design/methodology/approach - The schemes were assessed using the preferred components for a national scheme established by the FSA. An attempt was made to gauge consumer and industry interest in the schemes and to identify whether food safety standards had been improved. Findings - In all of the schemes the food safety standards were assessed by enforcement officers during routine inspections to grade the awards. The award schemes appeared to be popular with most award winners, with some of the local authorities and with those members of the public who are aware of them. However, the schemes do little to inform the public of actual standards in food premises. This lack of transparency mainly relates to a lack of information on the scoring mechanism for businesses and the public, limited publicity for the scheme in the media and the evident need to educate the public. Originality/value - Information on the benefits and limitations of the different schemes that are highlighted may make some contribution to the debate on a national scheme. 3abusiness enterprises 3aindustry 3ahonors and awards 3asafety standards 3afood safety 3ahygiene 3aUnited Kingdom 0aawards0 tBritish food journal.g2005, v. 107, no. 3 p.162-172x0007-070X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1108/000707005105864893Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02264naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245007500174300001600249500002400265520144200289650001701731650001601748650002101764700002001785700001501805773010201820852000901922856005501931655001201986IND4458983320221119110754.0110614e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445898332DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2745.2011.01827.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeh, Kelvin S.-H.10aMechanisms of monodominance in diverse tropical tree-dominated systems  ap. 891-898.  aIncludes references  a1. The existence of many types of monodominant forests is readily explainable by ecological theory (e.g. early successional forests). Nevertheless, monodominant stands sometimes occur in areas where a much higher diversity typically occurs. Such ‘classical monodominance' is not currently readily explained by ecological theory. 2. We briefly review the published mechanisms suggested to cause classical monodominance and then combine them into a new probabilistic conceptual framework to better understand why these systems occur. We build on two theories proposed to explain monodominance: a lack of exogenous disturbance over long periods and species-specific life-history traits. We suggest that certain traits under certain conditions may generate positive feedbacks leading to a greater probability of monodominance being achieved. Such positive feedbacks have the potential to drive a typically diverse system towards a monodominant one. 3. Synthesis. Classical monodominance in tropical forests is hypothesized to be attained when a group of traits occur together under low exogenous disturbance conditions, this giving rise to a series of positive feedbacks. The presented framework links the differing mechanisms proposed in the literature to explain classical monodominance and shows there are potentially alternative routes to monodominance, thus reconciling apparently contradictory observational and experimental results. 3alife history 3aprobability 3atropical forests1 aLewis, Simon L.1 aLloyd, Jon0 tjournal of ecology.g2011 July, v. 99, no. 4 p.891-898dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2011.01827.x 7aarticle03560naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003300133040001800166072000900184072000900193100002200202245012600224300001600350500002400366506007600390520178600466506003702252650001902289650001202308650001602320650001202336650002002348650001702368650001302385650000902398650002502407650003002432650003802462650001702500650001702517650001302534650001602547650004402563650002502607650004302632700001602675700002402691700002702715773007902742852000902821856008302830930003302913945002502946946001102971655001202982IND4434131720221207100850.0100319s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443413172DNAL7 a201442282pmid7 aPMC28295902pmcid7 a10.1186/1471-2229-10-252doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF6001 aJiménez, Sergio.10aIdentification of genes associated with growth cessation and bud dormancy entrance using a dormancy-incapable tree mutant  ap. 361-367.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground: In many tree species the perception of short days (SD) can trigger growth cessation, dormancy entrance, and the establishment of a chilling requirement for bud break. The molecular mechanisms connecting photoperiod perception, growth cessation and dormancy entrance in perennials are not clearly understood. The peach [Prunus persica (L.) Batsch] evergrowing (evg) mutant fails to cease growth and therefore cannot enter dormancy under SD. We used the evg mutant to filter gene expression associated with growth cessation after exposure to SD. Wild-type and evg plants were grown under controlled conditions of long days (16 h/8 h) followed by transfer to SD (8 h/16 h) for eight weeks. Apical tissues were sampled at zero, one, two, four, and eight weeks of SD and suppression subtractive hybridization was performed between genotypes at the same time points. Results: We identified 23 up-regulated genes in the wild-type with respect to the mutant during SD exposure. We used quantitative real-time PCR to verify the expression of the differentially expressed genes in wild-type tissues following the transition to SD treatment. Three general expression patterns were evident: one group of genes decreased at the time of growth cessation (after 2 weeks in SD), another that increased immediately after the SD exposure and then remained steady, and another that increased throughout SD exposure. Conclusions: The use of the dormancy-incapable mutant evg has allowed us to reduce the number of genes typically detected by differential display techniques for SD experiments. These genes are candidates for involvement in the signalling pathway leading from photoperiod perception to growth cessation and dormancy entrance and will be the target of future investigations.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPrunus persica 3apeaches 3afruit trees 3amutants 3atree physiology 3aplant growth 3adormancy 3abuds 2aDNA, Plantxgenetics 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGene Library 2aGenes, Plant 2aMutation 2aPhotoperiod 2aPrunusxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aRNA, Plantxgenetics 2aTreesxgeneticsxgrowth & development.1 aLi, Zhigang1 aReighard, Gregory L1 aBielenberg, Douglas G.0 tBMC plant biology.g2010, v. 10 p.361-367dBioMed Centralx1471-22297nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2229-10-253Available from publisher's Web site  a20100416b20100501c00000000  aINDdRSCe2010/04/16  aNon-US 7aarticle02252naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245003500129300001600164500016500180520113200345650002501477650002201502650001401524650001201538650001301550650002201563650001501585650002801600650002201628650001901650651001001669651001801679773014501697856005101842852000901893655001201902IND4502459720221119110839.0150511e20141030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND450245972DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Donglin10aWest meets east on ornamentals  ap. 397-401.  aPaper presented Proceedings of the International Plant Propagatorâs Society â 2013 held on October 30, 2013, Bellefonte, PA (United States of America)  aWhen talking about ornamentals, the USA introduced Magnolia grandiflora to Asian countries (East) more than 120 years ago and the species has been widely cultivated in Asian gardens and landscape. Today, only two cultivars were developed in China compared to at least 85 cultivars from the USA. If comparing the natural species of Magnolia (narrow-sense), China has 38 species while only eight are native to the USA (Wu and Raven, 1994). Nandina domestica was introduced to the West in 1804 and more than 36 cultivars have been developed and marketed in USA (Dirr, 2009). In China, all N. domestica have been marketed as the species, with no cultivar development (Table 1). Obviously, the natural resource of ornamental plants is much richer in East, than the West. In terms of new plant breeding, we are more advanced than that of the East. The marriage of East and West is imperative in the field of ornamental horticulture. We can fully utilize natural ornamental plant resources (East) and traditional and advanced plant breeding technology (West) for breeding better ornamental plants for our nursery industry and gardens. 3aMagnolia grandiflora 3aNandina domestica 3acultivars 3agardens 3aindustry 3aintroduced plants 3alandscapes 3aornamental horticulture 3aornamental plants 3aplant breeding 3aChina 3aUnited States0 tActa horticulturae.g2014 Oct. 30, , no. 1055 p.397-401dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/1055/1055_84.htm  aDNAL 7aarticle02615naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002800184245007700212300002000289506007600309520114200385506003701527650001701564650001301581650001301594650002301607650002201630650001101652650002101663650002401684650001301708650003101721650001601752650002801768650001101796700002001807700002701827700002201854773017601876852000902052856008302061946001302144655001202157IND4443597920221207095425.0101015e20101012xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444359792DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10063401072doi7 aPMC29550872pmcid7 a208761432pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaskaran, Sulochanadevi10aStructural basis for glucose-6-phosphate activation of glycogen synthase  ap. 17563-17568.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRegulation of the storage of glycogen, one of the major energy reserves, is of utmost metabolic importance. In eukaryotes, this regulation is accomplished through glucose-6-phosphate levels and protein phosphorylation. Glycogen synthase homologs in bacteria and archaea lack regulation, while the eukaryotic enzymes are inhibited by protein kinase mediated phosphorylation and activated by protein phosphatases and glucose-6-phosphate binding. We determined the crystal structures corresponding to the basal activity state and glucose-6-phosphate activated state of yeast glycogen synthase-2. The enzyme is assembled into an unusual tetramer by an insertion unique to the eukaryotic enzymes, and this subunit interface is rearranged by the binding of glucose-6-phosphate, which frees the active site cleft and facilitates catalysis. Using both mutagenesis and intein-mediated phospho-peptide ligation experiments, we demonstrate that the enzyme's response to glucose-6-phosphate is controlled by Arg583 and Arg587, while four additional arginine residues present within the same regulatory helix regulate the response to phosphorylation.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aactive sites 3aarginine 3abacteria 3acatalytic activity 3acrystal structure 3aenergy 3aeukaryotic cells 3aglucose 6-phosphate 3aglycogen 3aglycogen (starch) synthase 3amutagenesis 3aprotein phosphorylation 3ayeasts1 aRoach, Peter J.1 aDePaoli-Roach, Anna A.1 aHurley, Thomas D.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Oct. 12, v. 107, no. 41 p.17563-17568dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10063401073Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle01957naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002400154245010700178300001600285500002400301520098900325650001501314650000901329650001901338650001001357650001601367700002301383700002201406773012401428852000901552856009401561655001201655IND4463266720221119110842.0120522e200305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446326672DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1740-8261.2003.tb00459.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalwei, Rochelle M.10aUse of contrast harmonic ultrasound for the diagnosis of congenital protosystemic shunts in three dogs  ap. 301-305.  aIncludes references  aContrast harmonic ultrasound was used to determine macrovascular and perfusion patterns in three dogs with congenital extrahepatic solitary portosystemic shunts (PSS). With coded harmonic angio-graphic ultrasound, the size and tortuosity of the hepatic arteries were subjectively increased. Single pulse intermittent low-amplitude harmonic perfusion imaging provided contrast enhancement time-intensity curves from regions of interest in the liver. Mean (±standard deviation) peak perfusion times of dogs with PSS were significantly shorter (p= 0.01; 7.0 ± 2.0 s) than reported in normal dogs (22.8 ± 6.8 s). The contrast inflow slope for the dogs with PSS (14.6 ± 3.7 pixel intensity units [PIU] was significantly (p= 0.05) larger than reported for normal dogs (3.6 ±1.4 PIU/s). These results indicate that combined coded harmonic angiographic and contrast harmonic perfusion sonography can be used to detect increased hepatic arterial blood flow as an indicator of PSS in dogs. 3ablood flow 3adogs 3ahepatic artery 3aliver 3aultrasonics1 aO'Brien, Robert T.1 aMatheson, Jodi S.0 tVeterinary radiology & ultrasound.g2003 , v. 44, no. 3 p.301-305dBlackwell SciencewJournal:jnl48671x1058-81837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1740-8261.2003.tb00459.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02536naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001500184245009500199300002000294506007600314520115600390506003701546650001701583650002201600650002301622650000901645700001401654700001401668700001401682700001701696700001801713700002001731700001601751700001801767700001601785700002001801773017601821852000901997856008302006946001302089655001202102IND4443598020221207095411.0101015e20101012xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444359802DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10056811072doi7 aPMC29551072pmcid7 a208761332pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Xiang10aStructural basis for the autoprocessing of zinc metalloproteases in the thermolysin family  ap. 17569-17574.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThermolysin-like proteases (TLPs), a large group of zinc metalloproteases, are synthesized as inactive precursors. TLPs with a long propeptide (~200 residues) undergo maturation following autoprocessing through an elusive molecular mechanism. We report the first two crystal structures for the autoprocessed complexes of a typical TLP, MCP-02. In the autoprocessed complex, Ala205 shifts upward by 33 Å from the previously covalently linked residue, His204, indicating that, following autocleavage of the peptide bond between His204 and Ala205, a large conformational change from the zymogen to the autoprocessed complex occurs. The eight N-terminal residues (residues Ala205-Gly212) of the catalytic domain form a new β-strand, nestling into two other β-strands. Simultaneously, the apparent Tm of the autoprocessed complex increases 20 °C compared to that of the zymogen. The stepwise degradation of the propeptide begins with two sequential cuttings at Ser49-Val50 and Gly57-Leu58, which lead to the disassembly of the propeptide and the formation of mature MCP-02. Our findings give new insights into the molecular mechanism of TLP maturation.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aactive sites 3acrystal structure 3ametalloproteinases 3azinc1 aWang, Jue1 aYu, Da-Qi1 aBian, Fei1 aXie, Bin-Bin1 aChen, Xiu-Lan1 aZhou, Bai-Cheng1 aLai, Lu-Hua1 aWang, Zhi-Xin1 aWu, Jia-Wei1 aZhang, Yu-Zhong0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Oct. 12, v. 107, no. 41 p.17569-17574dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10056811073Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle03111naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002300184245011800207300002000325506007600345520162300421506003702044650002002081650001502101650001702116650001602133650001402149650002502163650000902188650001702197650001302214650001402227650001102241650001402252700002002266700001502286700001902301700002202320700001802342773017602360852000902536856008302545946001302628655001202641IND4443597720221207095416.0101015e20101012xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444359772DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10087691072doi7 aPMC29551022pmcid7 a208761392pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoiseyev, Gennadiy10aInhibition of the visual cycle by A2E through direct interaction with RPE65 and implications in Stargardt disease  ap. 17551-17556.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aStargardt disease (STGD) is the major form of inherited juvenile macular degeneration. Pyridinium bis-retinoid A2E is a major component of lipofuscin which accumulates in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells in STGD and contributes to the disease pathogenesis. However, the precise role of A2E in vision loss is unclear. Here we report that A2E efficiently inhibits RPE65 isomerohydrolase, a key enzyme in the visual cycle. Subretinal injection of A2E significantly inhibited retinoid isomerohydrolase activity in mice. Likewise, A2E also inhibited isomerohydrolase activity in cells coexpressing RPE65, lecithin retinol acyltransferase (LRAT), and cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein. In vitro isomerohydrolase activity assays confirmed that A2E inhibited enzymatic activity of recombinant RPE65 in a concentration-dependent manner, but did not inhibit LRAT activity. The inhibition type for isomerohydrolase was found to be reversible and competitive with Ki = 13.6 μM. To determine the direct interaction of A2E with RPE65 protein, fluorescence binding assays were performed. As shown by fluorimetric titration, binding of purified RPE65 with A2E enhanced the bis-retinoid fluorescence. Consistently, the fluorescence of RPE65 decreased upon incubation with A2E. Both of these experiments suggest a direct, specific binding of A2E to RPE65. The binding constant for A2E and purified RPE65 was calculated to be 250 nM. These results demonstrate that A2E inhibits the regeneration of 11-cis retinal, the chromophore of visual pigments, which represents a unique mechanism by which A2E may impair vision in STGD.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aenzyme activity 3aepithelium 3afluorescence 3afluorometry 3ajuveniles 3amacular degeneration 3amice 3apathogenesis 3apigments 3atitration 3avision 3avitamin A1 aNikolaeva, Olga1 aChen, Ying1 aFarjo, Krysten1 aTakahashi, Yusuke1 aMa, Jian-xing0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Oct. 12, v. 107, no. 41 p.17551-17556dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10087691073Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle01605naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245007200166300001600238500002400254520075400278650002501032650001301057650001901070650001801089650002001107650001601127773007801143852000901221856008501230655001201315IND4465893620221119110759.0130414s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446589362DNAL7 a10.1108/000707003105062452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWorsley, Anthony14aThe behavioural and demographic contexts of white bread consumption  ap. 695-699.  aIncludes references  aThe aim of this study was to examine the demographic, health habits and personal values associations of white bread use. A total of 474 randomly selected consumers completed a questionnaire about bread consumption, health habits and personal values. The findings showed that compared with non-consumers white bread users were younger, less educated, more likely to have children and to be smokers. They were less likely to follow vegetarian, low fat or special diets or use alternative therapies. Non-consumers were more likely to hold pro-nature universalistic values. This suggests that the use of this staple food is associated with demographic, behavioural and ideological domains. Their causal inter-relationships require further investigation. 3aalternative medicine 3achildren 3aquestionnaires 3aspecial diets 3avegetarian diet 3awhite bread0 tBritish food journal.g2003, v. 105, no. 10-11 p.695-699x0007-070X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1108/000707003105062453Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01653naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245013200126300001600258500011800274500002400392520049900416650001900915650001400934650003400948650001100982650001300993650001301006650001501019650001601034650001001050700002001060773014001080852000901220856008601229655001201315IND4463031020221119110706.0120416s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446303102DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKitsiou, S.10aModified atmosphere packaging of 'Hayward' kiwifruit: composition of the storage atmosphere and quality changes at 10 and 20°C  ap. 239-244.  aPaper presented at the Fifth International Symposium on Kiwifruit, held September 15-20, 2002, Wuhan, P.R.

The main symptoms consisted of a hypertrophy of the entire trunks and plant development was significantly affected. Cross sections of diseased trunks and larger branches showed a marked brown discoloration of the xylem starting from the central core, wood rings were also irregularly arranged. Diseased plant samples were tested in the laboratory for the presence of phytopathogenic agents. Various fungi were isolated from roots and transverse trunk sections of about 2 cm in thickness, cut at different heights. The most frequent were: Acremonium spp., Cylindrocarpon spp., Fusarium spp., Phaeoacremonium spp., Phialophora spp. and Phomopsis spp. Along with these mitosporic fungi, some basidiomycetes were also sometimes found. In addition PCR products of the ITS regions of some Phaeoacremonium isolates were investigated. 3aNeonectria 3aplant development 3ahypertrophy 3aPhialophora 3adiscoloration 3awood 3apolymerase chain reaction 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3afungi 3aAcremonium 3aBasidiomycota 3abranches 3axylem 3akiwifruit 3aroots 3aDiaporthe 3aFusarium 3aItaly 0aPhomopsis 0aCylindrocarpon1 aSandalo, S.1 aProdi, A.1 aCredi, R.1 aSpada, G.1 aGraziani, S.0 tActa horticulturae.g2003 June, , no. 610 p.253-259dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/610/610_33.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02786naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245008500126300001600211500011300227500002400340520150000364650002301864650002601887650003201913650002301945650002501968650002501993650001402018650001002032650001102042650005202053650001102105650001202116651001302128700001502141700001402156773012302170852000902293856008602302655001202388IND4465904920221119110810.0130415s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446590492DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMavrič, I.10aDetection of raspberry bushy dwarf virus in some raspberry cultivars in Slovenia  ap. 155-158.  aPaper presented at the Tenth International Symposium on Small Fruit Virus Diseases, held in Valencia, Spain.  aIncludes references  aIn 2002, severe vein yellowing and partial or complete yellowing of the leaves were observed on some shoots of red raspberry 'Golden Bliss' and 'Autumn Bliss', indicating the possible infection with RBDV. Sap of infected plants of 'Golden Bliss' was inoculated on Chenopodium quinoa and Nicotiana benthamiana. Faint chlorotic spots were observed on inoculated leaves of C. quinoa about 14 days after inoculation. No symptoms were observed on N. benthamiana. Systemic infections of inoculated C. quinoa and N. benthamiana and infections of original raspberry plants were confirmed by DAS-ELISA. In 2003 the virus was isolated from the same raspberry cultivar by mechanical inoculation of C. quinoa in growth chamber at 20°C. Systemic chlorotic spots were observed about 14 days after inoculation. With immuno-capture RT-PCR a part of the CP gene was amplified using four primer pairs. The largest product of about 872bp was purified and sequenced. Comparison of the nucleotide and amino acid sequences showed the identities of 96,8%-99,7% and 98,4%-99,6%, respectively. In 2003, 31 raspberry cvs., four autochthonous Rubus sp., Rubus occidentalis and Rubus phoenicolasius grown in collection plantation at Brdo pri Lukovici were tested for the presence of RBDV by DAS-ELISA. Infection was confirmed in raspberry 'Autumn Bliss', 'Fall Gold' 'Golden Bliss', 'Meeker' and in three of four tested autochthonous Rubus species.

Six months after harvest, we conducted a synoptic survey of 217 stream sites in Indiana to determine the extent of maize detritus and presence of Cry1Ab protein in the stream network. We found that 86% of stream sites contained maize leaves, cobs, husks, and/or stalks in the active stream channel. We also detected Cry1Ab protein in stream-channel maize at 13% of sites and in the water column at 23% of sites. We found that 82% of stream sites were adjacent to maize fields, and Geographical Information Systems analyses indicated that 100% of sites containing Cry1Ab-positive detritus in the active stream channel had maize planted within 500 m during the previous crop year. Maize detritus likely enters streams throughout the Corn Belt; using US Department of Agriculture land cover data, we estimate that 91% of the 256,446 km of streams/rivers in Iowa, Illinois, and Indiana are located within 500 m of a maize field. Maize detritus is common in low-gradient stream channels in northwestern Indiana, and Cry1Ab proteins persist in maize leaves and can be measured in the water column even 6 mo after harvest. Hence, maize detritus, and associated Cry1Ab proteins, are widely distributed and persistent in the headwater streams of a Corn Belt landscape.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aUSDA 3aagricultural land 3acorn 3acrop year 3aecosystems 3agenetically modified organisms 3ageographic information systems 3ahulls 3ainsecticidal proteins 3aland cover 3alandscapes 3aleaves 3aplanting 3arivers 3astream channels 3asurveys 3asystems analysis 3aCorn Belt region 3aIllinois 3aIndiana 3aIowa1 aRosi-Marshall, Emma J.1 aRoyer, Todd V.1 aWhiles, Matt R.1 aGriffiths, Natalie A.1 aFrauendorf, Therese C.1 aTreering, David J.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Oct. 12, v. 107, no. 41 p.17645-17650dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10069251073Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle03018naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002200184245007900206300002000285506007600305520139200381506003701773650001801810650001301828650001101841650003201852650000901884650001201893650001901905650001101924650002301935700002201958700002201980700002002002700002102022700002602043700001902069700002302088700002502111700001702136700002402153700002302177700001902200773017602219852000902395856008302404946001302487655001202500IND4443598720221207095418.0101015e20101012xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444359872DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10090621072doi7 aPMC29550832pmcid7 a208761442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNicoll, Andrew J.10aPharmacological chaperone for the structured domain of human prion protein  ap. 17610-17615.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn prion diseases, the misfolded protein aggregates are derived from cellular prion protein (PrPC). Numerous ligands have been reported to bind to human PrPC (huPrP), but none to the structured region with the affinity required for a pharmacological chaperone. Using equilibrium dialysis, we screened molecules previously suggested to interact with PrP to discriminate between those which did not interact with PrP, behaved as nonspecific polyionic aggregates or formed a genuine interaction. Those that bind could potentially act as pharmacological chaperones. Here we report that a cationic tetrapyrrole [Fe(III)-TMPyP], which displays potent antiprion activity, binds to the structured region of huPrP. Using a battery of biophysical techniques, we demonstrate that Fe(III)-TMPyP forms a 1:1 complex via the structured C terminus of huPrP with a Kd of 4.5 ± 2 μM, which is in the range of its IC₅₀ for curing prion-infected cells of 1.6 ± 0.4 μM and the concentration required to inhibit protein-misfolding cyclic amplification. Therefore, this molecule tests the hypothesis that stabilization of huPrPC, as a principle, could be used in the treatment of human prion disease. The identification of a binding site with a defined 3D structure opens up the possibility of designing small molecules that stabilize huPrP and prevent its conversion into the disease-associated form.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abinding sites 3adialysis 3ahumans 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3airon 3aligands 3aprion diseases 3aprions 3aprotein aggregates1 aTrevitt, Clare R.1 aTattum, M.

We use isothermal calorimetry, circular dichroism, NMR, and computational modeling to analyze how the structure of the eIF4E-binding domain of 4E-BP1 determines its affinity for the dorsal face of eIF4E and thus the ability of this regulator to act as a competitive inhibitor. This work identifies the key role of solvent-facing amino acids in 4E-BP1 that are not directly engaged in interactions with eIF4E. These amino acid residues influence the propensity of the natively unfolded binding motif to fold into a conformation, including a stretch of α-helix, that is required for tight binding to eIF4E. In so doing, they contribute to a free energy landscape for 4E-BP1 folding that is poised so that phosphorylation of S65 at the C-terminal end of the helical region can modulate the propensity of folding, and thus regulate the overall free energy of 4E-BP1 binding to eIF4E, over a physiologically significant range. Thus, phosphorylation acts as an intramolecular structural modulator that biases the free energy landscape for the disorder-order transition of 4E-BP1 by destabilizing the α-helix to favor the unfolded form that cannot bind eIF4E. This type of order-disorder regulatory mechanism is likely to be relevant to other intermolecular regulatory phenomena in the cell.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aamino acids 3acalorimetry 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3aenergy 3amodels 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphosphorylation1 aDutta, Kaushik1 aCowburn, David1 aWarwicker, Jim1 aDoig, Andrew J.1 aMcCarthy, John E.G.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Oct. 12, v. 107, no. 41 p.17627-17632dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10082421073Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02103naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245006400165300001600229500002400245520121800269650002001487650001401507650003701521650001801558650001201576650001701588700002201605700002001627773008501647852000901732856004801741655001201789IND4410468020221119110940.0080919e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441046802DNAL7 a10.1007/s00442-008-1101-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolzer, Barbara10aForeign ant queens are accepted but produce fewer offspring  ap. 717-723.  aIncludes references  aUnderstanding social evolution requires us to understand the processes regulating the number of breeders within social groups and how they partition reproduction. Queens in polygynous (multiple queens per colony) ants often seek adoption in established colonies instead of founding a new colony independently. This mode of dispersal leads to potential conflicts, as kin selection theory predicts that resident workers should favour nestmate queens over foreign queens. Here we compared the survival of foreign and resident queens as well as their relative reproductive share. We used the ant Formica exsecta to construct colonies consisting of one queen with workers related to this resident queen and introduced a foreign queen. We found that the survival of foreign queens did not differ from that of resident queens over a period of 136 days. However, the genetic analyses revealed that resident queens produced a 1.5-fold higher number of offspring than introduced queens, and had an equal or higher share in 80% of the colonies. These data indicate that some discrimination can occur against dispersing individuals and that dispersal can thus have costs in terms of direct reproduction for dispersing queens. 3aFormica exsecta 3aevolution 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3akin selection 3aprogeny 3areproduction1 aChapuisat, Michel1 aKeller, Laurent0 tOecologia.g2008 Oct., v. 157, no. 4 p.717-723dSpringer-Verlagx0029-85497nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-008-1101-3 7aarticle02396naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001400184245009200198300002000290506007600310520086300386506003701249650002601286650001801312650001501330650001901345650002401364650001301388700002001401700001901421700002301440700002601463700002201489700001801511700002201529700001401551700002501565700002501590700003001615773017601645852000901821856008301830946001301913655001201926IND4443598920221207112743.0101015e20101012xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444359892DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10037501072doi7 aPMC29551222pmcid7 a208761412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Hui10aAllosteric inhibition of complement function by a staphylococcal immune evasion protein  ap. 17621-17626.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe complement system is a major target of immune evasion by Staphylococcus aureus. Although many evasion proteins have been described, little is known about their molecular mechanisms of action. Here we demonstrate that the extracellular fibrinogen-binding protein (Efb) from S. aureus acts as an allosteric inhibitor by inducing conformational changes in complement fragment C3b that propagate across several domains and influence functional regions far distant from the Efb binding site. Most notably, the inhibitor impaired the interaction of C3b with complement factor B and, consequently, formation of the active C3 convertase. As this enzyme complex is critical for both activation and amplification of the complement response, its allosteric inhibition likely represents a fundamental contribution to the overall immune evasion strategy of S. aureus.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3abinding sites 3acomplement 3aimmune evasion 3amechanism of action 3aproteins1 aRicklin, Daniel1 aHammel, Michal1 aGarcia, Brandon L.1 aMcWhorter, William J.1 aSfyroera, Georgia1 aWu, You-Qiang1 aTzekou, Apostolia1 aLi, Sheng1 aGeisbrecht, Brian V.1 aWoods, Virgil L.

Strawberry isolates could not be maintained under greenhouse conditions, since the infected plants died and graft transmission could not be achieved. The recent identification of the planthopper Cixius wagneri as vector of this proteobacterium, allowed the transmission of "Ca P. fragariae" to Catharanthus roseus periwinkle, providing the first "Ca P. fragariae" reference isolate. Electron microscopy, 16S-rDNA and spoT PCR amplification confirmed the presence of "Ca P. fragariae" in diseased periwinkles. Graft transmission of infected shoots to healthy periwinkle seedlings led to stable maintenance of isolate LG2001 and reproducible observation of symptoms expression. Recent description of 16S-rDNA sequences from other proteobacteria revealed that "Ca P. fragariae" was related closely to a proteobacterium associated with a sugarbeet disease and transmitted by another planthopper as well as to secondary symbionts of whiteflies and psyllids. A remarkable feature in "Ca P. fragariae" 16S-rDNA sequence was a unique 36 bp deletion at the beginning of the gene . In order to better characterize our reference isolate, we further studied its 16S-rDNA. Because at least 11 "Ca P. fragariae" different 16S-rDNA copies could be found, we concluded that isolate LG 2001 is either a mixed infection of two different "Ca P. fragariae" strains or possesses more than eleven 16S-rDNA copies, and only some have the 36-bp deletion at the beginning of the gene. 3aAleyrodidae 3aCatharanthus roseus 3aPhlomobacter 3achlorosis 3aelectron microscopy 3agenes 3agreenhouses 3amixed infection 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3astrawberries 3asymbionts 3aChina1 aSalar, P.1 aBatailler, B.1 aFoissac, X.1 aGarnier, M.0 tActa horticulturae.g2004 Sept., , no. 656 p.87-92dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/656/656_12.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02097naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245009700126300001600223500011800239500002400357520088700381650001101268650001801279650001401297650001301311650001501324650001301339650002001352650001501372650001101387650001101398650002501409650001401434700001301448700001501461773014001476852000901616856008601625655001201711IND4463029520221119111036.0120415s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446302952DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuezawa, K.10aEvaluation of vineyard conditions useful for predicting fruit quality of 'Koryoku' kiwifruit  ap. 145-151.  aPaper presented at the Fifth International Symposium on Kiwifruit, held September 15-20, 2002, Wuhan, P.R.

Coefficient of variation (CV) of total soluble solids (TSS) in ‘Koryoku’ was larger than ‘Hayward’ throughout several years. Negative correlation was found between soil nitrate level and TSS. Coefficient of variation (CV) of TSS within canopy or within vineyard was relatively small, while CV among vineyards was large. The enzymatic degradation of starch in unripe (two weeks before commercial harvest) fruit was an effective method of estimating TSS in ripened fruit. Near Infra Red Analysis (NIRA) method was also effective. Evaluation of the vineyard by the conditions of management and soil type in summer was very effective to predict the quality of fruit produced in individual vineyard. 3acanopy 3afruit quality 3akiwifruit 3anitrates 3aprediction 3aripening 3asoil management 3asoil types 3astarch 3asummer 3atotal soluble solids 3avineyards1 aNoda, H.1 aFukuda, T.0 tActa horticulturae.g2003 June, , no. 610 p.145-151dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/610/610_18.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02721naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245009100167300001600258520146100274650001801735650002501753650001701778650001601795650002901811650002001840650001701860650001101877650000901888650001901897653001901916653002001935653002301955653002401978700002002002700002202022773011702044852000902161856008502170930003302255946001102288655001202299IND4394416320221119110912.0070826e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439441632DNAL7 a10.1007/s11120-007-9179-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTóth, Szilvia Z.12aA non-invasive assay of the plastoquinone pool redox state based on the OJIP-transient  ap. 193-203.  aThe plastoquinone (PQ) pool of the photosynthetic electron transport chain becomes reduced under anaerobic conditions. Here, anaerobiosis was used as a tool to manipulate the PQ-pool redox state in darkness and to study the effects of the PQ-redox state on the Chl-a fluorescence (OJIP) kinetics in pea leaves (Pisum sativum L.). It is shown that the FJ (fluorescence intensity at 3 ms) is linearly related to the area above the OJ-phase (first 3 ms) representing the reduction of the acceptor side of photosystem II (PSII) and FJ is also linearly related to the area above the JI-phase (3-30 ms) that parallels the reduction of the PQ-pool. This means that FJ depends on the availability of oxidized PQ-molecules bound to the QB-site. The linear relationships between FJ and the two areas indicate that FJ is not sensitive to energy transfer between PSII-antennae (connectivity). It is further shown that a ~94% reduced PQ-pool is in equilibrium with a ~19% reduction of QA (primary quinone acceptor of PSII). The non-linear relationship between the initial fluorescence value (F₂₀ μs) and the area above the OJ-phase supports the idea that F₂₀ μs is sensitive to connectivity. This is reinforced by the observation that this non-linearity can be overcome by transforming the F₂₀ μs-values into [QA -]-values. Based on the FJ-value of the OJIP-transient, a simple method for the quantification of the redox state of the PQ-pool is proposed. 3aPisum sativum 3aanaerobic conditions 3aanaerobiosis 3achlorophyll 3aelectron transport chain 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence 3aleaves 3apeas 3aphotosystem II 0aOJIP-transient 0aPisum sativum L 0aPlastoquinone pool 0a820 nm transmission1 aSchansker, Gert1 aStrasser, Reto J.0 tPhotosynthesis research.g2007 July, v. 93, no. 1-3 p.193-203dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0166-85957nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11120-007-9179-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20110531b20110603c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02847naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245006000124300001600184500011800200500002400318520167800342650002002020650001802040650001102058650001702069650001402086650003102100650004402131650001302175650001002188700001702198700001902215700001602234773014002250852000902390856008602399655001202485IND4463030120221119110801.0120415s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446303012DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCosta, G.10aNon-destructive assessment methods of kiwifruit quality  ap. 179-189.  aPaper presented at the Fifth International Symposium on Kiwifruit, held September 15-20, 2002, Wuhan, P.R. China.  aIncludes references  aFruit quality is essential for consumer acceptance. The definition of quality at harvest is dependent on a precise harvesting date that in turn has a marked influence on storage strategy as well as edible fruit quality. The traditional techniques of assessing fruit quality and harvest date (refractometer and penetrometer readings) are carried out by sampling a limited number of fruits, which often may not be representative of the totality of harvested fruits. Indeed, fruits off a single vine are marked by very high variability in maturity and quality. Recently, non-destructive techniques have been developed to assess fruit quality in several countries (Japan, New Zealand, Australia, USA and Italy). These techniques make it possible: to assess fruit quality non-destructively on a large number of fruits, or even on all the harvested fruits; to increase the number and representativeness of the selected samples; to repeat analysis on the same samples and to follow their physiological development (i.e. ripening in pre-harvest or during storage); to select the sample most representative of the variability of the studied population, to determine different attributes from the same measurement and, hence, to increase the amount of useful information. The methods used commercially, or which are still under research, employ electromagnetic (NIRS, near infrared spectroscopy, and NMR, nuclear magnetic resonance), electrochemical (e-nose, electronic nose) and electromechanical (impact) principles. The present paper reports examples of determining quality and ripening stage of kiwifruit in pre- and post-harvest situations with these non-destructive techniques. 3aelectronic nose 3afruit quality 3afruits 3aharvest date 3akiwifruit 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aripening 3avines1 aNoferini, M.1 aMontefiori, M.1 aBrigati, S.0 tActa horticulturae.g2003 June, , no. 610 p.179-189dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/610/610_24.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02591naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245007700167300001600244520149300260653002201753653001501775653001901790653001501809653002001824700001501844700002501859700002101884700001801905700001501923773015801938852000902096856009202105930003302197946001102230655001202241IND4426992920221119110734.0091011e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442699292DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0507.2008.01636.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohann, S.10aAntifungal activities of compounds isolated from Piper abutiloides Kunth  ap. 499-506.  aPiperaceae is a family of tropical plants known to have antifungal, antibacterial, tumour-inhibitory, antiviral, antioxidant, molluscicidal and leishmanicidal activities. In this work, extracts and fractions from aerial parts of Piper abutiloides (Piperaceae), a traditional medicinal plant, were evaluated against the fungal species Candida albicans, C. parapsilosis, C. krusei, C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, Cryptococcus neoformans and Sporothrix schenckii. The results have shown that the antifungal activity of this plant can be concentrated in the hexanic fraction after partitioning its hydroalcoholic extract between hexane and 90% aqueous methanol. The chromatographic fractionation of the bioactive part was monitored with a bioautographic assay using C. glabrata, and allowed the isolation of three antifungal compounds: pseudodillapiol, eupomatenoid-6 and conocarpan. These compounds presented different potencies against the fungi tested, with the strongest effect being observed for eupomatenoid-6 against C. glabrata, which presented a minimal inhibitory concentration value of 0.3 μg spot⁻¹. Conocarpan showed antifungal activity without apparent cytotoxic effect on normal human lymphocytes, as assessed by the proliferation assay with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with phytohaemaglutinin.

Participants were shown 12 photographs taken at retail stores portraying either commonly perceived or actual food safety contributing factors, such as cross-contamination, product and equipment temperatures, worker hygiene, and/or store sanitation practices. Participants were then asked to specifically identify what they saw, comment as to whether what they saw was safe or unsafe, and articulate what actions they would take in response to these situations. In addition to the survey, focus groups were employed to supplement survey findings with qualitative data. Survey respondents identified risk factors for six of nine actual contributing factor photographs >50% of the time: poor produce storage sanitation (86%, n = 899), cross-contamination during meat slicing (72%, n = 750), bare-hand contact of ready-to-eat food in the deli area (67%, n = 698), separation of raw and ready-to-eat food in the seafood case (63%, n = 660), cross-contamination from serving utensils in the deli case (62%, n = 644), and incorrect product storage temperature (51%, n = 528). On a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 was very unsafe and 5 was very safe, a significant difference was found between average risk perception scores for photographs of actual contributing factors (score of ca. 2.5) and scores for photographs of perceived contributing factors (score of ca. 2.0). Themes from the focus groups supported the results of the survey and provided additional insight into consumer food safety risk perceptions. The results of this study inform communication interventions for consumers and retail food safety professionals aimed at improving hazard identification. 3aconsumer attitudes 3across contamination 3aequipment 3afocus groups 3afood safety 3ahazard identification 3ahygiene 3ameat 3aphotographs 3aprofessionals 3aready-to-eat foods 3arisk factors 3arisk perception 3asanitation 3aseafoods 3aslicing 3astorage temperature 3asurveys1 aYavelak, Mary1 aLuchansky, John B.1 aPorto-Fett, Anna C.

The percentage of product recovered following a recall action was not dependent on establishment size, recall expansions, complexity of the distribution chain, type of distribution, amount of time between the production and recall dates, or number of pounds of product recalled. However, illness-related recalls were associated with larger amounts of recalled product, smaller percentages of recalled product recovered, a greater number of days between the production date and recall date, and nationwide distribution than were recalls that were not illness related. In addition, the detection of recall-associated illnesses appeared to be enhanced in states with strong foodborne illness investigation systems. The number of Salmonella illnesses prevented by recalls was based on the number of illnesses occurring relative to the number of pounds consumed, which was then extrapolated to the number of pounds of recalled product recovered. A simulation using a program evaluation and review technique probability distribution with illness-related recalls from 2003 through 2012 estimated that there were 19,000 prevented Salmonella illnesses, after adjusting for underdiagnosis. Recalls not associated with illnesses from 2000 through 2012 prevented an estimated additional 8,300 Salmonella illnesses, after adjusting for underdiagnosis. Although further improvements to ensure accurate and complete reporting should be undertaken, our study demonstrates that recalls are an important tool for preventing additional Salmonella illnesses. Moreover, additional training resources dedicated to public health agencies for enhancing foodborne illness detection, investigations, and rapid response and reporting would further prevent illnesses. 3aSalmonella 3afoodborne illness 3ameat 3amodels 3apoultry products 3aprobability distribution 3aprogram evaluation 3apublic health1 aSampedro, Fernando1 aHedberg, Craid W.0 tJournal of food protection.g2017 Aug., v. 80, no. 8 p.1288-1292dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-16-424  aDNAL 7aarticle02444naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150100001700168245012500185300001600310500002400326500001500350520103000365650001901395650002301414650001201437650001201449650001801461650000901479650001601488650001201504650002001516650001201536650001101548650001001559650001501569650002101584650002001605650001101625650003501636650002101671650001401692653001001706700001701716700002101733700002301754773008801777852000901865856005201874655001201926IND4440304720221119110809.0100723e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444030472DNAL7 a204936402pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2010.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZell, Markus10aOhmic cooking of whole beef muscle — Evaluation of the impact of a novel rapid ohmic cooking method on product quality  ap. 258-263.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aCylindrical cores of beef semitendinosus (500g) were cooked in a combined ohmic/convection heating system to low (72°C, LTLT) and high (95°C, HTST) target end-point temperatures. A control was also cooked to an end-point temperature of 72°C at the coldest point. Microbial challenge studies on a model meat matrix confirmed product safety. Hunter L-values showed that ohmically heated meat had significantly (p <0.05) lighter surface-colours (63.05 (LTLT) and 62.26 (HTST)) relative to the control (56.85). No significant texture differences (p ≥0.05) were suggested by Warner-Bratzler peak load values (34.09, 36.37 vs. 35.19N). Cook loss was significantly (p <0.05) lower for LTLT samples (29.3%) compared to the other meats (36.3 and 33.8%). Sensory studies largely confirmed these observations. Cook values were lower for LTLT (3.05) while HTST and the control were more comparable (6.09 and 7.71, respectively). These results demonstrate considerable potential for this application of ohmic heating for whole meats. 3aproduct safety 3asensory evaluation 3atexture 3amuscles 3aohmic heating 3abeef 3atemperature 3acooking 3acooking quality 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aColor 2aConvection 2aCookingxmethods 2aHot Temperature 2aHumans 2aMeatxmicrobiologyxstandards. 2aMuscle, Skeletal 2aOdorants. 0aloads1 aLyng, James.1 aCronin, Denis A.1 aMorgan, Desmond J.0 tMeat science.g2010 Oct., v. 86, no. 2 p.258-263dElsevier Sciencex0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2010.04.007 7aarticle03188naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245011600181300001600297520135800313650002201671650001701693650001401710650001801724650003001742650001001772650001101782650002401793650001401817650001801831650001701849650001501866650001001881650001301891650004201904650006901946650005902015650006602074650006102140650001502201653002502216653003002241700002102271700002002292700002302312700001802335700001602353773011502369852000902484856008502493930003302578946001102611655001202622IND4394417620221119110958.0070826e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439441762DNAL7 a176651502pmid7 a10.1007/s11120-007-9224-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTalts, Eero 10aDark inactivation of ferredoxin-NADP reductase and cyclic electron flow under far-red light in sunflower leaves  ap. 109-120.  aThe oxidation kinetics under far-red light (FRL) of photosystem I (PSI) high potential donors P700, plastocyanin (PC), and cytochrome f (Cyt f) were investigated in sunflower leaves with the help of a new high-sensitivity photometer at 810 nm. The slopes of the 810 nm signal were measured immediately before and after FRL was turned on or off. The same derivatives (slopes) were calculated from a mathematical model based on redox equilibrium between P700, PC and Cyt f and the parameters of the model were varied to fit the model to the measurements. Typical best-fit pool sizes were 1.0-1.5 μmol m-² of P700, 3 PC/P700 and 1 Cyt f/P700, apparent equilibrium constants were 15 between P700 and PC and 3 between PC and Cyt f. Cyclic electron flow (CET) was calculated from the slope of the signal after FRL was turned off. CET activated as soon as electrons accumulated on the PSI acceptor side. The quantum yield of CET was close to unity. Consequently, all PSI in the leaf were able to perform in cycle, questioning the model of compartmentation of photosynthetic functions between the stroma and grana thylakoids. The induction of CET was very fast, showing that it was directly redox-controlled. After longer dark exposures CET dominated, because linear e- transport was temporarily hindered by the dark inactivation of ferredoxin-NADP reductase. 3aHelianthus annuus 3acytochrome f 3aelectrons 3afar-red light 3aferredoxin-NADP reductase 3agrana 3aleaves 3amathematical models 3aoxidation 3aphotosystem I 3aplastocyanin 3athylakoids 2aColor 2aDarkness 2aElectron Transportxradiation effects 2aFerredoxin-NADP Reductasexantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aHelianthusxenzymologyxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aPhotosystem I Protein Complexxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aPlant Leavesxenzymologyxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aTitrimetry 0aCyclic electron flow 0aFerredoxin-NADP reductase1 aOja, V.q(Vello)1 aRämma, Heikko 1 aRasulov, Bahtijor 1 aAnijalg, Agu 1 aLaisk, Agu 0 tPhotosynthesis research.g2007 Oct., v. 94, no. 1 p.109-120dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0166-85957nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11120-007-9224-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20070826b20070902c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01454naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245006100166300001600227500002400243520065700267650001300924650002700937650001300964651001200977700001900989773007401008852000901082856008501091655001201176IND4465892820221119110926.0130413s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446589282DNAL7 a10.1108/000707003104973542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmidt, Ruth A.10aPills by post?

In this paper, we argue that nearly all of these studies have overstated the impacts of FGB on global agricultural and land markets due to the fact that they have ignored the role of biofuel by-products. Feed by-products of FGB, such as dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS) and oilseed meals (VOBP), are used in the livestock industry as protein and energy sources. Their presence mitigates the price impacts of biofuel production. More importantly, they reduce the demand for cropland and moderate the indirect land use consequences of FGB. This paper explicitly introduces DDGS and VOBP into a global computational general equilibrium (CGE) model, developed at the Center for Global Trade Analysis at Purdue University, to examine the economic and environmental impacts of regional and international mandate policies designed to stimulate bioenergy production and use. We show that models with and without by-products reveal different portraits of the economic impacts of the US and EU biofuel mandates for the world economy in 2015. While both models demonstrate significant changes in the agricultural production pattern across the world, the model with by-products shows smaller changes in the production of cereal grains and larger changes for oilseeds products in the US and EU, and the reverse for Brazil. Models that omit by-products are found to overstate cropland conversion from US and EU mandates by about 27%. 3abiofuels 3abioenergy industry 3abyproducts 3aeconomic analysis 3aenvironmental impact 3adistillers grains 3aoilmeals 3aland use change1 aHertel, Thomas W.1 aTyner, Wallace E.1 aBeckman, Jayson F.1 aBirur, Dileep K.0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2010 Mar., v. 34, no. 3 p.278-289dPergamonx0961-95347nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2009.10.0173Available from publisher's Web site  a20100506b20100605c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/04/16  aNon-US 7aarticle03624naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245019000164300001600354520176400370650001702134650001202151650002202163650001302185650001102198650001502209650002902224650002202253650003102275650001702306650001702323650003302340650002102373650001102394650002002405650001802425650001202443650001802455650001902473650001502492651001002507653003502517653004302552653001202595653002802607700001902635700001902654700001402673700001802687700002202705700001702727700001902744773010902763852000902872856008502881930003302966946001102999655001203010IND4447436120221119110718.0110114e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444743612DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-010-0565-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Wen-Jie 10aAddition of HPMA affects seed germination, plant growth and properties of heavy saline-alkali soil in northeastern China: comparison with other agents and determination of the mechanism  ap. 177-191.  aChina has a large area of inland saline-alkali land, equivalent to 40% of the total cultivated land in the country. The principal features of these lands are high salt content, high pH, and poor soil structure with low water infiltration and poor drainage. These conditions effectively prevent the exploitation of such land for agriculture. In this study, we have compared 17 soil conditioning agents for their abilities to promote seed germination and growth under both laboratory and field conditions. One of these, Hydrolyzed Polymaleic Anhydride (HPMA), was identified as a highly effective agent for soil improvement. Laboratory germination experiments and laboratory and field cultivation of a variety of plants both showed that addition of HPMA could significantly increase the germination percentage and plant growth rate. Distinct from other Ca-carrier agents such as gypsum, HPMA increases the dissolution of CaCO₃, which is abundant in the calcareous saline-alkali soils. This allows Ca²⁺ in soil solution to displace the over-abundant Na⁺ in the soil colloids. This process greatly improves soil properties such as the bulk density, which decreased, and the capillary soil rise height of water and soil water infiltration rate, which increased. Direct SEM and AFM imagery showed flocculent soil precipitation (soil aggregates) after HPMA addition, and a looser structure of those aggregates. The addition of HPMA also reduced the soil pH and EC. These changes in soil chemical and physical properties are a likely explanation for the soil improvement effected by HPMA. The high content of insoluble CaCO₃ in saline-alkali land such as that in northeastern China (up to 13%) favors the further exploration of HPMA as an ameliorative agent. 3abulk density 3acalcium 3acalcium carbonate 3adrainage 3agypsum 3ahydrolysis 3ainfiltration (hydrology) 3ainfiltration rate 3alaboratory experimentation 3aplant growth 3asalt content 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aseed germination 3asodium 3asoil aggregates 3asoil colloids 3asoil pH 3asoil solution 3asoil structure 3asoil water 3aChina 0aSaline-alkali land improvement 0aSeed germination and plant growth rate 0aSoil EC 0aAtomic force microscope1 aHe, Hai-Sheng 1 aZu, Yuan-Gang 1 aGuan, Yu 1 aLiu, Zhi-Guo 1 aZhang, Zhong-Hua 1 aXu, Hui-Nan 1 aYu, Xing-Yang 0 tPlant and soil.g2011 Feb., v. 339, no. 1-2 p.177-191dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0032-079X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-010-0565-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20110114b20110205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02767naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002500145245016700170300001600337520158600353650002201939650002401961650001701985650002202002650003102024650004402055650001702099650001202116650001202128653002202140773011702162852000902279856008502288930003302373946001102406655001202417IND4398518720221119110835.0071209e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439851872DNAL7 a10.1007/s11120-007-9192-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGross, Elizabeth L. 12aA Brownian dynamics computational study of the interaction of spinach plastocyanin with turnip cytochrome f: the importance of plastocyanin conformational changes  ap. 411-422.  aBrownian Dynamics (BD) computer simulations were used to study electrostatic interactions between turnip cytochrome f (cyt f) and spinach plastocyanin (PC). Three different spinach PC structures were studied: The X-ray crystal structure of Xue and coworkers [(1998) Protein Sci 7:2099-2105] and the NMR structure of Musiani et al. [(2005) J Biol Chem 280:18833-18841] and Ubbink and co-workers [(1998) Structure 6:323-335]. Significant differences exist in the backbone conformation between the PC taken from Ubbink and coworkers and the other two PC structures particularly the regions surrounding G10, E59-E60, and D51. Complexes formed in BD simulations using the PC of Ubbink and colleagues had a smaller Cu-Fe distance than the other two. These results suggest that different PC conformations may exist in solution with different capabilities of forming electron-transfer-active docks. All three types of complexes show electrostatic contacts between D42, E43, and D44 on PC and K187 on cyt f as well as between E59 on PC and K58 on cyt f. However, the PC of Ubbink and coworkers reveals additional contacts between D51 and cyt f as a result of the difference in backbone configuration. A second minor complex component was observed for the PC of Ubbink and co-workers and Xue and co-workers which had contacts between K187 on cyt f and E59 and E60 on PC rather than between K187 on cyt f and D42-D44 on PC as observed for the major components. This second type of complex may represent an earlier complex which rearranges to form a final complex capable of electron transfer. 3aX-ray diffraction 3acomputer simulation 3acytochrome f 3aelectron transfer 3aelectrostatic interactions 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aplastocyanin 3aspinach 3aturnips 0aBrownian dynamics0 tPhotosynthesis research.g2007 Nov., v. 94, no. 2-3 p.411-422dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0166-85957nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11120-007-9192-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071209b20080102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01443naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009400165300001600259500002900275520049700304592002800801650001700829650002300846650001100869650001200880650001600892650002200908773012100930856008101051852000901132655001201141IND60688635020221120094829.0200416e20000501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068863502DNAL7 a10.1080/096145200500102322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMitlin, Diana10aAddressing urban poverty: Increasing incomes, reducing costs, and securing representation  ap. 204-215.  aNALT-AP-4-rerunAP2-fuzzy  aThe paper considers the effectiveness of different strategies used in urban areas by development agencies to reduce poverty, including the relative merits of income generation and housing and neighbourhood improvement.

Critical quality attributes (CQAs), critical process parameters (CPPs) and quality target parameters (QTPs) were identified and measured all along the chips processing chain in 98 independent experiments. Temperature, time and oil quality usually used in the food industry were applied. Multilinear regression (MLR) was conducted to identify the variables (CQAs and CPPs) that could explain variation of the QTPs. An aggregation of significant QTPs was also performed in order to determine a single value that could express final products quality coupled to MLR analysis. It was possible to identify the main CQAs and CPPs that can explain the variation of some QTPs (colour a*, “flavour roast” sensory attribute, pentylfuran content and acrylamide content) as well as aggregated data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylamides 3acolor 3adeep fat frying 3afood industry 3aoils 3apotato chips 3apotatoes 3asensory properties 3atemperature 0aQuality by design 0aPotatoe chips 0aDeep frying 0aMultilinear regressions 0aTemperature1 aGou, Pere1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6356-02221 aPruneri, Valerio1 aDiaz, Isabel1 aCastellari, Massimo0 tJournal of food engineering.g2019 Nov., v. 260 p.22-29dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2019.04.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02908naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100007500142245008400217300001800301500002000319520168300339592002802022596004802050650001902098650001502117650001302132650001502145650001302160650001902173650000902192700005702201700005402258700001702312773013102329856007702460852000902537655001202546IND60790165820221123044033.0220824e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079016582DNAL7 a10.1029/2019JB0175622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuḥammadī, M.q(Manūchihr),1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5749-252310aWind‐Induced Ground Motion: Dynamic Model and Nonuniform Structure for Ground  ap. 8478-8490.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWind‐induced ground vibrations are a source of noise in seismic surveys. In a previous study, a wind‐ground coupling theory was developed to predict the power spectral density of ground motions caused by wind perturbations on the ground surface. The prediction was developed using a superposition of the point source response of an elastic isotropic homogeneous medium deforming quasi‐statically with the statistical description of the wind‐induced pressure fluctuations on the ground. Model predictions and field measurements were in agreement for the normal component of the displacement but underpredicted the horizontal component. In this paper, two generalizations are investigated to see if they lead to increased horizontal displacement predictions: (1) First, the dynamic point source response is calculated and incorporated into the ground displacement calculation. Measured ground responses are used to incorporate losses into the dynamic calculation. (2) The quasi‐static response function for three different types of nonuniform grounds are calculated and used in the seismic wind noise superposition. The dynamic point source response and the three more realistic ground models result in larger horizontal displacements for the point source at distances on the order of 1 m or greater from the source. However, the superposition to predict the seismic wind noise is dominated by the displacements very close to the point source where the prediction is unchanged. This research indicates that the modeling of the wind‐induced pressure source distribution must be improved to predict the observed equivalency of the vertical and horizontal displacements.  aPublisher supplied data  a58-6060-6-009cUS Department of Agriculture 3adynamic models 3ageophysics 3aisotropy 3aprediction 3aresearch 3athermodynamics 3awind1 aHickey, C.

Previous studies on estimating wind turbine icing (WTI) generally rely on complex physical models, and many only model the ice growth itself while failing to correlate ice growth with energy loss. It is the estimation of icing-induced energy loss that is critical for power grid management to cope with energy deficits associated with extreme weather conditions. This study focuses on bridging this modeling gap through developing an efficacious methodology for predicting icing-induced energy losses for wind turbines in cold weather events. Specifically, this study uses measurements of 11 WTI events between 2018 and 2020 from a 2.5 MW wind turbine (Eolos site, University of Minnesota) to create a statistical correlation between meteorological conditions and icing-induced energy loss. Meteorological icing parameters generated from a Weather Research and Forecasting simulation are used as inputs to the model. The model is validated against in-situ data for all events, and against two additional 1.65 MW wind turbines for one event (Morris site, University of Minnesota). When comparing average estimated energy loss to measured loss, it shows a relative mean absolute error of 37% at Eolos and 2.9% at Morris (after power curve scaling). The new model is additionally implemented for 30 large-scale wind farms in the Midwest region of the United States for estimation of WTI energy loss. The method proposed in this study enables fast and accurate prediction of WTI energy loss for wind turbines.  aPublisher supplied data 3acold 3aenergy 3aice 3aprediction 3awind 3awind power 3awind turbines 3aMinnesota 0aWind turbine icing 0aMeteorological icing 0aWeather Research and Forecasting (WRF) 0aNumerical weather prediction (NWP) 0aEnergy loss1 aGao, Linyue1 aHong, Jiarong1 aShen, Lian0 tApplied energy.g2022 Jan. 01, v. 305 p.117809-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.1178093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02749naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245007700157300001800234520148200252592002801734650001701762650002801779650001701807650001801824650001801842650004301860650001901903650001101922650000701933650002001940650002001960650002801980650001102008650002102019700001602040700001602056700001602072700001902088773012502107856007402232852000902306655001202315IND60656567720221120161036.0190814e20120503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065656772DNAL7 a10.1039/c2ay05915k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Yanyan10aPhosphopeptide enrichment and fractionation by using Click OEG-CD matrix  ap. 1244-1251.  aReversible protein phosphorylation regulates many significant cellular processes. Identification of phosphorylation sites is vital to elucidate their biofunctions. To aid in phosphoproteome characterization, several selective enrichment methods have been developed, including immobilized metal-ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) and titanium dioxide (TiO₂). However, the high pH elution step applied in these two methods, which tends to degrade phosphopeptides. In order to improve phosphopeptide enrichment efficiency, a hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) based material, cyclodextrin (CD) bonded silica (Click OEG-CD), was synthesized in our group and applied to phosphopeptide enrichment and fractionation. Taking tryptic digest of standard protein α-casein as model sample, the performance of Click OEG-CD in phosphopeptide isolation was investigated. It was found that both the acetonitrile and salt concentrations in mobile phase influence the phosphopeptide enrichment selectivity of the matrix. Under optimized enrichment condition, Click OEG-CD has a similar phosphopeptide enrichment selectivity as commercial TiO₂. Meanwhile, phosphopeptides with same charges could be fractionated according to hydrophilicity difference on Click OEG-CD under acetonitrile gradient. Different selectivity is proved with Click OEG-CD from conventional SAX.

However, platinum-based chemotherapy induces severe side-effects in cancer patients, such as cachexia. Weight loss, as well as fatigue and systemic inflammation are characteristics of this syndrome that adversely affects the survival and the quality of life of cancer patients. The signalling pathways involved in chemotherapy-induced cachexia are still to be fully understood, but the activity of several mediators associated with muscle wasting, such as myostatin and pro-inflammatory cytokines are increased by platinum-based drugs like cisplatin. Indeed, the molecular mechanisms behind chemotherapy-induced muscle wasting seem to be similar to the ones promoted by cancer in treatment-naive patients. Although some therapeutic agents are under investigation for treating muscle wasting in cancer patients, no effective treatment is yet available. Herein, we review the molecular mechanisms proposed to be involved in chemotherapy-related muscle wasting with a focus on the typical platinum-based drug cisplatin. Therapeutic strategies presently under investigation are also reviewed, providing an overview of the current efforts to preserve muscle mass and quality of life among cancer patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3acachexia 3acisplatin 3acytokines 3adrug therapy 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3amuscles 3amyostatin 3aneoplasms 3apatients 3aquality of life 3asignal transduction 3aweight loss 0aCachexia 0aChemotherapy 0aNF-κB 0aMuscle wasting 0aSkeletal muscle1 aFerreira, Rita1 aGil da Costa, Rui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2151-24490 tLife sciences.g2018 Sept. 01, v. 208 p.1-9dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2018.07.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02069naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245006900159300001600228520103300244592002801277650002401305650002301329650001301352650002001365650002401385650002001409700002201429700002101451700002601472700002501498773012501523856007401648852000901722655001201731IND60656567920221121235008.0190814e20120329xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065656792DNAL7 a10.1039/c2ay05918e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrandke, Julia10aQuality assurance in immunoassay performance-temperature effects  ap. 901-905.  aTemperature is one factor that influences the performance of immunoassays. Most commonly all incubation steps of the immunoassay are performed at ambient temperature. To systematically study the influence of temperature deviations on assay parameters like signal variation coefficients, limit of detection and measurement range, direct competitive enzyme immunoassays for the determination of two anthropogenic markers, caffeine and carbamazepine, were run at different temperatures above and below room temperature during individual assay steps. The temperature during the competition step had the greatest impact on the assay sensitivity yielding changes in test midpoints by a factor of 10 to 15. For carbamazepine, the test midpoints varied from 36 ng L⁻¹, 108 ng L⁻¹ to 378 ng L⁻¹ employing 4 °C, 21 °C, or 37 °C as incubation temperature, respectively. The edge effect can be minimized resulting in a good plate homogeneity with small variation coefficients, when the assay is performed at ambient temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aanalytical methods 3acaffeine 3adetection limit 3aenzyme immunoassays 3aquality control1 aResch-Genger, Ute1 aBremser, Wolfram1 aGarbe, Leif-Alexander1 aSchneider, Rudolf J.0 tAnalytical methods.g2012 Mar. 29, v. 4, no. 4 p.901-905dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2ay05918e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01944naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245014100167500001900308520077400327592002801101650001801129650002801147650001601175650001001191650001301201650001401214653003601228653002401264653003101288653002701319700002401346700002701370773009401397856008201491852000901573655001201582IND60735638020221117015341.0210610e20210604xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073563802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2021.1321662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoohgard, Mehdi10aDual organic dyes as a pseudo-redox mediation system to promotion of tandem oxidation /[3+2] cycloaddition reactions under visible light  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAn atom- and step-economy protocol has been developed to synthesize some new biologically active pyrrolo[2,1-a]isoquinoline alkaloids via redox mediation system under visible light irradiation.

Irradiations were performed for two doses (0.1 and 1MGy) in wet conditions under an oxygen atmosphere, with a gamma ⁶⁰Co source. Irradiation effect on RO membranes performances (NaCl rejection, permeability) was studied before and after irradiation. ATR-FTIR, XPS, AFM, FESEM microscopy, ion chromatography were also used to characterize structural modifications. Results show that NaCl rejection of RO membranes irradiated at 1MGy decreased until 64% and permeability increased by a factor of three. Nevertheless, membranes irradiated at 0.1MGy did not exhibit any change in theirs permselectivity properties. Advanced analysis techniques confirmed that the firsts effects of gamma rays on RO membranes occurred between 0.1 and 1MGy. Results emphasize that gamma rays effects on the RO membranes led to the breaking of amide and ester bonds at 1MGy. These breakings resulted in loss of hydrogen bonds between polyamide chains, and consequently to a relaxation of the polyamide network. Finally, modifications of the polysulfone layer underneath were highlighted. Both relaxation of the polyamide network and modifications of the polysulfone layer could be involved in the drop of the permselectivity properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aartificial membranes 3aatomic force microscopy 3acobalt 3agamma radiation 3ahydrogen bonding 3aion exchange chromatography 3airradiation 3aoxygen 3apermeability 3apolyamides 3aradionuclides 3areverse osmosis 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asodium chloride 0aGamma irradiation 0aReverse osmosis 0aPolyamide membrane 0aXPS1 aSchrive, Luc1 aLabed, Véronique1 aWyart, Yvan1 aCarretier, Emilie1 aBenony-Rhodier, Adeline1 aMoulin, Philippe0 tJournal of membrane science.g2015 Apr. 15, v. 480 p.64-73dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2015.01.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03690naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245012900166520219600295592002802491650001402519650000802533650002002541650000902561650004202570650001602612650001402628650001902642650002202661650003002683650002702713650001102740651001002751653002402761653001902785653001502804653002102819653002602840700001402866700001602880700002202896700001702918700001902935700001602954700001402970773010502984856008603089852000903175655001203184IND60755675920221120134802.0211227e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075567592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.1271142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Chenxi10aAsymmetric response of short- and long-duration dry spells to warming during the warm-rain season over Eastern monsoon China  aChanges in dry spell duration have been analyzed over China and worldwide. However, the asymmetric response (i.e. skewed distribution) of short- and long-duration dry spells to warming temperature and possible mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we investigate this response based on daily weather observations during the warm-rain season (May-September) over 1961–2019 from 1540 quality-controlled stations across Eastern Monsoon China (EMC). Our results show a 1℃ warming in surface air temperature (SAT) and a considerable elongation of dry spells. Specifically, the regional average, maximum, and total dry spell duration over EMC increased by +7.06%, +6.17%, and +5.16%, respectively over 1961–2019. The areas in EMC with long dry spells and high SAT are also the areas that have experienced faster increases in the duration of dry spells per degree of warming. We find increases in the frequency of long-duration dry spells, but significant decreases in the frequency of short-duration dry spells. The increasing frequency of long-duration dry-spells can be explained by the slight increase in land evaporation (+1.6%/℃) over EMC and the decrease in integrated moisture vapor transport (-3.8%/℃) with warming, such that atmospheric moisture sources cannot meet the warming-induced demand, resulting in significant decreases in relative humidity (−2.4%/℃) and precipitation (−7.0%/℃). In contrast, the decreasing frequency of short-duration dry spells during hotter warm-rain seasons occurs when the saturation vapor pressure deficit is enhanced, leading to prolonged periods where the atmosphere is replenished to necessary saturation levels for local precipitation. Relative to cold warm-rain seasons, hot warm-rain seasons with higher SAT witness cold-dry air advection in the upper level, lower convective available potential energy, and stronger vapor divergence over EMC, which tends to suppress precipitation occurrence. With future warming, the increasing frequency and duration of dry spells in the warm-rain season is likely to be conducive to the occurrence of severe droughts and heatwaves in EMC, with negative impacts on socio-economic development in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadvection 3aair 3aair temperature 3acold 3aconvective available potential energy 3aevaporation 3ahydrology 3amonsoon season 3arelative humidity 3asocioeconomic development 3avapor pressure deficit 3avapors 3aChina 0aWarming temperature 0aLonger-lasting 0aDry spells 0aWarm-rain season 0aEastern Monsoon China1 aGu, Xihui1 aBai, Wenkui1 aSlater, Louise J.1 aLi, Jianfeng1 aKong, Dongdong1 aLiu, Jianyu1 aLi, Yanan0 tJournal of hydrology.g2021 Dec., v. 603 p.127114-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.1271143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02809naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245007500170520156100245592002801806650001701834650001201851650001901863650001801882650001501900651001001915651001801925653001501943653002101958653002501979653002002004653002402024700001502048700005802063700005102121700001602172700001102188773010502199856008602304852000902390655001202399IND60755676020221120150021.0211227e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075567602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.1271152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiong, Jinghua10aIntegrated flood potential index for flood monitoring in the GRACE era  aBy utilizing Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA) and remote sensing precipitation data, Flood Potential Index (FPI) has been widely used in large-scale flood monitoring. However, divergent post-processing dynamics of different GRACE solutions result in substantial uncertainties in GRACE TWSA and thus affecting predictive skills of FPI. To overcome this, this study develops an Integrated Flood Potential Index (IFPI) by linking the FPI derived from six GRACE products. The Gaussian copula is employed to establish the joint distribution of FPI from six spherical harmonic (SH) products and mass concentration blocks solutions. One of the most flood-prone regions, Yangtze River basin in China, is selected as a case study. We have identified and characterized the floods with different intensities using IFPI, which is evaluated against standardized discharge observations as well as the Total Storage Deficit Index (TSDI), Water Storage Deficit Index (WSDI) and Combined Climatologic Deviation Index (CCDI). Results show that the area under curve (AUC) values of IFPI for different levels of floods are generally greater than FPIs and their ensemble mean, implying the better predictive skill for the large-scale flood events. During the three severest floods in 2010, 2015, and 2016, IFPI captures the flood variability exhibited by TSDI, WSDI, and CCDI, as well as hydrological observations. This proposed approach might provide reference for flood monitoring and from multi-mission satellite data.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aclimate 3aremote sensing 3awater storage 3awatersheds 3aChina 3aYangtze River 0aGRACE data 0aFlood monitoring 0aUncertainty analysis 0aCopula function 0aYangtze River basin1 aYin, Jiabo1 aGuo, Shenglian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8594-49881 aGu, Lei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8291-98941 aXiong, Feng1 aLi, Na0 tJournal of hydrology.g2021 Dec., v. 603 p.127115-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.1271153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03436naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245015000162300001400312520170200326592002802028650002802056650002102084650002802105650001302133650001202146650001902158650003902177650002502216650001902241650003502260650000902295650001302304650002002317650002202337650002702359650002602386650001502412700001202427700001702439700001402456700001602470700001702486700001902503700001602522700001902538700001502557700002102572700001702593700001402610700002002624773008802644856008202732990002302814852000902837655001202846IND60095060420221119083048.0141104e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009506042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.diff.2012.11.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Jian14aThe expression of calcium-sensing receptor in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and its influence on differentiation of mESC into cardiomyocytes  ap. 32-40.  aThe calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), a G protein coupled receptor, is involved in a number of physiological and pathological processes.

Mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) were cultured to embryoid bodies (EBs) and the differentiation of EBs into cardiomyocytes was induced by icariin (ICA). The cardiac specific proteins, a-Actinin and cardiac troponin-I (cTnI), were analyzed by immunofluorescence, and the differentiation rate was analyzed by flow cytometry. The expression of cardiac-specific transcription factors, Nkx2.5 and GATA-4, was detected by Western blotting. We found that the CaSR protein exists in both mESCs and mESC-derived cardiomyocytes (mESC-CMs). Increasing extracellular calcium or neomycin (an agonist of CaSR) increased [Ca²⁺]ᵢ and the differentiation rate. These effects were abolished by inhibition of CaSR, phospholipase C, IP₃ receptor and Ca²⁺ ATPase, or by depletion of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺ store, respectively. Activation of CaSR up-regulated protein expression of Nkx2.5 and GATA4 in EBs at an early stage of ICA-induced differentiation. In conclusion, CaSR is functionally expressed in mESCs, and activation of CaSR is involved in the differentiation of mESCs into cardiomyocytes by facilitating the expression of NKx2.5 and GATA-4.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCa2-transporting ATPase 3aWestern blotting 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3aagonists 3acalcium 3acardiomyocytes 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3aembryonic stem cells 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescent antibody technique 3amice 3aneomycin 3aphospholipase C 3aprotein synthesis 3asarcoplasmic reticulum 3atranscription factors 3atroponin I1 aHe, Wen1 aBai, Shu-zhi1 aPeng, Xue1 aZhang, Ning1 aLi, Hong-xia1 aZhang, Wei-hua1 aWang, Lina,1 aShao, Xue-qian1 aHe, Yu-qin1 aYang, Guang-dong1 aWu, Lingyun,1 aWang, Rui1 aXu, Chang-Qing,0 tDifferentiation.g2013 Jan., v. 85, no. 1-2 p.32-40dElsevier B.V.x0301-46817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.diff.2012.11.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03294naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100001900176245013100195300001500326520179400341592002802135650001602163650002002179650001702199650001002216650003502226650001902261650001202280650001302292650001602305650001402321650002102335650001802356650001602374650001202390700002402402700001802426700002302444773015202467856006902619856010402688990002302792852000902815655001202824IND60644019420221119065730.0190514e20160407xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064401942DNAL7 a10.3791/539212doi7 aPMC48413632pmcid7 a270782072pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerner, Birgit10aAnalysis of zebrafish kidney development with time-lapse imaging using a dissecting microscope equipped for optical sectioning  ap. e53921.  aIn order to understand organogenesis, the spatial and temporal alterations that occur during development of tissues need to be recorded. The method described here allows time-lapse analysis of normal and impaired kidney development in zebrafish embryos by using a fluorescence dissecting microscope equipped for structured illumination and z-stack acquisition. To visualize nephrogenesis, transgenic zebrafish (Tg(wt1b:GFP)) with fluorescently labeled kidney structures were used. Renal defects were triggered by injection of an antisense morpholino oligonucleotide against the Wilms tumor gene wt1a, a factor known to be crucial for kidney development. The advantage of the experimental setup is the combination of a zoom microscope with simple strategies for re-adjusting movements in x, y or z direction without additional equipment. To circumvent focal drift that is induced by temperature variations and mechanical vibrations, an autofocus strategy was applied instead of utilizing a usually required environmental chamber. In order to re-adjust the positional changes due to a xy-drift, imaging chambers with imprinted relocation grids were employed. In comparison to more complex setups for time-lapse recording with optical sectioning such as confocal laser scanning or light sheet microscopes, a zoom microscope is easy to handle. Besides, it offers dissecting microscope-specific benefits such as high depth of field and an extended working distance. The method to study organogenesis presented here can also be used with fluorescence stereo microscopes not capable of optical sectioning. Although limited for high-throughput, this technique offers an alternative to more complex equipment that is normally used for time-lapse recording of developing tissues and organ dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aembryo (animal) 3afluorescence 3agenes 3agenetically modified organisms 3aimage analysis 3akidneys 3alighting 3amicroscopes 3aneoplasms 3aoligonucleotides 3aorganogenesis 3atemperature 3atissues1 aSchnerwitzki, Danny1 aGraf, Michael1 aEnglert, Christoph0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2016 Apr. 07, , no. 110 p.e53921-e53921dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/539213Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/53921/analysis-zebrafish-kidney-development-with-time-lapse-imaging-using  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03088naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003600151245011000187300001400297500001900311520132400330536027001654592002801924650003201952650003301984650001002017650001202027650001102039650000802050650001202058650001802070650002002088650002302108650001502131653001402146653002702160653002102187653003702208653001802245653002102263700002602284700003502310700003002345773013702375856008502512852000902597655001202606IND60722420620221119212756.0210102e20210102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072242062DNAL7 a10.1080/10498850.2020.18556892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCavenaghi-Altemio, Angela Dulce10aFeasibility of Using Fillet and Mechanically Separated Meat of Hybrid Sorubim in Inlaid Ham Type Products  ap. 76-84.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe aim of this work was to evaluate the feasibility of using fillet and/or mechanically separated meat (MSM) of hybrid sorubim (Pseudoplatystoma reticulatum x Pseudoplatystoma corruscans) in obtaining inlaid ham type products. Five formulations with the proportion (w/w) of fillet, MSM, and water of 0:100:0, 25:75:0, 50:50:0, 75:25:0, and 85:0:15 were developed and named F1, F2, F3, F4, and F5, respectively. Other ingredients were included at equivalent concentrations for the different treatments. Results showed that the protein content ranged (p > .05) from 13.62 to 16.56%. The lipid content varied (p < .05) from 2.85% (F5) to 8.58% (F1). For instrumental color, the luminosity decreased (p > .05) from 66.11 (F1) to 58.58 (F5). The shear force ranged from 1.23 N (F1) to 7.50 N (F5), with all formulations differing from each other (p < .05). After microbiological assessment, sensory analysis indicated acceptation indexes ranging from 72.89 to 86.67%. F5 presented the highest acceptation index for the three evaluated attributes (color, flavor, and tenderness). The sum of the percentages of purchase intention for “probably would purchase” and “certainly would purchase” reached its maximum of 80% for F5. The relationship between the composition and the other obtained results is evaluated.  aThis work was supported by the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico; Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior; Fundação de Apoio ao Desenvolvimento do Ensino, Ciência e Tecnologia do Estado de Mato Grosso do Sul.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudoplatystoma corruscans 3aPseudoplatystoma reticulatum 3acolor 3afillets 3aflavor 3aham 3ahybrids 3alipid content 3aprotein content 3asensory evaluation 3atechnology 0aFisheries 0afish and fish products 0afish ingredients 0afish preservation and processing 0afish proteins 0afish composition1 aLopes, Ademir Barboza1 aMissio, Mariângela Dal Castel1 aFonseca, Gustavo Graciano0 tJournal of aquatic food product technology.g2021 Jan. 02, v. 30, no. 1 p.76-84dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl47704x1547-06367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10498850.2020.18556893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02142naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245015100172300001400323520094700337592002801284650000801312650002201320650002701342650001601369650001001385650001701395650002301412650001101435650000701446650003301453650001401486700002901500700002301529773008901552856008301641990002301724852000901747655001201756IND60094570220221123004223.0141104e20110815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009457022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.desal.2011.04.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdlan, Mohd Nordin10aOptimization of coagulation and dissolved air flotation (DAF) treatment of semi-aerobic landfill leachate using response surface methodology (RSM)  ap. 74-82.  aFeCl₃ coagulation and dissolved air flotation (DAF) were combined to assess the success of these techniques for the treatment of semiaerobic landfill leachate. Treatment parameters (i.e.; flow rate, coagulant dosage, pH and injection time) were optimized via response surface methodology (RSM) using central composite design (CCD) to yield the maximum removal of turbidity, chemical oxygen demand (COD), color and ammonia nitrogen (NH₃-N). Model-determined optimum conditions were tested to confirm the predicted results. Initial concentrations of turbidity (259FAU), COD (2010mg/L), color (4000PtCo) and NH₃-N (1975mg/L) were reduced by 50%, 75%, 93% and 41%, respectively. These experimental results were consistent with those predicted by the model. The optimum operating conditions for coagulation and DAF were 599.22mg/L of FeCl₃ at pH 4.76 followed with saturator pressure of 600kPa, flow rate 6L/min and injection time of 101s.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aammonium nitrogen 3achemical oxygen demand 3acoagulation 3acolor 3adesalination 3alandfill leachates 3amodels 3apH 3aresponse surface methodology 3aturbidity1 aPalaniandy, Puganeshwary1 aAziz, Hamidi Abdul0 tDesalination.g2011 Aug. 15, v. 277, no. 1-3 p.74-82dElsevier B.V.x0011-91647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.desal.2011.04.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02560naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001800171245007700189300001600266520139200282592002801674650001301702650001201715650001401727650001101741650001701752650001501769650001401784650002501798650001301823650001201836650001601848650002401864650002001888650001701908700003101925700002201956773009601978856005502074852000902129655001202138IND4472260720221120090348.0120302e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447226072DNAL7 a216759672pmid7 a10.1111/j.1745-6584.2011.00832.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Lumeng10aConservative Models: Parametric Entropy vs. Temporal Entropy in Outcomes  ap. 199-206.  aThe geologic architecture in aquifer systems affects the behavior of fluid flow and the dispersion of mass. The spatial distribution and connectivity of higher‐permeability facies play an important role. Models that represent this geologic structure have reduced entropy in the spatial distribution of permeability relative to models without structure. The literature shows that the stochastic model with the greatest variance in the distribution of predictions (i.e., the most conservative model) will not simply be the model representing maximum disorder in the permeability field. This principle is further explored using the Shannon entropy as a single metric to quantify and compare model parametric spatial disorder to the temporal distribution of mass residence times in model predictions. The principle is most pronounced when geologic structure manifests as preferential‐flow pathways through the system via connected high‐permeability sediments. As per percolation theory, at certain volume fractions the full connectivity of the high‐permeability sediments will not be represented unless the model is three‐dimensional. At these volume fractions, two‐dimensional models can profoundly underrepresent the entropy in the real, three‐dimensional, aquifer system. Thus to be conservative, stochastic models must be three‐dimensional and include geologic structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3aentropy 3amass flow 3amodels 3apermeability 3aprediction 3asediments 3astochastic processes 3avariance 2aEntropy 2aGroundwater 2aModels, Theoretical 2aWater Movements 2aWater Supply1 aRitzi, Robert W., Jr.cJr.1 aRamanathan, Ramya0 tGround water.g2012 Mar., v. 50, no. 2 p.199-206dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0017-467X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6584.2011.00832.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02920naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245012700165300002000292520167900312592002801991650001302019650001102032650001402043650001202057650001202069650001702081650001302098650001302111650001502124650002902139700001602168700001702184700005902201700005002260773013102310856008402441852000902525655001202534IND60659467020221119165932.0190823e20190718xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065946702DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.9b020922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Ruilin10aStep-Wise Assessment and Optimization of Sample Handling Recovery Yield for Nanoproteomic Analysis of 1000 Mammalian Cells  ap. 10395-10400.  aProtein and peptide adhesion is a major factor contributing to sample loss during proteomic sample preparation workflows. Sample loss often has detrimental effects on the quality of proteomic analysis by compromising protein identification and data reproducibility. When starting with a low sample amount, only the most abundant proteins can be identified, which often offers little insights for biological research. Although the general idea about severe sample loss from low amount of starting material is widely presumed in the proteomics field, quantitative assessment on the impact of sample loss has been poorly investigated. In the present study, we have quantitatively assessed sample loss during each step of a conventional in-solution sample preparation workflow using bicinchoninic acid (BCA) and targeted LC/MS/MS protein and peptide assays. According to our assessment, for starting materials of ∼1000 mammalian cells, surface adhesion, along with desalting and speed-vacuum drying steps, all contribute heavily to sample loss, in particular for low-abundance proteins. With this knowledge, we have adapted slippery liquid infused porous surface (SLIPS) treatment, commercial LoBind tubes, and in-line desalting during sample processing. With these improvements, we were able to use a conventional in-solution sample handling method to identify on average 829 proteins with 1000 U2OS osteosarcoma cells (∼100 ng) with 75-min LC/MS/MS runs, an 11-fold increase in protein identification. Our optimized in-solution workflow is straightforward and also much less equipment- and technique-demanding than other advanced sample preparation protocols in the field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3adrying 3aequipment 3aliquids 3amammals 3aosteosarcoma 3apeptides 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3atandem mass spectrometry1 aXing, Sansi1 aBadv, Maryam1 aDidar, Tohid F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8757-80021 aLu, Yu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4522-68230 tAnalytical chemistry.g2019 July 18, v. 91, no. 16 p.10395-10400dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.9b020923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02531naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245015000171300001400321520097700335592002801312650002301340650002301363650002601386650001301412650002301425650001801448650001701466650001301483650001801496650001401514650001901528653002301547653001201570653003601582653003101618700005001649700001601699700001701715700001301732700001701745700001801762700001501780700001401795700001601809773010401825856008701929852000902016655001202025IND60629277320221119020702.0190409e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062927732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2019.01.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Xuejiao10aAmmonium transformed into nitrous oxide via nitric oxide by Pseudomonas putida Y-9 under aerobic conditions without hydroxylamine as intermediate  ap. 87-93.  aPrevious studies have reported that hydroxylamine (NH2OH) is an inevitable intermediate of the ammonium (NH4+) oxidation pathway under aerobic conditions. In this study, Pseudomonas putida Y-9 was found to oxidize ammonium into N2O via NO without the accumulation of NH2OH and NO2− under aerobic conditions. NH2OH was nearly completely transformed into NO2− whether NH4+ was present in the medium, and NH4+ could accelerate the transformation of NH2OH to NO2− by promoting Y-9 growth. NH4+ was oxidized rapidly by Y-9 with or without the presence of NH2OH in the medium, and the decrease of total nitrogen reached 30.65 mg/L and 39.38 mg/L, respectively, which indicates that NH2OH inhibits the transformation efficiency of NH4+ to N2O. Gene amplification and enzyme assays demonstrated that ammonia monooxygenase doesn’t exist in Y-9. All results show that NH4+ can be transformed into N2O via NO by Y-9 under aerobic conditions without NH2OH as intermediate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas putida 3aaerobic conditions 3aammonia monooxygenase 3aammonium 3agene amplification 3ahydroxylamine 3anitric oxide 3anitrites 3anitrous oxide 3aoxidation 3atotal nitrogen 0aPseudomonas putida 0aAerobic 0aHydroxylamine transform pathway 0aAmmonium oxidation pathway1 aXu, Yi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1355-00551 aHe, Tengxia1 aJia, Hongjie1 aFeng, Mi1 aXiang, Shudi1 aWang, Shutong1 aNi, Jiupai1 aXie, Deti1 aLi, Zhenlun0 tBioresource technology.g2019 Apr., v. 277 p.87-93dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2019.01.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03634naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245011000173300001400283500001900297520208200316592002802398650002102426650001402447650002602461650001502487650001302502650001702515650001002532650000902542650001102551650002302562650002802585650001002613650001602623650002602639650001502665650001002680650001202690650002102702650000902723653001202732653001502744653002202759653001302781700002302794700001902817700002502836773013702861856008502998852000903083655001203092IND60722420720221119211457.0210102e20210102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072242072DNAL7 a10.1080/10498850.2020.18562602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLelwela, G.K.T.N.10aEffect of Selected Wood Smoke on Physicochemical and Sensory Qualities of Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus)  ap. 85-94.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDifferent preservation and processing techniques have been used to extend the shelf life of fish. Smoking is a technique that enhances the flavor, color, texture, and shelf life of fish. This study was conducted to identify specific smoking conditions for tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), while comparing the physicochemical and sensory qualities of tilapia smoked using selected wood smokes. Tilapia fillets of the same thickness were obtained, and trials were conducted to identify the best brine concentration, temperature/time combination, and wood material. The fillets were immersed in brine containing 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0, and 12.5% (w/v) NaCl for 1 hour. Then, fillets were smoked with wood smoke at three different temperatures (50, 60, and 70°C) and three drying times (3, 4, and 5 hours) using a smoking oven. Based on the selected temperature/time combinations, tilapia were smoked using mahogany, cinnamon, or their combination (1:1). Final products were vacuum-packed and stored at 4°C for analysis. Quality changes in sensory attributes were tested by 30 untrained panelists. Microbial quality (Salmonella, Escherichia coli, and total plate count), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances assay, and color were determined during 21 days of chilled storage, and proximate analysis was conducted. Fish brined in 10% (w/v) NaCl and smoked at 60°C for 4 hours using mahogany: cinnamon at 1:1 had the best sensory qualities (p < .05). Microbial counts and lipid oxidation were within the permitted levels, while no Escherichia coli and Salmonella sp. were observed. During the chilled storage, an increase in lightness (40.85 ± 0.32 to 42.02 ± 1.22) was observed, whereas the redness (8.86 ± 0.69 to 6.84 ± 0.11) was decreased. In conclusion, immersing tilapia fillets in brine containing 10% (w/v) NaCl followed by smoking at 60°C for 4 hours using mahogany: cinnamon at 1:1 can be considered as the best conditions to produce smoked tilapia. However, further studies need to be done to compare the chemical changes that occurred due to smoking.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aMeliaceae 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aSalmonella 3acinnamon 3acold storage 3acolor 3afish 3aflavor 3alipid peroxidation 3amicrobiological quality 3aovens 3aplate count 3aproximate composition 3ashelf life 3asmoke 3atexture 3avacuum packaging 3awood 0aTilapia 0awood smoke 0asensory qualities 0aMahogany1 aWijesinghe, S.K.D.1 aHimali, S.M.C.1 aAbeyrathne, E.D.N.S.0 tJournal of aquatic food product technology.g2021 Jan. 02, v. 30, no. 1 p.85-94dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl47704x1547-06367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10498850.2020.18562603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02542naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245012900166300001400295520134700309592002801656650002301684650001701707650001201724650002401736650001201760650002401772650001201796700001601808700001801824700002101842700001701863700002301880700002001903700001701923773008901940856008302029990002302112852000902135655001202144IND60094570320221122221648.0141104e20110815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009457032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.desal.2011.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJung, Da Hee10aSimulation of forward osmosis membrane process: Effect of membrane orientation and flow direction of feed and draw solutions  ap. 83-91.  aPerformance of forward osmosis (FO) process is significantly affected by factors such as membrane properties, concentration polarization (CP), and fouling. In this study, FO performance of a plate and frame type membrane is investigated via a numerical simulation based on mass conservation theorem. To evaluate the FO membrane performance, permeate flux and recovery rate are simulated according to membrane orientation, flow direction of feed and draw solutions, flow rate, and solute resistivity (K). In the case of membrane orientation, all-inside case, in which the draw solution faces the active layer, displays a relatively higher performance than all-outside and all-up cases. Notably, the membrane performance is highly affected by K indicating the extent of the internal CP. During the simulation approach, the spatial variation of the concentration profile was observed on a 2-dimensional membrane area; it was expected to cause a high diffusion load on a particular area of membrane, due to the relatively higher flux at that location. Moreover, it can result in unexpected fouling in a specific area on a membrane. Accordingly, the findings in this study suggest that the numerical simulation can be applied to optimize both physical properties and operation conditions, thereby ensuring cost-effective operation of FO processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acost effectiveness 3adesalination 3afouling 3amathematical models 3aosmosis 3aphysical properties 3asolutes1 aLee, Jijung1 aKim, Do-yeon,1 aLee, Young-Geun,1 aPark, Minkyu1 aLee, S.q(Sangho),1 aYang, Dae Ryook1 aKim, Joon Ha0 tDesalination.g2011 Aug. 15, v. 277, no. 1-3 p.83-91dElsevier B.V.x0011-91647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.desal.2011.04.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02541naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245014800161300001600309520117700325592002801502650001501530650001401545650001601559650002201575650001701597650001101614650001301625650001701638650001201655650002201667650001001689650001601699650001501715651001001730653001801740653001601758653001101774653001901785653002101804700001501825700002001840700002801860773008401888856007801972852000902050655001202059IND60128296120221122221843.0151115e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012829612DNAL7 a10.3106/041.039.04062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHill, David A.10aInfluence of Trap Environment on the Effectiveness of an Acoustic Lure for Capturing Vespertilionid Bats in two Temperate Forest Zones in Japan  ap. 229-236.  aBats that typically forage in the forest understorey can be difficult to capture using mist nets or harp traps alone. We assessed the effectiveness of an ultrasonic lure for increasing capture rates of vespertilionid bats in two forest zones in Japan. One sequence of stimuli was modelled on social calls of four species that typically forage in narrow-space; the other on those of four species that forage along edges and in forest gaps. The lure increased capture rates by 24.5 times in cool temperate deciduous forest in Hokkaido, and 9.75 times in warm temperate evergreen rain forest in Yakushima, compared with the control condition. Narrow-space foraging bats of the genus Murina dominated the catch at both sites and were caught most frequently when the trap was located in the cluttered environment of the forest understorey. There was no significant effect of call type on capture rate. The lure is an effective method for increasing capture rates of bats and particularly for narrow-space foraging species within the forest, which are otherwise difficult to catch. Acoustic lures have great potential for enhancing study and survey capabilities for forest bats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChiroptera 3aacoustics 3acanopy gaps 3adeciduous forests 3aedge effects 3aforage 3aforaging 3arain forests 3asurveys 3atemperate forests 3atraps 3aultrasonics 3aunderstory 3aJapan 0aacoustic lure 0aforest bats 0aMurina 0asurvey methods 0aVespertilionidae1 aFukui, Dai1 aAgetsuma, Naoki1 aMacintosh, Andrew J.

Such circulation of resistance genes constitutes a latent public health hazard. The aim of this study was to characterize the variable region of the class 1 integron and relate its genetic content to resistance patterns observed in antimicrobial-resistant Escherichia coli isolated from the surface waters of Patos Lagoon, Southern Brazil. Genetic diversity of the isolates and presence of the qacEΔ1 gene, which confers resistance to quaternary ammonium compounds, were also investigated. A total of 27 isolates were analyzed. The variable region harbored dfrA17, dfrA1 and dfrA12 genes, which confer resistance to trimethoprim, and aadA1, aadA5 and aadA22 genes that encode resistance to streptomycin/spectinomycin. Most of the isolates were considered resistant to quaternary ammonium compounds and all of them carried the qacEΔ1 gene at the 3′ conserved segment of the integron. ERIC-PCR analyses of E. coli isolates that presented the integrons showed great genetic diversity, indicating diverse sources of contamination in this environment. These results suggest that fecal bacteria with class 1 integrons in aquatic environments are potentially important reservoirs of antibiotic-resistance genes and may transfer these elements to other bacteria that are capable of infecting humans.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aantibiotic resistance 3aaquatic environment 3abacteria 3agenetic variation 3ahealth hazards 3ahumans 3ainterspersed repetitive sequences 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apublic health 3aquaternary ammonium compounds 3aresistance genes 3aspectinomycin 3astreptomycin 3asurface water 3atrimethoprim 3aBrazil 0aAntibiotic resistance 0aClass 1 integron 0aSuperficial water 0aEscherichia coli1 aMeneghetti, Karine Lena1 ade Almeida, Clara Ponzi1 ada Rosa Bastos, Marina1 aOtton, Letícia Muner1 aCorção, Gertrudes0 tBrazilian journal of microbiology.g2016 Apr.,  June, v. 47, no. 2 p.337-344dElsevier Editora Ltda.aSociedade Brasileira de MicrobiologiawJournal:23437x1517-83827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bjm.2016.01.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02598naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245015900166300001400325520108200339592002801421650001501449650001201464650001201476650001501488650002501503650001701528650001201545650001201557650001501569650001901584650001501603650002101618653001501639653006601654653002901720653004101749653002001790700001801810700002201828700002901850700001701879700002001896773010401916856008702020852000902107655001202116IND60629277620221119020724.0201111e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062927762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2019.01.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Tao10aSemi-hydrolysate of paper pulp without pretreatment enables a consolidated fermentation system with in situ product recovery for the production of butanol  ap. 57-65.  aUtilization of lignocellulosic biomasses for biobutanol fermentation usually requires costly processes of pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis. In this study, paper pulp (93.2% glucan) was used as a starting biomass material to produce biobutanol. We conducted enzymatic semi-hydrolysis of paper pulp without pretreatment and with low enzyme loading, which produced high concentrations of cellobiose (13.9 g L⁻¹) and glucose (21.3 g L⁻¹). In addition, efficient fermentation of the semi-hydrolysate was achieved similar to that with the use of commercial sugars without inhibitors. Finally, we designed a novel non-isothermal simultaneous saccharification and fermentation with in situ butanol recovery, which was composed of a repeated semi-hydrolysis process and successive butanol-extractive fermentation process under the respective optimal conditions. The consolidated system improved butanol production, butanol yields, and butanol productivities and enabled repeated use of medium when compared with other integrated hydrolysis and fermentation processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiobutanol 3abiomass 3abutanol 3acellobiose 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3afermentation 3aglucans 3aglucose 3ahydrolysis 3alignocellulose 3apaper pulp 3asaccharification 0aPaper pulp 0aNon-isothermal simultaneous saccharification and fermentation 0aIn situ butanol recovery 0aAcetone-butanol-ethanol fermentation 0aSemi-hydrolysis1 aYasuda, Kento1 aTashiro, Yukihiro1 aDarmayanti, Rizki Fitria1 aSakai, Kenji1 aSonomoto, Kenji0 tBioresource technology.g2019 Apr., v. 278 p.57-65dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2019.01.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02660naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245012000172300001600292520128100308592002801589650001601617650001601633650002001649650001001669650001501679650002201694650003501716651001701751651001301768653001901781653002301800653003301823653001401856653002201870653001701892700002301909700002001932700002401952700002101976773012301997856008502120852000902205655001202214IND60469394220221120103703.0151218e20150902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046939422DNAL7 a10.1080/01650521.2015.10993792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarín, Mario A.10aDifferences in butterfly (Nymphalidae) diversity between hillsides and hilltop forest patches in the northern Andes  ap. 194-203.  aAndean montane butterflies have unique diversity patterns in each mountain system, and the knowledge on how their community diversity changes at local scale has potential important implications on designing regional conservation strategies. The multiplicative partition of the diversity and the effective number of species provides a useful tool in studying the patterns of diversity in heterogeneous Andean cloud forest habitats. Here, we evaluated diversity in three nearby sites in the Andean Central Cordillera of Colombia, two hillsides – on western (Cauca canyon) and eastern (Aburrá valley) slopes – and one hilltop. We collected a total of 1039 individuals belonging to 55 species of butterflies. Alpha diversity differs between hillsides and the hilltop. Beta diversity in the three areas show differences in richness (q0) and in diversity of the order of magnitude of q1 and q2, with the major differences between hillsides and hilltop. This study shows important differences in butterfly (Nymphalidae) assemblages on a local scale, and suggests that any efforts directed towards comprehensive protection of a given area in a heterogeneous mountain landscape must be focused on the complete forested area, not being limited to a hilltop or to a single hillside.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNymphalidae 3abutterflies 3aforest habitats 3ahills 3alandscapes 3aspecies diversity 3atropical montane cloud forests 3aAndes region 3aColombia 0abeta diversity 0aAndes conservation 0aeffective numbers of species 0aMedellín 0aperi-urban forest 0aPronophilina1 aGiraldo, Carlos E.1 aMarín, Alba L.1 aÁlvarez, Carlos F.1 aPyrcz, Tomasz W.0 tStudies on neotropical fauna and environment.g2015 Sept. 2, v. 50, no. 3 p.194-203dTaylor & Francisx1744-51407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01650521.2015.10993793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02014naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245011900170300001600289520094300305592002801248650001201276650002201288650001701310650001401327650001201341650001801353650001101371650001501382650001201397700001801409700001901427773009101446856008301537990002301620852000901643655001201652IND60094570620221123004122.0141104e20110815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009457062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.desal.2011.04.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShirazian, Saeed10aSupercritical extraction of organic solutes from aqueous solutions by means of membrane contactors: CFD simulation  ap. 135-140.  aThis work presents mass transfer modeling of solvent extraction by means of membrane contactors. Model was based on solving conservation equations for solutes in the membrane contactor. The system considered here was a polymeric membrane contactor, an aqueous solution of ethanol or acetone, and a dense solvent. The equations of the model were solved by numerical method using CFD techniques. The simulation results for ethanol and acetone showed an average deviation of 15.6% and 2.5% with the experimental data, respectively. Simulation results indicated that the extraction of acetone is higher than ethanol due to higher solubility of acetone in the solvent. The simulation results revealed that decreasing feed velocity and increasing solvent velocity increase solute removal. The developed mass transfer model is more accurate than other models and represents a general approach for simulation of membrane-based solvent extraction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetone 3aaqueous solutions 3adesalination 3aequations 3aethanol 3amass transfer 3amodels 3asolubility 3asolutes1 aMarjani, Azam1 aFadaei, Farzad0 tDesalination.g2011 Aug. 15, v. 277, no. 1-3 p.135-140dElsevier B.V.x0011-91647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.desal.2011.04.0113Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle04125naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245012400167300001800291520190900309592002802218596006602246596006602312650002602378650002102404650001102425650001902436650002502455650001702480650002002497650001702517650001502534650001902549650001302568650001902581650000902600650002002609650003102629650001002660650002102670650002202691650001502713650001702728650001502745650000902760650001302769650001702782650002402799650000702823650001502830650001502845650002202860650002402882650002502906650002602931650003202957650001102989700002703000700002903027700002703056700002903083700006703112773014503179856008203324852000903406655001203415IND60632744620221123032725.0190316e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063274462DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-019-09621-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAngulo, Miriam10aProbiotic effects of marine Debaryomyces hansenii CBS 8339 on innate immune and antioxidant parameters in newborn goats  ap. 2339-2352.  aSeveral marine Debaryomyces hansenii strains have shown probiotic effects on aquatic animals, and D. hansenii-derived β-glucans have recently provided immunostimulant effects on goat leukocytes. This study assessed the probiotic effects of live yeast D. hansenii CBS 8339 on newborn goats administered orally, and subsequently challenged in vitro with Escherichia coli. D. hansenii CBS 8339 demonstrated the capacity to survive gastrointestinal tract conditions (bile salts and acid pH tolerance) and adhere to goat intestine. Twelve Saanen × Nubian crossbred newborn goats (2.9 ± 0.47 kg) were fed with a controlled diet or D. hansenii (0.7 g/kg body weight per day)–supplemented milk for 30 days. Blood samples of newborn goats were taken at days 15 and 30, and peripheral blood leukocytes were isolated for bacterial challenge, and immunological and antioxidant analyses. Despite cell viability was higher in leukocytes of goat kids fed with the yeast supplement, protection against E. coli challenge was not significantly affected. On the other hand, at day 15, oral administration of D. hansenii enhanced respiratory burst and catalase activity and increased superoxide dismutase activity after challenge. In contrast, at day 30, administration of the yeast supplement increased peroxidase activity and enhanced nitric oxide production and catalase activity after challenge. Finally, the yeast-supplemented diet upregulated the expression of the receptor genes TLR (2, 4, 6), modulator genes Raf.1, Syk, and Myd88, transcription factor gene AP-1, and cytokine genes IL-1β and TNF-α only at day 15 in leukocytes from unchallenged goat kids. These results demonstrated that a short time (15 days) of orally administering the probiotic D. hansenii CBS 8339 to newborn goats stimulated innate immune and antioxidant parameters and the expression of immune-related gene signaling pathways.  aPublisher supplied data  aINFR-2014-01/225924cConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog?a  aPDCPN2014-01/248033cConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog?a 3aDebaryomyces hansenii 3aEscherichia coli 3aSaanen 3aanimal feeding 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aaquatic animals 3abeta-glucans 3abile salts 3ablood sampling 3acatalase 3acell viability 3adiet 3aenzyme activity 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aimmunostimulants 3ainterleukin-1beta 3aintestines 3akids (goats) 3aleukocytes 3amilk 3aneonates 3anitric oxide 3aoral administration 3apH 3aperoxidase 3aprobiotics 3arespiratory burst 3asignal transduction 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atranscription factors 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3ayeasts1 aReyes-Becerril, Martha1 aCepeda Palacios, Ramón,1 aTovar-Ramírez, Dariel1 aEsteban, María Ángeles1 aAngulo Valdés, Carlos,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7965-16790 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2019 Mar., v. 103, no. 5 p.2339-2352dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-019-09621-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03049naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245013900176300001600315520143600331536012201767592002801889650001601917650002601933650001301959650001901972650002801991650001702019650000902036650000702045650001302052651001302065653002102078653002702099653002802126653002002154653001802174700002002192700002402212700002602236700002102262700002002283700002202303700001902325773011602344856008602460852000902546655001202555IND60782311620221116155948.0220707e20220701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078231162DNAL7 a10.1080/01490451.2022.20603842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerháčová, Zuzana10aDynamics of the Galionella spp. and Leptothrix spp. Communities of Polluted Mine Drainage Water in Slovinky and Markušovce (Slovakia)  ap. 597-605.  aTailings ponds Slovinky and Markušovce (Slovakia) belong to the group of high-risk areas threatening human health and the environment due to the high concentrations of potentially toxic elements. The aim of this study was to identify iron bacteria living in these extreme environments and to assess the impact of selected physicochemical parameters of drainage water, flowing from tailings ponds, on the dynamics of their population. The material deposited on the Slovinky and Markušovce tailings pond showed a circumneutral pH. The values of electrical conductivity and total dissolved solids were significantly higher in drainage water in Slovinky compared to Markušovce. The concentration of total iron was notably higher in drainage water in Markušovce than in Slovinky. Direct microscopic observations showed the presence of iron-oxidizing bacteria as Gallionella spp. and Leptothix spp. exhibiting significant seasonal changes in their prevalence. The differences in the environmental characteristics of drainage waters did not affect the dynamics of iron-oxidizing bacteria populations, but cultivable heterotrophic bacterial community showed significantly lower abundance in Markušovce drainage water. The findings contribute to the understanding of bacterial diversity in neutral mine drainage waters and demonstrate an important role of environmental factors in shaping the microbial population in mine environments.  aThis work was supported in part by grants provided H2020-MSCA-RISE-2016-CHARMED 336 under Grant Agreement No. 734684.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGallionella 3abacterial communities 3adrainage 3adrainage water 3aelectrical conductivity 3ahuman health 3airon 3apH 3atoxicity 3aSlovakia 0aGallionella spp. 0aheterotrophic bacteria 0airon-oxidizing bacteria 0aLeptothrix spp. 0atailings pond1 aPristaš, Peter1 aTrnková, Katarína1 aPrepilková, Veronika1 aSchwarz, Marián1 aJankech, Andrej1 aKvasnová, Simona1 aKisková, Jana0 tGeomicrobiology journal.g2022 July 1, v. 39, no. 7 p.597-605dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12314x1521-05297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01490451.2022.20603843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01739naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245012600164300001800290520064400308592002800952650001500980650001600995650001901011650001601030650001301046650001301059650001701072651001001089700001301099700001401112700001401126700001701140773012901157856008201286852000901368655001201377IND60637749820221120122916.0190424e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063774982DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-019-06268-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Kaili10aFirst report of sparganosis manifested by pleuritis and decreased peripheral blood eosinophils in Jiangsu province, China  ap. 1653-1656.  aSparganosis is a parasitic infection caused by the metacestode stage of Spirometra mansoni and some other related diphyllobothriidean cestodes.

The goal of the present work was to study the feasibility of a biohydrometallurgical approach for the processing of Kajaran porphyry copper-molybdenum ore as no attempt was done previously for microbiological processing of the mentioned ore. Sulfide and oxide ore samples used for bioleaching tests contained 0.63 and 0.77% copper, 1.81 and 1.55% iron, and 0.14 and 0.023% molybdenum, respectively. The experiments were carried out in 250 ml flasks under shaking conditions. Indigenous and adapted bacterial consortia ‘Kashen’ and ‘Kavart’ were used for bioleaching of ore samples. The objectives of the study were to investigate the influence of particle size (PS), pulp density (PD), and adaptation of the bacterial cultures to the process of copper extraction. The composition of feed material and leaching residues from bioleaching experiments were characterized by geochemical, mineralogical, and particle analyses. As a result, nearly complete bioleaching of the sulfide and oxide ores could be achieved after the optimization of the experiments. The particle analyses showed an enhanced liberation of chalcopyrite particles out of the intergrown ore under bioleaching conditions compared to the abiotic controls and hence an improved Cu solubilization under bioleaching conditions.  aPublisher supplied data  aFEMS-GO-2018-136 3abioleaching 3acopper 3aenvironmental impact 3afeed composition 3airon 3amolybdenum 3aparticle size 3apulp 3asolubilization 3asulfides 0aPorphyry copper ore 0asulfide and oxide ores 0acopper extraction 0aconsortia of bacteria 0amineral liberation analysis1 aKhachatryan, A.

Besides keeping this biomass in the field, it can be used as a feedstock in thermochemical or biochemical conversion processes. This makes feasible its incorporation in a biorefinery, whose economic profitability could be supported by integrated production of low-value biofuels and high-value chemicals, e.g., xylitol, which has important industrial and clinical applications. Herein, biotechnological production of xylitol is presented as a possible route for the valorization of sugarcane straw and its incorporation in a biorefinery. Nutritional supplementation of the sugarcane straw hemicellulosic hydrolyzate as a function of initial oxygen availability was studied in batch fermentation of Candida guilliermondii FTI 20037. The nutritional supplementation conditions evaluated were: no supplementation; supplementation with (NH4)2SO4, and full supplementation with (NH4)2SO4, rice bran extract and CaCl2·2H2O. Experiments were performed at pH 5.5, 30°C, 200rpm, for 48h in 125mL Erlenmeyer flasks containing either 25 or 50mL of medium in order to vary initial oxygen availability. Without supplementation, complete consumption of glucose and partial consumption of xylose were observed. In this condition the maximum xylitol yield (0.67gg⁻¹) was obtained under reduced initial oxygen availability. Nutritional supplementation increased xylose consumption and xylitol production by up to 200% and 240%, respectively. The maximum xylitol volumetric productivity (0.34gL⁻¹h⁻¹) was reached at full supplementation and increased initial oxygen availability. The results demonstrated a combined effect of nutritional supplementation and initial oxygen availability on xylitol production from sugarcane straw hemicellulosic hydrolyzate.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMeyerozyma guilliermondii 3aammonium sulfate 3abatch fermentation 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3abiorefining 3acalcium chloride 3adietary supplements 3afeedstocks 3aglucose 3ahydrolysates 3alignocellulose 3amicrobiology 3aoxygen 3apH 3aprofitability 3arice bran oil 3astraw 3asugarcane 3axylitol 3axylose 3aBrazil 0aSugarcane straw 0aHemicellulosic hydrolyzate 0aXylitol 0aNutritional supplementation 0aInitial oxygen availability1 ade Arruda, Priscila Vaz1 aFelipe, Maria das Graças de Almeida0 tBrazilian journal of microbiology.g2016 Apr.,  June, v. 47, no. 2 p.489-496dElsevier Editora Ltda.aSociedade Brasileira de MicrobiologiawJournal:23437x1517-83827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bjm.2016.01.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02680naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245008100165300001600246520107100262536022001333592002801553596001901581596001301600650001801613650001801631650002201649650001901671650001901690650001901709650001001728650001501738650001601753650001901769653002401788653003301812653002601845653001801871653001001889700001601899700001901915700001701934700001601951773013601967856008602103852000902189655001202198IND60782311920221116160113.0220809e20220705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078231192DNAL7 a10.1080/02773813.2022.20706462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiu, Yang10aPreparation of fluorine-free and stable superhydrophobic paper for packaging  ap. 222-234.  aWrapping paper has an irreplaceable role in the food industry, but the high hydrophilicity of cellulose-based wrapping paper limits its application. Here, we aim to develop a fluorine-free and stable method for preparing the superhydrophobic cellulose-based paper using KH570-modified-n-TiO₂ and ε-polylysine (ε-PL) to construct a superhydrophobic surface by layer-by-layer self-assembly. The paper modified by (ε-PL/KH570-modified-n-TiO₂)₄ multilayers has superhydrophobic and self-cleaning properties after heat treatment. The water contact angle reaches up to 152.8° and the antibacterial rate is close to 100%. The high barrier properties to water vapor better prolong the shelf life of cherries. Therefore, the (ε-PL/KH570-modified-n-TiO₂)₄ multilayers modified paper can provide a new idea for food preservation. The advantage of the double-layer assembly is that even if the superhydrophobic layer of the wrapper is worn away and lost, the remaining ε-PL is still able to act as a bacterial inhibitor, ensuring that the food is not perishable.  aThis work was supported by the National Key Research & Development Plan for the ‘13th Five-year Plan of China’ (Grant No.2017YFD0600804) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 31470605).  aPublisher supplied data  a2017YFD0600804  a31470605 3acontact angle 3afood industry 3afood preservation 3aheat treatment 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3apaper 3ashelf life 3awater vapor 3awood chemistry 0aSuperhydrophobicity 0alayer-by-layer self-assembly 0anano titanium dioxide 0aε-polylysine 0apaper1 aZhang, Zhen1 aLiang, Shuaibo1 aMiao, Yaning1 aYao, Chunli0 tJournal of wood chemistry and technology.g2022 July 5, v. 42, no. 4 p.222-234dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl33236x1532-23197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02773813.2022.20706463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02823naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002100192245010900213300001600322506007600338520128400414592002801698506003701726650002001763650002101783650001101804650001001815650001501825650001001840650002201850650003301872650001401905650002201919650001201941653002001953653002701973653002202000653002102022653001502043700002402058700002102082700002502103773010702128856008502235852000902320655001202329IND60469394720221207060759.0151218e20151002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046939472DNAL7 a10.1080/21501203.2015.10702132doi7 aPMC61060792pmcid7 a301513222pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurphy, Brian R.10aProfundae diversitas: the uncharted genetic diversity in a newly studied group of fungal root endophytes  ap. 139-150.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEndophytes associated with crops have potential as beneficial inoculants in agriculture, but little is known about their genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships. We carried out the first ever ecological and phylogenetic survey of the culturable fungal root endophytes of a wild barley species. Fungal root endophytes were isolated from 10 populations of wall barley (Hordeum murinum), and 112 taxa of fungi were identified based on internal transcribed spacer sequence similarity. We found representatives from 8 orders, 12 families and 18 genera. Within this group, only 34 isolates (30% of the total) could be confidently assigned to a species, and 23 of the isolates (21% of the total) had no significant match to anything deposited in GenBank (based on <85% sequence similarity). These results suggest a high proportion of novel fungi, with 28% not assigned to a known fungal order. This includes three endophytes that have been shown to significantly improve agronomic traits in cultivated barley. This study has, therefore, revealed a profound diversity of fungal root endophytes in a single wild relative of barley. Extrapolating from this, the study highlights the largely unknown, hugely diverse and potentially useful resource of crop wild relative endophytes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHordeum murinum 3aagronomic traits 3abarley 3acrops 3aendophytes 3afungi 3agenetic variation 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aphylogeny 3asequence homology 3asurveys 0aHordeum murinum 0afungal root endophytes 0agenetic diversity 0abiofertilisation 0abiocontrol1 aMartin Nieto, Lucia1 aDoohan, Fiona M.1 aHodkinson, Trevor R.0 tMycology.g2015 Oct. 2, v. 6, no. 3-4 p.139-150dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000125x2150-12037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21501203.2015.10702133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03203naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245006200168300001600230520170700246592002801953650001301981650002101994650001102015650001202026650001202038650001302050650002402063650001602087650003002103650001302133650001402146650001302160650001302173650002502186650001402211650001502225650001402240650000902254650001702263650001202280650001402292651001102306653002402317653001902341653001402360653002702374700001802401700002102419773011602440856008402556852000902640655001202649IND60535441520221122224457.0190403e20150131xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053544152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2014.09.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhiberto, P.J.10aNutrient leaching in an Ultisol cultivated with sugarcane  ap. 141-149.  aSolute leaching below the crop-rooting zone represents not only a valuable loss of nutrients for the plant, but also a potential pollution source of groundwater. The objective of this work was to quantify nutrient-leaching losses at 0.9m depth in an Ultisol that was cultivated with sugarcane, located in the county of Jaboticabal-SP, Brazil. The following ions were evaluated: nitrite, nitrate, ammonium, sulfate, phosphate, calcium, magnesium and potassium. The first ratoon cycle was monitored from November 16, 2006, to July 9, 2007. The experimental design was organized as four random blocks and three treatments: T1: without fertilizer; T2: 100kgha−1 of N and 114kgha−1 of S; and T3: 150kgha−1 of N and 172kgha−1 of S. To determine the fate of the N-fertilizer and S-fertilizer, four microplots were installed, in which 2.15% atoms of 15N- and 10.5% atoms of 34S-enriched ammonium sulfate were applied. The input and output of anions and cations were quantified from the flux density of water and the ion concentration. The NO3−, K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+ concentrations in the soil increased in January following both rainfall and drainage. The leaching of N was between 3.9 and 34.9kgha−1. The N leached derived from the 100kgha−1 applied N fertilizer was 22.5kgha−1. The S leached was between 4.6 and 8.4kgha−1. From the 114kgha−1 S applied as fertilizer the leaching was 0.480kgha−1. The maximum leaching of P, K, Ca, and Mg were 1.2, 53.6, 135.7 and 39.8kgha−1, respectively. From the results, it is not possible to determine whether the local groundwater will be contaminated, but caution should be taken to maintain soil quality by reducing the leaching loss of nutrients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUltisols 3aammonium sulfate 3aanions 3acalcium 3acations 3adrainage 3aexperimental design 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3aleaching 3amagnesium 3anitrates 3anitrites 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anutrients 3aphosphates 3apotassium 3arain 3asoil quality 3asolutes 3asugarcane 3aBrazil 0a15N and 34S isotope 0aSaccharum spp. 0aPollution 0aSustainable management1 aLibardi, P.L.1 aTrivelin, P.C.O.0 tAgricultural water management.g2015 Jan. 31, v. 148 p.141-149dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2014.09.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02573naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100005400171245012500225300001600350520116700366592002801533650001601561650002701577650001101604650002101615650002001636650002101656650001401677653004601691653003201737653002201769653001401791653003201805653001801837700001301855700001401868700001801882700001501900700001701915773009901932856008702031852000902118655001202127IND50071972720221120231213.0190402e20140515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007197272DNAL7 a244235152pmid7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.11.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiao, Ming1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8389-112510aStructure and physicochemical properties of octenyl succinic esters of sugary maize soluble starch and waxy maize starch  ap. 154-160.  aThe structure and physicochemical properties of octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA) starches prepared from sugary maize (SMSS) and waxy maize (WMS) were studied and compared. The degree of substitution (DS) increased linearly with the amount of OSA, while the DS of OSA-SMSS was higher than that of OSA-WMS using equivalent modification conditions. FT-IR analysis indicated that two characteristic peaks, at 1725 and 1570cm−1, were observed for OSA-starch. The weight-average of the molar mass (Mw) and z-root mean square radius of gyration (Rz) of SMSS increased with increased OSA esterification substitutions, whereas Mw was reduced and Rz was nearly constant for WMS. The zeta-potential and emulsifying activity increased with DS for starch modified with OSA. OSA-SMSS (DS of 0.0192) was the best material for stable oil-in-water emulsion preparation. The increase of DS in OSA-starch resulted in a substantial reduction of RDS content with an accompanying increase of SDS and RS. This study revealed the potential application of OSA-SMSS as a particle stabilizer of oil-in-water emulsion, which would allow encapsulate and protect functional food components.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorn starch 3aemulsifying properties 3aesters 3afunctional foods 3amodified starch 3amolecular weight 3awaxy corn 0aOctenyl succinic anhydride esterification 0aSugary maize soluble starch 0aWaxy maize starch 0aStructure 0aPickering emulsion property 0aDigestibility1 aLi, Rong1 aJiang, Bo1 aCui, Steve W.1 aZhang, Tao1 aJin, Zhengyu0 tFood chemistry.g2014 May 15, v. 151 p.154-160dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.11.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02422naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011500167300001800282500001900300520128000319592002801599650001301627650001101640650001201651650001301663650001301676650001501689650001601704650001101720650001101731650000901742650001601751650001501767700001801782700002001800773011301820856008201933852000902015655001202024IND60722421620221119212713.0210204e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072242162DNAL7 a10.1134/S00978078200601842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhuravin, S.

It is shown that the major changes in the hydrological regime of water bodies have been induced by the weakening of the effect of cryogenic regulation of water exchange in the basin. This can be seen in two processes: an increase in the infiltration of atmospheric precipitation into aeration zone and groundwater and better drainage of groundwater by the hydrographic network. The first process dominates in the initial period, leading to an increase in the share of surface runoff, a rise in groundwater table, i.e., an increase in groundwater inflow into rivers. Later, the contribution of the second process increases, resulting in a decrease in groundwater reserves in the basin and a drop of groundwater table and river runoff in the dry season. The budget of the processes of replenishment and drawdown of groundwater recovers after the cessation of the formation of cryogenic phenomena in the river basin caused by phase transitions in water–ice (snow)–water system. It is very likely that the transformation of these processes is now coming to an end.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaeration 3abasins 3aclimate 3adrainage 3adrawdown 3adry season 3agroundwater 3arivers 3arunoff 3asnow 3awater table 3awatersheds1 aMarkov, M.

On the basis of the platinum(II)-base pair coordination, a novel type of aptameric platform for platinum detection has been introduced. This chemiluminescence (CL) aptasensor consists of a designed streptavidin (SA) aptamer sequence in which several base pairs were replaced by G-G mismatches. Only in the presence of platinum, coordination occurs between the platinum and G-G base pairs as opposed to the hydrogen-bonded G-C base pairs, which leads to SA aptamer sequence activation, resulting in their binding to SA coated magnetic beads. These Pt-DNA coordination events were monitored by a simple and direct luminol-peroxide CL reaction through horseradish peroxidase (HRP) catalysis with a strong chemiluminescence emission. The validated ranges of quantification were 0.12–240 μM with a limit of detection of 60 nM and selectivity over other metal ions. This assay was also successfully used in urine sample determination. It will be a promising candidate for the detection of platinum in biomedical and environmental samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarcinoma 3acatalytic activity 3achemiluminescence 3adetection limit 3adrug therapy 3ahydrogen bonding 3ametal ions 3aoligonucleotides 3aperoxidase 3aplatinum 3astreptavidin 3aurine1 aTian, Xueke1 aSun, Lianli1 aHu, Haihong1 aZheng, Shirui1 aJiang, Huidi1 aYu, Lushan1 aZeng, Su0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2015 Oct. 20, v. 87, no. 20 p.10542-10546dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.analchem.5b028103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03214naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006500148245013200213300001600345520166800361592002802029650001902057650003302076650002002109650001502129650003002144650001602174650002802190650001502218650001702233650002202250650001002272650004302282650001702325650002202342650001402364650001502378650003702393700002202430700002202452700001602474700002602490700002202516773010302538856008202641852000902723655001202732IND60637750320221119235428.0190424e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063775032DNAL7 a10.1007/s00726-019-02715-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarrison, Michelle L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9205-196114aThe additive effect of type 2 diabetes on fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, tryptophan and threonine in people living with HIV  ap. 783-793.  aChronic immune activation and ensuing inflammation that accompany HIV infection lead to adverse metabolic consequences and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). We examined the additive effects of T2D on circulating biomarkers involved in inflammation, coagulation, and vascular function along with plasma amino acids in people living with HIV (PLWH). This cross-sectional study included PLWH with and without T2D (n = 32 total). Analyses involved a multiplex platform for circulating biomarkers and gas chromatography–vacuum ultraviolet spectroscopy for plasma amino acids. In PLWH and T2D, both fibrinogen (2.0 ± 0.6 vs 1.6 ± 0.4 µg/mL, p = 0.02) and von Willebrand factor (vWF) (40.8 ± 17.2 vs 26.7 ± 13.8 µg/mL, p = 0.02) were increased and tryptophan (47 ± 6 vs 53 ± 8 nmol/mL, p = 0.03) and threonine (102 ± 25 vs 125 ± 33 nmol/mL, p = 0.03) were decreased. Fibrinogen, as a biomarker of inflammation, and vWF, as a biomarker of endothelial dysfunction, are augmented by the combined effects of HIV and T2D and may contribute to the pathogenesis of T2D in PLWH. Chronic immune activation and inflammation compromise the integrity of the intestinal mucosa, which increases mucus production. Tryptophan metabolism is altered by a loss of intestinal membrane integrity and threonine is consumed in the production of mucus. Metabolic competition arising from increased protein synthesis in the setting of chronic inflammation along with the associated loss in intestinal membrane integrity may be a primary mechanism in the pathogenesis of T2D in PLWH and requires further investigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHIV infections 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3aadditive effect 3abiomarkers 3ablood coagulation factors 3acoagulation 3across-sectional studies 3afibrinogen 3ainflammation 3aintestinal mucosa 3amucus 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apathogenesis 3aprotein synthesis 3athreonine 3atryptophan 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aWolfe, Anthony S.1 aFordyce, Jonathan1 aRock, Jamie1 aGarcía, Alexandra A.1 aZuñiga, Julie A.0 tAmino acids.g2019 May, v. 51, no. 5 p.783-793dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl52832x0939-44517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00726-019-02715-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02373naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245006100171300001600232520105900248592002801307650001301335650001201348650001401360650002801374650001101402650002501413650002301438650001501461650001901476650001601495650002201511650002501533653001501558653002001573653002701593653001501620653001701635700002601652700001801678700001801696773010501714856008701819852000901906655001201915IND60629278220221119020714.0200128e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062927822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2019.01.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatel, Anil K.10aThermostable cellulases: Current status and perspectives  ap. 385-392.  aIt is envisaged that the utilization of lignocellulosic biomass for ethanol production for transport sector, would make cellulases the most demanded industrial enzyme. The greatest potential of cellulolytic enzymes lies in ethanol production from biomass by enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose but low thermostability and low titer of cellulase production resulting into high cost of the enzyme which is the major set-back. A number of research groups are working on cellulase to improve its thermostability so as to be able to perform hydrolysis at elevated temperatures which would eventually increase the efficiency of cellulose hydrolysis. The technologies developed from lignocellulosic biomass via cellulose hydrolysis promise environmental and economical sustainability in the long run along with non-dependence on nonrenewable energy source. This review deals with the important sources of thermostable cellulases, mechanism, its regulation, strategies to enhance the thermostability further with respect to its importance for biofuel applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3acellulose 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aenergy 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aethanol production 3ahydrolysis 3alignocellulose 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3athermostable enzymes 0aCellulases 0aThermostability 0aLignocellulose biomass 0aBioethanol 0aThermophiles1 aSinghania, Reeta Rani1 aSim, Sang Jun1 aPandey, Ashok0 tBioresource technology.g2019 May, v. 279 p.385-392dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2019.01.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01774naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245007600164300001800240500001900258520075300277592002801030650001101058650001201069650001901081650001101100650000901111650000901120650001501129650001001144650001501154700001701169700002201186773011301208856008201321852000901403655001201412IND60722421720221119212558.0210204e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072242172DNAL7 a10.1134/S00978078200600812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKulik, A.

The studies were mostly focused on the water-regime plots in Kalachevsko-Golubinskie and Archedinsko-Donskie sands. The area under study was divided into zones according to sand types based on land relief, the conditions of the soil cover, vegetation, and phreatic-water mineralization and level. Water-balance parameters and the characteristics of water regime were evaluated for individual types of sands. The volume of gravity flow of precipitation into the Don river system was determined. The study suggests the important role of sand massifs in water-resources protection, which consists in water freshening and maintaining river discharges.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3agravity 3amineralization 3arivers 3asand 3asoil 3avegetation 3awater 3awatersheds1 aKulik, K.

Monitoring HER catalyzed by MoS₂ QDs based on a glass nanopore with an electrochemically confined effect was proposed for the first time. MoS₂ QDs inside the glass nanopore is driven toward the orifice of the nanopore and bonded with the Ag nanoparticles (Ag NPs) to form a single nanocomposite. When enough voltage is applied across the orifice, the single Ag NP acts as a single nanoparticle electrode to conduct the electrochemically bipolar reaction on its two extremities. In the process, HER is catalyzed by MoS₂ QDs, and Ag NPs are oxidized at the same time. The appearance of blockages on the elevated ionic current is attributed to the generation of a H₂ bubble. Furthermore, by analyzing the modulations in the ionic current oscillation, the frequency of hydrogen bubble generation that is related to the catalytic efficiency of MoS₂ QDs could be estimated. The results reveal the capability of the glass nanopore for the real-time monitoring electrocatalytic behavior, which makes the glass nanopore an ideal candidate to further reveal the heterogeneity of catalytic capability at the single particle level.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aglass 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3amolybdenum 3amolybdenum disulfide 3amonitoring 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3ananopores 3ananosilver 3aoxidation 3aquantum dots1 aLi, Yuan-Jie1 aZhang, Jian-Fang1 aWang, Yan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1479-17151 aYing, Yi-Lun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6217-256X1 aLong, Yi-Tao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2571-74570 tAnalytical chemistry.g2019 Aug. 02, v. 91, no. 16 p.10361-10365dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.9b023643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02759naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245006600175300001600241520102000257536031401277592002801591596003701619650001401656650002001670650001401690650003201704650002001736650002101756650001501777650000901792650001301801650001301814650001801827650001701845650000901862650001901871653002001890653002001910653002301930653001401953700002101967700002201988700002402010773013602034856008602170852000902256655001202265IND60782312120221116155918.0220809e20220705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078231212DNAL7 a10.1080/02773813.2022.20779662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMendes, Inês S.

The concentration of bisulphite anions decreased almost two-third along the cooking, while the sulphate concentration increased progressively. Of the bisulphite consumed, only a third was converted to sulfates. Unexpectedly, the maximum thiosulphate concentration was found in the pulping acid filling step, being further decreased along the cooking. The chloride ions rise progressively during the cooking being extracted essentially from the wood, although a noticeable part of the phosphate anions belongs to pulping reagents and inlet water. The low molecular weight fraction of lignosulphonates (LS) appeared in the cooking liquor in the residual delignification step and, together with xylonic acid, contributed to an overestimation of the fluoride concentration determined by the IC due to the same retention time in the chromatographic column during the analysis.  aThis work was financially supported by Caima – Indústria de Celulose S.A. within the scope of the PhD project of Inês S.

Water samples and two macrophyte species were collected from the littoral zone of a subtropical Brazilian Reservoir. A lignocellulosic matrix was obtained using aqueous extraction of dried plant material (≈40°C). Incubations for decomposition of the lignocellulosic matrix were prepared using lignocelluloses, inoculums and filtered water simulating different trophic statuses with the same N:P ratio. The particulate organic carbon and dissolved organic carbon (POC and DOC, respectively) were quantified, the cellulase enzymatic activity was measured by releasing reducing sugars and immobilized carbon was analyzed by filtration. During the cellulose degradation indicated by the cellulase activity, the dissolved organic carbon daily rate and enzyme activity increased. It was related to a fast hydrolysable fraction of cellulose that contributed to short-term carbon immobilization (ca. 10 days). After approximately 20 days, the dissolved organic carbon and enzyme activity were inversely correlated suggesting that the respiration of microorganisms was responsible for carbon mineralization. Cellulose was an important resource in low nutrient conditions (oligotrophic). However, the detritus quality played a major role in the lignocelluloses degradation (i.e., enzyme activity) and carbon release.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaquatic ecosystems 3acellulose 3adetritus 3adissolved organic carbon 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aenergy flow 3aenzyme activity 3afiltration 3ahydrolysis 3ainoculum 3alignocellulose 3alittoral zone 3amacrophytes 3amineralization 3anutrient content 3aparticulate organic carbon 3areducing sugars 0aAnaerobic decomposition 0aCellulose 0aCarbon cycle 0aAquatic macrophytes1 aCunha-Santino, Marcela Bianchessi1 aBianchini, Irineu0 tBrazilian journal of microbiology.g2016 Apr.,  June, v. 47, no. 2 p.352-358dElsevier Editora Ltda.aSociedade Brasileira de MicrobiologiawJournal:23437x1517-83827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bjm.2016.01.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02601naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245006500168300001600233520136800249592002801617650001001645650002501655650001001680650001701690650001801707650001701725650001901742650001901761650003001780650001601810650002401826650002101850650001501871650001301886653001201899653001601911653001901927653001501946773011501961856008202076852000902158655001202167IND60716394620221118110203.0201202e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071639462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jgr.2017.04.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Tong-hyŏn,10aGut microbiota-mediated pharmacokinetics of ginseng saponins  ap. 255-263.  aOrally administered ginsengs come in contact with the gut microbiota, and their hydrophilic constituents, such as ginsenosides, are metabolized to hydrophobic compounds by gastric juice and gut microbiota: protopanxadiol-type ginsenosides are mainly transformed into compound K and ginsenoside Rh2; protopanaxatriol-type ginsenosides to ginsenoside Rh1 and protopanaxatriol, and ocotillol-type ginsenosides to ocotillol. Although this metabolizing activity varies between individuals, the metabolism of ginsenosides to compound K by gut microbiota in individuals treated with ginseng is proportional to the area under the blood concentration curve for compound K in their blood samples. These metabolites such as compound K exhibit potent pharmacological effects, such as antitumor, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, antiallergic, and neuroprotective effects compared with the parent ginsenosides, such as Rb1, Rb2, and Re. Therefore, to monitor the potent pharmacological effects of ginseng, a novel probiotic fermentation technology has been developed to produce absorbable and bioactive metabolites. Based on these findings, it is concluded that gut microbiota play an important role in the pharmacological action of orally administered ginseng, and probiotics that can replace gut microbiota can be used in the development of beneficial and bioactive ginsengs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanax 3aanti-allergic agents 3ablood 3afermentation 3agastric juice 3aginsenosides 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aintestinal microorganisms 3ametabolites 3aoral administration 3apharmacokinetics 3aprobiotics 3aresearch 0aginseng 0aginsenoside 0agut microbiota 0ametabolism0 tJournal of Ginseng Research.g2018 July, v. 42, no. 3 p.255-263dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27195x1226-84537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jgr.2017.04.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03292naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002600192245013200218300001600350506007600366520132500442592002801767506003701795650002101832650001401853650002701867650002601894650003001920650002601950650001701976650001701993650001002010650001502020650001802035650001002053650001002063650002802073650003302101650001102134650001602145650002902161650001402190650001802204650001802222650002602240650001202266651001002278653002102288653002502309653003002334653002202364700001602386700002302402700002802425773010702453856008502560852000902645655001202654IND60469395220221207061012.0151218e20151002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046939522DNAL7 a10.1080/21501203.2015.11132072doi7 aPMC61060672pmcid7 a301513272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRao, H.C.

In a survey of endophytic fungal biodiversity, an antimicrobial endophytic strain CLB32 was isolated from the leaf of Combretum latifolium Blume (Combretaceae) from the Western Ghats of Southern India. CLB32 was then identified as Gliomastix polychroma (KR704576) by morphological and phylogenetic analysis based on internal transcribed spacer (ITS) nuclear rDNA and intervening 5.8S rRNA gene. CLB32 here constituted the first report on incidence of endophytic fungi from C. latifolium Blume. Ethyl acetate fraction of strain CLB32 was evaluated for antimicrobial activity by disc diffusion assay. Secondary metabolites produced effectively inhibited methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (18.33 ± 0.33 mm), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14.66 ± 0.33 mm) and Candida albicans (14.00 ± 0.57 mm). Biosynthesis of these antimicrobial compounds was detected by analytical TLC-bioautography method as depicted by zone of inhibition on intensive the band. These findings suggest that G. polychroma CLB32, as a producer of natural antimicrobial drugs, could help to combat against multidrug-resistant infections and also provide baseline information for industrial applications.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCandida albicans 3aCombretum 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aanti-infective properties 3aantibiotic resistance 3abiodiversity 3abiosynthesis 3adrugs 3aendophytes 3aethyl acetate 3afungi 3agenes 3aindustrial applications 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aleaves 3amethicillin 3amultiple drug resistance 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal DNA 3aribosomal RNA 3asecondary metabolites 3asurveys 3aIndia 0aendophytic fungi 0amultidrug resistance 0aantimicrobial metabolites 0aTLC-bioautography1 aBaker, Syed1 aRakshith, Devaraju1 aSatish, Sreedharamurthy0 tMycology.g2015 Oct. 2, v. 6, no. 3-4 p.176-181dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000125x2150-12037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21501203.2015.11132073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03140naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002100191245010900212300002000321506007600341520190200417592002802319506003702347650001002384650001102394650001902405650002102424650001502445650002202460650001102482650000702493700002202500700002402522773011302546856008602659852000902745655001202754IND60530049620221207082030.0160720e20151020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053004962DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.5b028662doi7 aPMC47367402pmcid7 a263750392pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDengler, Adam K.10aMicrofabricated Collector-Generator Electrode Sensor for Measuring Absolute pH and Oxygen Concentrations  ap. 10556-10564.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) has attracted attention for studying in vivo neurotransmission due to its subsecond temporal resolution, selectivity, and sensitivity. Traditional FSCV measurements use background subtraction to isolate changes in the local electrochemical environment, providing detailed information on fluctuations in the concentration of electroactive species. This background subtraction removes information about constant or slowly changing concentrations. However, determination of background concentrations is still important for understanding functioning brain tissue. For example, neural activity is known to consume oxygen and produce carbon dioxide which affects local levels of oxygen and pH. Here, we present a microfabricated microelectrode array which uses FSCV to detect the absolute levels of oxygen and pH in vitro. The sensor is a collector-generator electrode array with carbon microelectrodes spaced 5 μm apart. In this work, a periodic potential step is applied at the generator producing transient local changes in the electrochemical environment. The collector electrode continuously performs FSCV enabling these induced changes in concentration to be recorded with the sensitivity and selectivity of FSCV. A negative potential step applied at the generator produces a transient local pH shift at the collector. The generator-induced pH signal is detected using FSCV at the collector and correlated to absolute solution pH by postcalibration of the anodic peak position. In addition, in oxygenated solutions a negative potential step at the generator produces hydrogen peroxide by reducing oxygen. Hydrogen peroxide is detected with FSCV at the collector electrode, and the magnitude of the oxidative peak is proportional to absolute oxygen concentrations. Oxygen interference on the pH signal is minimal and can be accounted for with a postcalibration.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abrain 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aoxygen 3apH1 aWightman, R.

Ten bacteriophages were isolated from feces of chickens with diarrhea using the ill-chicken intestinal pathogenic E. coli 3-2 as target organism. Three bacteriophages propagated on E. coli 3-2 with relative big and clear plaques were selected and used together for toxicity experiment and evaluating the effect of therapy on chicken weight gain. In 3 weeks of trial, no mice given with or without mixed bacteriophages died, and the weight of mice of the experimental group did not show significant difference to the control group after 3 weeks infection. Besides remarkable decreasing the death rate of chickens with diarrhea, treatment of mixed bacteriophages also promoted the weight gain and saved the diet consumption as the utilize rate of diet increased 11% compared with the control group. These observations indicated that a mixture of three bacteriophages would be biosafe for rapid and effective preventing pathogenic E. coli infections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3abacteriophages 3abiosafety 3achickens 3adiarrhea 3adiet 3afeces 3aindustry 3amice 3amortality 3apathogens 3atherapeutics 3atoxicity 3aweight gain 2aAnimals 2aBiological Therapyxadverse effectsxmethodsxveterinary. 2aChickensxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiology. 2aColiphagesxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aDiarrheaxprevention & controlxtherapyxveterinary. 2aEscherichia coli Infectionsxprevention & controlxtherapyxveterinary. 2aFood Safety 2aHumans 2aMice 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Transmission 2aPoultry Diseasesxprevention & controlxtherapy. 2aWeight Gain1 aMa, Manli,1 aXie, Hui-Jun1 aKong, Jian0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2012 Jan., v. 28, no. 1 p.1-6dSpringer-Verlagx0959-39937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-011-0784-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02709naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002200189245010600211300001800317506007600335520127600411592002801687596006101715506003701776650001701813650002001830650001201850650001601862650000901878650002001887650001401907650001101921650001601932700002201948700001901970700006201989773014502051856008202196852000902278655001202287IND60632745620221207094128.0190316e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063274562DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-018-09610-02doi7 aPMC64204612pmcid7 a306756362pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorkowska, Monika10aRapid micro-assays for amylolytic activities determination: customization and validation of the tests  ap. 2367-2379.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHigh-throughput function-based screening techniques remain the major bottleneck in the novel biocatalysts development pipeline. In the present study, we customized protocols for amylolytic activity determination (Somogyi-Nelson and starch-iodine tests) to micro-volume thermalcycler-based assays (linearity range 60–600 μM of reducing sugar, R² = 0.9855; 0–2 mg/mL of starch, R² = 0.9921, respectively). Exploitation of a thermalcycler enabled rapid and accurate temperature control, further reduction of reagents and samples volumes, and limited evaporation of the reaction mixtures, meeting several crucial requirements of an adequate enzymatic assay. In the optimized micro-volume Somogyi-Nelson protocol, we were able to reduce the time required for high-temperature heating sixfold (down to 5 min) and further increase sensitivity of the assay (tenfold), when compared to the previous MTP-based protocol. The optimized microassays have complementary scope of specificities: micro-starch-iodine test for endoglucanases, micro-Somogyi-Nelson test for exoglucanases. Due to rapid, micro-volume and high-throughput character, the methods can complement toolbox assisting development of novel biocatalysts and analysis of saccharides-containing samples.  aPublisher supplied data  aIP2015 011074cMinisterstwo Nauki i Szkolnictwa Wy?szego0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiocatalysts 3aenzyme activity 3aenzymes 3aevaporation 3aheat 3areducing sugars 3ascreening 3astarch 3atemperature1 aBiałas, Wojciech1 aKubiak, Monika1 aCelińska, Ewelina1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8372-84590 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2019 Mar., v. 103, no. 5 p.2367-2379dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-018-09610-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02586naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245012800169300001600297520139800313592002801711650001901739650001701758650002001775650002401795650001801819650001201837650001001849650001301859650001201872650002001884650002501904650001501929650001601944700002201960773009101982856008302073990002302156852000902179655001202188IND60094571620221122193949.0141104e20110901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009457162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.desal.2011.05.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLing, Ming Ming10aDesalination process using super hydrophilic nanoparticles via forward osmosis integrated with ultrafiltration regeneration  ap. 194-202.  aFor the first time, a potentially sustainable integrated FO–UF (forward osmosis–ultrafiltration) system for water reuse and desalination with the aid of super hydrophilic nanoparticles as draw solutes has been proposed. The system uses an FO membrane as the semi-permeable membrane to reject salts, super hydrophilic nanoparticles as draw solutes to induce water across the FO membrane, and UF membranes to regenerate the draw solutes. For comparison, a magnetic separator was also used to recycle super hydrophilic magnetic nanoparticles but agglomeration was observed. Ultrasonication proved to effectively reduce the size of agglomerated magnetic nanoparticle and the FO performance was partially restored. However, the resultant magnetic properties were weakened under ultrasonic processes and thus jeopardized regeneration efficiency in magnetic fields. The novel FO–UF process was tested for 5 continuous runs for the purpose of desalination without increasing nanoparticle draw solute size or reducing osmotic functionality. UF membranes of small pore diameter and narrow pore size distribution can enhance the recovery efficiency of nanoparticle draw solution. The proposed FO–UF integrated system using super hydrophilic nanoparticles as draw solutes is believed to be a promising technology to desalinate both seawater and brackish water and to reclaim water from wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrackish water 3adesalination 3amagnetic fields 3amagnetic properties 3ananoparticles 3aosmosis 3asalts 3aseawater 3asolutes 3aultrafiltration 3aultrasonic treatment 3awastewater 3awater reuse1 aChung, Tai-shung,0 tDesalination.g2011 Sept. 1, v. 278, no. 1-3 p.194-202dElsevier B.V.x0011-91647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.desal.2011.05.0193Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03491naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245006900167500001900236520210900255592002802364650001002392650002102402650001202423650001902435650001802454650001502472650002002487650001702507650001202524650001202536653001002548653002102558653002002579653001902599653000802618653001002626653000802636653001502644653001602659653001902675653001702694700005602711700001802767773012102785856008202906852000902988655001202997IND60718548220221120210831.0210506e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071854822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mce.2020.1110882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuuskanen, Suvi10aEndocrinology of thermoregulation in birds in a changing climate  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe ability to maintain a (relatively) stable body temperature in a wide range of thermal environments by use of endogenous heat production is a unique feature of endotherms such as birds. Endothermy is acquired and regulated via various endocrine and molecular pathways, and ultimately allows wide aerial, aquatic, and terrestrial distribution in variable environments. However, due to our changing climate, birds are faced with potential new challenges for thermoregulation, such as more frequent extreme weather events, lower predictability of climate, and increasing mean temperature. We provide an overview on thermoregulation in birds and its endocrine and molecular mechanisms, pinpointing gaps in current knowledge and recent developments, focusing especially on non-model species to understand the generality of, and variation in, mechanisms. We highlight plasticity of thermoregulation and underlying endocrine regulation, because thorough understanding of plasticity is key to predicting responses to changing environmental conditions. To this end, we discuss how changing climate is likely to affect avian thermoregulation and associated endocrine traits, and how the interplay between these physiological processes may play a role in facilitating or constraining adaptation to a changing climate. We conclude that while the general patterns of endocrine regulation of thermogenesis are quite well understood, at least in poultry, the molecular and endocrine mechanisms that regulate, e.g. mitochondrial function and plasticity of thermoregulation over different time scales (from transgenerational to daily variation), need to be unveiled. Plasticity may ameliorate climate change effects on thermoregulation to some extent, but the increased frequency of extreme weather events, and associated changes in resource availability, may be beyond the scope and/or speed for plastic responses. This could lead to selection for more tolerant phenotypes, if the underlying physiological traits harbour genetic and individual variation for selection to act on – a key question for future research.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirds 3abody temperature 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aendocrinology 3aendothermy 3aheat production 3amitochondria 3apoultry 3aweather 0aAvian 0aThermoregulation 0aThyroid hormone 0aCorticosterone 0aNST 0aavUCP 0aBMR 0aPlasticity 0aTemperature 0aMetabolic rate 0aHeterothermy1 aHsu, Bin-Yan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3799-05091 aNord, Andreas0 tMolecular and cellular endocrinology.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 519 p.111088-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12477x0303-72077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2020.1110883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02816naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245011800174300001600292520156800308592002801876650001501904650001201919650001201931650001601943650001301959650001501972650001801987650001802005650001102023651001602034651001202050653001502062653001302077653002302090653002202113653001402135653001102149700002202160773010602182856008502288852000902373655001202382IND60469395420221120123716.0151218e20160209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046939542DNAL7 a10.1080/00222933.2015.10599612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSitnikova, Tatyana10aOn morphological and ecological evidence of adaptive differentiation among stony cliff littoral Baikal gastropods  ap. 263-280.  aThree morpho- or ecotypes (‘ribbed’, ‘middle’ or ‘ribless’ shell and ‘smooth’) of lithophilous Maackia herderiana (Lindholm, 1909) (Caenogastropoda: Baicaliidae) were investigated along the hydrodynamic zones of four locations on the southwestern littoral of Lake Baikal in southeast Siberia. We found a prevalence of the ribbed-shell morphotype inhabiting stones at a depth of 1.2–2.0 m, corresponding to the hydrodynamic zone of strong wave activity, and a predominance of the smooth-shell morphotype living on cliffy canyons at 21–31 m depth in the hydrodynamic zone where wave action is very weak or totally absent. Mixed groups of snails with ribbed, ribless and/or smooth shells were present on stony-boulder substrates at 3 to 15–19 m depth of the wave-cut and wave-weakening hydrodynamic zones. Ribbed-morphotype snails living in inshore and wave-cut hydrodynamic zones had a smaller shell size than did smooth-morphotype snails inhabiting zones where wave activity was weak or totally absent. The thickness of ribbed shells in the non-ribbed areas was equal to the thickness of smooth shells; ribs enhance the thickness of the shell by 3–4 times, thereby increasing the strength of ribbed shells against destructive wave action. On the basis of the different correlation coefficients of shell weight, soft body mass and total mass with increasing shell height, we assumed a growth differentiation between the ribbed and smooth morphotypes. We compared our results with data on ecotypes of some freshwater and marine gastropods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGastropoda 3aMaackia 3acanyons 3acorrelation 3aecotypes 3afreshwater 3ahydrodynamics 3alittoral zone 3asnails 3aLake Baikal 3aSiberia 0agastropods 0aecotypes 0ahydrodynamic zones 0ashell morphometry 0athickness 0aweight1 aMaximova, Natalia0 tJournal of natural history.g2016 Feb. 9, v. 50, no. 5-6 p.263-280dTaylor & Francisx1464-52627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00222933.2015.10599613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02330naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245010900170300002000279520118000299592002801479650001901507650001601526650002201542650002001564650002601584650002201610650001301632650001001645650001301655650001401668700002301682700002201705700002101727773011301748856008601861852000901947655001201956IND60530049820170412000000.0160720e20151020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053004982DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.5b029962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzabó, Eszter,10aQuantitative Analytical Method for the Determination of Biotinidase Activity in Dried Blood Spot Samples  ap. 10573-10578.  aBiotinidase activity assay is included in most newborn screening protocols, and the positive results are confirmed by quantitative enzyme activity measurements. In our study, we describe a new quantitative analytical method for the determination of biotinidase activity using the blood sample deposited onto filter paper as the assay medium, by predepositing N-biotinyl-p-aminobenzoic acid onto the standard sample collection paper. The analysis of the assay mixture requires a simple extraction step from a dried blood spot followed by the quantification of product by LC-MS. The method provides a simple and reliable enzyme assay method that enables the rapid diagnosis of biotinidase deficiency (BD). Out of the measured 36 samples, 13 were healthy with lower enzyme activities, 16 were patients with partial BD, and 7 were patients with profound BD with residual activity below 10%. Expression of enzyme activity in percentage of mean activity of negative controls allows comparison of the different techniques. The obtained results are in good agreement with activity data determined from both dried blood spots and serum samples, giving an informative diagnostic value.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood sampling 3ablood serum 3adisease diagnosis 3aenzyme activity 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3aneonates 3apaper 3apatients 3ascreening1 aSzatmári, Ildikó1 aSzőnyi, László1 aTakáts, Zoltán0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2015 Oct. 20, v. 87, no. 20 p.10573-10578dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.analchem.5b029963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03133naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245013800176300001600314520139700330592002801727650002201755650003701777650001201814650001401826650001401840650001501854650001901869650001601888650002101904650001101925650002001936650001301956650002401969650001401993650001302007650002002020650003302040650001702073650001602090650002102106650001102127653002202138653001902160653003102179653001402210700005602224700002402280700002902304700002102333773011702354856008702471852000902558655001202567IND60644183520221121143724.0190923e20190901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064418352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2019.05.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIbrahim, Naeemah A.10aSynthesis of carbonaceous solid acid magnetic catalyst from empty fruit bunch for esterification of palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD)  ap. 480-491.  aA biomass-based magnetic catalyst was synthesised by way of a chemical activation-doping-sulphonation process using empty fruit bunch (EFB) char as a precursor for conversion of palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) to biodiesel. The magnetic heterogeneous acid catalyst AC-Fe(x)-SO3Cl, with x = 2, 5, 10 and 15 (%) was prepared, to synthesise the optimised magnetic catalyst. The optimised magnetic catalyst was identified by applying TPD-NH3, BET, XRD, XPS, VSM, TGA and FESEM. The prepared magnetic catalyst had a higher surface area (20.42 m2/g), high acidity (29,520 μmol/g), and high magnetic properties (HC = 344.14G). The esterification activity of the AC-Fe(10)-SO3Cl catalyst showed high free fatty acid conversion (98.6%) with optimal reaction conditions of 4 wt% catalyst, 3 h reaction time, 16:1 methanol/PFAD ratio and 100 °C reaction temperature. In addition, AC-Fe(10)-SO3Cl showed the capability of maintaining esterification activity for six continuous cycles with no further treatment and gave a ∼79% biodiesel conversion. The produced catalysts showed characteristics such as high durability during esterification, with metal leaching containing low activity after several cycles. The EFB waste-based acidic magnetic catalysts are potentially efficient, economical, and eco-friendly for the esterification of waste oils and fats for biodiesel production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aacidity 3abiodiesel 3acatalysts 3adurability 3aesterification 3afatty acids 3afree fatty acids 3afruits 3afuel production 3aleaching 3amagnetic properties 3amagnetism 3amethanol 3apalm kernel oil 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asurface area 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 3awastes 0aMagnetic catalyst 0aEsterification 0aPalm fatty acid distillate 0aBiodiesel1 aRashid, Umer1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6224-413X1 aTaufiq-Yap, Yun Hin1 aYaw, Thomas Choong Shean1 aIsmail, Ismayadi0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2019 Sept. 01, v. 195 p.480-491dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2019.05.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02849naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245014900174300001600323500001500339520155000354592002801904650002001932650001101952650002401963650001301987650001202000650001502012650002202027650002202049650001102071653003702082653002702119653004302146653001802189700003002207700001702237773009202254856008402346852000902430655001202439IND60547532620221120025020.0160903s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054753262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.proenv.2013.06.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCornelissen, Thomas10aUsing HydroGeoSphere in a Forested Catchment: How does Spatial Resolution Influence the Simulation of Spatio-temporal Soil Moisture Variability?  ap. 198-207.  a2019-12-06  aSoil moisture is a key variable in the soil-plant-atmosphere system because it interacts with various system components. Both the measurement and the simulation of the soil moisture pattern and its spatio-temporal variability are current challenges in hydrology. This study applies the model HydroGeoSphere in a natural forest ecosystem to assess whether the model can simulate the spatio-temporal variability and pattern of soil moisture. The assessment is performed by comparing the simulation results with soil moisture measurements. The model is used at two different model resolutions to reveal the scale dependency of the calibrated model parameters, the water balance, the discharge components, and the spatial distribution of soil moisture and its variogram parameters. Discharge simulation results show that the model is capable of reproducing the discharge characteristics. A weak correlation is found between simulated and measured soil moisture dynamics in the topsoil, but the correlation is stronger in 20cm depth. In 50cm depth, the model is able to simulate the seasonal trend but not the short-term dynamics because preferential flow is not simulated. Furthermore, a decrease in soil moisture variance during continued drying is observed for both simulations and the measurements at both resolutions. In addition, the pattern of measured soil moisture shows a patchy character that does not show in the simulated pattern indicating that using uniform soil properties in the topsoil makes the soil moisture simulation inaccurate.  aPublisher supplied data 3asoil properties 3amodels 3aforested watersheds 3avariance 3atopsoil 3asoil water 3aforest ecosystems 3apreferential flow 3adrying 0aVegetation-hyrology interactions 0aHydrological modelling 0aPattern analysis,Spatial heterogeneity 0awater balance1 aDiekkrüger, B.q(Bernd),1 aBogena, Heye0 tProcedia Environmental Sciences.g2013, v. 19 p.198-207dElsevier B.V.x1878-02967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.proenv.2013.06.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02144naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245014200176300001600318520091300334592002801247650002501275650001101300650001301311650001801324650001301342650001001355650001901365650001301384700002801397700002301425700001701448700002301465700003801488700001801526773008801544856008201632990002301714852000901737655001201746IND60095057120221116160212.0141104e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009505712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.diff.2012.04.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJongbloed, Monique R.M.10aNormal and abnormal development of the cardiac conduction system; implications for conduction and rhythm disorders in the child and adult  ap. 131-148.  aThe cardiac conduction system is a specialized network that initiates and closely coordinates the heart beat. Cardiac conduction system development is intricately related to the development and maturation of the embryonic heart towards its four-chambered form, as is indicated by the fact that disturbed development of cardiac structures is often accompanied by a disturbed formation of the CCS. Electrophysiological studies have shown that selected conduction disturbances and cardiac arrhythmias do not take place randomly in the heart but rather at anatomical predilection sites. Knowledge on development of the CCS may facilitate understanding of the etiology of arrhythmogenic events. In this review we will focus on embryonic development of the CCS in relation to clinical arrhythmias, as well as on specific cardiac conduction abnormalities that are observed in patients with congenital heart disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabnormal development 3aadults 3achildren 3aembryogenesis 3aetiology 3aheart 3aheart diseases 3apatients1 aVicente Steijn, Rebecca1 aHahurij, Nathan D.1 aKelder, T.P.1 aSchalij, Martin J.1 aGittenberger-de Groot, Adriana C.1 aBlom, Nico A.0 tDifferentiation.g2012 July, v. 84, no. 1 p.131-148dElsevier B.V.x0301-46817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.diff.2012.04.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03837naa a2200805 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100003000166245014500196300001600341520134300357592002801700650001201728650002101740650001801761650001901779650002501798650002301823650001501846650002801861650003201889650001101921650000901932650001301941650001401954650001201968650001301980650002501993650001602018650004702034650001202081650004902093650003502142650001402177650002302191650002002214650001902234650000902253650000902262650004402271650001702315650002502332650005102357650001702408650001202425650002402437650002102461653003102482653001402513653002302527653001302550653001902563700002402582700002102606700002602627700002302653700002902676700002602705700002402731700002202755700002802777773012302805856008202928852000903010655001203019IND50069687020221120180229.0220214e20131028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006968702DNAL7 a240213012pmid7 a10.1016/j.jep.2013.08.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlvarenga, Felipe Queiroz10aIn vivo analgesic activity, toxicity and phytochemical screening of the hydroalcoholic extract from the leaves of Psidium cattleianum Sabine  ap. 280-284.  aPsidium cattleianum Sabine is extensively used in Brazilian traditional medicine to treat several diseases including painful disorders. Aim of the study to investigate the toxicity and the possible analgesic activities of the hydroalcoholic extract from the leaves of Psidium cattleianum Sabine (ELPCS), to support its use in folk medicine. To screen the major phytochemical constituents of this extract and evaluate their antioxidant activity. ELPCS was assessed for its antioxidant activity using the DPPH model. Its analgesic activity was examined using mouse models of acetic acid-induced writhing and hot plate paw licking models. The major phytochemical constituents of the extract were screened; their toxicity on LLC-MK2 mammalian cells was evaluated. ELPCS exhibited significant peripheral analgesic activity at doses of 60, 80, 100, 200 and 400mg/kg in mice, but it did not display central analgesic activity and not was toxic to LLC-MK2 cell (LD₅₀>400µg/mL). The extract exhibited free radical scavenging activity as evidenced by IC₅₀ values (15.9µg/mL) obtained by the DPPH method. Phytochemical screening detected flavonoids, saponins, cardiac glycosides, anthraquinones, and tannins. The results of the experimental studies proved the analgesic activity of ELPCS and supported the traditional use of this plant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPsidium 3aanalgesic effect 3aanimal models 3aanthraquinones 3aantioxidant activity 3acardiac glycosides 3aflavonoids 3afree radical scavengers 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aleaves 3amice 3asaponins 3ascreening 3atannins 3atoxicity 3atraditional medicine 2aAcetic Acid 2aAnalgesicsxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aAnimals 2aAntioxidantsxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aBiphenyl Compoundsxmetabolism 2aCell Line 2aEthanolxchemistry 2aHot Temperature 2aMacaca mulatta 2aMale 2aMice 2aPainxchemically inducedxdrug therapy. 2aPhytotherapy 2aPicratesxmetabolism 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aPlant Leaves 2aPsidium 2aSolventsxchemistry 2aWaterxchemistry 0aPsidium cattleianum Sabine 0aMyrtaceae 0aAnalgesic activity 0aToxicity 0aPhytochemistry1 aMota, Bárbara C.F.1 aLeite, Marcel N.1 aFonseca, Jaciara M.S.1 aOliveira, Dario A.1 ade Andrade Royo, Vanessa1 ae Silva, Márcio L.A.1 aEsperandim, Viviane1 aBorges, Alexandre1 aLaurentiz, Rosangela S.0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2013 Oct. 28, v. 150, no. 1 p.280-284dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2013.08.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03673naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005400142245016700196300001800363500002000381520182100401592002802222596003302250596004702283596007502330596006802405596003402473596005602507596006502563650001502628650001102643650001102654650001602665650001502681650001202696650001302708650001402721700005302735700001602788700001502804700001902819700001902838700005902857700001902916700001502935773013102950856007703081852000903158655001203167IND60790162920221123045044.0220824e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079016292DNAL7 a10.1029/2018JB0165822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiptai, N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2464-246810aLateral and Vertical Heterogeneity in the Lithospheric Mantle at the Northern Margin of the Pannonian Basin Reconstructed From Peridotite Xenolith Microstructures  ap. 6315-6336.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis study analyzes the microstructures and deformational characteristics of spinel peridotite xenoliths from the Nógrád‐Gömör Volcanic Field (NGVF), located on the northern margin of a young extensional basin presently affected by compression. The xenoliths show a wide range of microstructures, bearing the imprints of heterogeneous deformation and variable degrees of subsequent annealing. Olivine crystal preferred orientations (CPOs) have dominantly [010]‐fiber and orthorhombic patterns. Orthopyroxene CPOs indicate coeval deformation with olivine. Olivine J indices correlate positively with equilibration temperatures, suggesting that the CPO strength increases with depth. In contrast, the intensity of intragranular deformation in olivine varies as a function of the sampling locality. We interpret the microstructures and CPO patterns as recording deformation by dislocation creep in a transpressional regime, which is consistent with recent tectonic evolution in the Carpathian‐Pannonian region due to the convergence between the Adria microplate and the European platform. Postkinematic annealing is probably linked to percolation of metasomatism by mafic melts through the upper mantle of the NGVF prior to the eruption of the host alkali basalt. Elevated equilibration temperatures in xenoliths from the central part of the volcanic field are interpreted to be associated with the last metasomatic event, which only shortly preceded the ascent of the host magma. Despite well‐developed olivine CPOs in the xenoliths, which imply a strong seismic anisotropy, the lithospheric mantle alone cannot account for the shear wave splitting delay times measured in the NGVF, indicating that deformation in both the lithosphere and the asthenosphere contributes to the observed shear wave splitting.  aPublisher supplied data  aiMQREScMacquarie University  aCGL2016‐81085‐RcState Research Agency  aFPDI‐2013‐16253cMinistry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness  cARC Centre of Excellence for Core to Crust Fluid Systems (CCFS)  cHungarian Academy of Sciences  aPD101683cHungarian Scientific Research Fund (OTKA)  aNAMS‐230937cMarie Curie International Reintegration Grant 3aanisotropy 3abasalt 3abasins 3adeformation 3ageophysics 3aolivine 3aresearch 3atectonics1 aHidas, K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1371-03621 aTommasi, A.1 aPatkó, L.1 aKovács, I.

(Asteraceae), belonging to the tribe Cichorieae of the family Asteraceae, has a long history as an edible and medicinal food. Sesquiterpene lactones are commonly considered as its major active constituents. In the current study, five unreported sesquiterpene lactones, including one 12,8-guaianolide and four 12,6-guaianolides were isolated from C. intybus roots, as well as 16 known analogues. The planar structures and relative configurations of these compounds were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic analysis. The absolute configurations were determined by the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT)-based electronic circular dichroism (ECD) calculation method. Bioassay results showed that seven of the isolates exhibited remarkable NO production inhibitory activity in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages, with IC₅₀ values ranging from 1.83 to 38.81 μM. Some of them can significantly decrease the secretion of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6). Cytotoxicity assays demonstrated that intybusins B, as well as four known compounds, displayed obvious inhibitory activities against four human tumor cells, with IC₅₀ values ranging from 9.01 to 27.07 μM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCichorium intybus 3abioassays 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3acytotoxicity 3adensity functional theory 3afunctional foods 3ahumans 3ainterleukin-6 3amacrophages 3aneoplasms 3aplant biochemistry 3asecretion 3asesquiterpenoid lactones 3aspectral analysis 0aCichorium intybus L. 0aAsteraceae 0aSesquiterpene lactones 0aAnti-inflammatory activity 0aCytotoxicity1 aLv, Han1 aDing, Xiao-qin1 aJian, Tun-yu1 aGuo, Da-le1 aFeng, Xiu-juan1 aRen, Bing-ru1 aChen, Jian0 tPhytochemistry.g2022 Nov., v. 203 p.113377-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44710x0031-94227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2022.1133773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02548naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002800152245012500180300001600305520122900321592002801550650001501578650001901593650001601612650001101628650002201639650002001661650002101681650001701702650001601719651000901735653001901744653001001763653003201773653003501805700002401840700006101864773011701925856008702042852000902129655001202138IND60644183920221121110318.0190923e20190901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064418392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2019.05.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdolalipouradl, Mehran10aExergoeconomic analysis of a novel integrated transcritical CO2 and Kalina 11 cycles from Sabalan geothermal power plant  ap. 420-435.  aA new integrated cycle based on different real temperatures and pressures on Sabalan geothermal power plant, located in Iran, has been proposed and thermodynamic and exergoeconomic analyses are performed. The Kalina and Transcritical Rankine cycles are used as bottoming cycles and an algorithm are applied to find the exact location of the pinch points in heat exchangers. Also, a parametric study carried out to reveal the effects on the thermodynamic and exergoeconomic performance of the integrated cycle of such important parameters as separator 1 pressure, separator 2 pressure, pinch point temperature difference in the evaporators, higher pressure of the Kalina cycle and the ratio of the Transcritical cycle higher pressure to the critical pressure. Finally, the proposed cycle performance is optimized from the thermodynamic and exergoeconomic viewpoints. The results show that for the integrated geothermal power plant, the power generation, thermal efficiency, exergy efficiency and power specific cost rate are calculated to be 19,448 kW, 16.63%, 63.78%, and 4.521 $/GJ, respectively, which indicate that the proposed cycle has improved thermodynamically and exergoeconomically compared to previous studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acarbon dioxide 3aevaporators 3aexergy 3ageothermal energy 3aheat exchangers 3apower generation 3apower plants 3atemperature 3aIran 0aExergoeconomic 0aKCS11 0aTranscritical rankine cycle 0aSabalan geothermal power plant1 aKhalilarya, Shahram1 aJafarmadar, Samad1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1118-29810 tEnergy conversion and management.g2019 Sept. 01, v. 195 p.420-435dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2019.05.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03065naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245008800168300001600256520172900272592002802001650001702029650002102046650002002067650001902087650001602106650002302122650002602145650001102171650001502182650001902197650001702216650001002233650001402243650001702257653002702274653001502301653002702316700001602343700001702359700002002376700001402396773009202410856008402502852000902586655001202595IND60547533020221120054934.0160903s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054753302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.proenv.2013.06.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalladino, M.10aMass and Surface Energy Balance Approaches for Monitoring Water Stress in Vineyards  ap. 231-238.  aTree crops are representing one of most widespread agricultural systems in Mediterranean regions, thus contributing in a substantial way to the economy and productivity of primary sectors of the countries interested. Besides the aspects concerning their economical relevance, tree crops like vineyards, olive and orange orchards are also typical elements of the Mediterranean landscape, and their ecological role has been recently revitalised in consideration of their function as carbon sinks for the Kyoto agreement.The environmental and economical sustainability of these agricultural systems in arid and semi-arid zones has to cope with the availability and management of water resources for irrigation. During recent years there has been a substantial progress in understanding the evolution of evapotranspiration processes in cropping systems, and detailed models and measurement techniques have been set-up for describing the mass and energy exchanges in the soil-plant- atmosphere continuum. However, due to the complexity of rooting systems and aerial parts further steps are needed for a full comprehension of hydrological processes in tree crop systems, with special regard to water stress conditions.Within the research project P.R.I.N. 2008 “Assessment of mass and energy fluxes for the irrigation management of Mediterranean tree crops” different techniques for measuring evapotranspiration fluxes in tree crops will be developed and tested, from innovative methodologies based on remote sensing observations to in-situ observations (xylem-flow measurements and micro-meteorology). These data-sets have be interpreted by means of physical approaches, with a modelling perspective of the observed processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerial parts 3acropping systems 3adata collection 3aenergy balance 3aenergy flow 3aevapotranspiration 3airrigation management 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aremote sensing 3aroot systems 3atrees 3avineyards 3awater stress 0asurface energy balance 0atree-crops 0awater stress modelling1 aStaiano, A.1 aD’Urso, G.1 aMinacapilli, M.1 aRallo, G.0 tProcedia Environmental Sciences.g2013, v. 19 p.231-238dElsevier B.V.x1878-02967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.proenv.2013.06.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03051naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002800180245008600208506007600294520159500370592002801965506003701993650001202030650000802042650002102050650001802071650001102089650001702100650001802117650001602135650002002151650001402171650001802185650003502203650004302238650001502281650001202296700002702308700002202335700002102357773012102378856007302499852000902572655001202581IND60653003320221207082544.0190713e20190601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065300332DNAL7 a10.3390/v110605062doi7 aPMC66308212pmcid7 a311594502pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValverde, Estefania  J.10a<i>Artemia</i> spp., a Susceptible Host and Vector for Lymphocystis Disease Virus  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDifferent developmental stages of Artemia spp. (metanauplii, juveniles and adults) were bath-challenged with two isolates of the Lymphocystis disease virus (LCDV), namely, LCDV SA25 (belonging to the species Lymphocystis disease virus 3) and ATCC VR-342 (an unclassified member of the genus Lymphocystivirus). Viral quantification and gene expression were analyzed by qPCR at different times post-inoculation (pi). In addition, infectious titres were determined at 8 dpi by integrated cell culture (ICC)-RT-PCR, an assay that detects viral mRNA in inoculated cell cultures. In LCDV-challenged Artemia, the viral load increased by 2&ndash;3 orders of magnitude (depending on developmental stage and viral isolate) during the first 8&ndash;12 dpi, with viral titres up to 2.3 &times; 102 Most Probable Number of Infectious Units (MPNIU)/mg. Viral transcripts were detected in the infected Artemia, relative expression values showed a similar temporal evolution in the different experimental groups. Moreover, gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) fingerlings were challenged by feeding on LCDV-infected metanauplii. Although no Lymphocystis symptoms were observed in the fish, the number of viral DNA copies was significantly higher at the end of the experimental trial and major capsid protein (mcp) gene expression was consistently detected. The results obtained support that LCDV infects Artemia spp., establishing an asymptomatic productive infection at least under the experimental conditions tested, and that the infected metanauplii are a vector for LCDV transmission to gilthead seabream.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArtemia 3aDNA 3aLymphocystivirus 3aSparus aurata 3aadults 3acell culture 3acoat proteins 3afingerlings 3agene expression 3ajuveniles 3amessenger RNA 3amost probable number technique 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aviral load 3aviruses1 aLabella, Alejandro  M.1 aBorrego, Juan  J.1 aCastro, Dolores 0 tViruses.g2019 June 01, v. 11, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v110605063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02821naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245010900173300001600282520147900298592002801777650002201805650002501827650002101852650002601873650002801899650001701927650002101944650001901965650002301984653002402007653004302031653002902074653001402103653001702117700002002134700002202154700001802176773011202194856008402306852000902390655001202399IND60604838420221120231330.0180718e20150301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060483842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2014.12.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEfligenir, Anthony10aCharacterization of the isolated active layer of a NF membrane by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy  ap. 172-182.  aThe dielectric and electric properties of the isolated active layer of an NF membrane were determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). To our knowledge, this was the first attempt aimed at assessing the above properties from measurements performed directly on the active layer alone. Experiments were conducted with Desal DK membrane and various electrolyte solutions (KCl, KI, LiCl, NH4Cl, CaCl2 and BaCl2) at 10⁻² mol m⁻³. The comparison of impedance spectra obtained for the whole membrane and active layer alone revealed very low contribution of the active layer to the overall membrane impedance. The dielectric constant (εp) and conductivity (κca) inside the pores of the active layer were evaluated from capacity and resistance measurements. The dielectric constant inside the pores was found to be smaller than its bulk value, irrespective of the electrolyte used. The reduction in εp was attributed only to confinement effect. It was also shown that pore conductivity exceeded the bulk conductivity. This increased conduction inside the pores could have been due to the excess of counter-ions inside the pores resulting from fixed charges on the pore walls. The present study shows that the dielectric constant inside the pores of the active layer of NF membranes can be determined independently from nano-filtration measurements and without any ambiguity, provided that EIS measurements are performed directly on the isolated active layer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium chloride 3aartificial membranes 3acalcium chloride 3adielectric properties 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrolytes 3alithium chloride 3ananofiltration 3apotassium chloride 0aDielectric constant 0aElectrochemical impedance spectroscopy 0aNanofiltration membranes 0aPolyamide 0aConductivity1 aFievet, Patrick1 aDéon, Sébastien1 aSalut, Roland0 tJournal of membrane science.g2015 Mar. 01, v. 477 p.172-182dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2014.12.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03094naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100002300161245008900184300001800273500000900291500001500300520175800315592002802073650001702101650001702118650002102135650002102156650002802177650001102205650002002216650002302236650001802259650002702277650002702304650001702331650002702348651001602375653001102391700002802402773012302430852000902553856009802562655001202660IND9300457020221119151132.0191122e199207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930045702DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1992.0011183X003200040042x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrink, Geoffrey E.10aForage Quality and Morphological Components of Diverse Clovers during Primary Growth  ap. 1043-1048.  aepub  a2019-12-04  aForage quality of dover (Trifolium spp.) may be influenced by changes in nutrient concentration of morphological fraction as a function of growth habit or life cycle. We compared the dry matter (DM) accumulation trends of four clovers differing in growth habit and life cycle, and determined the influence of plant fraction nutritive value on total forage quality. Primary spring growth of berseem (T. alexandrinum L.), red (T. pratense L.), subterranean (T. subterraneum L.), and white (T. repens L.) clovers was harvested in each of 2 yr beginning in late March, and thereafter every 10 d (eight harvests total). Digestible dry matter (DDM) and crude protein (CP) concentration determined for leaf, petiole, stem, and reproductive fractions, and total forage of each species at each harvest. Total DM accumulation of berseem and red clover increased linearly to a maximum of 547 and 407 g DM m⁻², respectively, by Day 61, while that of subterranean and white clover increased nonlinearly to a maximum of 336 and 219 g DM m⁻², respectively, by Day 51. Days to maximum accumulation of stem DM in erect species and petiole DM in prostrate species corresponded with maximum total DM accumulation in the respective species. Leaf-to-stem weight ratio ranged from 0.27 to 1.42 for berseem clover and from 1.10 to 3.04 for white clover, although quadratic trends for leaf DM accumulation for the two species were similar. Mean DDM of berseem and red clover forage declined 2.0 g kg⁻¹ d⁻¹. Based on trends for dry matter accumulation and nutrient concentration of the leaf fraction, subterranean and white clover merit consideration equal to berseem and red clover as pasture legumes.

Its mainshock occurred at the edge of a high‐Vp (2–4%) seismogenic zone. Significant low‐Vs (−1% to −3%) and high Poisson's ratio (2–7%) anomalies are imaged in and below the source zone and extend to the upper surface of the subducting Pacific slab, most likely reflecting ascending fluids released by the slab dehydration. A high consistency between the fault plane and the low‐Vs and high Poisson's ratio anomalies indicates that the fluids may have entered the fault and affected the rupture nucleation. A high‐V (1–3%) anomaly is revealed in the fore‐arc mantle wedge and connects with the high‐V seismogenic zone, probably reflecting a lithospheric fragment and contributing to cool down the mantle wedge. Complex seismic anisotropy is revealed in the crust in and around the source area, which may reflect complicated stress regime and strong structural heterogeneities there.  aPublisher supplied data  a19H01996cMEXT | Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)  a41674044cNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)  a41674049cNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)  cNanjing University  a19H01996cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  a41674049cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41674044cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aJapan 3aPoisson distribution 3aanisotropy 3aearthquakes 3ageophysics 3aresearch1 aHuang, Zhouchuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0934-17791 aZhao, Dapeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4407-594X1 aWang, Liangshu0 tJournal of geophysical research.g2019 July, v. 124, no. 7 p.7052-7066dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27943x2169-93137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019JB0173883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02506naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001400143245010300157520131600260592002801576650001401604650003401618650001401652650002001666650002001686650001501706650001001721650002601731650001301757650002701770650001301797650001401810700002001824700001701844700001901861700002001880773012101900856007802021852000902099655001202108IND60794160120221123011831.0220922e20220917xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079416012DNAL7 a10.3390/foods111828912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Xiao 10aTwo-Dimensional Liquid Chromatography Method for the Determination of Gelsemium Alkaloids in Honey  aToxic Chinese medicine residues in honey pose a serious threat to consumer health. Gelsemium is one of the nine ancient poisons, making the whole plant virulent. The residue of Gelsemium alkaloid in honey causes poisoning from time to time. Therefore, it is very important to establish a method for the detection of Gelsemium alkaloids in honey. In this study, a method of solid phase extraction (SPE) with two-dimensional liquid chromatography (2D-LC) was developed for the first time for the simultaneous determination of Gelsemium alkaloids in honey, including gelsemine, koumine and humantenmine. First, the honey samples were purified by a PRS cation exchange column and extracted with 5% ammoniated methanol. Then, we verified the methodological indicators, which were in line with the Codex Guideline requirements. The verification results are as follows: matrix-matched calibrations indicated that the correlation coefficients were higher than 0.998. The recovery was in the range of 81%–94.2% with an intraday precision (RSD) of ≤5.0% and interday RSD of ≤3.8%. The limit of detection for the three alkaloids was 2 ng/g. The limits of quantification for gelsemine and koumine were 5 ng/g, and humantenmine was 20 ng/g. This method can be applied to the monitoring of Gelsemium alkaloids in honey.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGelsemium 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aalkaloids 3acation exchange 3adetection limit 3aguidelines 3ahoney 3aliquid chromatography 3amethanol 3asolid phase extraction 3atoxicity 3avirulence1 aZuo, Meng-Ting 1 aQi, Xue-Jia 1 aWang, Zi-Yuan 1 aLiu, Zhao-Ying 0 tFoods.g2022 Sept. 17, v. 11, no. 18dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods111828913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03072naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002900180245010000209506007600309520150300385592002801888506003701916650001801953650003501971650000802006650003202014650001802046650002302064650001302087650003602100650001002136650002002146650001802166650001102184650001302195650001402208650001302222650002502235650001102260650002502271700002102296700002002317700002602337773012102363856007302484852000902557655001202566IND60653003420221207083218.0190713e20190602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065300342DNAL7 a10.3390/v110605072doi7 aPMC66304792pmcid7 a311594882pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonelli, Christopher  A.10aHIV-1-Based Virus-like Particles that Morphologically Resemble Mature, Infectious HIV-1 Virions  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA prophylactic vaccine eliciting both broad neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) to the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) and strong T cell responses would be optimal for preventing HIV-1 transmissions. Replication incompetent HIV-1 virus-like particles (VLPs) offer the opportunity to present authentic-structured, virion-associated Env to elicit bNAbs, and also stimulate T cell responses. Here, we optimize our DNA vaccine plasmids as VLP expression vectors for efficient Env incorporation and budding. The original vector that was used in human trials inefficiently produced VLPs, but maximized safety by inactivating RNA genome packaging, enzyme functions that are required for integration into the host genome, and deleting accessory proteins Vif, Vpr, and Nef. These original DNA vaccine vectors generated VLPs with incomplete protease-mediated cleavage of Gag and were irregularly sized. Mutations to restore function within the defective genes revealed that several of the reverse transcriptase (RT) deletions mediated this immature phenotype. Here, we made efficient budding, protease-processed, and mature-form VLPs that resembled infectious virions by introducing alternative mutations that completely removed the RT domain, but preserved most other safety mutations. These VLPs, either expressed from DNA vectors in vivo or purified after expression in vitro, are potentially useful immunogens that can be used to elicit antibody responses that target Env on fully infectious HIV-1 virions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA packaging 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3aRNA 3aRNA-directed DNA polymerase 3aT-lymphocytes 3aantibody formation 3aantigens 3abroadly neutralizing antibodies 3agenes 3agenetic vectors 3aglycoproteins 3ahumans 3amutation 3aphenotype 3aplasmids 3arecombinant vaccines 3avirion 3avirus-like particles1 aKhoury, Georges 1 aCenter, Rob  J.1 aPurcell, Damian  F.J.0 tViruses.g2019 June 02, v. 11, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v110605073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01782naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245011600167300001600283520083800299592002801137650001701165650001501182650001101197700002201208700006201230773012101292856008201413852000901495655001201504IND60681029120221120233102.0200113e20190904xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068102912DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biomac.9b010652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerlin, Pesach10aModification of Poly(5,6-epoxy-l-norleucine) Gives Functional Polypeptides with Alternative Side-Chain Linkages  ap. 126-132.  aThe preparation and characterization of a new epoxide containing polypeptide, poly(5,6-epoxy-l-norleucine), via postpolymerization modification of poly(l-homoallylglycine) is described. Addition of thiols to the epoxide groups in poly(5,6-epoxy-l-norleucine) was studied as a means to prepare side-chain functional polypeptides. The solution properties of the derivatized polypeptides were studied in water and compared to similar thioether containing functional polypeptides prepared via different routes. Subtle differences in side-chain linkage chemistry were found to influence polypeptide solubility, chain conformation in solution, and thermoresponsive behavior. Poly(5,6-epoxy-l-norleucine) was found to be useful as a readily prepared intermediate that can be reacted with thiols to give a variety of functional polypeptides.  aPublisher supplied data 3apolypeptides 3asolubility 3athiols1 aScott, Wendell A.1 aDeming, Timothy J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0594-50250 tBiomacromolecules.g2019 Sept. 04, v. 21, no. 1 p.126-132dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12556x1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biomac.9b010653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02824naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245006100160300002000221520166900241592002801910650002301938650001401961650001301975650001101988650001301999650001302012700001202025700001502037700001602052700002102068700001302089700005602102700005902158773014802217856007602365852000902441655001202450IND60699380920221118004801.0200617e20200520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069938092DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.0c033302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Zhongwei10aControlled Hierarchical Self-Assembly of Catenated Cages  ap. 10833-10840.  aConstructing hierarchical superstructures to achieve comparable complexity and functions to proteins with four-level hierarchy is challenging, which relies on the elaboration of novel building blocks with complex structures. We present a series of catenated cages with unique structural complexity and tailorability. The rational design was realized as such: A catenane of two symmetric cages (CSC), CSC-1, with all rigid imine panels was converted to a catenane of two dissymmetric cages (CDC), CDC-1, with two exterior flexible amine panels, and CDC-5 was tailored from CDC-1 by introducing an additional methyl group on each blade to increase lateral hindrance. CDC-1s with the most irregular and flexible configuration formed supramolecular dimers, which self-organized into 3D continuous wavelike plank with a three-level hierarchy, previously undiscovered by conventional building blocks. A drastically different 3D triclinic crystalline phase with a four-level hierarchy and trigonal phase with a three-level hierarchy were constructed of distorted CSC-1s and the most symmetric CDC-5s, respectively. The wavelike plank exhibited the lowest order, and the triclinic phase had a lower order than the trigonal phase which had the highest order. It correlates with the configuration of the primary structures, namely, the most disordered shape of CDC-1, the low-order configuration of CSC-1, and the most ordered geometry of CDC-5. The catenated cages with subtle structural differences therefore provide a promising platform for the search of emerging hierarchical superstructures that might be applied to proton conductivity, ferroelectricity, and catalysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3acatenanes 3ageometry 3aimines 3amoieties 3aproteins1 aLi, Pan1 aXu, Shijun1 aLi, Zi-Ying1 aNomura, Yoshiaki1 aLi, Zimu1 aLiu, Xiaoyun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9838-11091 aZhang, Shaodong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7923-84570 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2020 May 20, v. 142, no. 24 p.10833-10840dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.0c033303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01993naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245009400208300001600302520081500318592002801133650001401161650002501175650001701200650001801217650001301235650001301248650001201261650001301273700005701286700002401343700006401367773012101431856008201552852000901634655001201643IND60681029220221120233158.0200113e20190902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068102922DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biomac.9b010882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Sung-Po R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4257-388910aUV-Cross-Linked Polymer Nanostructures with Preserved Asymmetry and Surface Functionality  ap. 133-142.  aPolymer nanostructures can be designed with tailored properties and functions by varying their shape, chemical compositions, and surface functionality. The poor stability of these soft materials in solvent other than water can be overcome by introducing cross-links. However, cross-linking complex morphologies remains a challenge. Here, by using the temperature-directed morphology transformation method, we show that the symmetric (nanoworm) and asymmetric (tadpole) nanostructure cores can be UV-cross-linked through the coupling of styrene and para-chlorostyrene units found in the core by irradiating at 254 nm for up to 5 h. Once cross-linked, these nanostructures maintain their structure in organic solvent, further allowing us to couple on a water-insoluble pro-fluorescent probe with high efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasymmetry 3achemical composition 3acrosslinking 3ananomaterials 3apolymers 3asolvents 3astyrene 3atadpoles1 aJia, Zhongfan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9690-72881 aBobrin, Valentin A.1 aMonteiro, Michael J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5624-71150 tBiomacromolecules.g2019 Sept. 02, v. 21, no. 1 p.133-142dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12556x1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biomac.9b010883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01669naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245005800168300001600226500002900242520069200271592002800963650001300991650001801004650001301022650002201035700001901057700001601076700001701092700002101109773012401130856008001254852000901334655001201343IND60688633020221121065601.0200416e20020801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068863302DNAL7 a10.1080/09614502201497802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDierolf, Thomas S10aHeifer International: Growing a learning organisation  ap. 436-448.  aNALT-AP-4-rerunAP2-fuzzy  aHeifer International (HI) has been applying participatory approaches to rural development for nearly 60 years.

This research inquired the influence of exercise on liver insulin sensitivity and whole body insulin resistance in high-fat diet fed rats.Forty male Sprague-Dawley rats at seven-week-old were assigned to four groups at random: standard diet as normal control group (NC, n = 10), high-fat diet group (HFD, n = 10), high-fat diet with chronic exercise intervention group (HFD-CE, n = 10) and high-fat diet with acute exercise intervention group (HFD-AE, n = 10).Compared with rats fed with a standard diet, eight-week high-fat diet feeding lead to elevated body weight, visceral fat content and serum FFAs, and decreased insulin sensitivity index. Moreover, high-fat diet enhanced NFE2 protein expression and miR-423-5p level, decreased FAM3A mRNA and protein expression, ATP level and Akt phosphorylation in liver. In contrast, physical exercise, both chronic and acute exercise alleviated whole body insulin resistance, reduced hepatic NFE2 and miR-423-5p expression, and serum FFAs level, meanwhile enhanced FAM3A mRNA and protein expression, ATP level and Akt phosphorylation in liver. The current findings indicated that exercise in diet-induced obesity, both chronic and acute, induce a momentous regulation in NFE2/miR-423-5p and FAM3A-ATP-Akt pathway in liver, and improve hepatic insulin sensitivity and whole body insulin resistance.All these results supply crucial evidence in our comprehending of the molecular mechanism that connected exercise to an alleviation of insulin resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine triphosphate 3ablood serum 3aexercise 3ahigh fat diet 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3alaboratory animals 3alipid content 3aliver 3amales 3amessenger RNA 3aobesity 3aphosphorylation 3aprotein synthesis 3arats 3avisceral fat 0aExercise 0aInsulin resistance 0aNFE2 0amiR-423-5p 0aFAM3A1 aWan, Jianyong1 aLiu, Shiqiang1 aHua, Tianmiao1 aSun, Qingyan0 tLife sciences.g2018 Aug. 15, v. 207 p.23-29dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2018.05.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02692naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002300189245009600212300001600308520142300324592002801747650001901775650002301794650001101817650001201828650001801840650001501858650002601873700002701899700002301926700001901949700002301968700002701991700002602018700002302044773008902067856008202156990002302238852000902261655001202270IND60095057820221116160209.0141104e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009505782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.diff.2012.04.0072doi7 aPMC38356762pmcid7 a227216782pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGavrilov, Svetlana10aTbx6 is a determinant of cardiac and neural cell fate decisions in multipotent P19CL6 cells  ap. 176-184.  aMultipotent P19CL6 cells differentiate into cardiac myocytes or neural lineages when stimulated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or retinoic acid (RA), respectively. Expression of the transcription factor Tbx6 was found to increase during cardiac myocyte differentiation and to decrease during neural differentiation. Overexpression of Tbx6 was not sufficient to drive P19CL6 cells to a cardiac myocyte fate or to accelerate DMSO-induced differentiation. In contrast, knockdown of Tbx6 dramatically inhibited DMSO-induced differentiation of P19CL6 cells to cardiac myocytes, as evidenced by the loss of striated muscle-specific markers and spontaneous beating. Tbx6 knockdown was also accompanied by almost complete loss of Nkx2.5, a transcription factor involved in the specification of the cardiac myocyte lineage, indicating that Nkx2.5 is downstream of Tbx6. In distinction to its positive role in cardiac myocyte differentiation, Tbx6 knockdown augmented RA-induced differentiation of P19CL6 cells to both neurons and glia, and accelerated the rate of neurite formation. Conversely, Tbx6 overexpression attenuated differentiation to neural lineages. Thus, in the P19CL6 model, Tbx6 is required for cardiac myocyte differentiation and represses neural differentiation. We propose a model in which Tbx6 is a part of a molecular switch that modulates divergent differentiation programs within a single progenitor cell.  aPublisher supplied data 3acardiomyocytes 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3amodels 3aneurons 3aretinoic acid 3astem cells 3atranscription factors1 aNührenberg, Thomas G.1 aAshton, Anthony W.1 aPeng, Chang-Fu1 aMoore, Jennifer C.1 aKonstantinidis, Klitos1 aMummery, Christine L.1 aKitsis, Richard N.0 tDifferentiation.g2012 Sept., v. 84, no. 2 p.176-184dElsevier B.V.x0301-46817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.diff.2012.04.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02848naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245012700170300001400297520145000311592002801761650001401789650001701803650003101820650001901851650001101870650001901881650001501900650002001915650003401935650001901969653002401988653001902012653002002031653002002051653002102071700002202092700002202114700002002136700001202156700001902168773011002187856008402297852000902381655001202390IND60604838720221120221642.0180718e20150315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060483872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2014.12.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoday, Bryan D.10aIndirect determination of zeta potential at high ionic strength: Specific application to semipermeable polymeric membranes  ap. 58-64.  aThe understanding of membrane charge neutralization and diffuse layer compression at environmentally relevant ionic strengths is becoming increasingly important. In this work, the impact of high ionic strengths on membrane zeta potential was determined using a combination of streaming potential measurements and theoretical modeling. Streaming potential measurements were conducted on cellulose triacetate (CTA) and polyamide thin-film composite (TFC) membranes at ionic strengths within the operating limits of an electrokinetic analyzer. Zeta potential calculated from streaming potential was then extrapolated to environmentally relevant ionic strengths (0.05 to 1 M 1:1 electrolyte) using the Debye–Hückel and Helmholtz-Smoluchowski models. Extrapolated zeta potential values revealed that membrane charge neutralization and compression of the diffuse layer are limited by the size of the hydrated counter-ions, and full membrane charge neutralization, or even charge reversal, can not be achieved. The expected zeta potential of CTA membranes was similar to that of TFC membranes at high ionic strength, which has considerable implications in the comparison of membrane performance when treating brackish and saline feed waters. The methodologies developed in this work can help to better understand the contribution of electrostatic forces resulting from zeta potential to the sum of interfacial forces present at the membrane surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3acellulose 3aelectrolytes 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aionic strength 3amodels 3aneutralization 3apolyamides 3asurface tension 3athin film composite membranes 3azeta potential 0aStreaming potential 0aZeta potential 0aForward osmosis 0aReverse osmosis 0aSolute rejection1 aLuxbacher, Thomas1 aChildress, Amy E.1 aAlmaraz, Nohemi1 aXu, Pei1 aCath, Tzahi Y.0 tJournal of membrane science.g2015 Mar. 15, v. 478 p.58-64dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2014.12.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03470naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005200147245014200199300001300341520169900354592002802053650002002081650002102101650001502122650001902137650001802156650001802174650001102192650002202203650002102225650002002246650001102266650001602277650001702293650001102310650001302321650004302334650000902377650005202386650001802438653002302456653001602479653001502495653002402510653002602534700002402560700001702584700001702601700001702618700005302635700001802688773009502706856008202801852000902883655001202892IND60609556420221122225434.0181002e20180815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060955642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2018.05.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Kang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8492-205810aEmodin as a selective proliferative inhibitor of vascular smooth muscle cells versus endothelial cells suppress arterial intima formation  ap. 9-14.  aA well-known natural anthraquinone “Emodin”, has been proven to inhibit the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). But the anti-proliferative effects of emodin on both VSMCs versus vascular endothelial cells (VECs) are still largely unknown. Herein, a comparative study for the evaluation of anti-proliferation effects of emodin on human VSMCs and VECs was designed. Various methodologies including MTS, EdU assay, FACS analysis, qRT-PCR and mitochondrial fluorescent probes were used for detecting cell viabilities, DNA synthesis rate, cell cycle, proliferation genes expression levels and mitochondrial activities, respectively. In addition, carotid arteries balloon injury was performed to evaluate the effects of emodin on intima hyperplasia (IH) and re-endothelialization. The emodin showed a dose-dependent (0.05 to 5 μM) inhibition of hVSMCs proliferation was quiet higher than hVECs in vitro. Conditioned culture media with a range of emodin concentrations (2.5, and 5 μM) reduced CDK1, Ki67, and E2F-1 gene expression, along with inhibition of mitochondrial activities in both hVSMCs and hVECs cells, while former remained highly sensitive. Emodin (10 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally for 2 weeks, and had obvious alleviation in an endothelial denudation induced-IH formation and limited interfere-endothelialization in injured arteries in vivo. Emodin preferentially inhibited hVSMCs proliferation but not the hVECs in vitro and had limited influence on the re-endothelialization of later in a rat artery endothelial denudation model. It is concluded that emodin will provide a promising approach for efficient prevention of blood vessel restenosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA replication 3acarotid arteries 3acell cycle 3acell viability 3aculture media 3adose response 3aemodin 3aendothelial cells 3afluorescent dyes 3agene expression 3ahumans 3ahyperplasia 3amitochondria 3amodels 3amyocytes 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arats 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asmooth muscle 0aAnti-proliferation 0aSelectively 0aCell cycle 0aIntimal hyperplasia 0aRe-endothelialization1 aAl-ani, Mohanad Kh.1 aWang, Chunli1 aQiu, Xuefeng1 aChi, Qingjia1 aZhu, Peng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8724-40991 aDong, Nianguo0 tLife sciences.g2018 Aug. 15, v. 207 p.9-14dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2018.05.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02424naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012500159300001600284520105100300592002801351650002201379650001501401650001501416650001901431650002601450650002601476650002001502650004101522650001901563650001501582650001301597650003301610650002701643650002301670650001401693650001801707650000901725700001901734700001801753773012401771856007401895852000901969655001201978IND60656565820221121101312.0190814e20120301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065656582DNAL7 a10.1039/c2ay05878b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Guan-Hua10aExploration of a coordination polymer as a novel sorbent for the solid-phase extraction of benzo[a]pyrene in edible oils  ap. 647-651.  aIn this paper, a zinc(ii) coordination polymer, [Zn(BTA)₂]ₙ (BTAH = benzotriazole) was prepared, characterized and explored as a novel sorbent for the solid-phase extraction of trace benzo[a]pyrene in edible oils, with analysis using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in selected ion monitoring mode (GC-MS, SIM). The resulting material was characterized by XRD, SEM, nitrogen adsorption analysis and elemental analysis. The adsorbent shows great adsorption affinity towards aromatics due to the strong π–π interaction and hydrophobic effect. Herein, benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) in edible oil was chosen as a probe to validate the adsorption capacity and selectivity of the material. With extraction of 0.5 g sample oil, three spiked levels at 0.5–8 μg kg⁻¹ were added, with recoveries in the range of 88.7–106% and relative standard deviations ranging from 2.9 to 9.4%. The detection limit is 0.075 μg kg⁻¹. The proposed method has been successfully applied for the trace analysis of BaP in several kinds of edible vegetable oil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3abenzo(a)pyrene 3acooking fats and oils 3acoordination polymers 3adetection limit 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahydrophobicity 3amonitoring 3anitrogen 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolid phase extraction 3astandard deviation 3atriazoles 3avegetable oil 3azinc1 aLei, Yong-Qian1 aSong, Hua-Can0 tAnalytical methods.g2012 Mar. 1, v. 4, no. 3 p.647-651dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2ay05878b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02444naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005600151245007600207520116700283592002801450650001601478650001301494650001701507650001201524650002001536650001601556650002101572650001601593650001701609653001201626653002001638653001701658653001601675653002001691653001401711700001701725700001701742700007501759773009301834856008601927852000902013655001202022IND60735635820221117015806.0211123e20210901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073563582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2021.1224172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSett, Arghya1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8356-514012aA malachite green light-up aptasensor for the detection of theophylline  aBiosensors are of interest for the quantitative detection of small molecules (metabolites, drugs and contaminants for instance). To this end, fluorescence is a widely used technique that is easily associated to aptamers. Light-up aptamers constitute a particular class of oligonucleotides that, specifically induce fluorescence emission when binding to cognate fluorogenic ligands such as malachite green (MG). We engineered a dual aptasensor for theophylline (Th) based on the combination of switching hairpin aptamers specific for MG on the one hand and for Th on the other hand, hence their names: malaswitch (Msw) and theoswitch (Thsw). The two aptaswitches form a loop-loop or kissing Msw-Thsw complex only in the presence of theophylline, allowing binding of MG, subsequently generating a fluorescent signal. The combination of the best Msw and Thsw variants, MswG12 and Thsw19.1, results in a 20-fold fluorescence enhancement of MG at saturating theophylline concentration. This aptasensor discriminates between theophylline and its analogues caffeine and theobromine. Kissing aptaswitches derived from light-up aptamers constitute a novel sensing device.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaptasensors 3acaffeine 3afluorescence 3aligands 3amalachite green 3ametabolites 3aoligonucleotides 3atheobromine 3atheophylline 0aAptamer 0aMalachite green 0aFluorescence 0aRNA hairpin 0aKissing complex 0aBiosensor1 aZara, Lorena1 aDausse, Eric1 aToulmé, J.

Muscle derived stem cells, known as satellite cells are responsible for the maintenance and repair of muscle tissue post-natally and in vivo would be exposed to oxygen concentrations of ∼2–5%. Relatively few studies describe the function of these cells in large animal models and here we investigate the influence oxygen concentration has on modulating porcine muscle derived stem cell fate. We compared cells derived from two metabolically distinct muscles, the diaphragm and the hind limb semi-membranosus (SM) muscle. The two sub-populations responded differently to culture at atmospheric (∼20%) and physiological (∼5%) oxygen concentration. While myogenesis was enhanced in both populations at low oxygen, noticeably diaphragm derived cells exhibited greater myotube formation, than those from SM. The trans-differentiation of cells derived from these two sources was similarly affected, with considerable differences seen in adipogenic and neuronal tendencies. In addition to the effect of oxygen on cell phenotype, the expression of key signalling proteins varied between the two sub-populations during early time-points of induced differentiation, suggesting altered regulation of muscle specific stem cells under these conditions. While differences in muscle stem cell potential requires further investigation, the culture of cells in physiological oxygen concentration appears as fundamental to recreating the micro-environmental niche as routinely used factors such as cytokines, substrata and matrices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3acytokines 3adiaphragm 3amuscle development 3amuscle tissues 3aoxygen 3aphenotype 3aproteins 3astem cells 3aswine1 aLoughna, Paul T.0 tDifferentiation.g2012 Sept., v. 84, no. 2 p.193-202dElsevier B.V.x0301-46817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.diff.2012.06.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03443naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245009600173300001600269520188000285592002802165650002702193650001402220650001702234650001502251650001002266650001702276650001802293650001602311650002002327650001402347650001902361650002602380650000902406650001402415650001302429650002302442650002402465700001902489700001902508700002402527700006102551700006002612700006502672773012102737856008202858852000902940655001202949IND60681029520221120233027.0200113e20190910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068102952DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biomac.9b011152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarrison, Tristan D.10aPhosphonium Polyelectrolyte Complexes for the Encapsulation and Slow Release of Ionic Cargo  ap. 152-162.  aPolyelectrolyte complexation, the combination of anionically and cationically charged polymers through ionic interactions, can be used to form hydrogel networks. These networks can be used to encapsulate and release cargo, but the release of cargo is typically rapid, occurring over a period of hours to a few days and they often exhibit weak, fluid-like mechanical properties. Here we report the preparation and study of polyelectrolyte complexes (PECs) from sodium hyaluronate (HA) and poly[tris(hydroxypropyl)(4-vinylbenzyl)phosphonium chloride], poly[triphenyl(4-vinylbenzyl)phosphonium chloride], poly[tri(n-butyl)(4-vinylbenzyl)phosphonium chloride], or poly[triethyl(4-vinylbenzyl)phosphonium chloride]. The networks were compacted by ultracentrifugation, then their composition, swelling, rheological, and self-healing properties were studied. Their properties depended on the structure of the phosphonium polymer and the salt concentration, but in general, they exhibited predominantly gel-like behavior with relaxation times greater than 40 s and self-healing over 2–18 h. Anionic molecules, including fluorescein, diclofenac, and adenosine-5′-triphosphate, were encapsulated into the PECs with high loading capacities of up to 16 wt %. Fluorescein and diclofenac were slowly released over 60 days, which was attributed to a combination of hydrophobic and ionic interactions with the dense PEC network. The cytotoxicities of the polymers and their corresponding networks with HA to C2C12 mouse myoblast cells was investigated and found to depend on the structure of the polymer and the properties of the network. Overall, this work demonstrates the utility of polyphosphonium-HA networks for the loading and slow release of ionic drugs and that their physical and biological properties can be readily tuned according to the structure of the phosphonium polymer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine triphosphate 3achlorides 3acytotoxicity 3adiclofenac 3adrugs 3aelectrolytes 3aencapsulation 3afluorescein 3ahyaluronic acid 3ahydrogels 3ahydrophobicity 3amechanical properties 3amice 3amyoblasts 3apolymers 3asalt concentration 3aultracentrifugation1 aYunyaeva, Olga1 aBorecki, Aneta1 aHopkins, Cameron C.1 ade Bruyn, John R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9431-67481 aRagogna, Paul J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2727-76351 aGillies, Elizabeth R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3983-22480 tBiomacromolecules.g2019 Sept. 10, v. 21, no. 1 p.152-162dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12556x1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biomac.9b011153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01649naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245006700168300001600235500002900251520077800280592002801058650001101086650001401097650001101111650001301122650001101135773012401146856008001270852000901350655001201359IND60688633420221121065510.0200416e20020801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068863342DNAL7 a10.1080/09614502201498252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWallace, Marshall14aThe learning process of the Local Capacities for Peace Project  ap. 480-489.  aNALT-AP-4-rerunAP2-fuzzy  aIf aid is found to support a war effort, should aid agencies and practitioners continue to give it? The resounding answer given by aid workers all over the world is that the needs of suffering people are too important to ignore and, further, that there can be no justification for not assisting suffering people. But how can one provide aid in the context of conflict without exacerbating the conflict? The Local Capacities for Peace Project (LCPP) was formed in 1994 to learn how aid and conflict interact in order to help aid workers find a way to address human needs without feeding conflict. This paper will discuss how the learning process of the LCPP was designed, the results gained at each step, and how the results were fed back to the participating organisations.  aPublisher supplied data 3adesign 3afirst aid 3ahumans 3alearning 3apeople0 tDevelopment in practice.g2002 Aug. 1, v. 12, no. 3-4 p.480-489dTaylor & Francis GroupwJournal:12201x1364-92137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09614502201498253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02562naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002500143245015400168520119700322592002801519650001001547650001701557650002601574650001801600650001001618650002201628650001801650650002301668650000901691650003101700650002701731650001801758700002101776700002501797700001901822700001801841700001801859700002001877700002301897773012101920856007802041852000902119655001202128IND60794160620221123030610.0220922e20220918xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079416062DNAL7 a10.3390/foods111828942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoffman, Louwrens C.10aCharacterisation and Identification of Individual Intact Goat Muscle Samples (Capra sp.) Using a Portable Near-Infrared Spectrometer and Chemometrics  aAdulterated, poor-quality, and unsafe foods, including meat, are still major issues for both the food industry and consumers, which have driven efforts to find alternative technologies to detect these challenges. This study evaluated the use of a portable near-infrared (NIR) instrument, combined with chemometrics, to identify and classify individual-intact fresh goat muscle samples. Fresh goat carcasses (n = 35; 19 to 21.7 Kg LW) from different animals (age, breeds, sex) were used and separated into different commercial cuts. Thus, the longissimus thoracis et lumborum, biceps femoris, semimembranosus, semitendinosus, supraspinatus, and infraspinatus muscles were removed and scanned (900–1600 nm) using a portable NIR instrument. Differences in the NIR spectra of the muscles were observed at wavelengths of around 976 nm, 1180 nm, and 1430 nm, associated with water and fat content (e.g., intramuscular fat). The classification of individual muscle samples was achieved by linear discriminant analysis (LDA) with acceptable accuracies (68–94%) using the second-derivative NIR spectra. The results indicated that NIR spectroscopy could be used to identify individual goat muscles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapra 3achemometrics 3adiscriminant analysis 3afood industry 3agoats 3aintramuscular fat 3alipid content 3alongissimus muscle 3ameat 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3asemimembranosus muscle 3aspectrometers1 aIngle, Prasheek 1 aKhole, Ankita Hemant1 aZhang, Shuxin 1 aYang, Zhiyin 1 aBeya, Michel 1 aBureš, Daniel 1 aCozzolino, Daniel 0 tFoods.g2022 Sept. 18, v. 11, no. 18dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods111828943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02531naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245008500172300001400257520110800271592002801379650002101407650001801428650003801446650001701484650001801501650001801519650001601537650001901553650002101572650001601593650001601609650001901625653001801644653001801662653001401680653002101694653002401715700003101739700002601770700003001796700004101826773009801867856008701965852000902052655001202061IND60591060820221120034108.0190516e20180801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059106082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.02.1022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRicaurte, Leidy10aPhysical, thermal and thermodynamical study of high oleic palm oil nanoemulsions  ap. 62-70.  aNanoemulsions are useful for encapsulating nutritionally compounds of the high oleic palm oil (HOPO) including β-carotene and tocopherols. However, some nanoemulsions can be thermodynamically unstable. For this reason, it is important to understand the thermal and thermodynamic stability of nanoemulsions and to investigate both the parameters that cause, and the mechanisms associated with, the destabilization. In this sense, the DSC, TGA and destabilization analysis were used. In this work, the average droplet size (ADS) and zeta potential (ζ) had a significant influence over HOPO nanoemulsions stability. The range of ADS and ζ were between 162 and 839 nm and −9 to −40 mV, respectively. Furthermore, the HOPO nanoemulsions were establish until temperatures of 80 °C, showing lower loss of weight when the ADS was higher. Additionally, the destabilization of nanoemulsions occurred by the Ostwald ripening mechanism. The Ostwald ripening rate was provided as stability parameter which increased to nanoemulsions with ADS higher between 5 × 10−23 and 8 × 10−23 m3/s.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOstwald ripening 3abeta-carotene 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3adroplet size 3aencapsulation 3ananoemulsions 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 3athermogravimetry 3atocopherols 3aweight loss 3azeta potential 0aNanoemulsions 0aThermodynamic 0aStability 0aOstwald ripening 0aHigh oleic palm oil1 aHernández-Carrión, Maria1 aMoyano-Molano, Miguel1 aClavijo-Romero, Angélica1 aQuintanilla Carvajal, María Ximena,0 tFood chemistry.g2018 Aug. 01, v. 256 p.62-70dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.02.1023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03219naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001500143245010600158520168100264592002801945650001601973650002001989650002602009650001602035650002602051650001502077650001702092650001302109650001402122650001402136650001002150650002302160650001202183650003002195650002202225650001502247650001702262650001102279650002702290650001502317650002002332650001402352700001802366700001802384700001802402700001902420700001502439700001502454773012102469856007802590852000902668655001202677IND60794160820221123030626.0220922e20220918xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079416082DNAL7 a10.3390/foods111828972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yilin 10aEffects of Two Kinds of Extracts of Cistanche deserticola on Intestinal Microbiota and Its Metabolism  aCistanche deserticola belongs to the Liedang family. Known as “desert ginseng”, it has high medicinal value and plays important roles in endocrine regulation, neuroprotection, immune regulation, and other processes. Some studies have shown that single substances such as polysaccharides and phenylethanolside can affect intestinal microbiota, but few studies have studied the synergistic effect of various components in Cistanche deserticola extracts on intestinal microbiota. Therefore, in this study, through an in vitro digestion model (Changdao Moni, CDMN) combined with 16S rRNA gene amplification sequencing technology and untargeted metabolomics technology, it was found that the two extracts all had significant effects on the enteric cavity and mucosal flora. Both extracts inhibited Bacteroides in the intestinal cavity and Parabacteroides and Ruminococcus 2 in the intestinal mucosa and promoted Bifidobacterium and Prevotella in the intestinal cavity and Megasphaera in the intestinal mucosa. The aqueous extract also inhibited Phascolarctobacterium. Both extracts also significantly increased the production of short-chain fatty acids, especially butyrate. The intake of extract had significant effects on the metabolic pathways related to amino acids and lipids. Indoles were upregulated by the aqueous extract but downregulated by the alcohol extract. In addition, the extract also had a significant effect on the hemolytic phosphorus esters. In conclusion, the two kinds of extracts have different effects on intestinal microbiota and its metabolism. This study provides guiding significance for the edibility and food development of Cistanche deserticola.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroides 3aBifidobacterium 3aCistanche deserticola 3aMegasphaera 3aPhascolarctobacterium 3aPrevotella 3aRuminococcus 3aalcohols 3abutyrates 3adigestion 3aflora 3agene amplification 3aindoles 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestinal mucosa 3ametabolism 3ametabolomics 3amodels 3aneuroprotective effect 3aphosphorus 3apolysaccharides 3asynergism1 aZhang, Yalin 1 aSu, Xiaoming 1 aZou, Pengfei 1 aWang, Xinyang 1 aChen, Jie 1 aZhu, Xuan 0 tFoods.g2022 Sept. 18, v. 11, no. 18dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods111828973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03299naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003000148245012900178300001600307520180000323592002802123650001602151650001802167650002502185650002502210650001902235650002102254650002502275650002302300650000902323650001002332650002402342650002102366650001602387650001902403650001102422650001802433650001502451650001202466650002602478650002302504700002002527700002102547700002302568773008802591856008202679990002302761852000902784655001202793IND60095058520221116160131.0141104e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009505852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.diff.2012.07.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParameswaran, Vijayakumar10aESSA1 embryonic stem like cells from gilthead seabream: A new tool to study mesenchymal cell lineage differentiation in fish  ap. 240-251.  aEmbryonic stem (ES) cells are a promising tool for generation of transgenic animals and an ideal experimental model for in vitro studies of embryonic cell development, differentiation and gene manipulation. Here we report the development and initial characterization of a pluripotent embryonic stem like cell line, designated as ESSA1, derived from blastula stage embryos of the gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata, L). ESSA1 cells are cultured in Leibovitz’s L-15 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and, unlike other ES cells, without a feeder layer. They have a round or polygonal morphology, grow exponentially in culture and form dense colonies. ESSA1 cells also exhibit intense alkaline phosphatase activity, normal karyotype and are positive for stage-specific embryonic antigen-1 (SSEA1) and octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (Oct4) markers for up to 30 passages. Upon treatment with all-trans retinoic acid, ESSA1 cells differentiate into neuron-like, oligodendritic, myocyte and melanocyte cells; they can also form embryoid bodies when seeded in bacteriological plates, a characteristic usually associated with pluripotency. The capacity of ESSA1 cells to differentiate into osteoblastic, chondroblastic or osteoclastic cell lineages and to produce a mineralized extracellular matrix in vitro was demonstrated through histochemical techniques and further confirmed by immunocytochemistry using lineage-specific markers. Furthermore, ESSA1 cells can be used to produce chimera, where they contribute to the development of a variety of tissues including the trunk and gut of zebrafish embryos and fry. Thus, ESSA1 cells represent a promising model for investigating bone-lineage cell differentiation in fish and also highlight the potential of piscine stem cell research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aSparus aurata 3aalkaline phosphatase 3acell differentiation 3acultured cells 3adigestive system 3aextracellular matrix 3afetal bovine serum 3afish 3agenes 3aimmunocytochemistry 3ain vitro studies 3akaryotyping 3amineralization 3amodels 3aretinoic acid 3astem cells 3atissues 3atranscription factors 3atransgenic animals1 aLaizé, Vincent1 aGavaia, Paulo J.1 aLeonor Cancela, M.0 tDifferentiation.g2012 Oct., v. 84, no. 3 p.240-251dElsevier B.V.x0301-46817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.diff.2012.07.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03016naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001200152245016600164300001600330520155900346592002801905650001301933650002401946650001601970650001301986650001501999650001402014650001302028650002202041650001502063653002202078653001802100653002502118653002302143653003002166700005702196700001602253700005802269700001402327700001602341773011702357856008702474852000902561655001202570IND60644185020221122014041.0190923e20190901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064418502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2019.05.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Yao10aResearch on the application of aviation kerosene in a direct injection rotary engine-Part 1: Fundamental spray characteristics and optimized injection strategies  ap. 519-532.  aIn view of the gradual promotion of Single Fuel Concept in the military field and also the rotary engine (RE) which has been widely applied in specialized equipment, it is necessary to study the basic spray characteristics of aviation kerosene under RE operation conditions and optimize the fuel injection strategies. In this research, an optically visible constant volume combustion chamber platform for Mie-scattering and a validated three-dimensional dynamic simulation model of aviation kerosene fueled direct injection rotary engine (DI-RE) were established. The experimental results show that the ambient temperature and pressure affect the spray process differently. There is no linear relationship between ambient temperature and penetration length. The ambient temperature of 600 K is a watershed, when it is below 600 K, the penetration length increases as the temperature rises. When the temperature reaches 600 K, the penetration length decreases rapidly which means a prominent improvement of atomization quality. On the basis of experimental results, the simulation was carried out and the results show that different injection strategies have important effect on distribution of fuel in cylinder, the larger injection angle will promote the atomization of fuel due to the collision between the spray and air flow field. In Case A3, B2 and C2, the fuel mainly distributes near the spark plugs in the center of the combustion chamber, which is supposed to be more conducive to the ignition and diffusion combustion process of the fuel.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair flow 3aambient temperature 3aatomization 3aaviation 3acombustion 3aequipment 3akerosene 3asimulation models 3awatersheds 0aAviation kerosene 0aRotary engine 0aSpray characteristic 0aInjection strategy 0aExperiment and simulation1 aPan, Jianfeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8962-30681 aFan, Baowei1 aOtchere, Peter1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5212-094X1 aChen, Wei1 aCheng, Biao0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2019 Sept. 01, v. 195 p.519-532dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2019.05.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05077naa a2201045 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245013300184300001600317520200000333592002802333650002402361650001402385650001802399650001402417650001802431650001602449650001202465650002202477650002002499650001802519650001602537650001202553650002202565650002502587650000902612650004302621650002402664650001402688650000902702650001202711650001602723650002802739650001402767650002102781650002002802650001502822650006302837650005702900650002402957650002702981650001703008650003703025650003003062650001103092650005603103650002403159650003903183650000903222650002303231650006303254650007103317653002403388653000903412653000803421653000803429653000903437653001003446653000703456653000803463653000803471653000803479653000903487653001403496653002003510653004103530653002403571700001803595700001303613700001903626700001503645700001403660700001503674700001703689700001903706700001803725700001403743700001503757700002003772700001303792773012303805856008203928852000904010655001204019IND50069687120221120164655.0220214e20131028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006968712DNAL7 a240125272pmid7 a10.1016/j.jep.2013.08.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, Xin-gang10aNatural product vindoline stimulates insulin secretion and efficiently ameliorates glucose homeostasis in diabetic murine models  ap. 285-297.  aCatharanthus roseus (L). Don (Catharanthus roseus) is a traditional anti-diabetic herb widely used in many countries, and the alkaloids of Catharanthus roseus are considered to possess hypoglycemic ability. To systematically investigate the potential anti-diabetic effects and the underlying anti-diabetic mechanisms of vindoline, one of the alkaloids in Catharanthus roseus. The regulation of vindoline against the glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) was examined in insulinoma MIN6 cells and primary pancreatic islets. Insulin concentration was detected by Elisa assay. Diabetic models of db/db mice and type 2 diabetic rats induced by high-fat diet combining with streptozotocin (STZ/HFD-induced type 2 diabetic rats) were used to evaluate the anti-diabetic effect of vindoline in vivo. Daily oral treatment with vindoline (20mg/kg) to diabetic mice/rats for 4 weeks, body weight and blood glucose were determined every week, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed after 4 weeks. Vindoline enhanced GSIS in both glucose- and dose-dependent manners (EC₅₀=50μM). It was determined that vindoline acted as a Kv2.1 inhibitor able to reduce the voltage-dependent outward potassium currents finally enhancing insulin secretion. It protected β-cells from the cytokines-induced apoptosis following its inhibitory role in Kv2.1. Moreover, vindoline (20mg/kg) treatment significantly improved glucose homeostasis in db/db mice and STZ/HFD-induced type 2 diabetic rats, as reflected by its functions in increasing plasma insulin concentration, protecting the pancreatic β-cells from damage, decreasing fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA₁c), improving OGTT and reducing plasma triglyceride (TG). Our findings suggested that vindoline might contribute to the anti-diabetic effects of Catharanthus roseus, and this natural product may find its more applications in the improvement of β-cell dysfunction and further the potential treatment of type 2 diabetes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCatharanthus roseus 3aalkaloids 3aanimal models 3aapoptosis 3ablood glucose 3abody weight 3aglucose 3aglucose tolerance 3aglycohemoglobin 3ahigh fat diet 3ahomeostasis 3ainsulin 3ainsulin secretion 3aislets of Langerhans 3amice 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aoral administration 3apotassium 3arats 2aAnimals 2aApocynaceae 2aApoptosisxdrug effects 2aCHO Cells 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCells, Cultured 2aCricetulus 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Experimentalxdrug therapyxmetabolism. 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xdrug therapyxmetabolism. 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aGlucose Tolerance Test 2aHEK293 Cells 2aGlycated Hemoglobinxmetabolism. 2aHomeostasisxdrug effects 2aHumans 2aHypoglycemic Agentsxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aInsulinxsecretion. 2aIslets of Langerhansxdrug effects 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aPotassium Channel Blockersxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aVinblastinexanalogs & derivativesxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 0aCatharanthus roseus 0aGSIS 0aHFD 0aSTZ 0aOGTT 0aHbA1c 0aTG 0aTEA 0aGly 0aFSK 0aLAME 0aVindoline 0aType 2 diabetes 0aGlucose-stimulated insulin secretion 0aβ-cell dysfunction1 aChen, Fanglei1 aLi, Ping1 aQuan, Lingling1 aChen, Jing1 aYu, Liang1 aDing, Hong1 aLi, Chenjing1 aChʻen, Li-li,1 aGao, Zhaobing1 aWan, Ping1 aHu, Lihong1 aJiang, Hualiang1 aShen, Xu0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2013 Oct. 28, v. 150, no. 1 p.285-297dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2013.08.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02932naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100001500161245006500176300001800241500000900259520189900268592002802167650002102195650001402216650002202230650002802252650002002280650001502300651001502315700001702330700001702347773012302364852000902487856009802496655001202594IND9301377220221119151124.0191122e199211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930137722DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1992.0011183X003200060005x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBell, M.J.10aNight Temperature Affects Radiation-Use Efficiency in Peanut  ap. 1329-1335.  aepub  aThree peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) cultivars were grown under optimal field conditions in two environments in subtropical Australia contrasting primarily in night temperature. Mean minimum temperatures during the growing season were 16.7 °C (Kingaroy, cool) and 20.1 °C (Bundaberg, warm). Dry matter production was similar in both environments, but pod yields were slightly higher with warm nights (P < 0.05). This occurred despite large differences in rates of development between environments, with plants of all cultivars in the warm night environment maturing 23 to 24 d earlier. Accumulation of energy-corrected dry matter was highly correlated with cumulative intercepted shortwave solar radiation. There were no significant differences among cultivars in the rate of accumulation of energy-corrected dry matter per unit of intercepted shortwave radiation (radiation-use efficiency; RUE, g MJ⁻¹) in either environment. Data were pooled within environments, with RUE in the warm environment 39% higher than with cool nights. This higher RUE in the warm nights occurred despite poorer radiation distribution within the canopy and lower specific leaf N. A subsequent glasshouse study with ‘Early Bunch’ peanut compared growth and RUE at day/night temperature regimes of 33/23 °C and 33/17 °C, and confirmed the role of night temperature in determining RUE. Cool night effects were associated with increased specific leaf weight and lower stomatal conductances. Both effects were evident from 7 d after start of treatments, but differences were never greater than ≈ 10%. Analysis of published RUE data for Early Bunch peanut from tropical and subtropical environments collectively showed a highly significant (P < 0.01) negative linear relationship between RUE and night temperature.

M.10aStructure of the Polymer Backbones in polyMOF Materials  ap. 10863-10868.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe molecular connectivity of polymer−metal−organic framework (polyMOF) hybrid materials was investigated using density functional theory calculations and solid-state NMR spectroscopy. The architectural constraints that dictate the formation of polyMOFs were assessed by examining poly(1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid) (pbdc) polymers in two archetypical MOF lattices (UiO-66 and IRMOF-1). Modeling of the polyMOFs showed that in the IRMOF-1-type lattice, six, seven, and eight methylene (−CH₂−) groups between 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate (terephthalate, bdc²–) units can be accommodated without significant distortions, while in the UiO-66-type lattice, an optimal spacing of seven methylene groups between bdc²– units is needed to minimize strain. Solid-state NMR supports these predictions and reveals pronounced spectral differences for the same polymer in the two polyMOF lattices. With seven methylene groups, polyUiO-66-7a shows 7 ± 3% of uncoordinated terephthalate linkers, while these are undetectable (<4%) in the corresponding polyIRMOF-1-7a. In addition, NMR-detected backbone mobility is significantly higher in the polyIRMOF-1-7a than in the corresponding polyUiO-66-7a, again indicative of taut chains in the latter.  aPublisher supplied data 3adensity functional theory 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolymers1 aYuan, Shichen1 aAyala, Sergio1 aDuan, Pu1 aSemino, Rocio1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3937-74141 aCohen, Seth M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5233-22801 aSchmidt-Rohr, Klaus1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3188-48281 aMaurin, G.q(Guillaume),0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2020 May 25, v. 142, no. 24 p.10863-10868dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.0c045463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02195naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245017300165520107100338592002801409650001501437650001701452650001801469650002001487650002401507650002101531650002001552650001701572700002301589700001601612700002101628773012101649856007801770852000901848655001201857IND60794157620221122152145.0220922e20220916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079415762DNAL7 a10.3390/foods111828672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarag, Mohamed A.10aUV Fingerprinting Approaches for Quality Control Analyses of Food and Functional Food Coupled to Chemometrics: A Comprehensive Analysis of Novel Trends and Applications  a(1) Background: Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy is a common analytical tool to detect chromophore in compounds by monitoring absorbance spectral wavelengths. Further, it could provide spectral information about complex conjugated systems in mixtures aided by chemometric tools to visualize large UV-Vis datasets as typical in food samples. This review provides novel insight on UV-Vis applications in the last 20 years, as an advanced analytical tool in the quality control of food and dietary supplements, as well as several other applications, including chemotaxonomy, authentication, fingerprinting, and stability studies. (2) Conclusions: A critical assessment of the value of UV application and its novel trends in the quality control (QC) of nutraceuticals reveals the advantages and limitations, focusing on areas where future advancements are in need. Although simple, UV and its novel trends present potential analytical tools with an acceptable error for QC applications from a non-targeted perspective compared to other expensive spectral tools.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3achemometrics 3achemotaxonomy 3adata collection 3adietary supplements 3afunctional foods 3aquality control 3aspectroscopy1 aSheashea, Mohamed 1 aZhao, Chao 1 aMaamoun, Amal A.0 tFoods.g2022 Sept. 16, v. 11, no. 18dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods111828673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01907naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006000149245012600209300001800335520058200353592002800935650001400963650002800977650002301005650002101028650002001049650001301069700001501082700001401097700001701111700005301128700005801181700002101239700005901260773012101319856008401440852000901524655001201533IND60755671320221118234035.0211105e20211021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075567132DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.1c033182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Jian-Qiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4444-963010aCatalytic Asymmetric Dearomative 1,3-Dipolar Cycloaddition of 2-Nitrobenzothiophenes and Isatin-Derived Azomethine Ylides  ap. 8600-8605.  aAn enantioselective dearomative 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of 2-nitrobenzothiophenes and isatin-derived azomethine ylides with a bifunctional hydrogen-bonding thiourea catalyst was established, giving polyheterocyclic compounds in excellent results (up to 99% yield, >20:1 dr for all cases and up to 99% ee).

Modern voltammetric testing techniques were used for primarily investigating the redox electrochemical characterization of Fe(CN)₆³⁻/⁴⁻ and electrochemical behavior of insulin on nanocarbon electrode surface. At the same time, a plausible mechanism was also proposed to provide insights into understanding how to facilitate the electron transfer between insulin biomolecule and electrode surface. The results have shown that the pretreated AB/CPE represented high accumulation efficiency to insulin and promoted its direct electron transfer rate owing to the presence of nanocarbon particles and anodic pretreatment. It is found that insulin exhibited a very sensitive anodic peak at 0.47 V on the pretreated AB/CPE, and its peak current was increased about six times more than that on the pretreated carbon paste electrode (CPE). A linear relationship between the anodic peak current and the concentration of insulin from 20 to 1000 nM and a limit of detection as low as 5 nM were obtained using the pretreated AB/CPE. Attracting attention, the proposed method was applied to the realistic samples successfully and showed good recovery and reproducibility.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylene 3aanalytical methods 3acarbon electrodes 3acarbon nanoparticles 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectron transfer 3aferricyanides 3ainsulin1 aChen, Changguo1 aLuo, Zhongli1 aChen, Lin0 tAnalytical methods.g2012 May 3, v. 4, no. 5 p.1377-1382dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2ay05828f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03336naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002400180245015000204506007600354520137300430592002801803506003701831650002101868650001601889650001801905650001301923650001001936650001701946650001501963650001301978650000901991650001402000650002202014650001102036650001302047650004202060650002502102650001302127650001702140650001802157650001402175650001002189650003302199650001202232700002302244700002002267700001702287700002202304700002102326700002302347700002302370700002202393700002002415700002402435700002502459773012002484856007302604852000902677655001202686IND60653001520221207092814.0190713e20190526xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065300152DNAL7 a10.3390/v110504812doi7 aPMC65632852pmcid7 a311306992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLean, Fabian  Z.

However, its utility as an alternate animal model has not been fully explored. In this paper, we evaluated the pathogenesis of BTV in ovo using a pathogenic isolate of South African BTV serotype 3 (BTV-3) derived from the blood of an infected sheep. Endothelio- and neurotropism of BTV-3 were observed by immunohistochemistry of non-structural protein 1 (NS1), NS3, NS3/3a, and viral protein 7 (VP7) antigens. In comparing the pathogenicity of BTV from infectious sheep blood with cell-culture-passaged BTV, including virus propagated through a Culicoides-derived cell line (KC) or ECE, we found virus attenuation in ECE following cell-culture passage. Genomic analysis of the consensus sequences of segments (Seg)-2, -5, -6, -7, -8, -9, and -10 identified several nucleotide and amino-acid mutations among the cell-culture-propagated BTV-3. Deep sequencing analysis revealed changes in BTV-3 genetic diversity in various genome segments, notably a reduction of Seg-7 diversity following passage in cell culture. Using this novel approach to investigate BTV pathogenicity in ovo, our findings support the notion that pathogenic BTV becomes attenuated in cell culture and that this change is associated with virus quasispecies evolution.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBluetongue virus 3aamino acids 3aanimal models 3aantigens 3ablood 3acell culture 3acell lines 3achickens 3aeggs 3aevolution 3agenetic variation 3agenome 3agenomics 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amutation 3apathogenesis 3apathogenicity 3aserotypes 3asheep 3aviral nonstructural proteins 3aviruses1 aNeave, Matthew  J.1 aWhite, John R.,1 aPayne, Jean 1 aEastwood, Teresa 1 aBergfeld, Jemma 1 aDi Rubbo, Antonio 1 aStevens, Vittoria 1 aDavies, Kelly  R.1 aDevlin, Joanne 1 aWilliams, David T.,1 aBingham, J.q(John),0 tViruses.g2019 May 26, v. 11, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v110504813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02454naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245009500160520123600255592002801491650001701519650001701536650001801553650001001571650001701581650003201598650001901630650000901649650002001658650001601678650000801694700001801702700002001720700001701740700001801757700001601775700001801791700001501809773012101824856007801945852000902023655001202032IND60794157920221122175642.0220922e20220916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079415792DNAL7 a10.3390/foods111828712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMei, Tingna 10aIdentification and Evaluation of Microplastics from Tea Filter Bags Based on Raman Imaging  aMicroplastic (MP) contamination is a public issue for the environment and for human health. Plastic-based food filter bags, including polyethylene terephthalate, polypropylene, nylon 6 (NY6), and polyethylene, are widely used for soft drink sub-packaging, increasing the risk of MPs in foods and the environment. Three types of commercially available filter bags, including non-woven and woven bags, were collected, and MPs released after soaking were mapped using Raman imaging combined with chemometrics. Compared with peak area imaging at a single characteristic peak, Raman imaging combined with direct classical least squares calculation was more efficient and reliable for identifying MP features. Up to 94% of the bags released MPs after soaking, and there was no significant correlation with soaking conditions. Most MPs were tiny fragments and particles, and a few were fibrous MPs 620–840 μm in size. Woven NY6 filter bags had the lowest risk of releasing MPs. Source exploration revealed that most MPs originated from fragments and particles adsorbed on the surface of bags and strings. The results of this study are applicable to filter bag risk assessment and provide scientific guidance for regulating MPs in food.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemometrics 3ahuman health 3amicroplastics 3anylon 3apolyethylene 3apolyethylene terephthalates 3apolypropylenes 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3asoft drinks 3atea1 aWang, Jiahua 1 aXiao, Xiaofeng 1 aLv, Jingwen 1 aLi, Qiaocong 1 aHuang, Dai,1 aLiu, Xiaodan 1 aPi, Fuwei 0 tFoods.g2022 Sept. 16, v. 11, no. 18dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods111828713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02927naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005200142245005500194300002000249520114900269592002801418650001901446650001101465650001801476650002701494650002301521650003401544650001101578650002201589700001601611700001701627700002001644700001401664700005201678700001501730700001401745700006001759700005501819700001401874700001801888700005701906700005501963700005802018700005502076700005702131773014802188856007602336852000902412655001202421IND60699378920200904000000.0200617e20200527xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069937892DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.0c001922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQi, Jing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6859-750X10aForce-Activated Isomerization of a Single Molecule  ap. 10673-10680.  aUnderstanding and controlling isomerization at the single molecular level should provide new insight into the molecular dynamics and design guidelines of functional devices. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) has been demonstrated to be a powerful tool to study isomerization of single molecules on a substrate, by either electric field or inelastic electron tunneling mechanisms. A similar molecular isomerization process can in principle be induced by mechanical force; however, relevant study has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that isomerization of a N,N-dimethylamino-dianthryl-benzene molecule on Ag(100) can be mechanically driven by the STM tip. The existence of an out-of-plane dimethylamino group in the molecule is found to play a pivotal role in the isomerization process by providing a steric hindrance effect for asymmetric interaction between the STM tip and the molecule. This underlying mechanism is further confirmed by performing molecular dynamics simulations, which show agreement with experimental results. Our work opens the opportunity to manipulate the molecular configuration on the basis of mechanical force.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric field 3aforces 3aisomerization 3amolecular conformation 3amolecular dynamics 3ascanning tunneling microscopy 3asilver 3asimulation models1 aGao, Yixuan1 aJia, Haihong1 aRichter, Marcus1 aHuang, Li1 aCao, Yun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7518-24811 aYang, Huan1 aZheng, Qi1 aBerger, Reinhard1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8959-78211 aLiu, Junzhi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7146-09421 aLin, Xiao1 aLu, Hongliang1 aCheng, Zhihai1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4938-44901 aOuyang, Min1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1721-15711 aFeng, Xinliang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3885-27031 aDu, Shixuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9323-13071 aGao, Hong-Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6766-06230 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2020 May 27, v. 142, no. 24 p.10673-10680dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.0c001923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03050naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245011200157300001800269520168100287592002801968650001901996650002302015650002202038650002302060650000902083650002102092650001802113650001502131650002202146650001902168650002402187650001402211650002402225650005802249650002502307700001602332700001802348700001402366700001402380773012702394856007402521852000902595655001202604IND60656563720221120150433.0190814e20120329xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065656372DNAL7 a10.1039/c2ay05834k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xiaojie10aApplication of ionic liquids in the microwave-assisted extraction of quercetin from Chinese herbal medicine  ap. 1012-1018.  aEight types of ionic liquid (IL) were synthesized in this paper, and ionic liquids-based microwave-assisted extraction (ILs-MAE) technique was used to extract quercetin from the Chinese herbal medicine Toona sinensis. Several significant operating parameters were optimized by a series of single factor experiments and orthogonal design L₉ (3⁴) experiments in this work. Compared with liquid-based maceration extraction (ILs-ME), liquid-based heat extraction (ILs-HE) and liquids-based ultrasound-assisted extraction (ILs-UAE), the optimized approach of ILs-MAE technique cost the shortest time but afforded the highest extraction amount. Moreover, reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) with ultraviolet detection (UV-DAD) was employed for the analysis. The results show that the amount of quercetin extracted by [Bmim]Br was 182.78 mg g⁻¹ with RSD 1.02%. The developed approach is linear between concentrations from 15.20 mg L⁻¹ to 213.2 mg L⁻¹ of quercetin and the regression coefficient (R) was 0.9992. The recoveries of quercetin extracted by these four methods were 95.07%–105.8% with RSDs lower than 3%. Furthermore, the change of the microstructure and chemical structure of the sample before and after different extraction procedures were researched, respectively. Because of the remarkable dissolving capacity of ILs aqueous solution and the obvious destruction on sample surface microstructures during ILs-MAE process, ILs-MAE technique got the highest extracted amount. With the help of LC-MS, we can further confirm that Toona sinensis do contain the active ingredient of quercetin and ILs had no interference of quercetin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aToona sinensis 3aactive ingredients 3aaqueous solutions 3achemical structure 3aheat 3aherbal medicines 3aionic liquids 3amaceration 3amass spectrometry 3amicrostructure 3amicrowave treatment 3aquercetin 3aregression analysis 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3aultrasonic treatment1 aWang, Yuzhi1 aKong, Jinhuan1 aNie, Chan1 aLin, Xiao0 tAnalytical methods.g2012 Mar. 29, v. 4, no. 4 p.1012-1018dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2ay05834k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02922naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100002300136245007900159300001400238500002000252520165000272592002801922596005701950650001502007650002702022650001202049650001502061650003102076650001502107650001102122650001402133650002402147650001402171651001302185700002302198700001902221700002302240700002102263773013602284856007102420852000902491655001202500IND60130843920221119134937.0220424e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013084392DNAL7 a10.2981/12-0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSvoboda, Nathan J.10aIdentifying bobcat Lynx rufus kill sites using a global positioning system  ap. 78-86.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe role of predation in ecological systems has received considerable attention in scientific literature and is one of the most important, yet least understood aspects of carnivore ecology. Knowledge of factors that improve our ability to detect predation events using animal telemetry data could be used to develop strategies to reduce time and resources required to obtain reliable kill estimates. Using Global Positioning System telemetry‐collars, we investigated 246 bobcat Lynx rufus location clusters to identify white‐tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus kill sites in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, USA, during May‐August, 2009‐2011. We documented kills of white‐tailed deer at 42 location clusters. We used logistic regression and Akaike Information Criterion for small samples to identify factors (i.e. number of locations in cluster, time from cluster formation to investigation, time of day and land cover) that may influence bobcat behaviour and our ability to detect white‐tailed deer kill sites. Clusters with more locations and the search of clusters within 14 days after cluster formation increased odds of detecting bobcat kill sites. The best‐performing model was 67% accurate overall and identified 34% of kill sites and 75% of non‐kill sites. Applying our best‐performing model with the optimal cut‐off value would result in a twofold increase in the identification of white‐tailed deer kill sites reducing time and effort to find a similar number of kill sites without models by half. Identifying factors that improve our ability to identify bobcat kill sites can reduce field effort and search time.  aPublisher supplied data  aW‐147‐RcFederal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act 3aLynx rufus 3aOdocoileus virginianus 3aanimals 3acarnivores 3aglobal positioning systems 3aland cover 3amodels 3apredation 3aregression analysis 3atelemetry 3aMichigan1 aBelant, Jerrold L.1 aBeyer, Dean E.1 aDuquette, Jared F.1 aMartin, James A.0 tWildlife biology.g2013 Mar., v. 19, no. 1 p.78-86dNordic Council for Wildlife Research (NKV)wJournal:J000000165x0909-63967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2981/12-0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03001naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100003100180245008900211506007600300520139800376592002801774506003701802650003501839650001301874650002201887651002001909700002101929700001901950700001901969700001901988700001802007700002102025700001902046700001802065700002302083700002002106700002202126700002302148700002302171700002602194700002302220700002402243700002602267773012002293856007302413852000902486655001202495IND60653001620221207082412.0190713e20190527xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065300162DNAL7 a10.3390/v110504822doi7 aPMC65635102pmcid7 a311378362pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDi Giallonardo, Francesca 10aLimited Sustained Local Transmission of HIV-1 CRF01_AE in New South Wales, Australia  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAustralia&rsquo;s response to the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) pandemic led to effective control of HIV transmission and one of the world&rsquo;s lowest HIV incidence rates&mdash;0.14%. Although there has been a recent decline in new HIV diagnoses in New South Wales (NSW), the most populous state in Australia, there has been a concomitant increase with non-B subtype infections, particularly for the HIV-1 circulating recombinant form CRF01_AE. This aforementioned CRF01_AE sampled in NSW, were combined with those sampled globally to identify NSW-specific viral clades. The population growth of these clades was assessed in two-year period intervals from 2009 to 2017. Overall, 109 NSW-specific clades were identified, most comprising pairs of sequences; however, five large clades comprising &ge;10 sequences were also found. Forty-four clades grew over time with one or two sequences added to each in different two-year periods. Importantly, while 10 of these clades have seemingly discontinued, the remaining 34 were still active in 2016/2017. Seven such clades each comprised &ge;10 sequences, and are representative of individual sub-epidemics in NSW. Thus, although the majority of new CRF01_AE infections were associated with small clades that rarely establish ongoing chains of local transmission, individual sub-epidemics are present and should be closely monitored.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3apandemic 3apopulation growth 3aNew South Wales1 aPinto, Angie  N.1 aKeen, Phillip 1 aShaik, Ansari 1 aCarrera, Alex 1 aSalem, Hanan 1 aTelfer, Barbara 1 aCooper, Craig 1 aPrice, Karen 1 aSelvey, Christine 1 aHolden, Joanne 1 aBachmann, Nadine 1 aLee, Frederick  J.1 aDwyer, Dominic  E.1 aDuchêne, Sebastián 1 aHolmes, Edward C.,1 aGrulich, Andrew  E.1 aKelleher, Anthony  D.0 tViruses.g2019 May 27, v. 11, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v110504823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02244naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100002100136245010300157300001500260500002000275520099800295592002801293650001901321650002301340650001201363650001201375650001301387650001501400650001001415650001301425650001501438651001101453700002601464700002801490700002301518700001901541700002301560700002201583773013701605856007101742852000901813655001201822IND60130844020221119135043.0220424e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013084402DNAL7 a10.2981/12-0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDouhard, Mathieu10aRoaring counts are not suitable for the monitoring of red deer Cervus elaphus population abundance  ap. 94-101.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe successful management of large herbivores requires the monitoring of a set of indicators of ecological change (IEC) describing animal performance, herbivore impact on habitat and relative animal abundance. Roaring counts during the rut have often been used to assess the abundance of red deer Cervus elaphus populations, but a formal evaluation of this method is still lacking. In this paper, we examined the usefulness of the number of red deer recorded during roaring counts for managing red deer populations. Using standardised spotlight counts applied for the monitoring of red deer at La Petite Pierre, France, as a reference method, we found that roaring counts did not correlate with spotlight counts. Moreover, we did not find any evidence that roaring counts decreased with increasing number of male and female red deer harvested in the reserve during the previous hunting season. We thus conclude that managers should not rely on roaring counts for managing red deer populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCervus elaphus 3aanimal performance 3aanimals 3afemales 3ahabitats 3aherbivores 3amales 3amanagers 3amonitoring 3aFrance1 aBonenfant, Christophe1 aGaillard, Jean‐Michel1 aHamann, Jean‐Luc1 aGarel, Mathieu1 aMichallet, Jacques1 aKlein, François,0 tWildlife biology.g2013 Mar., v. 19, no. 1 p.94-101dNordic Council for Wildlife Research (NKV)wJournal:J000000165x0909-63967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2981/12-0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02111naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245009000169520097600259592002801235650000901263650001301272650001801285650002301303650002101326653002801347653002201375653002501397653002101422653002901443653002301472700002001495700003101515773010601546856008801652852000901740655001201749IND60789998520221119233245.0220926e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078999852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2022.1140492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeng, Cathy10aDeploying deep learning to estimate the abundance of marine debris from video footage  aThe insatiable desire of society for plastic goods has led to synthetic materials becoming omnipresent in the marine environment. In attempting to address the problem of plastic pollution, we propose an image classifier based on the YOLOv5 deep learning tool that is able to classify and localize marine debris and marine life in images and video recordings. Utilizing the region of interest line and the centroid tracking counting methods, the image classifier was able to count marine debris and fish displayed in video footage. Results revealed that, with a counting accuracy of 79 %, the centroid tracking method proved more efficient thanks to its ability to trace the geometric center of the bounding box of detected marine litter. Remarkably, the proposed method achieved a mean average precision of 89.4 % when validated on nine categories of objects. Finally, its impact can be enhanced substantially if integrated into other surveying methods or applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3afish 3ageometry 3amarine debris 3amarine environment 3amarine pollution 0aArtificial intelligence 0aCentroid tracking 0aImage classification 0aMarine pollution 0aPlastic debris detection 0aRegion of interest1 aKylili, Kyriaki1 aHadjistassou, Constantinos0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2022 Oct., v. 183 p.114049-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2022.1140493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01795naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128245004000146300001600186520068200202536012000884592002801004650001701032650001101049650001501060653002401075653002501099653002201124653003001146653002801176700002401204700002001228773012001248856008001368852000901448655001201457IND60681027220221123022000.0200113e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068102722DNAL7 a10.1177/00027642198596402doi  aAGLbengcAGL10aInnovations in Ethnographic Methods  ap. 176-197.  aThis article reviews innovations in ethnographic methods that have developed over the past 25 years, specifically the emergence of multisited and short-term fieldwork, digital ethnography, various kinds of participatory and collaborative ethnography, and the use of interviews.

However, interactions between coexisting species can be surprisingly complex, suggesting that animals not only perceive but also selectively respond to signals produced by other species. Many species respond to the vocalisations of heterospecifics, but it is usually difficult to separate actual vocal recognition from the response resulting from misidentification. We controlled this bias in a playback experiment with two sympatric Rallidae species, the water rail (Rallus aquaticus) and little crake (Zapornia parva). Both focal species produced more calls and little crake additionally approached the speaker more often in response to calls of each other than to calls of closely related but non‐sympatric spotted crakes (Porzana porzana) or the sympatric but non‐competing little grebes (Tachybaptus ruficollis). By contrast, when responding to each other's calls water rails produced fewer loud calls than during the conspecific treatment suggesting that focal birds were merely announcing their presence, whereas little crakes produced mainly alarms suggesting that they communicated with the mated partner to warn it rather than with the heterospecific intruder. We conclude that focal Rallidae species could distinguish not only their calls from those of conspecifics, but also each other's calls from those of other sympatric and phylogenetically related species.  aPublisher supplied data  aGrant/Award Number: 2014/15/N/NZ8/00337cPolish National Science Centre 3aRallus 3aconspecificity 3aphylogeny 3asympatry1 aPolak, Marcin1 aKoperski, Paweł1 aRęk, Paweł0 tEthology.g2021 Sept., v. 127, no. 9 p.710-719dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39008x0179-16137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eth.132083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01759naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245011700155300002000272520066300292592002800955650001600983650002200999650001901021650001501040650001701055650002201072650001201094650000701106650002101113650001501134700001701149700002401166773012401190856007401314852000901388655001201397IND60665722020221119220708.0190912e20140821xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066572202DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra03844d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStoin, Uri10aNew technology for post-combustion abatement of carbon dioxide via an in situ generated superoxide anion-radical  ap. 36544-36552.  aA novel chemistry for the efficient sequestration of carbon dioxide via swift nucleophilic attack by superoxide anions is disclosed. A relatively stable aqueous solution of the latter is generated in situ by contacting alkali hydroxide solution with hydrogen peroxide at pH 11. Using a simple gas liquid scrubber containing the above blend, carbon dioxide is quantitatively absorbed from a gas stream under ambient conditions and is totally converted to aqueous carbonate.

This procedure resulted in a general and environmentally benign protocol and has the advantages of better reusability of the catalyst system, excellent yield, short reaction time and ease of work up.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2-naphthol 3aaldehydes 3aambient temperature 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3amicelles 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3asurfactants1 aSahu, Praveen K.1 aAgarwal, Dau D.0 tRSC advances.g2014 Sept. 03, v. 4, no. 76 p.40414-40420dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra03847a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03078naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245011000160300001600270520155100286592002801837650002401865650001901889650002001908650001401928650001001942650002301952650002101975650001001996650002502006650001902031650001202050650002302062650001602085650001902101650002002120650001402140650001802154650002502172650002302197653001002220653001902230653002002249653002002269653002002289700001702309700001702326773012002343856007602463852000902539655001202548IND60517123120221121074805.0160328s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051712312DNAL7 a10.4141/cjps2011-1442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Cheng-Wu10aChanges in photosynthetic rate, water potential, and proline content in kenaf seedlings under salt stress  ap. 311-319.  aJin, C.-W., Sun, Y.-L. and Cho, D.-H. 2012. Changes in photosynthetic rate, water potential, and proline content in kenaf seedlings under salt stress. Can. J. Plant Sci. 92: 311–319. As irrigation water salinization has become a serious constraint for crop production, as well as soil salinity, the selection and use of salt-tolerant species is urgently required. In this study, we describe the salt responses of three kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus L.) cultivars and select the cultivar with high salt tolerance. Responses to salt stress were investigated in terms of growth, water potentials, photosynthesis, and proline contents. Photosynthesis, evaluated by net CO₂ assimilation rate, stomatal conductance, and intercellular CO₂ concentration, did not show any significant effects among the cultivars. Leaf water potential decreased depending on salt concentration and salt treatment period. Proline accumulation was enhanced, particularly depending on salt concentration, but not salt treatment period. As salt concentration increased, seedling growth was inhibited to a certain extent, and the inhibition of growth depended mainly on salt concentration. At the early stage of treatment, Dowling was more tolerant to salt stress than Everglade-41 and Tainung-2. Although Dowling showed a lower decrease in fresh weight, Tainung-2 always maintained a relatively high vegetative yield, even under high salt stress. Tainung-2, having greater salt adaptation, was therefore considered an ideal cultivar for popularization and farm cultivation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHibiscus cannabinus 3acarbon dioxide 3acrop production 3acultivars 3afarms 3agrowth retardation 3airrigation water 3akenaf 3aleaf water potential 3aphotosynthesis 3aproline 3asalt concentration 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3asoil salinity 3astomatal conductance 3awater salinization 0aKenaf 0aphotosynthesis 0aproline content 0asalinity stress 0awater potential1 aSun, Yan-Lin1 aCho, Dong-Ha0 tCanadian journal of plant science.g2012, v. 92, no. 2 p.311-319dAgricultural Institute of Canadax1918-18337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4141/cjps2011-1443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02911naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245009600170300001600266520172100282592002802003650002202031650001102053650001302064650002502077653003102102653002302133653002902156653002202185653002602207700001702233700002102250700002202271700002502293773012502318856008502443852000902528655001202537IND60541200720221119203245.0190318e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054120072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2015.03.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaikwar, Satyam10aSimulation of components of a power shuttle transmission system for an agricultural tractor  ap. 114-124.  aThe usage of tractors is widely extended to various non-agricultural and construction applications like with front end loaders, dozers, backhoe, etc. Tractors which are predominantly used in front end loader application requires frequent shifting of gear due to repetitive fore and aft travel requirements of the vehicle. In this application, tractors usually move forward and reverse direction at the same speed within a short duration by using a mechanical shuttle, synchro shuttle or by power shuttle transmission. This research article presents an idea on the simulation of the power shuttle transmission system of an agricultural tractor. A model of the individual component of power shuttle transmission system has been developed and integrated, to make it as a whole vehicle model, using MATLAB as a simulation platform. The model has been used to study the proportional valve characteristic, vehicle shift time and motion inversion time of modelled tractor and comparison was made between actual and simulated results. The model was validated with the help of an instrumented test tractor. The findings indicated that the time required to develop required actual system pressure was 1.85s whereas the simulated time was 3.1s which was optimized to 1.94s.The simulated shift time was 5s which was optimized to 3.1s. Similarly the actual and simulated motion inversion time of the tractor was 6.4s and 10s. The modification in the model was done to bring the resemblance between actual and simulated results by providing the actual simulation environment. Thus the simulation study presented here may be beneficial in the design and simulation of other types of power transmission systems used in the tractors.  aPublisher supplied data 3afront-end loaders 3amodels 3atractors 3atransmission systems 0aPower shuttle transmission 0aProportional valve 0aSimulation of wet clutch 0aGear box modeling 0aMotion inversion time1 aTewari, V.K.1 aMukhopadhyay, S.1 aVerma, Cmde.

Evidence from the Influence of Coal Resources-Exhaustion on Coal Resources–Based Industry Land Use Changes  aAnalyzing the spatial-temporal changes of resources&ndash;based industrial land is essential to the transformation and development of resources&ndash;exhausted cities. In this paper, we studied coal resources&ndash;based industrial land use changes and their driving factors in a typical coal resources&ndash;exhausted city, Anyuan District, Pingxiang city. The changes between coal resources&ndash;based industrial land and other land-use types were analyzed. The logistic regression models were applied to identify the main driving factors and quantify their contributions to coal resources&ndash;based industrial land-use changes during the two periods of 2003&ndash;2008 and 2008&ndash;2013. The results show that coal resources&ndash;based industrial land declined by 34.37% during the period 2008&ndash;2013 as coal resources were being exhausted. Altitude, distance to roads, distance to town, population density change, fixed-asset investment per area change, and GDP per capita change drove coal resources&ndash;based industrial land-use changes. However, the patterns of the driving effects differed, and even the same factors had different influences on coal resources&ndash;based industrial land-use changes during the two periods. The changes in the driving factors can be seen as responses to socioeconomic transformation and development in the city, which is experiencing the exhaustion of coal resources. As a result of the comprehensive effects of these driving factors, coal resources&ndash;based industrial land use has changed in complex ways.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3acities 3acoal 3aindustrial sites 3aindustry 3aland use change 3apopulation density 3aregression analysis 3aroads1 aPan, Yunhua1 aZhang, Yanyuan1 aLiu, Jingjie1 aXia, Min0 tSustainability.g2018 Aug. 01, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100826983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02767naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245011700169520146200286592002801748650001601776650002501792650001001817650000901827650001301836650001301849650001701862650001401879650003301893650002201926650001001948650001301958653002001971653001501991653001702006653001102023653001602034700002202050700001802072700001902090773012202109856008102231852000902312655001202321IND60730463920221118091520.0211030e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073046392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1112572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuriano, Serafino10aComparison of total polyphenols, profile anthocyanins, color analysis, carotenoids and tocols in pigmented maize  aTotal phenolics, flavonoids, anthocyanins, CIELAB color, tocols and carotenoids were determined in whole kernels of four different pigmented (yellow, red, blue and purple) maize genotypes. The aim of this work was devoted i) to characterize the anthocyanin profile, ii) to compare the bioactive phytochemical substances, iii) to promote the introduction of new pigmented maize genotypes. Anthocyanins detected were mainly eight: cyanidin, petunidin, pelargonidin and peonidin-3-glucoside and their malonated derivatives. Acylated anthocyanins were far more abundant than glycosilated anthocyanins. Among the pigmented maize samples, the purple kernel genotype showed the highest concentration of anthocyanins. Color analysis of individual kernels of the four maize samples showed difference between the average L*a*b* values, detecting high correlations between L*, C* and Hue. Anthocyanins were negatively significantly correlated versus L*, C* and Hue. Considerable differences in phytochemical contents were observed between the genotypes. Principal Component Analysis provided a good summary of the results; it accounted for about 91% of total variance and clearly discriminated the four genotypes based on their specific chemical composition. Purple kernel maize genotype showed a higher content of total phenolics, flavonoids, proanthocyanidin, whereas yellow maize showed higher content in carotenoids and red maize resulted dominant in total tocols.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarotenoids 3achemical composition 3acolor 3acorn 3acyanidin 3agenotype 3apelargonidin 3apetunidin 3aprincipal component analysis 3aproanthocyanidins 3aseeds 3avariance 0aPigmented maize 0aFlavonoids 0aAnthocyanins 0aTocols 0aCarotenoids1 aBalconi, Carlotta1 aValoti, Paolo1 aRedaelli, Rita0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2021 June, v. 144 p.111257-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1112573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02741naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245011900157520153500276592002801811650001601839650002201855650001901877650000801896650001101904650002201915650001101937650002601948650002401974650002401998650001002022650001202032650001102044651001002055700002202065700001702087700001702104773012702121856007402248852000902322655001202331IND60652548220221119083130.0190713e20180801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065254822DNAL7 a10.3390/su100827002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Xiaomei14aThe Implication of Road Toll Discount for Mode Choice: Intercity Travel during the Chinese Spring Festival Holiday  aIntercity travel congestion during the main national holidays takes place every year at different places around the world. Charge reduction measurements on existing toll roads have been implemented to promote an efficient use of the expressways and to reduce congestion on the public transit networks. However, some of these policies have had negative effects. A more comprehensive understanding of the determinants of holiday intercity travel patterns is critical for better policymaking. This paper aims to investigate the effectiveness of the road toll discount policy on mode choice behavior for intercity travel. A mixed logit model is developed to model the mode choices of intercity travelers, which is estimated based on survey data about intercity journeys from Beijing during the 2017 Chinese Spring Festival holiday. The policy impact is further discussed by elasticity and scenario simulations. The results indicate that the expressway toll discount does increase the car use and decrease the public transit usage. Given the decreased toll on expressways, the demand tends to shift from car to public transit, in an order of coach, high-speed rail, conventional rail, and airplane. When it comes to its effect on socio-demographic groups, men and lower-income travelers are identified to be more likely to change mode in response to variation of road toll. Finally, policy effectiveness is found to vary for travelers in different travel distance groups. Conclusions provide useful insights on road pricing management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomobiles 3aissues and policy 3alogit analysis 3amen 3amodels 3anational holidays 3aprices 3apublic transportation 3arail transportation 3aroad transportation 3aroads 3asurveys 3atravel 3aChina1 aSusilo, Yusak O.,1 aShao, Chunfu1 aLiu, Chengxi0 tSustainability.g2018 Aug. 01, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100827003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03293naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245016800172500001900340520184800359592002802207650001302235650001602248650002102264650001102285650001902296650002202315650001802337650002402355650001602379653002602395653003502421653002402456653002402480653002202504653002502526700002002551700002702571700001702598700002002615773011702635856008602752852000902838655001202847IND60725383520221121022738.0210415e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072538352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconhyd.2021.1037732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoeck, Christian10aCombined method of 3H/3He apparent age and on-site helium analysis to identify groundwater flow processes and transport of perchloroethylene (PCE) in an urban area  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aUrban groundwater management requires a thorough and robust scientific understanding of flow and transport processes. ³H/³He apparent ages have been shown to efficiently help provide important groundwater-related information. However, this type of analysis is expensive as well as labor- and time-intensive, and hence limits the number of potential sampling locations.To overcome this limitation, we established an inter-relationship between ³H/³He apparent groundwater ages and ⁴He concentrations analyzed in the field with a newly developed portable gas equilibrium membrane inlet mass spectrometer (GE-MIMS) system, and demonstrated that the results of the simpler GE-MIMS system are an accurate and reliable alternative to sophisticated laboratory based analyses. The combined use of ³H/³He lab-based ages and predicted ages from the ³H/³He–⁴He age relationship opens new opportunities for site characterization, and reveals insights into the conceptual understanding of groundwater systems.For our study site, we combined groundwater ages with hydrochemical data, water isotopes (¹⁸O and ²H), and perchloroethylene (PCE) concentrations (1) to identify spatial inter-aquifer mixing between artificially infiltrated groundwater and water originating from regional flow paths and (2) to explain the spatial differences in PCE contamination within the observed groundwater system. Overall, low PCE concentrations and young ages occur when the fraction of artificially infiltrated water is high. The results obtained from the age distribution analysis are strongly supported by the information gained from the isotopic and hydrochemical data. Moreover, for some wells, fault-induced aquifer connectivity is identified as a preferential flow path for the transport of older groundwater, leading to elevated PCE concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3agroundwater 3agroundwater flow 3ahelium 3ahydrochemistry 3apreferential flow 3aspectrometers 3atetrachloroethylene 3aurban areas 0aGroundwater transport 0aManaged aquifer recharge (MAR) 0a3H/3He apparent age 0aEnvironmental gases 0aPerchloroethylene 0aAquifer connectivity1 aPopp, Andrea L.1 aBrennwald, Matthias S.1 aKipfer, Rolf1 aSchirmer, Mario0 tJournal of contaminant hydrology.g2021 Mar., v. 238 p.103773-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl42311x0169-77227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconhyd.2021.1037733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01678naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245022900163300001600392520039400408592002800802650001600830650004400846650001500890650002000905653002000925653001500945653002300960653001600983653001500999700002101014700002001035700002501055773015001080856007701230852000901307655001201316IND60522107820221121033044.0160601e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052210782DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1998-04102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeckmann, Gemot10aEin weiteres 2λ5,4λ5-Diphosphapyridin: 2,2,4,4-Tetrakis-(dimethylamino)-6- amino-1-aza-2λ5,4λ5-diphosphinin / A Further 2λ5,4λ5-Diphosphapyridine: 2,2,4,4-Tetrakis-(Dimethylamino)-6-amino-1-aza- 2λ5,4λ5-diphosphinine  ap. 443-447.  a2,2,4,4-Tetrakis-(dimethylamino)-6-amino-1-aza-2λ⁵,4λ⁵-diphosphinine (3) has been prepared by reacting 1,1,3,3-tetrakis(dimethylamino)-1λ⁵-3λ⁵-diphosphete (1) with bis(trimethylsilyl) carbodiimide (2) in a 2 : 1 molar ratio.

Despite progresses made in recent years, there is still a lack of effective treatments for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) in clinical practices. AIMS: The Chinese Acute Ischemic Stroke Treatment Outcome Registry (CASTOR) is designed to evaluate the patterns and cost-effectiveness of current treatments for AIS in real-world settings in China. DESIGN: CASTOR is a prospective, multi-center study registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02470624) with a target sample size of 10,000 patients who are experiencing AIS. The patients are treated for AIS following the Chinese stroke guideline and local practice. Real-world data on treatment regimens, outcomes and costs are collected at baseline (Visit 1) and during subsequent visits (Visit 2 to Visit 5) after medication treatments. OUTCOME: The primary objective of the present study is to analyze the current treatment status of AIS in real world settings. The secondary objectives include: 1) to compare the effectiveness of common treatment regimens, 2) to analyze the cost-effectiveness of different treatment regimens for AIS, 3) to analyze the incidence of adverse events and complications in enrolled patients with AIS, 4) to analyze the effect of Trial of Org 10,172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) classification on the specific therapies during acute phase treatment period. DISCUSSION: In face of changing treatment patterns and increasing demand from medical insurers for cost-effectiveness data in China, a large-scale registry study examining the real-world patterns of AIS in hospitals is needed. The CASTOR study will help to find favorable cost-utility treatment regimens for AIS and improve the overall treatment outcome of Chinese patients with AIS.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalternative medicine 3acost effectiveness 3adrug therapy 3aguidelines 3ahospitals 3apatients 3astroke 3aChina1 aOu, Qianhua1 aZhang, Zhijun1 aQu, Jiazhi1 aHuang, Yining0 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2017 Dec., v. 17, no. 1 p.357-357dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-017-1863-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03626naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245013200166300001600298520236100314592002802675650001302703650001602716650000902732650002502741650003502766650001702801653001302818653001202831653001602843653003502859653001302894653001502907700001602922700001602938700002302954700002002977773012502997856008503122852000903207655001203216IND60541200920221119203627.0190318e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054120092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2015.03.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSales, G.T.10aQuantifying detection performance of a passive low-frequency RFID system in an environmental preference chamber for laying hens  ap. 261-268.  aRadio Frequency Identification (RFID) systems are widely used in production livestock systems for identification, traceability assurance, and animal registration. An RFID system was implemented and evaluated for use in a four-compartment, two-tier, environmental preference chamber (EPC) to detect hens transiting between compartments. Eight RFID antennae were located near the passages between compartments and each hen wore an RFID tag on one of its legs. The RFID system’s performance was assessed by determining detection ranges in a controlled test and by comparing the number of entries into and duration in each compartment as detected by the RFID system to manual assessment of recorded video. The RFID system detection range was revealed to cover a radius of approximately 29cm from the antenna, excluding a portion of the compartment furthest from the antenna. During a choice-test study, successful detection rates based on duration of stay in compartments were 91.0±2.6% (mean±SD) for trials with groups of birds, and 85.8±8.0% for trials with individual birds. Based on number of entries into compartments, successful detection rates were 62.6±11.2% for trials with groups of four birds, and 51.3±18.4% for trials with individual birds. Sources of entry misdetection included: (i) RFID tag being out of the detection range during sampling; (ii) conflicts caused by multiple RFID tags within the same detection zone; and (iii) visits of duration less than the RFID antenna scan interval. The delay between hen entry and RFID system detection averaged 42.3±35.7s and 6.4±5.2s in trials with individuals and with groups, respectively. Detection times were within the antenna scanning interval of 15s (a hen entered a compartment and was immediately detected by the next antenna scan) in 60.3% of the events with individuals and 98.1% of the events with groups. Despite the difference between detected and actual entries (P=0.008 [groups]; P=0.05 [individuals]), no significant differences were found between total duration of compartment occupancy over a 24h test period or average compartment visit duration, as calculated from RFID data and video observations. The RFID system was suitable for characterizing the amount of time birds spent in each EPC compartment, but not reliable for determining number of entries into a compartment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantennae 3alaying hens 3alegs 3alivestock production 3aradio frequency identification 3atraceability 0aBehavior 0aPoultry 0aChoice test 0aRadio frequency identification 0aTracking 0aValidation1 aGreen, A.R.1 aGates, R.S.1 aBrown-Brandl, T.M.1 aEigenberg, R.A.0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2015 June, v. 114 p.261-268dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2015.03.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03147naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245015800177300001800335520167900353592002802032650001702060650002302077650002702100650001402127650002902141650001302170650002502183650002602208650002402234650001602258653003602274653003002310653001502340653005202355653002402407653002602431700002702457700001902484773011502503856008602618852000902704655001202713IND60557363220221123011027.0180831e20170101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055736322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.09.1952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchöggl, Josef-Peter10aImproving sustainability performance in early phases of product design: A checklist for sustainable product development tested in the automotive industry  ap. 1602-1617.  aIn the early phases of product development, it is important to both reduce costs and improve a product's sustainability performance. Insufficient data are available on the costs and sustainability aspects of innovative concepts such as automotive lightweight design, which require the application of new materials and processes. The lack of information and high degree of uncertainty hinder the use of traditional sustainability evaluation tools such as Life Cycle Assessment during these early phases. Tools used in eco-design and sustainable design have disadvantages since they either focus on only one sustainability dimension, require quantitative data about materials and processes, or cannot be applied by designers and engineers. To overcome these disadvantages, a new checklist for Sustainable Product Development (CSPD) was developed in close collaboration with practitioners. The CSPD allows the qualitative assessment of environmental, economic and social aspects during the early phases of product development while considering a full life cycle perspective. It provides the methodological foundation for an iterative process, in which improvement tasks related to sustainability are defined that must be completed by the engineers. The applicability of the CSPD with reference to a wide range of technologies was evaluated and tested in a case study that included nine automotive lightweight technologies. This case study revealed that the developed tool helped designers and engineers assess and improve the sustainability performance of a technology and that it stimulated processes of collaboration and information exchange within and between organizations.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acost effectiveness 3adesign for environment 3aengineers 3aenvironmental assessment 3aindustry 3ainformation exchange 3alife cycle assessment 3aproduct development 3auncertainty 0aSustainable product development 0aDesign for sustainability 0aEco-design 0aFramework for strategic sustainable development 0aAutomotive industry 0aLightweight materials1 aBaumgartner, Rupert J.1 aHofer, Dietmar0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2017 Jan. 01, v. 140 p.1602-1617dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.09.1953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03075naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245009500175500001900270520163400289592002801923650001301951650001301964650002001977650001601997650002202013650001302035650002302048650001402071650002402085650002202109650001802131651001002149653002502159653002402184653002602208653003102234653001002265700001902275700002502294700002102319700002102340700002002361773011702381856008602498852000902584655001202593IND60725383620221121022810.0210415e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072538362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconhyd.2021.1037742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPollicino, Licia C.10aMulti-aquifer susceptibility analyses for supporting groundwater management in urban areas  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn the densely urbanised Milan Metropolitan area (northern Italy), the long history of anthropogenic activities still exerts a significant pressure on groundwater resource. One of the most serious threats to the water quality of urban aquifers is attributed to diffuse contamination, which is caused by a series of unknown small sources (i.e., multiple point sources) distributed over large areas. In the study area and in many industrialised regions of the world, tetrachloroethylene [PCE], trichloroethylene [TCE] and hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] represent the common example of long-standing and persistent pollution in groundwater. In the Milan Metropolitan area, high levels of PCE + TCE and Cr(VI) were detected in the shallow aquifer as well as in the deep aquifer.To assess and map the shallow and deep aquifers susceptibility to PCE + TCE and Cr(VI) contamination at a regional scale, the Weights of Evidence modelling technique has been applied. This method has been used to objectively evaluate the spatial correlation between the high presence of these pollutants in each aquifer and hydrogeological and land use factors that can potentially influence the contamination. Moreover, the results allowed us to quantify on a large scale the effect that preferential flowpaths, due to both thickness variation in the aquitard and the areal density of multi aquifer wells, have in reducing the protection of the underlying deep aquifer. The end-products of the study constitute a key tool to be used by water-resource managers and decision-makers for the improvement of groundwater management and protection strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3achromium 3adecision making 3agroundwater 3aindustrialization 3aland use 3ametropolitan areas 3apollution 3atetrachloroethylene 3atrichloroethylene 3awater quality 3aItaly 0aChlorinated solvents 0aHexavalent chromium 0aDiffuse contamination 0aSpatial statistical method 0aMilan1 aMasetti, Marco1 aStevenazzi, Stefania1 aCristaldi, Agata1 aRighetti, Chiara1 aGorla, Maurizio0 tJournal of contaminant hydrology.g2021 Mar., v. 238 p.103774-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl42311x0169-77227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconhyd.2021.1037743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03409naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006100142245011800203300002000321520172000341592002802061650002202089650002402111650001302135650001002148650002202158650001202180650000902192650002102201650002202222650001602244700002102260700005902281700002402340700002502364700002602389700002502415700002302440700003002463700003202493700002202525700006102547700002002608700002102628700002002649773014902669856007602818852000902894655001202903IND60603294720180905000000.0180713e20171227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060329472DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.7b102232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBooker, Edward P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8155-820610aFormation of Long-Lived Color Centers for Broadband Visible Light Emission in Low-Dimensional Layered Perovskites  ap. 18632-18639.  aWe investigate the origin of the broadband visible emission in layered hybrid lead-halide perovskites and its connection with structural and photophysical properties. We study ⟨001⟩ oriented thin films of hexylammonium (HA) lead iodide, (C₆H₁₆N)₂PbI₄, and dodecylammonium (DA) lead iodide, (C₁₂H₂₈N)₂PbI₄, by combining first-principles simulations with time-resolved photoluminescence, steady-state absorption and X-ray diffraction measurements on cooling from 300 to 4 K. Ultrafast transient absorption and photoluminescence measurements are used to track the formation and recombination of emissive states. In addition to the excitonic photoluminescence near the absorption edge, we find a red-shifted, broadband (full-width at half-maximum of about 0.4 eV), emission band below 200 K, similar to emission from ⟨110⟩ oriented bromide 2D perovskites at room temperature. The lifetime of this sub-band-gap emission exceeds that of the excitonic transition by orders of magnitude. We use X-ray diffraction measurements to study the changes in crystal lattice with temperature. We report changes in the octahedral tilt and lattice spacing in both materials, together with a phase change around 200 K in DA₂PbI₄. DFT simulations of the HA₂PbI₄ crystal structure indicate that the low-energy emission is due to interstitial iodide and related Frenkel defects. Our results demonstrate that white-light emission is not limited to ⟨110⟩ oriented bromide 2D perovskites but a general property of this class of system, and highlight the importance of defect control for the formation of low-energy emissive sites, which can provide a pathway to design tailored white-light emitters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aambient temperature 3abromides 3acolor 3acrystal structure 3aiodides 3alead 3aphase transition 3aphotoluminescence 3awhite light1 aThomas, Tudor H.1 aQuarti, Claudio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5488-12161 aStanton, Michael R.1 aDashwood, Cameron D.1 aGillett, Alexander J.1 aRichter, Johannes M.1 aPearson, Andrew J.1 aDavis, Nathaniel J.

Bidirectional Reflectance factor (BRF) data of both rough [surface roughness index (SRI) of 51%] and smooth soil surfaces (SRI of 5%) were acquired in the laboratory under 30° illumination zenith angle using a Specim V10E imaging spectrometer and an Ocean Optics non-imaging spectrometer mounted on the University of Lethbridge Goniometer System version 2.5 (ULGS-2.5) and version 2.0 (ULGS-2.0), respectively. Under controlled laboratory conditions, the rough soil surface exhibited higher spectral reflectance than the smooth surface for most viewing angles. The BRF of the rough surface varied more than the smooth surface as a function of the viewing zenith angle. The shadowing effect was stronger for the rough surface than for the smooth surface and was stronger in the forward-scattering direction than in the backscattering direction. The pattern of the BRF generated with the non-image based data was similar to that generated with the whole region of interest (ROI) of the image-based data, and that of the whole ROI of the image-based data was similar to that of the illuminated scene component. The BRF of the smooth soil surface was dominated by illuminated scene component, i.e., the sunlit pixels, whereas the shaded scene component, i.e., the shaded pixels, was a larger proportion of the BRF of the rough soil surface. The image-based approach allowed the characterization of the contribution of spatial components in the field of view to soil BRF and improved our understanding of soil reflectance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aimage analysis 3alighting 3areflectance 3asoil 3aspectrometers 3asurface roughness 0aBidirectional reflectance factor 0agoniometer 0asoil reflectance 0aremote sensing1 aCoburn, C.

This article presents an empirical analysis of education for sustainability related to regional planning. The study combines multiscalar governance on RSI with a research project of HEI students’ opinion on sustainability competences. Drawing upon a sample of 398 respondents the survey is supplemented with a discussion on the nexuses and linkages between business, education, environmental and regional development plans. The results from the survey illustrate that students generally value sustainability competences and that they consider such competences important to possess in order to become attractive in future labour markets. By relating student perception to regional climate and energy planning, the study also highlights a mis-match between policy and (educational) practice. The findings from the survey and the discussion have implications for the traditional lack of coherence between policy areas relevant to sustainable development and stress an urgent need for better coordination between business, education, environmental and regional development plans.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3abusiness planning 3aclimate 3aenergy 3agovernance 3ahigher education 3aissues and policy 3alabor 3amarkets 3astudents 3asurveys 3asustainable development 0aClean-tech industry 0aRegional sustainability initiatives 0aSustainability in higher education 0aEnergy and environmental innovation 0aUniversity policy 0aSustainable entrepreneurship0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 Jan. 10, v. 171 p.1681-1690dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.09.1973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03682naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002200188245014600210300001200356506007600368520207900444592002802523506003702551650001402588650002102602650001302623650001302636650002502649650001402674650001102688650002102699650000902720650002402729650001902753650001202772650002502784651001402809651001402823700002402837700002302861700002202884700002502906700002302931773013102954856008203085852000903167655001203176IND60574610920221207115456.0210514e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057461092DNAL7 a286793822pmid7 aPMC54990372pmcid7 a10.1186/s12906-017-1858-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZaid, Abdel Naser10aEthnopharmacological survey of home remedies used for treatment of hair and scalp and their methods of preparation in the West Bank-Palestine  ap. 355.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Natural products have many uses and purposes, including those linked to pharmaceutics and cosmetics. The aim of this study was to investigate the use of natural remedies for the treatment of hair and scalp disorders in the West Bank, Palestine. METHODS: An ethnopharmacological survey of herbal remedies and other natural products used in cosmetics and cosmeceuticals was carried out in the West Bank, Palestine. A questionnaire was distributed to 267 herbalists, traditional healers, hairdressers and rural dwellers. Collected information included: the names of plants and other natural products, the parts used, hair conditions, diseases and problems for which these products were used and also their methods of preparation. To identify the most important species used, the factor of informant’s consensus (Fᵢc), fidelity level (Fl) and the use-value (UV) were calculated. RESULTS: Collected data showed that 41 plants are utilized for the treatment of hair and scalp disorders, belonging to 27 families; among them Lamiaceae and Rosaceae, which were the most commonly used. Plant oils and their fruits are the most commonly used parts. Hair loss, dandruff, split hair endings and lice treatment, are reported as the most treated disorders. The number of plant species used consisted of 19, 14, 13, and again 13 with a factor of informant’s consensus (Fic) for these disorders corresponding to 0.93, 0.94, 0.95 and 0.92, respectively. Fl was 100% for many plants; the highest UV value (0.84) was registered for Lawsonia inermis, which belongs to the Lythraceae family. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that many natural remedies are still used in Palestine for the treatment of scalp and hair disorders as well as for cosmeceutical purposes. This study is of great importance as it allows us to have a greater perspective on our folkloric use of these natural products. A combined scientific effort between informants and the scientific community, working in this field, may help in the discovery of new cosmetics, cosmeceutical and nutraceutical products.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLamiaceae 3aLawsonia inermis 3aRosaceae 3aalopecia 3aalternative medicine 3acosmetics 3afruits 3afunctional foods 3alice 3aplant fats and oils 3aquestionnaires 3asurveys 3atraditional medicine 3aPalestine 3aWest Bank1 aJaradat, Nidal Amin1 aEid, Ahmad Mustafa1 aAl Zabadi, Hamzeh1 aAlkaiyat, Abdulsalam1 aDarwish, Saja Adam0 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2017 Dec., v. 17, no. 1 p.355-355dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-017-1858-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02553naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245012100166300001400287520106400301592002801365650001301393650003501406650002001441650001701461650001001478650000901488650002001497650001401517650001501531650001301546650001501559650002301574650002001597653003501617653002801652653002101680653003201701653003501733700001801768700001601786700001501802700001801817700001901835773011401854856008201968852000902050655001202059IND60621439220221118040115.0181117s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062143922DNAL7 a10.1177/15648265020233S1112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQian, Qinfang10aActivable Enriched Stable Isotope Iron-58 for Monitoring Absorption Rate of Juvenile Athletes for Iron: A Case Study  ap. 57-60.  aActivable enriched stable isotopes can play a unique role in studies of nutritional status, metabolism, absorption rates, and bioavailability of minerals. As a practical example, eight juvenile athletes were selected to test the absorption rates of iron during training and non-training periods by enriched stable isotope of Fe-58 (enriched degree: 51.1%) via activation analysis Fe-58 (n,γ) Fe-59 of the collected feces samples. The results indicated that the average iron absorption rates of the juvenile athletes with and without training are 9.1 ± 2.8 and 11.9 ± 4.7%, respectively, which implies that the long-term endurance training with high intensity makes the iron absorption rate of athletes lower. In the meantime, the comparison of the activable enriched isotope technique with atomic absorption spectrometry was performed, which showed that the former was better than the latter in reliability and sensitivity. It is because this nuclear method can distinguish the exogenous and endogenous iron in the samples, but not for non-nuclear methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aathletes 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3abioavailability 3acase studies 3afeces 3airon 3airon absorption 3ajuveniles 3ametabolism 3aminerals 3amonitoring 3anutritional status 3astable isotopes 0aactivable stable isotope Fe-58 0aabsorption rate of iron 0ajuvenile athlete 0aneutron activation analysis 0aatomic absorption spectroscopy1 aChai, Zhifang1 aFeng, Weiyu1 aChen, Jidi1 aZhang, Peiqun1 aPan, Jianxiang0 tFood and nutrition bulletin.g, v. 23, no. 3_suppl1 p.57-60dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2034x0379-57217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/15648265020233S1113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02813naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245007100172300001600243520133200259592002801591650002201619650001501641650001901656650002401675650001501699650001001714650001401724650002901738650001201767650001101779650000901790650002001799650000901819650001501828650002301843651001101866653001801877653000901895653001001904653001901914700002201933700002401955700001601979700001601995700002502011773014002036856008502176961001302261852000902274655001202283IND60541201020221119203601.0190318e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054120102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2015.03.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanchez-Cohen, I.12aA decision support system for rainfed agricultural areas of Mexico  ap. 178-188.  aRural inhabitants of arid lands constantly face a lack of sufficient water to fulfill their agricultural and household needs. In this situation they have to take quick and precise decisions about how to cope with the situation. Moreover, there is not readily available technical information to support their decisions regarding the course of action they should follow to handle the agro-climatic risk. In this paper a computer model (soil water balance model) is described to assess the impact on crops yields of rainfall shortages in dry lands in Mexico. The model is linked to a knowledge based database where a farmer may find readily available information to support cropping decisions. The knowledge base activates when the computed average crop yield is less than the 50% of the expected crop yield. The knowledge base provides information on risk, potential crops, and the geographical location (counties) where the crop may succeed. Also, it provides a technology to increase water productivity under limited availability situations. Further, the model can evaluate the impact of a climate change scenario (IPCC B2). Other inputs to the model being equal, the user may shift the model to run the climate change scenario and to compare the outputs of the model to assess the climate change impact on future crops yields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aarid lands 3aclimate change 3acomputer simulation 3acrop yield 3acrops 3adatabases 3adecision support systems 3afarmers 3amodels 3arain 3arainfed farming 3arisk 3asoil water 3asoil water balance 3aMexico 0aWater balance 0aRisk 0aModel 0aKnowledge base1 aDíaz-Padilla, G.1 aVelasquez-Valle, M.1 aSlack, D.C.1 aHeilman, P.1 aPedroza-Sandoval, A.0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2015 June, v. 114 p.178-188dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2015.03.0093Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02242naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245012600158520136700284592002801651650001201679650002401691650001501715651001601730700002001746773012701766856007401893852000901967655001201976IND60652548620221119083246.0190713e20180801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065254862DNAL7 a10.3390/su100827042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOh, Hyun  Min14aThe Effect of Analyst Coverage on the Relationship between Seasoned Equity Offerings and Investment Efficiency From Korea  aIn order for a firm to remain sustainable, it must establish a strategy that is appropriate to its changing environment. One of these strategies is that the procurement of capital and the efficient operation of the procured capital are directly linked to the sustainability of the firm. This study empirically analyzes the relationship between seasoned equity offerings (hereafter SEO) and investment efficiency. We examine the investment efficiency of firms that have SEO and those that do not, and then analyze the effect of analysts on the relationship between SEO and investment efficiency. The empirical results of this study are as follows. First, there is a significant negative correlation between SEO and investment efficiency, meaning that firms with SEO have lower investment efficiency than firms without SEO. Second, the interaction variable between SEO and analyst participation showed a significant positive correlation with investment efficiency, meaning that the more active the analyst, the more any ineffective investment that is derived from managers&rsquo; opportunistic earnings management is suppressed. The results show that the efficient operation of procured capital is important for the sustainability of the firm, and that the analyst plays an important role in monitoring the efficient allocation of resources as an external auditor.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapital 3aeconomic investment 3amonitoring 3aSouth Korea1 aKim, Woo-Young,0 tSustainability.g2018 Aug. 01, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100827043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02958naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006200147245014900209520147000358592002801828650002001856650004401876650002401920650001101944650002501955650001701980650002301997650001802020650002102038650001102059650002202070650004402092650000702136650001502143650001502158653002202173653001502195653001402210653002802224653001502252700002102267773012202288856008102410852000902491655001202500IND60730464220221118091845.0211030e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073046422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1112602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSakr, Ebtehag A.E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6657-755310aImpact of prebiotic potential of stevia sweeteners-sugar used as synbiotic preparation on antimicrobial, antibiofilm, and antioxidant activities  aStevia sweeteners-sugar are low-caloric prebiotic components that fermented by beneficial bacteria and enhance the host health. This study aimed to characterize, select the prebiotic for the chosen probiotics to create synbiotic preparation, and investigate their bioactive properties. The structure of stevia sweeteners-sugar was studied by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), mass spectroscopy (MS), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). There were possible hexose sugars attached to the aglycon groups. Fermentability of these sweeteners by six Lactobacillus spp. and two Bifidobacterium spp. strains was examined and the pH reduction was comparable to the De Man, Rogosa and Sharpe (MRS) media. The best stevia sweeteners-sugar concentration was 0.5% that had favorable effect on the probiotic growth. Moreover, the added sweeteners to the culture media had clearly better growth of probiotics when compared with inulin. The synbiotic supernatants enhanced the antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities of probiotics against potential pathogens and also supported the antioxidant activity. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) determined by HPLC indicated that stevia extract-sugar (SE–sugar) was the best from synbiotic samples. In conclusion, the synbiotic of Lactobacillus casei with SE–sugar as a prebiotic new compound suggested its potential use as pharmaceutical, functional food industry and biocontrol agents for treating bacterial infections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBifidobacterium 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aLactobacillus casei 3aStevia 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abiological control 3afood industry 3afunctional foods 3ainulin 3amass spectrometry 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apH 3aprebiotics 3aprobiotics 0aStevia rebaudiana 0aProbiotics 0aPrebiotic 0aStevia sweeteners-sugar 0aSynbiotics1 aMassoud, Mona I.0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2021 June, v. 144 p.111260-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1112603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02586naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245007300159300001600232520138500248592002801633650001201661650001201673650001201685650001001697650001401707650002801721650001401749650001301763650000901776650001401785650001001799653001901809653001701828653002801845700002301873700001801896700001501914700001801929773012001947856007602067852000902143655001202152IND60517123820221121095613.0160328s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051712382DNAL7 a10.4141/cjps2011-1742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSteppuhn, H.10aInherent responses to root-zone salinity in nine alfalfa populations  ap. 235-248.  aSteppuhn, H., Acharya, S.

Alfalfa productivity can be enhanced by growing crops from cultivars tolerant of root-zone salinity. Rangelander, Keho, Bridgeview, Halo, CW054038, CW064027, Rugged, Bullseye and TS4002 alfalfa plants (respectively designated Ra, Ke, Br, Ha, C8, C7, Ru, Bu and T4) were grown in sand tanks irrigated with nutrient-sulphate solutions averaging 1.53 (nutrients only), 8.03 and 15.61 dS m⁻¹ in electrical conductivity. Except for Br and C7, seedlings emerged equally under the 1.5 and 8.0 dS m⁻¹ treatments, but decreased in the 15.6 dS m⁻¹ treatment by percentages ranging from 3.1 through 29.5. Average shoot biomass among the populations respectively decreased by 49.6, 43.6 and 37.6% in the 1st, 1st+2nd, and 1st+2nd+3rd harvest-cuts as salinity increased from 1.5 to 8.0 dS m⁻¹ and by 80.1, 73.2 and 67.1% from 1.5 to 15.6 dS m⁻¹. At 1.5 dS m⁻¹, the C7 plants consistently produced more shoot biomass than the T4, Bu, Ha, Ru, Ra, or Ke plants. At 8 dS m⁻¹, the relative yields of the Ha plants (scaled by their 1.5 dS m⁻¹ production) exceeded those from the other populations, although the Ha plants produced no greater actual shoot biomass than the C7 or the C8 plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalfalfa 3abiomass 3abromine 3acrops 3acultivars 3aelectrical conductivity 3anutrients 3asalinity 3asand 3aseedlings 3atanks 0aSalt tolerance 0asaline media 0aforage crop development1 aAcharya, Surya N.,1 aIwaasa, A.

In the long run, an individual&rsquo;s ego identity status may influence the sustainability of his or her well-being. Researchers have attempted to discover the predictors or factors correlated with one&rsquo;s identity status. In that search, aesthetic experience, as a unique means of knowing oneself and the world, seemed to be overlooked. Philosophical and psychological discourses have asserted that aesthetic experience stimulated identity discovery and formation; this hypothesis, however, is not supported by strong quantitative evidence. Thus, an empirical study with a quantitative approach was conducted to examine whether those who have frequent aesthetic experiences are more likely to possess a mature ego identity. A sample of 758 valid questionnaires was collected. The results supported the argument that aesthetic experience favors the development of ego identity. In addition, this study revealed that sociodemographic backgrounds such as women, fine arts and design majors, and religious individuals were more likely to have a rich aesthetic life. The results imply that aesthetic experience serves as a crucial aspect that contributes to the wellness of personality development and promotes a healthy and sustainable quality of life.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescence 3aaesthetics 3aempirical research 3apersonality 3aquality of life 3aquantitative analysis 3aquestionnaires 3awomen1 aWang, Po-Ching0 tSustainability.g2018 July 24, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100825963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02821naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245014400161520132700305592002801632650002201660650001201682650001501694650001601709650001601725650002001741650001701761650001701778650001201795650001001807650002401817650002301841650001301864650001001877650001501887650001001902650001101912653001901923653002001942653001701962653002201979653001702001700005702018700001502075700001302090773012202103856008102225852000902306655001202315IND60730464320221118091515.0211030e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073046432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1112612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhong, Wu10aEffect of selected yeast on physicochemical and oenological properties of blueberry wine fermented with citrate-degrading Pichia fermentans  aBlueberry wine has an excessively sour taste due to the presence of high-level of organic acids. Pichia fermentans JT-1-3 with a strong ability to degrade citric acid was selected for blueberry wine production in this work. The flocculation of JT-1-3 in comparison with two S. cerevisiaes strains was evaluated. Then citric acid degradation of JT-1-3 was assessed in synthetic media with different citric acid/glucose ratios under shaking or static conditions. Finally, JT-1-3 was inoculated in blueberry juice for fermentation. The results confirmed that JT-1-3 had appropriate flocculation and consumed citric acid and glucose greatly. In final wines, 6.25% (v/v) alcohol was achieved with 1.83% (w/w) residual sugar. Compared with juice, citric, malic and tartaric acids declined significantly by 43.35%, 35.29% and 44.68% in wine, respectively. 2-phenylethanol, ethyl 9-hexadecenoate, ethyl decanoate were the main volatiles in blueberry wine and most esters contributed to the aroma with high odor activity values. Sensory evaluation showed that wine produced by JT-1-3 imparted improved taste with lower acidity, bitterness and hotness perceptions compared with S. cerevisiae fermentation. This work revealed that JT-1-3 had a great potential to be applied for blueberry wine fermentation along with deacidification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPichia fermentans 3aacidity 3abitterness 3ablueberries 3acitric acid 3adeacidification 3afermentation 3aflocculation 3aglucose 3aodors 3aphenylethyl alcohol 3asensory evaluation 3asourness 3ataste 3awinemaking 3awines 3ayeasts 0aBlueberry wine 0aDeacidification 0aFermentation 0aNon-saccharomyces 0aOrganic acid1 aLiu, Shaoquan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0868-27311 aYang, Hong1 aLi, Erhu0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2021 June, v. 145 p.111261-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1112613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01409naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245002400159300001600183520037400199592002800573650002300601650001000624650001100634650002000645650001400665650001700679653002600696653001500722653001600737653002500753700002000778700001500798700001700813773012000830856007600950852000901026655001201035IND60517123920221121095614.0160328s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051712392DNAL7 a10.4141/cjps2011-1842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, T.

However, the potential safety problems of QDs, mainly due to their nanotoxicities by unclear mechanisms, have greatly limited its applications. To reverse this situation, we investigated the underlying biological mechanisms of the toxicity of Quantum Dots CdTe/CdS 655 (QDs 655) in this work. QDs 655 was found to elicit nanotoxicity in vitro and in vivo. During the process, autophagy was activated, which was characterized by three main stages of autophagic flux including formation of autophagosomes, lysosomes fused with autophagosomes, and degradation of autophagosomes by lysosomes. Furthermore, the autophagic cell death was demonstrated in vitro under QDs 655 treatment while inhibition of autophagy by pharmacological inhibitors or genetic approaches could attenuate the toxicity induced by QDs 655 in vitro and in vivo. These results indicated that autophagic flux and autophagic cell death were triggered by QDs 655, which elucidated the critical role of autophagy in QDs 655 induced toxicity. Our data may suggest the approach to overcome the toxicity of QDs and other nanoparticles by autophagy inhibition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautophagy 3adisease diagnosis 3adrugs 3aimage analysis 3alysosomes 3ananoparticles 3aquantum dots 3atoxicity 0aAutophagy 0aCadmium 0aQuantum dots 0aNanotoxicity 0aBiosafety1 aSun, Yun1 aWang, Shaofei1 aLi, Yubin1 aZeng, Xian1 aCao, Zhonglian1 aYang, Ping1 aSong, Ping1 aWang, Junchen,1 aXian, Zongshu1 aGao, Hongjian1 aChen, Qicheng1 aCui, Daxiang1 aJu, Dianwen0 tBiomaterials.g2016 Feb., v. 78 p.102-114dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.11.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02427naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245013500162300002000297520109700317592002801414650002701442650001901469650001101488650001301499650001701512650002501529650001201554650001701566650001801583650002801601650001201629650001301641650001301654650002201667650001401689700001801703700001701721700001901738700001601757773012501773856007401898852000901972655001201981IND60665723020221119220649.0190912e20140902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066572302DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra03939d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGliszczyńska, A.10aSynthesis of β-damascone derivatives with a lactone ring and their feeding deterrent activity against aphids and lesser mealworms  ap. 39248-39256.  aStarting from β-damascone, six new lactones were obtained. The Claisen–Johnson rearrangement of allylic alcohol and halolactonization of γ,δ-unsaturated acid were the key steps of the presented synthesis. The structures of the new derivatives were determined by spectroscopic data. The antifeedant activity of β-damascone towards two insect species with different feeding habits and food preferences, i.e., the peach-potato aphid Myzus persicae (Sulz.) and lesser mealworm, Alphitobius diaperinus Panzer, was studied, as well as the biological consequences of structural modification of the starting substrate. The successive structural modifications of β-damascone that resulted in the greatest antifeedant activity towards M. persicae were the incorporation of a lactone moiety and concomitant presence of bromine in the side chain. All β-damascone derivatives with a lactone moiety deterred the feeding of adults and larvae of A. diaperinus. Halo-δ-lactones were more active than halo-γ-lactones, and A. diaperinus adults were more sensitive to the compounds studied than larvae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlphitobius diaperinus 3aMyzus persicae 3aadults 3aalcohols 3aantifeedants 3aantifeeding activity 3abromine 3afood choices 3ainsect larvae 3ainsecticidal properties 3ainsects 3alactones 3amoieties 3aspectral analysis 3asynthesis1 aDancewicz, K.1 aHnatejko, M.1 aSzczepanik, M.1 aGabryś, B.0 tRSC advances.g2014 Sept. 02, v. 4, no. 74 p.39248-39256dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra03939d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03410naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002200156245014500178300001400323520146800337592002801805650002101833650001401854650001801868650001801886650001401904650001301918650001401931650001901945650002001964650001501984650002301999650001602022650001102038650002302049650001102072650001502083650001902098650001402117650002602131650001402157653000702171653001502178653003202193653002902225653002802254653002302282700002102305700002002326700002002346700001802366700002102384700002402405700002002429700002202449700002002471700002402491700005902515773007502574856009002649852000902739655001202748IND60562516420221120212402.0170208e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056251642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.11.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEstrada, Marta F.10aModelling the tumour microenvironment in long-term microencapsulated 3D co-cultures recapitulates phenotypic features of disease progression  ap. 50-61.  a3D cell tumour models are generated mainly in non-scalable culture systems, using bioactive scaffolds. Many of these models fail to reflect the complex tumour microenvironment and do not allow long-term monitoring of tumour progression. To overcome these limitations, we have combined alginate microencapsulation with agitation-based culture systems, to recapitulate and monitor key aspects of the tumour microenvironment and disease progression. Aggregates of MCF-7 breast cancer cells were microencapsulated in alginate, either alone or in combination with human fibroblasts, then cultured for 15 days. In co-cultures, the fibroblasts arranged themselves around the tumour aggregates creating distinct epithelial and stromal compartments. The presence of fibroblasts resulted in secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and deposition of collagen in the stromal compartment. Tumour cells established cell–cell contacts and polarised around small lumina in the interior of the aggregates. Over the culture period, there was a reduction in oestrogen receptor and membranous E-cadherin alongside loss of cell polarity, increased collective cell migration and enhanced angiogenic potential in co-cultures. These phenotypic alterations, typical of advanced stages of cancer, were not observed in the mono-cultures of MCF-7 cells. The proposed model system constitutes a new tool to study tumour-stroma crosstalk, disease progression and drug resistance mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreast neoplasms 3acadherins 3acell movement 3acell polarity 3acoculture 3acollagen 3acytokines 3adisease course 3adrug resistance 3aepithelium 3aestrogen receptors 3afibroblasts 3ahumans 3amicroencapsulation 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aneoplasm cells 3aphenotype 3aresistance mechanisms 3asecretion 0a3D 0aCo-culture 0aAlginate microencapsulation 0aStirred-tank bioreactors 0aTumour microenvironment 0aTumour progression1 aRebelo, Sofia P.1 aDavies, Emma J.1 aPinto, Marta T.1 aPereira, Hugo1 aSanto, Vítor E.1 aSmalley, Matthew J.1 aBarry, Simon T.1 aGualda, Emilio J.1 aAlves, Paula M.1 aAnderson, Elizabeth1 aBrito, Catarina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8926-279X0 tBiomaterials.g2016 Feb., v. 78 p.50-61dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.11.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02902naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245012900176300001600305520143000321592002801751650001701779650002201796650001601818650001801834650001501852650001301867650000901880650002401889650002601913650001201939653001501951653001201966653002701978653003602005653001102041653001502052700002202067700002302089700002302112700002102135700002202156700002202178700001902200773009102219856008902310852000902399655001202408IND60606528520221121152121.0180726e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060652852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.07.0822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartin, David P.10aNanosilver conductive ink: A case study for evaluating the potential risk of nanotechnology under hypothetical use scenarios  ap. 222-227.  aEngineered nanomaterials (ENMs) are being incorporated into a variety of consumer products due to unique properties that offer a variety of advantages over bulk materials. Understanding of the nano-specific risk associated with nano-enabled technologies, however, continues to lag behind research and development, registration with regulators, and commercialization. One example of a nano-enabled technology is nanosilver ink, which can be used in commercial ink-jet printers for the development of low-cost printable electronics. This investigation utilizes a tiered EHS framework to evaluate the potential nano-specific release, exposure and hazard associated with typical use of both nanosilver ink and printed circuits. The framework guides determination of the potential for ENM release from both forms of the technology in simulated use scenarios, including spilling of the ink, aqueous release (washing) from the circuits and UV light exposure. The as-supplied ink merits nano-specific consideration based on the presence of nanoparticles and their persistence in environmentally-relevant media. The material released from the printed circuits upon aqueous exposure was characterized by a number of analysis techniques, including ultracentrifugation and single particle ICP-MS, and the results suggest that a vast majority of the material was ionic in nature and nano-specific regulatory scrutiny may be less relevant.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acommercialization 3aelectronics 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3aprinters 3arisk 3aultracentrifugation 3aultraviolet radiation 3awashing 0aNanosilver 0aRelease 0aSingle particle ICP-MS 0aEnvironmental health and safety 0aHazard 0aRegulatory1 aMelby, Nicolas L.1 aJordan, Shinita M.1 aBednar, Anthony J.1 aKennedy, Alan J.1 aNegrete, Maria E.1 aChappell, Mark A.1 aPoda, Aimee R.0 tChemosphere.g2016 Nov., v. 162 p.222-227dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.07.0823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04451naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100003000188245012800218300001200346506007600358520222700434592002802661506003702689650002502726650002102751650001902772650001402791650002502805650001802830650001702848650001902865650002902884650001902913650001602932650001402948650001502962650001802977650001202995650001003007650001403017650001903031650001803050650001103068650001903079650001503098650001003113650001003123650001003133650002503143650000903168650001903177650002403196650001203220650000903232650001303241650001403254650001103268650001203279651001303291700003703304700003003341700002203371700002403393700002003417700002203437773013103459856008203590852000903672655001203681IND60574611320221207115414.0210514e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057461132DNAL7 a286761142pmid7 aPMC54966052pmcid7 a10.1186/s12906-017-1854-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDjimeli, Merline Namekong10aAntibacterial activities and toxicological study of the aqueous extract from leaves of Alchornea cordifolia (Euphorbiaceae)  ap. 349.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: A. cordifolia is a plant widely used in Africa to solve many health problems. In Cameroon, it is used in the treatment of urogenital infections. As a continuation of our search for pharmacologically active agents from natural sources, the antimicrobial activity of A. cordifolia leaf extracts against E. coli and the toxicity of this extract were investigated. METHODS: The antibacterial activity of the aqueous extract from leaves of Alchornea cordifolia was carried out in vitro on Escherichia coli, as well as in vivo on E. coli-infected rat model. Phytochemical screening was performed using standard methods. The acute toxicity was investigated in mice, while at the end of treatment of infected rats, some biochemical, hematological and histological markers of toxicity were evaluated. RESULTS: The extract exhibited a bacteriostatic activity with MIC value of 1500 μg/ml. Phytochemical screening revealed the presence of phenols, tannins, triterpens, flavonoids, alkaloids, anthraquinones, anthocyanins, saponins and coumarins in the extract. The acute toxicity study showed LD₅₀ values of 8.6 g/kg and 3.8 g/kg in male and female mice respectively. In vivo, the oral administration of the extract showed a dose-dependent decrease of the bacterial load as the extract at 232, 112 and 58 g/kg were able to eradicate the infection after 9, 11 and 13 days of treatment. The infected rats showed a significant (p < 0.05) increase in the level of serum creatinine, ALAT, white blood cells, and a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in the level of food and water intake, the relative weight of lungs, heart and spleen. In the treated rats, a significant (p < 0.05) increase in food and water intake and ALAT was observed at the doses of 116 and 232 mg/kg. A decrease in the red blood cells count and serum protein levels was also observed. These observations corroborate liver damages as revealed by the histopathological examination of the cross sections of this organ. CONCLUSION: The results of this assay thus showed that the extract of A. cordifolia is bacteriostatic, therapeutic at 58 g/kg bw and may be considered as slightly and almost non-toxic on females and males mice respectively.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAlchornea cordifolia 3aEscherichia coli 3aacute toxicity 3aalkaloids 3aalternative medicine 3aanimal models 3aanthocyanins 3aanthraquinones 3aantibacterial properties 3ablood proteins 3ablood serum 3acoumarins 3acreatinine 3adose response 3afemales 3aheart 3ahistology 3ahistopathology 3aleaf extracts 3aleaves 3alethal dose 50 3aleukocytes 3aliver 3alungs 3amales 3amedicinal properties 3amice 3amicrobial load 3aoral administration 3aphenols 3arats 3asaponins 3ascreening 3aspleen 3atannins 3aCameroon1 aFodouop, Siméon Pierre Chegaing1 aNjateng, Guy Sedar Singor1 aFokunang, Charles1 aTala, Donald Sedric1 aKengni, Fabrice1 aGatsing, Donatien0 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2017 Dec., v. 17, no. 1 p.349-349dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-017-1854-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01519naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245006900164300001400233520056800247592002800815650001900843650002200862650001700884653001900901653000900920653002600929700001800955700001500973773012300988856008501111852000901196655001201205IND60541201620221119203823.0190318e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054120162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2015.03.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLardy, R.10aVuln-Indices: Software to assess vulnerability to climate change  ap. 53-57.  aVuln-Indices Java-based software was developed on concepts of vulnerability to climate change of agro-ecological systems.

Furthermore, a variety of sham interventions have been used as a control for acupuncture clinical trials. Indeed, one such control has been mock laser which has been used as control intervention in several acupuncture clinical controlled trials. The current study aim was to examine the De Qi sensory responses and its related characteristics elicited from acupuncture and compare them to those reported following sham laser in participants enrolled in a clinical trial. METHODS: The study was embedded in a multi-center, two-arm randomised clinical trial, which evaluated the effect of acupuncture on lateral elbow pain. De Qi was assessed using the Massachusetts General Hospital Acupuncture Sensation Scale (MASS). Ninety-six participants were randomly allocated to receive either acupuncture (n = 47) or mock laser (n = 49) at the acupoints LI 10 and LI 11. RESULTS: Participants in both intervention groups reported similar De Qi psychophysical characteristics; however, both intensity and frequency of the individually perceived De Qi characteristics were significantly higher in the acupuncture group. ‘Soreness’, ‘deep pressure’, and ‘fullness-distension’ in the acupuncture group and ‘tingling’, and ‘sharp pain’ in mock laser group, were identified as the leading characteristics. Similar level of MASS De Qi Index (MDI) scores were reported for ‘Hong Kong-China’ and ‘Australia-Italy’ with a significantly higher level of De Qi reported by ‘Hong Kong-China’. Furthermore, two distinct De Qi categories were identified, namely De Qi (in line with classical sensory responses of Suan, Ma, Zhang, and Zhong) and pain. CONCLUSIONS: Subjective ‘somatic or interoceptive awareness’ should be taken into account when De Qi psychophysical responses are examined. The study accentuates the necessity and the significance of further research into interoception phenomenon which may contribute to a better understanding of the placebo effect and De Qi psychophysical responses.

Ammonium complete depletion was not achieved. Ponds operated under real conditions presented lower ammonium removal. Elimination capacities were around 26mgN/Ld and were subsequently increased with increasing inlet ammonium loading rate. Different nitrogen transformation was observed depending on substrate source. When anaerobically digested slurry was fed to the ponds, nitrification followed by biomass uptake and denitrification were the main nitrogen transformation taking place depending on inlet ammonium loading rate and operational conditions. Ponds fed with fresh slurry exhibited denitrification as the main nitrogen removal mechanism for the pond operated under real conditions while under optimal conditions stripping, denitrification and biomass uptake contributed similarly. Therefore, this study confirmed that the so-claimed nitrogen recovery by microalgae biomass is frequently overestimated.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3adenitrification 3alighting 3amicroalgae 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3apig manure 3aponds 3aslurries 3atemperature 2aAnimals 2aBacteriaxmetabolism 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aFresh Waterxmicrobiology 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMicroalgaexmetabolism 2aNitratesxanalysis 2aNitritesxanalysis 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aOxygenxanalysis 2aQuaternary Ammonium Compoundsxisolation & purification 2aSewagexmicrobiology 2aSus scrofa 2aTime Factors 2aWaste Disposal, Fluid 2aWater Purificationxmethods1 aMolinuevo-Salces, Beatriz1 aGarcía-González, Maria Cruz0 tBioresource technology.g2011 Jan., v. 102, no. 2 p.960-966dElsevier Ltdx0960-85247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2010.09.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01957naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245011900160300001600279520073400295592002801029650001601057650002401073650001201097650001201109650002001121650001301141650001301154650001401167650001101181650001101192653001101203653001201214653001401226653001901240653002201259700002701281773015201308856007801460852000901538655001201547IND60522108820221120233709.0160601e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052210882DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1998-5-6012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRettich, R.10aDarstellung und Strukturbeschreibung von NaCa3 Mn(V2O7)(V3O10) / Preparation and Structure of NaCa3Mn(V2O7)(V3O10)  ap. 507-511.  aSingle crystals of NaCa₃ Mn(V₂O₇)(V₃O₁₀) have been prepared by crystallization from flux in argon atmosphere.

The Fe₃O₄ nanoparticles, Fe₃O₄-chitosan, and immobilized Alcalase 2.4L alkaline protease were characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscope, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, electron spin resonance, and vibrating sample magnetometry. Results showed that the binding of chitosan and Alcalase 2.4L alkaline protease on Fe₃O₄ through cross-linking was successful. In addition, the Alcalase 2.4L alkaline protease immobilized with chitosan-coated magnetic nanoparticles enhanced the activity, the optimum reaction temperature and pH value for the immobilized enzyme were 55 °C and 10, respectively, compared with the free enzyme, and the optimal temperature and pH profile range were considerably broadened. Similarly, the thermal stability was enhanced by immobilization, and the kinetic parameters of free and immobilized Alcalase 2.4L alkaline protease were determined. Then, from our hydrolysis experiments, we found that immobilized Alcalase 2.4L alkaline protease uses Fe₃O₄-chitosan had a greatest hydrolytic activity, and the DH of soy protein isolate (SPI) can reach to 18.38 %, against 17.50 % with the free enzyme after 140 min. Furthermore, the immobilized Alcalase 2.4L alkaline protease could maintain about 86 % of its original activity after ten consecutive operations. Thus, Fe₃O₄-chitosan immobilized Alcalase 2.4L alkaline protease a good candidate for the continuous hydrolysis of SPI.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3achitosan 3acrosslinking 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aglutaraldehyde 3ahydrolysis 3aimmobilized enzymes 3airon oxides 3ananoparticles 3apH 3asoy protein isolate 3asubtilisin 3atemperature 3athermal stability1 aZhang, Chao-ran1 aQi, Bao-kun1 aSui, Xiao-nan1 aJiang, Lian-zhou1 aLi, Yang1 aWang, Zhong-jiang1 aFeng, Hong-xia1 aWang, Rui1 aZhang, Qiao-zhi0 tEuropean food research & technology.g2014 Dec., v. 239, no. 6 p.1051-1059dSpringer-Verlagx1438-23777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00217-014-2301-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02795naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245013900172300001400311520141400325592002801739650001901767650001801786650001901804650001401823650001301837650001201850650001501862650001101877650001701888650001201905650001601917653000801933653000601941653000801947653001001955653003301965653003101998653002102029653001702050653001602067700006102083773008802144856008402232852000902316655001202325IND60592380720221116185954.0200509e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059238072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.flora.2018.01.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPadureanu, Silvica10aPalynological characterization, germination potential and pollen tube growth of direct producer hybrids Noah and Othello (Vitis genus)  ap. 58-67.  aNoah and Othello cultivars are American direct producer hybrids with different genetic origins. Noah is native of Vitis labrusca × Vitis riparia and Othello of (Vitis labrusca × Vitis riparia) × Black Hamburg (Vitis vinifera). Their grape productions are different. Pollen quality is important for grape production. Present research studied the two direct producer hybrids in order to highlight the pollen qualities correlated to genetic substrate of genitors. It presents a holistic approach of the two direct producer hybrids’ pollen, including a brief palynological characterization, germination potential analysis, dynamics of pollen tube growth, stages of pollen tube edification, morphological abnormalities of pollen tubes and main floral elements. The correlations between these characteristics can be used at the grape production appreciation based on pollen quality.Palynological characteristics of the two direct producer hybrids are very similar, as they belong to Vitis genus, even if the genitors are different. Germination potential is higher for Othello cultivar. In vitro, the pollen tube growth is fast and increases significantly within the first 24 h on mediums with 15% and 25% sucrose. It is proved that the longest pollen tubes are correlated with style's length of the flower of the two genotypes. Pollen tube abnormalities are more frequent in Noah than in Othello.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVitis labrusca 3aVitis riparia 3aVitis vinifera 3acultivars 3agenotype 3ahybrids 3apalynology 3apollen 3apollen tubes 3asucrose 3aviticulture 0acv. 0ah 0aDPH 0asucr. 0aDirect producer hybrid (DPH) 0aGermination rate of pollen 0aNutritive medium 0aPollen grain 0aPollen tube1 aPatras, Antoanela1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4054-48840 tFlora.g2018 Mar., v. 240 p.58-67dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl51878x0367-25307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.flora.2018.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02867naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245011300164300001600277520131300293592002801606650001201634650001301646650002301659650002201682650002101704650002201725650000901747650001401756650001101770650000701781650001501788650002501803653003701828653002201865653002501887653002401912653002901936700001301965700001401978700002001992700009202012700009002104773009702194856008502291852000902376655001202385IND60609784920221119101632.0191114e20181015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060978492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2018.06.0722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Wei10aCo-oxidation of As(III) and Fe(II) by oxygen through complexation between As(III) and Fe(II)/Fe(III) species  ap. 599-607.  aPrevious studies have shown that the oxidation of Fe(II) by molecular oxygen can lead to the co-oxidation of As(III) at neutral pH. However, the mechanism of As(III) oxidation in the presence of Fe(II) with respect to the interaction between As(III) and Fe(II) is still unclear. In this work, we examined the oxidation of As(III) in the presence of Fe(II) in air-saturated water, which is affected by pH, co-existing phosphate, and scavengers (tert-butanol, superoxide dismutase, catalase and dimethylsulfoxide). Results confirm that the formation of the Fe(II)–As(III) complex (formation constant, KFe(II)–As(III) = 103.86 M–1) plays an extremely important role in the initial stage of As(III) oxidation at pH 7.25. The oxidation of Fe(II)–As(III) promotes the production of H2O2 and colloidal ferric hydroxide. H2O2 reacts with the Fe(II)–As(III) complex through oxidizing Fe(II) to Fe(IV), which then causes the partial oxidation (ca. 50%) of As(III). The other part of As(III) oxidation by H2O2 occurs, in the form of Fe(III)–As(III) complex, through direct electron transfer from As(III) to H2O2 but not through Fe(IV). This work provides new mechanistic insight into arsenic and iron redox chemistry in the environment and furthers our understanding of Fenton reactions at neutral pH.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic 3acatalase 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3aelectron transfer 3aferric hydroxide 3ahydrogen peroxide 3airon 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3apH 3aphosphates 3asuperoxide dismutase 0aFe(II)/Fe(III)−As(III) complex 0aAs(III) oxidation 0aFenton-like reaction 0aFe(IV) intermediate 0aDirect electron transfer1 aXu, Jing1 aChen, Tao1 aLiu, Chengshuai1 aLi, Jinjun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4008-9022 https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4008-90221 aWu, Feng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0842-8728 https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0842-87280 tWater research.g2018 Oct. 15, v. 143 p.599-607dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2018.06.0723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02026naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245014700162520102200309592002801331650002501359650002501384650001601409650002301425650002101448650001601469651001301485700001801498773012601516856007301642852000901715655001201724IND60652003020221119175429.0190712e20170701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065200302DNAL7 a10.3390/su90711512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuathong, Kantapop10aPerceived Attributes of Event Sustainability in the MICE Industry in Thailand: A Viewpoint from Governmental, Academic, Venue and Practitioner  aThe environmental impacts of meetings, incentives, conventions, and exhibitions (MICE, Event) industries are as far reaching as their economic reach. The travelers who attend events patronize a wide variety of businesses: airlines, car rental agencies, hotels, restaurants, performance venues, and tour operators. The overall research objectives of this study fall on two aspects of sustainability in the event industry: the most prevalent practices that the industry employs and the relative importance of sustainability to convention consumers. This study implements mixed research methods in order to explore the perceptions of sustainable event development in the metropolitan area of Bangkok, Thailand.

Nowadays, only a few game reserves in this region support populations of African elephants (Loxodonta africana), and thus, little information exists regarding the suitability of the nutritionally poor Fynbos vegetation for these megaherbivores. Using already established non-invasive methods, the monitoring of individual body conditions and fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (fGCM) concentrations, as a measure of physiological stress, was performed to examine a herd of 13 elephants in a Western Cape Province Private Game Reserve, during two monitoring periods (April and June 2018), following a severe drought. The results indicate that overall median body condition scores (April and June: 3.0, range 2.0–3.0) and fGCM concentrations (April: 0.46 µg/g dry weight (DW), range 0.35–0.66 µg/g DW; June: 0.61 µg/g DW, range 0.22–1.06 µg/g DW) were comparable to those of other elephant populations previously studied utilizing the same techniques. These findings indicate that the individuals obtain sufficient nutrients from the surrounding Fynbos vegetation during the months monitored. However, a frequent assessment of body conditions and stress-associated fGCM concentrations in these animals would assist conservation management authorities and animal welfare practitioners in determining ways to manage this species in environments with comparably poorer nutritional vegetation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLoxodonta africana 3aanimal welfare 3abody condition 3aconservation areas 3adrought 3afynbos 3aglucocorticoids 3aherds 3aindigenous species 3ametabolites 3aSouth Africa1 aTeren, Gabriella 1 aGanswindt, Andre 0 tAnimals.g2020 May 08, v. 10, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani100508143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03309naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002400166245017600190300001600366520116400382592002801546650002501574650002101599650001701620650001501637650002401652650001001676650001701686650000901703650002101712650001001733650002001743650003901763650004801802650003301850650002701883650004601910650002001956650003001976650004402006650003802050650002602088650004402114650005502158650003302213650002502246650004002271650005502311650004102366700002202407700002402429700002202453700001902475700003202494773010002526856004802626852000902674655001202683IND50069715620221118155920.0131017e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006971562DNAL7 a237715982pmid7 a10.1007/s11103-013-0091-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlancquaert, Dieter10aRice folate enhancement through metabolic engineering has an impact on rice seed metabolism, but does not affect the expression of the endogenous folate biosynthesis genes  ap. 329-349.  aFolates are key-players in one-carbon metabolism in all organisms. However, only micro-organisms and plants are able to synthesize folates de novo and humans rely entirely on their diet as a sole folate source. As a consequence, folate deficiency is a global problem. Although different strategies are currently implemented to fight folate deficiency, up until now, all of them have their own drawbacks. As an alternative and complementary means to those classical strategies, folate biofortification of rice by metabolic engineering was successfully achieved a couple of years ago. To gain more insight into folate biosynthesis regulation and the effect of folate enhancement on general rice seed metabolism, a transcriptomic study was conducted in developing transgenic rice seeds, overexpressing 2 genes of the folate biosynthetic pathway. Upon folate enhancement, the expression of 235 genes was significantly altered. Here, we show that rice folate biofortification has an important effect on folate dependent, seed developmental and plant stress response/defense processes, but does not affect the expression of the endogenous folate biosynthesis genes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochemical pathways 3abiofortification 3abiosynthesis 3afolic acid 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3aplant stress 3arice 3aseed development 3aseeds 3astress response 2aArabidopsisxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aFolic Acidxmetabolism 2aGTP Cyclohydrolasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aMetabolic Engineering 2aOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis 2aOryzaxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aRNA, Plantxgenetics 2aReal-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSeedsxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aTransaminasesxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aVan Daele, Jeroen1 aStorozhenko, Sergei1 aStove, Christophe1 aLambert, Willy1 aVan Der Straeten, Dominique0 tPlant molecular biology.g2013 Nov., v. 83, no. 4-5 p.329-349dSpringer-Verlagx0167-44127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11103-013-0091-7  aDNAL 7aarticle02709naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245009400162520148900256592002801745650002001773650002201793650001201815650001801827650001101845650001301856650001601869650001601885650001401901650002001915650001401935650002201949650002101971650001001992650001402002700002202016700002002038700002102058773012602079856007302205852000902278655001202287IND60652003120221119175126.0190712e20170622xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065200312DNAL7 a10.3390/su90710892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlao, Babatunde O.14aThe Potential of Animal By-Products in Food Systems: Production, Prospects and Challenges  aThe consumption of animal by-products has continued to witness tremendous growth over the last decade. This is due to its potential to combat protein malnutrition and food insecurity in many countries. Shortly after slaughter, animal by-products are separated into edible or inedible parts. The edible part accounts for 55% of the production while the remaining part is regarded as inedible by-products (IEBPs). These IEBPs can be re-processed into sustainable products for agricultural and industrial uses. The efficient utilization of animal by-products can alleviate the prevailing cost and scarcity of feed materials, which have high competition between animals and humans. This will also aid in reducing environmental pollution in the society. In this regard, proper utilization of animal by-products such as rumen digesta can result in cheaper feed, reduction in competition and lower cost of production. Over the years, the utilization of animal by-products such as rumen digesta as feed in livestock feed has been successfully carried out without any adverse effect on the animals. However, there are emerging gaps that need to be further addressed regarding the food security and sustainability of the products. Therefore, the objective of this review highlights the efficacy and effectiveness of using animal by-products as alternative sources of feed ingredients, and the constraints associated with their production to boost livestock performance in the industry at large.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aanimal byproducts 3adigesta 3afood security 3ahumans 3aindustry 3aingredients 3akwashiorkor 3alivestock 3alivestock feeds 3apollution 3apollution control 3aproduction costs 3arumen 3aslaughter1 aFalowo, Andrew B.1 aChulayo, Amanda1 aMuchenje, Voster0 tSustainability.g2017 June 22, v. 9, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su90710893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02511naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245010300166300001800269520135600287592002801643650002101671650002001692650002001712650002501732650002101757650002901778650001301807653002101820653002501841653002001866653001401886653002101900700001701921773010501938856008502043852000902128655001202137IND60568244520221120111549.0170502e20170603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056824452DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2016.12287002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaboni, M.10aValidation of a new model for the sizing of denitrification reactors, by testing full-scale plants  ap. 1376-1382.  aA new deterministic model for the calculation of the specific denitrification rate (SDNR), useful for the design of pre-denitrification reactors, was tested on eight full-scale activated sludge plants. The model represents the SDNR at 20°C (SDNR ₂₀°C) as a function of the sludge loading in the denitrification reactor (F:M DEN) and the residual dissolved oxygen in the denitrification reactor (DO DEN). The results proved the ability of the model in calculating the SDNR ₂₀°C. The model shows a lower degree of adaptability for small-sized plants. SDNR ₂₀°C proved to have a strong sensitivity to DO DEN, mainly in correspondence with low DO concentrations (less than 2 mg L ⁻¹). The sensitivity decreases at greater DO values, but with a progressively less marked gradient, up to becoming weak only at DO concentrations greater than 0.4-0.5 mg L ⁻¹, which are rarely found in full-scale plants. DO concentrations measured in real-scale facilities are mostly in the range 0.2-0.4 mg L ⁻¹. These concentrations cause adverse effects on the kinetics of nitrogen removal, and consequently on the denitrification performance. Thus, minimizing DO in the pre-denitrification reactor is relevant. The sensitivity of SDNR ₂₀°C to F:M DEN was less important, as it is characterized by a growing linear behaviour with a low slope.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3aadverse effects 3adenitrification 3adeterministic models 3adissolved oxygen 3aenvironmental technology 3anitrogen 0aActivated sludge 0abiological processes 0adenitrification 0amodelling 0anitrogen removal1 aTorretta, V.0 tEnvironmental technology.g2017 June 3, v. 38, no. 11 p.1376-1382dTaylor & Francisx1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2016.12287003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03029naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245013800169300001600307500001900323520138200342592002801724650002201752650002301774650001601797650001601813650002101829650002001850650001501870650001301885650001101898650002001909650002301929650002701952650001901979650001601998650001202014650001102026650001802037653001002055653002402065653000902089653000902098653000902107653001402116700002302130700002302153700002002176700002102196700001902217700002402236773009502260856008702355852000902442655001202451IND60656920320221119144712.0200210e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065692032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cryobiol.2019.08.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpis, Emilia10aConventional freezing vs. cryoprotectant-free vitrification of epididymal (MESA) and testicular (TESE) spermatozoa: Three live births  ap. 100-102.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aData of cryoprotectant-free vitrification of human testicular and epididymal spermatozoa are limited. The aim of this investigation was to compare two aseptic technologies of TESE (testicular) and MESA (epididymal) spermatozoa cryopreservation: standard conventional freezing with the use of cryoprotectants and cryoprotectant-free vitrification. Sperm motility, capacitation-like changes, acrosome reaction and the mitochondrial membrane potential of frozen (5% glycerol, −10 °C/min) and vitrified (Human Tubal Fluid + 1% Human Serum Albumin+0.25 M sucrose, plunging into liquid nitrogen of capillaries with spermatozoa isolated from liquid nitrogen (aseptic method) were compared. The quality of the cryoprotectant-free vitrified MESA- and TESE-spermatozoa was higher than that of spermatozoa conventionally frozen with permeable cryoprotectants. Intracellular sperm injection (ICSI) was performed with vitrified spermatozoa. We report the birth of three healthy babies from two women following ICSI with motile MESA- and TESE-spermatozoa vitrified without cryoprotectants. This is the first report of full-term pregnancies and babies born after ICSI with epididymal and testicular spermatozoa vitrified without cryoprotectants. In conclusion, cryoprotectant-free vitrification can be successfully applied for the cryopreservation of motile TESE- and MESA-spermatozoa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrosome reaction 3aaseptic conditions 3ablood serum 3acryobiology 3acryopreservation 3acryoprotectants 3aepididymis 3aglycerol 3ahumans 3aliquid nitrogen 3amembrane potential 3amitochondrial membrane 3asperm motility 3aspermatozoa 3asucrose 3atestes 3avitrification 0aHuman 0aCryoprotectant-free 0aTESE 0aMESA 0aICSI 0aBaby born1 aBushkovskaia, Anna1 aIsachenko, Evgenia1 aTodorov, Plamen1 aSánchez, Raúl,1 aSkopets, Viola1 aIsachenko, Vladimir0 tCryobiology.g2019 Oct., v. 90 p.100-102dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45487x0011-22407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cryobiol.2019.08.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02660naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245014900178300001800327500001500345520118800360592002801548650002001576650001501596650001401611650002201625650002001647650002001667650002601687650002901713650002101742650002001763650001901783650002101802650002901823653001901852653001101871653002001882653001901902700002601921700002601947700001801973773010501991856008502096852000902181655001202190IND60568244620221120111458.0170502e20170603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056824462DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2016.12287012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPramanik, Biplob Kumar10aImpact of ozonation, anion exchange resin and UV/H2O2 pre-treatments to control fouling of ultrafiltration membrane for drinking water treatment  ap. 1383-1389.  a2019-12-06  aThe effects of ozonation, anion exchange resin (AER) and UV/H ₂O ₂ were investigated as a pre-treatment to control organic fouling (OF) of ultrafiltration membrane in the treatment of drinking water. It was found that high molecular weight (MW) organics such as protein and polysaccharide substances were majorly responsible for reversible fouling which contributed to 90% of total fouling. The decline rate increased with successive filtration cycles due to deposition of protein content over time. All pre-treatment could reduce the foulants of a Ultrafiltration membrane which contributed to the improvement in flux, and there was a greater improvement of flux by UV/H ₂O ₂ (61%) than ozonation (43%) which in turn was greater than AER (23%) treatment. This was likely due to the effective removal/breakdown of high MW organic content. AER gave greater removal of biofouling potential components (such as biodegradable dissolved organic carbon and assimilable organic carbon contents) compared to UV/H ₂O ₂ and ozonation treatment. Overall, this study demonstrated the potential of pre-treatments for reducing OF of ultrafiltration for the treatment of drinking water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aprotein content 3abiofouling 3aozonation 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aultrafiltration 3awater treatment 3aanion exchange resins 3adissolved organic carbon 3abiodegradability 3apolysaccharides 3adrinking water 3amolecular weight 3aenvironmental technology 0aDrinking water 0acarbon 0aorganic fouling 0apre-treatments1 aPramanik, Sagor Kumar1 aSarker, Dipok Chandra1 aSuja, Fatihah0 tEnvironmental technology.g2017 June 3, v. 38, no. 11 p.1383-1389dTaylor & Francisx1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2016.12287013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02323naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245014100163300001800304520104900322592002801371650001601399650001201415650001701427650001401444650001901458650002301477650001601500700001601516700001401532700005301546700001701599700001301616700006001629773017001689856008101859852000901940655001201949IND60769658520221119142023.0220309e20220224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076965852DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.1c048352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Zhicheng10aFuzzy-Logic-Based Modeling and Control for HiGee-AOP Nitric Oxide Attenuation with a Complex Gas–Liquid Mass-Transfer-Reaction Process  ap. 3428-3438.  aThe complex flows under high gravity in intricate advanced oxidation reactions expose a high-gravity advanced oxidation process (HiGee-AOP) modeling and control to uncertainty. Existing methods based on conservation equations cannot describe such a process with sufficient accuracy because of the mismatch between the assumptions and actual system behavior. Here, we propose a fuzzy-logic-based modeling and control scheme for a HiGee-AOP for nitric oxide (NO) attenuation. A hybrid fuzzy model is presented based on the theoretical model and a collection of if–then rules describing the difference between the theoretical model and the real system. Subsequently, the model serves as the internal model, associated with the fuzzy control rules illustrating the recommended actions under various conditions to construct the adaptive fuzzy controller. The results show that the model-simulated values are in good agreement with the experimental data, with a deviation of −0.81 ± 15.02%, and that the controller has good tracking performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3afuzzy logic 3agravity 3anitric oxide 3aoxidation 3aprocess design 3atheoretical models 3auncertainty1 aSun, Yixuan1 aLiu, Shuo1 aQian, Zhi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5158-65371 aChen, Hongyu1 aWu, Shao1 aZheng, Jianzhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3415-84820 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2022 Feb. 24, v. 61, no. 9 p.3428-3438dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.1c048353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02812naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100007000143245012300213300001600336520138200352592002801734650001801762650001601780650001501796650001401811650002201825650001701847650001901864650002001883650001301903650002501916650003501941650001201976651001601988653001402004653001002018653000902028653001902037700002502056700002002081700001702101700002302118773011402141856007802255852000902333655001202342IND60792551020221120220148.0220907e20220704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079255102DNAL7 a10.1139/gen-2022-00212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Araujo Barbosa, Vanessa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8338-537710aAssessing population genetic structure of three New Zealand stream insects using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA markers  ap. 427-441.  aAssessing genetic differentiation among natural populations can aid understanding of dispersal patterns and connectivity among habitats. Several molecular markers have become increasingly popular in determining population genetic structure for this purpose. Here, we compared the resolution of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and nuclear single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers for detecting population structure among stream insects at small spatial scales. Individuals of three endemic taxa—Coloburiscus humeralis (Ephemeroptera), Zelandobius confusus (Plecoptera), and Hydropsyche fimbriata (Trichoptera)—were collected from forested streams that flow across open pasture in the North Island of New Zealand. Both COI and SNP data indicated limited population structure across the study area, and small differences observed among these species were likely related to their putative dispersal abilities. For example, fine-scale genetic differentiation between and among neighbouring stream populations for H. fimbriata suggests that gene flow, and hence dispersal, may be more limited for this species relative to the others. Based on the generally similar results provided by both types of markers, we suggest that either COI or SNP markers can provide suitable initial estimates of fine-scale population genetic differentiation in stream insects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEphemeroptera 3aHydropsyche 3aPlecoptera 3agene flow 3agenetic variation 3amitochondria 3anuclear genome 3aoxidoreductases 3apastures 3apopulation structure 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3astreams 3aNew Zealand 0adispersal 0amtDNA 0aSNPs 0astream insects1 aGraham, S.

While in humans, fertility restoration strategies from prepubertal testicular tissues are still under investigation and have not yet resulted in complete germ cell differentiation, in mice various studies have described production of sperm and offspring through testicular organ culture and transplantation of in vitro propagated SSCs. Organ culture has shown to be successful in generating mature spermatozoa when using testicular fragments from various mouse strains, including CD1 and C57BL/6 J. Conversely, in vitro proliferation of SSCs from C57BL/6 J mice is highly inefficient when compared to other strains such as DBA2 or hybrid mice of C57BL/6 J and DBA2 with 75% C57BL/6 J background (B6D2F2). In this study, we investigated in vitro spermatogenesis by organ culture using testicular tissue from C57BL/6 J and B6D2F2 mice. Whereas spermatogenesis was initiated and completed in C57BL/6 J fragments, it could not be effectively supported in B6D2F2 testicular tissue. While maturation of Sertoli cells and Leydig cells functionality appeared to be identical between the two strains, in B6D2F2 tissue spermatogenesis did not proceed past the spermatocyte step, followed by a rapid decline of the number of all germ cells in the fragments. This suggests that the spermatogenic potential in vitro is dependent on specialized sites in the genome and therefore the organ culture conditions suboptimal for some strains of mice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeydig cells 3aSertoli cells 3abiopsy 3acell differentiation 3acryopreservation 3agenetic background 3agenome 3ahybrids 3amale fertility 3amales 3amice 3aneoplasms 3aorgan culture 3apatients 3aprogeny 3apuberty 3aspermatogenesis 3aspermatozoa 3astem cells 3atissues 0aTesticular organ culture 0aMouse strain differences 0aGenetic background 0aC57BL/6J 0aB6D2F21 aMulder, Callista L.1 avan Daalen, Saskia K.M.1 ade Winter-Korver, Cindy M.1 aStukenborg, Jan-Bernd1 aRepping, Sjoerd1 avan Pelt, Ans M.M.0 tDevelopmental biology.g2019 Dec. 01, v. 456, no. 1 p.25-30dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12382x0012-16067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2019.08.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03007naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006700150245012900217300001600346520127900362592002801641650002001669650001001689650001301699650001401712650001801726650001601744650001101760650001701771650001901788650001801807650002201825650002601847650002001873650001301893650001301906650001901919651001801938651001201956653002201968653002001990653003902010653001902049653001602068653001802084700001802102700001602120700001502136700002102151700001802172700001802190700001802208773009702226856008502323852000902408655001202417IND60609785120221119101251.0200427e20181101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060978512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2018.07.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetersen, Karen Lykkebo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6517-413810aImpact of brine and antiscalants on reef-building corals in the Gulf of Aqaba – Potential effects from desalination plants  ap. 183-191.  aSeawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) is becoming an increasingly important source of potable water in arid and semi-arid regions worldwide. Discharge of brine-effluent from desalination facilities has been shown to significantly impact coastal marine ecosystems ranging from seagrass meadows to microbial communities. In this study, we examined the impacts of increased salinity (10% above ambient) and presence of antiscalants (0.2 mg L⁻¹, polyphosphonate-based) on three reef-building coral species; Stylophora pistillata, Acropora tenuis and Pocillopora verrucosa, from the Gulf of Aqaba (northern Red-Sea). Our results indicate that the corals, as well as associated bacteria and algae, were significantly impaired by the elevated salinity and antiscalants, leading to partial bleaching. Specifically, the abundance of bacteria and symbiotic algae as well as calcification rates were typically lower (20–85%, 50–90% and 40–50%, respectively) following incubations with both amendments. However, the impact of desalination brine was often species-specific. Thus, we propose that the ecotoxicological criteria used for hard corals should be determined based on the sensitivity of key species in the community dominating the area affected by desalination discharge.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcropora tenuis 3aalgae 3abacteria 3ableaching 3acalcification 3acoral reefs 3acorals 3adesalination 3adrinking water 3aecotoxicology 3amarine ecosystems 3amicrobial communities 3areverse osmosis 3asalinity 3aseawater 3asemiarid zones 3aGulf of Aqaba 3aRed Sea 0aSWRO desalination 0aBrine discharge 0aPolyphosphonate-based antiscalants 0aOsmotic stress 0aCoral reefs 0aGulf of Aqaba1 aPaytan, Adina1 aRahav, Eyal1 aLevy, Oren1 aSilverman, Jacob1 aBarzel, Oriya1 aPotts, Donald1 aBar-Zeev, Edo0 tWater research.g2018 Nov. 01, v. 144 p.183-191dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2018.07.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03185naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245015900172300001600331520153700347592002801884650002001912650001501932650002101947650001701968650001301985650001701998650002902015650002102044650002102065650002202086650002102108650001202129650001002141650001402151650001502165650002002180650001602200653001302216653002202229653001002251653002102261653002802282653002902310700005402339700001402393700002402407700002102431773009702452856008502549852000902634655001202643IND60614368620221119024717.0181127e20181201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061436862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2018.09.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoung, Tessora R.10aCharacterization of disinfection byproduct formation and associated changes to dissolved organic matter during solar photolysis of free available chlorine  ap. 318-327.  aSolar irradiation of chlorine-containing waters enhances inactivation of chlorine-resistant pathogens (e.g., Cryptosporidium oocysts), through in situ formation of ozone, hydroxyl radical, and other reactive species during photolysis of free available chlorine (FAC) at UVB-UVA wavelengths of solar light (290–400 nm). However, corresponding effects on regulated disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation and associated dissolved organic matter (DOM) properties remain unclear. In this work, when compared to dark chlorination, sunlight-driven FAC photolysis over a range of conditions was found to yield higher DBP levels, depletion of DOM chromophores and fluorophores, preferential removal of phenolic groups versus carboxylic acid groups, and degradation of larger humic substances to smaller molecular weight compounds. Control experiments showed that increased DBP levels were not due to direct DOM photolysis and subsequent dark reactions with FAC, but to co-exposure of DOM to FAC and reactive species (e.g., O3, HO•, Cl•, Cl2•-, ClO•) generated by FAC photolysis. Because solar chlorine photolysis can enable inactivation of chlorine-resistant pathogens at far lower CTFAC values than chlorination alone, the increases in DBP formation inherent to this approach can likely be offset to some extent by the ability to operate at significantly decreased CTFAC.

In order to reduce costs, a number of farms prefer to perform their eradication process with continuous production using modified live vaccine (MLV) immunisation. However, the commercial PRRSV RT-PCR kits do not have the capacity to discriminate infected from vaccinated animals. In this paper, we describe a simple discriminatory duplex TaqMan RT-PCR assay based on common forward and reverse primers, as well as two differently labelled MLV- and wild-type PRRSV-specific probes. The discriminatory PCR test we designed is a fast and efficacious method for processing large quantities of samples. The assay is cheap, flexible, easy to apply in different herds using different MLVs, but should be checked, and can be modified based on the sequence data obtained during the permanent monitoring examinations. Owing to its simplicity the test can serve as a significant complementary assay for PRRS control and elimination/eradication.  aPublisher supplied data  aKFI-2018-00169cNational Research, Development, and Innovation Office 3aBetaarterivirus suid 1 3afarms 3aimmunization 3alive vaccines 3aporcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome 3aswine 3aviruses 0aPRRS 0aeradication 0adiscriminatory 0aPCR1 aSzabó, István,1 aLebhardt, Károly1 aBálint, Ádám,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2494-10970 tActa veterinaria Hungarica.g2022 Sept. 01, dAkadémiai KiadówJournal:jnl35480x1588-27057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1556/004.2022.000203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03335naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245012100171300001800292520173600310592002802046650001802074650002302092650001302115650002902128650001602157650002202173650001302195650003302208650001102241650001902252650000702271650001502278650001602293650001102309650001902320650002502339650002502364650000902389650001602398653003002414653002202444653002702466653002102493653001802514700001902532700002002551700002302571773010502594856008502699852000902784655001202793IND60568244820221120111545.0170502e20170603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056824482DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2016.12306532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuilayn, Felipe10aSequencing biological acidification of waste-activated sludge aiming to optimize phosphorus dissolution and recovery  ap. 1399-1407.  aPhosphorus (P) recovery in wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) as pure crystals such as struvite (MgNH ₄PO ₄.6H ₂O), potassium struvite (KMgPO ₄.6H ₂O) and calcium phosphates (e.g. Ca ₃(PO ₄) ₂) is an already feasible technique that permits the production of green and marketable fertilizers and the reduction of operational costs. Commercial crystallizers can recovery more than 90% of soluble P. However, most of the P in WWTP sludge is unavailable for the processes (not dissolved). P solubilization and separation are thus the limiting steps in P-crystallization. With an innovative two-step sequencing acidification strategy, the current study has aimed to improve biological P solubilization on waste-activated sludge (WAS) from a full-scale plant. In the first step (P-release), low charges of organic waste were used as co-substrates of WAS pre-fermentation, seeking to produce volatile fatty acids to feed the P-release by Polyphosphate-accumulating organisms, while keeping its optimal metabolic pH (6–7). In this phase, milk serum, WWTP grease, urban organic waste and collective restaurant waste were individually applied as co-substrates. In the second step (P-dissolution), pH 4 was aimed at as it allows the dissolution of the most common precipitated species of P. Biological acidification was performed by white sugar addition, as a carbohydrate-rich organic waste model, which was compared to chemical acidification by HCl (12M) addition. With short retention times (48–96 h) and without inoculum application, all experiences succeeded on P solubilization (37–55% of soluble P), principally when carbohydrate-rich co-substrates were applied. Concentrations from 270 to 450 mg were achieved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3acalcium phosphates 3acrystals 3aenvironmental technology 3afertilizers 3ahydrochloric acid 3ainoculum 3amagnesium ammonium phosphate 3amodels 3aorganic wastes 3apH 3aphosphorus 3arestaurants 3asludge 3asolubilization 3avolatile fatty acids 3awastewater treatment 3awhey 3awhite sugar 0aPhosphorus solubilization 0anutrient recovery 0awaste-activated sludge 0aWAS fermentation 0aorganic waste1 aBraak, Etienne1 aPiveteau, Simon1 aDaumer, Marie-Line0 tEnvironmental technology.g2017 June 3, v. 38, no. 11 p.1399-1407dTaylor & Francisx1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2016.12306533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03911naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245013100172300001400303520227300317592002802590650002002618650001102638650001102649650001502660650002302675650001202698650001502710650002602725650001502751650001002766650001102776650001902787650001102806650002502817650001102842650001302853650001202866650001302878650001102891650001602902651001102918653000802929653001202937653002402949653001902973653003302992700002103025700002103046700002003067700001703087700002003104773010103124856008703225852000903312655001203321IND60656920620221119144654.0190815e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065692062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.earscirev.2018.08.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStebbins, Alan10aSulfur-isotope evidence for recovery of seawater sulfate concentrations from a PTB minimum by the Smithian-Spathian transition  ap. 83-95.  aThe Smithian-Spathian substage boundary (SSB) in the Early Triassic was an important time interval during the protracted recovery of marine faunas and ecosystems following the end-Permian mass extinction event. Although some Tethyan SSB sections have been studied, little information is available regarding environmental conditions in the Panthalassic Ocean, which comprised ~85% of the Early Triassic global ocean, during the Smithian-Spathian transition. Understanding changes in the carbon and sulfur cycles during the Early Triassic is important for deciphering the pattern and controls on the marine recovery. Our understanding of the Early Triassic sulfur cycle, in particular, is incomplete. In this study, we report carbonate carbon and oxygen, carbonate-associated sulfate (CAS) sulfur and oxygen, and pyritic sulfur isotopic ratios from the Jesmond section, Cache Creek Terrane, western Canada. This section, which formed as a tropical carbonate atoll in the middle of the Panthalassic Ocean, spans the latest Smithian to middle Spathian. Both δ34SCAS and δ18OCAS increased through the SSB transition before decreasing in the early Spathian, matching variation in the δ13Ccarb profile. We hypothesize that the sharp increase in δ34SCAS and δ18OCAS at the SSB reflects a global increase in the amount of microbial sulfate reduction (MSR) and pyrite burial. Driving this increase in MSR and pyrite burial were cooling temperatures, increasing primary productivity, and increasing organic matter availability. The decreasing trend immediately following the SSB indicates that these environmental changes reached maxima and began to diminish or reverse in the early Spathian. The difference between δ34SCAS and δ34Spyr values (Δ34SCAS-pyr) remained relatively stable from the latest Smithian through the middle Spathian. This stability provides an estimate of MSR sulfur-isotope depletion allowing us to estimate paleo-seawater sulfate concentrations. Using the “MSR-trend” method, we estimate that Early Triassic seawater sulfate concentrations were between 2.5 and 9.1 mM. These estimates are higher than previously published values for the Permian-Triassic boundary, suggesting an overall increase in seawater sulfate by the late Early Triassic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriassic period 3aatolls 3acarbon 3acarbonates 3achemical reduction 3acooling 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3aextinction 3afauna 3aoceans 3aorganic matter 3aoxygen 3aprimary productivity 3apyrite 3aseawater 3astreams 3asulfates 3asulfur 3atemperature 3aCanada 0aSSB 0aJesmond 0aCache Creek Terrane 0aWestern Canada 0aCarbonate-associated sulfate1 aAlgeo, Thomas J.1 aOlsen, Christian1 aSano, Hiroyoshi1 aRowe, Harold1 aHannigan, Robyn0 tEarth-science reviews.g2019 Aug., v. 195 p.83-95dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11685x0012-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2018.08.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03734naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245012700162300001600289520210400305592002802409650001802437650001302455650002102468650001702489650002202506650001402528650002102542650001002563650001002573650001002583650002002593650002602613650001202639650002402651650002202675650004102697650002402738650002202762650004302784650002302827650002902850650001602879700001302895700001502908700001702923700001402940700001302954700001602967773010702983856008103090852000903171655001203180IND60123804620221122060104.0150404e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012380462DNAL7 a10.1007/s00427-015-0492-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Chang10aMolecular cloning, expression pattern, and molecular evolution of the spleen tyrosine kinase in lamprey, Lampetra japonica  ap. 113-120.  aSpleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), a member of Syk family of cytoplasmic non-receptor tyrosine kinases, is a key component of B cell receptor signaling and regulates multiple physiological functions of B lymphocytes in vertebrates. In the current study, a Syk homologue was identified in the lamprey Lampetra japonica (Lj-Syk). The cDNA fragment of Lj-Syk contains a 1953-bp open reading frame which encodes 651 amino acids, a 12-bp fragment of 5′-untranslated region, and a 1029-bp 3′-untranslated region. The same as vertebrate's Syks, Lj-Syk protein also contains a tyrosine kinase catalytic domain which functions as its kinase activity center and two Src homology 2 (SH2) domains which are the targets when Syk is recruited by phosphorylated immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif. It is revealed by multiple sequence alignment that the tyrosine kinase catalytic domain and two SH2 domains are conserved throughout the Syk gene family in vertebrates. The evolutionary dynamics of Syks were analyzed by MEME software using conserved motifs as markers. Among 19 conserved motifs elicited from 22 Syks or Syk-like proteins, 12 motifs that locate at N-terminal, two tandem SH2, Inter SH2, and Tyrkc domains are conserved in Syks from jawless to jawed vertebrates. From the absence and existence of the other seven motifs, it can be concluded that the primary Syk gene evolved to modern functional gene through short insertion and deletion strategy in their gene sequence rather than gene duplication. The expression of lamprey Syk was examined by real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot methods in leukocyte cells, gills, supraneural myeloid bodies, kidneys, and hearts of lampreys before and after the animals were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The transcriptional level of lamprey Syk was upregulated in gill, kidney, heart, and leukocyte cells, and the protein expression level is upregulated in leukocyte cells and supraneural myeloid bodies after stimulated with LPS. It could be deduced that Lj-Syk may play a crucial role in immune response of the jawless vertebrates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-lymphocytes 3aLampetra 3aWestern blotting 3aactive sites 3acomplementary DNA 3aevolution 3agene duplication 3agenes 3agills 3aheart 3aimmune response 3aimmunologic receptors 3akidneys 3alipopolysaccharides 3amolecular cloning 3anon-specific protein-tyrosine kinase 3aopen reading frames 3aprotein synthesis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asequence alignment 3atranscription (genetics) 3avertebrates1 aSu, Peng1 aLi, Ranran1 aZhang, Qiong1 aZhu, Ting1 aLiu, Xin1 aLi, Qingwei0 tDevelopment genes and evolution.g2015 Apr., v. 225, no. 2 p.113-120dSpringer-Verlagx0949-944X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00427-015-0492-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03067naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002400137245008900161300001600250520203400266592002802300650001002328650001302338650000902351650001202360650001002372650001602382650001602398650001102414650000902425650001602434651002002450651002002470700002202490773010102512856007102613852000902684655001202693IND60693940420221122104856.0200509e19981201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069394042DNAL7 a10.1071/MU980402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeathers, Wesley W.10aBehaviour and Time-Activity Budgets of Malleefowl Leipoa ocellata in South Australia  ap. 288-296.  aWe used time-lapse photography to record the temporal pattern of mound-tending behaviour by Malleefowl breeding in lower Murray River mallee during January and March. We also derived time budgets based on 149 h of behavioural observations of two focal individuals. We found striking behavioural differences between these Malleefowl and those studied by Frith (1959, 1962a) near Griffith, New South Wales. In contrast to Frith's birds, Murray River Malleefowl: (i) did not differ in the proportion of days that mounds were tended in January and March; (ii) were highly social not solitary; and (iii) shared mound-tending duties between males and females. On days when eggs were laid in January, both members of four pairs worked their mounds simultaneously 55 ± 26 (s.d.) % of the time. In March after egg laying had ceased, both members of two observed pairs worked simultaneously 68 ± 30% and 86 ± 9% of the time. In contrast, Frith (1962a) seldom observed females participating in mound work. The four pairs that we filmed during January spent an average of 6.8 ± 2.5 h opening and closing mounds on days that mounds were tended. This is equivalent to 46% of a single bird's active day. During March the two pairs that we filmed spent an average of 7.2 ± 0.6 h opening and closing mounds on days when mounds were tended, equivalent to 55% of a single bird's active day. Male and female Malleefowl moved similar amounts of sand per scratch when tending their mounds (mean 78 ± 13 g/scratch). We estimate that Malleefowl move a total of about 3.3 tonnes of sand to open and close the mound for egg laying or to check its temperature. We use our time-budget data and literature energetics values to evaluate Frith's (1959) postulation that female Malleefowl are prevented from participating in mound work by the high cost of egg synthesis. Our calculations suggest that it makes relatively little energetic difference to females whether or not they tend mounds, which may explain why females tended mounds at our study site.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirds 3abreeding 3aeggs 3afemales 3amales 3aoviposition 3aphotography 3arivers 3asand 3atemperature 3aNew South Wales 3aSouth Australia1 aSeymour, Roger S.0 tEmu.g1998 Dec. 1, v. 98, no. 4 p.288-296dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl3957316x1448-55407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MU980403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05143naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002400153245007900177520308600256592002803342650001603370650001703386650001503403650001203418650001303430650000903443650002403452650001203476650001103488650001503499650001403514650001603528650002203544651001203566651001703578653001303595653001203608653002403620653001403644653002503658653000903683653001703692653001503709700003203724700002203756700001903778700002203797700002203819700001703841700003603858700005703894700002503951700001803976700001803994700006404012700002404076700002204100700002404122700002004146700002404166700002404190700001904214773010304233856008804336852000904424655001204433IND60656920720221119144646.0200819e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065692072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.earscirev.2019.1029262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFoulger, Gillian R.14aThe Iceland Microcontinent and a continental Greenland-Iceland-Faroe Ridge  aThe breakup of Laurasia to form the Northeast Atlantic Realm disintegrated an inhomogeneous collage of cratons sutured by cross-cutting orogens.

North of the Greenland-Iceland-Faroe Ridge a new rift–the Aegir Ridge–propagated south along the Caledonian suture. South of the Greenland-Iceland-Faroe Ridge the proto-Reykjanes Ridge propagated north through the North Atlantic Craton along an axis displaced ~150 km to the west of the rift to the north. Both propagators stalled where the confluence of the Nagssugtoqidian and Caledonian orogens formed an ~300-km-wide transverse barrier. Thereafter, the ~150 × 300-km block of continental crust between the rift tips–the Iceland Microcontinent–extended in a distributed, unstable manner along multiple axes of extension. These axes repeatedly migrated or jumped laterally with shearing occurring between them in diffuse transfer zones. This style of deformation continues to the present day in Iceland. It is the surface expression of underlying magma-assisted stretching of ductile continental crust that has flowed from the Iceland Microplate and flanking continental areas to form the lower crust of the Greenland-Iceland-Faroe Ridge. Icelandic-type crust which underlies the Greenland-Iceland-Faroe Ridge is thus not anomalously thick oceanic crust as is often assumed. Upper Icelandic-type crust comprises magma flows and dykes. Lower Icelandic-type crust comprises magma-inflated continental mid- and lower crust. Contemporary magma production in Iceland, equivalent to oceanic layers 2–3, corresponds to Icelandic-type upper crust plus intrusions in the lower crust, and has a total thickness of only 10–15 km. This is much less than the total maximum thickness of 42 km for Icelandic-type crust measured seismically in Iceland. The feasibility of the structure we propose is confirmed by numerical modeling that shows extension of the continental crust can continue for many tens of millions of years by lower-crustal ductile flow. A composition of Icelandic-type lower crust that is largely continental can account for multiple seismic observations along with gravity, bathymetric, topographic, petrological and geochemical data that are inconsistent with a gabbroic composition for Icelandic-type lower crust. It also offers a solution to difficulties in numerical models for melt-production by downward-revising the amount of melt needed. Unstable tectonics on the Greenland-Iceland-Faroe Ridge can account for long-term tectonic disequilibrium on the adjacent rifted margins, the southerly migrating rift propagators that build diachronous chevron ridges of thick crust about the Reykjanes Ridge, and the tectonic decoupling of the oceans to the north and south. A model of complex, discontinuous continental breakup influenced by crustal inhomogeneity that distributes continental material in growing oceans fits other regions including the Davis Strait, the South Atlantic and the West Indian Ocean.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeformation 3ageochemistry 3ageophysics 3agravity 3alatitude 3alava 3amathematical models 3amelting 3aoceans 3aprovenance 3atectonics 3atemperature 3avolcanic activity 3aIceland 3aIndian Ocean 0aAtlantic 0aIceland 0aContinental breakup 0aTectonics 0aIcelandic-type crust 0aSDRs 0aGeochemistry 0aGeophysics1 aDoré, A.

K.10aLocal Control of cis-Peptidyl–Prolyl Bonds Mediated by CH···π Interactions: The Xaa-Pro-Tyr Motif  ap. 6348-6357.  aCompared to generic peptide bonds, the peptidyl–prolyl bond shows a strong propensity for the cis conformer. The presence of a sequence-contiguous aromatic (Aro) residue can further stabilize the cis conformer, as observed for the Aro-Pro motif. The cis propensity of the reverse sequence motif, Pro-Aro, is not so well understood, especially the effect of N-capping the Pro-Aro motif with different amino acid residues. From a comparative nuclear magnetic resonance study of two peptide series with the general sequences Ac-Xaa-Pro-Tyr-NH₂ and Ac-Xaa-Pro-Ala-NH₂, we present a relative thermodynamic scale that reflects how the nature of the Xaa side chain influences the cis propensity of the Xaa-Pro-Tyr motif, with Gly, Pro, and Ala at position Xaa giving the greatest enhancement of the cis-peptidyl–prolyl population. We also show that CH···π interaction between Xaa and Tyr is responsible for the enhanced cis population. However, the mere presence of the CH···π interaction does not guarantee that the peptidyl–prolyl bond will have a higher cis content in Xaa-Pro-Tyr than in Xaa-Pro-Ala. Xaa-dependent intramolecular interactions present in Xaa-trans-Pro-Tyr can nullify favorable CH···π interactions in Xaa-cis-Pro-Tyr. The relative cis-peptidyl–prolyl stabilizing propensities of Xaa (Xaa-Pro-Tyr) in proteins and in our peptide series show strong linear correlation except when Xaa is aromatic. We also explore the Xaa-Pro-Gly-Tyr sequence motif and show that mediated by a Pro-Tyr CH···π interaction, the cis-peptidyl–prolyl bond in the motif is stabilized when Xaa is Pro.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aproteins 3athermodynamics1 aKaur, Hundeep1 aBasu, Gautam0 tBiochemistry.g2013 Sept. 17, v. 52, no. 37 p.6348-6357dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbi40079183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02261naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245013100158520115500289592002801444650002501472650001201497650002201509650002001531650001101551650001101562651001101573651001201584651001001596651001601606651001001622700003001632700002901662773012601691856007301817852000901890655001201899IND60652003620221119175151.0190712e20170702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065200362DNAL7 a10.3390/su90711552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPreiss, Potira10aFostering Sustainable Urban-Rural Linkages through Local Food Supply: A Transnational Analysis of Collaborative Food Alliances  aThe mainstream system of food supply has been heavily criticized in the last years due to its social and environmental impacts. Direct food purchasing schemes have emerged in recent decades as a form of supply that may be more ecologically sound and socially just, while allowing for a closer relationship between producers and consumers. The aim of this article is to show how a specific kind of direct supply, Collaborative Food Alliances, may help to foster sustainable urban–rural linkages. This paper presents, compares and discusses seven different cases, located in five different countries: Movimento de Integração Campo-Cidade (MICC) (Brazil), Canasta Comunitaria Utopía (Ecuador), GAS Testaccio Meticcio and Gasper (Italy), Grupo de Consumo Vera and Grupo de Consumo de Russafa (Spain), and De Groene Schuur at Zeist (The Netherlands). Analysis of the seven cases reveals that, through alliances between consumers and producers, solidarity and sustainable food supply are built. City dwellers benefit from such alliances by receiving organic products on a stable basis and at a fair price, while providing farmers with a stable income.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental impact 3afarmers 3afood availability 3afood purchasing 3aincome 3aprices 3aBrazil 3aEcuador 3aItaly 3aNetherlands 3aSpain1 aMarques, Flávia Charão,1 aWiskerke, Johannes S.

Mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) can potentially alleviate this issue via diffusion-based separations within rigid framework materials. Previous work from our lab and others has shown that organic solvent reverse osmosis membranes have different responses to transmembrane pressure depending on whether the material is a rigid structure (e.g., a carbon, zeolite, or metal-organic framework) or a swollen polymer. This work combines two Maxwell–Stefan transport models, representing the flexible polymer phase and a rigid microporous filler, with the Maxwell model to predict mixed matrix membrane solvent separation performance as a function of pressure and membrane material properties. The model demonstrates that for every filler perm-selectivity, there is a filler permeability that provides the largest separation factor in the final MMM. This optimum permeability increases with the filler’s perm-selectivity. Dual-layer UiO-66/Matrimid hollow fiber MMMs were created to evaluate the model’s prediction on the influence of transmembrane pressure on the separation of toluene and mesitylene as a test case. The UiO-66/Matrimid membrane demonstrated a predicted decline in permeance as pressure was increased. The separation factors increased as higher pressures increased the driving force for separation, consistent with the model. UiO-66 was shown to have superior selectivity to Matrimid in toluene/mesitylene; however, we conclude that ultraselective materials are ultimately needed to enable the mixed matrix membrane concept for the most challenging solvent–solvent separations, and open questions remain about polymer–filler pairings for organic solvent reverse osmosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acoordination polymers 3adecline 3aliquids 3amodels 3apermeability 3aporous media 3aprediction 3aprocess design 3areverse osmosis 3asolvents 3atoluene 3azeolites1 aWeber, Dylan J.1 aJang, Hye Youn1 aLively, Ryan P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8039-40080 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2022 Feb. 22, v. 61, no. 9 p.3395-3411dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.1c049223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03432naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001800180245015000198300001800348506007600366520191500442592002802357506003702385650002202422650002202444650002202466650001202488650001102500650002702511650004402538650001502582650002402597700002102621700001902642700001302661700001902674700002402693700001202717700002402729700002102753773010402774856007502878852000902953655001202962IND60531284920221207142038.0160723e20130917xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053128492DNAL7 a10.1021/bi400795e2doi7 aPMC42548542pmcid7 a239524792pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiks, Dimitri10aAllostery and Substrate Channeling in the Tryptophan Synthase Bienzyme Complex: Evidence for Two Subunit Conformations and Four Quaternary States  ap. 6396-6411.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe allosteric regulation of substrate channeling in tryptophan synthase involves ligand-mediated allosteric signaling that switches the α- and β-subunits between open (low activity) and closed (high activity) conformations. This switching prevents the escape of the common intermediate, indole, and synchronizes the α- and β-catalytic cycles. ¹⁹F NMR studies of bound α-site substrate analogues, N-(4′-trifluoromethoxybenzoyl)-2-aminoethyl phosphate (F6) and N-(4′-trifluoromethoxybenzenesulfonyl)-2-aminoethyl phosphate (F9), were found to be sensitive NMR probes of β-subunit conformation. Both the internal and external aldimine F6 complexes gave a single bound peak at the same chemical shift, while α-aminoacrylate and quinonoid F6 complexes all gave a different bound peak shifted by +1.07 ppm. The F9 complexes exhibited similar behavior, but with a corresponding shift of −0.12 ppm. X-ray crystal structures show the F6 and F9 CF₃ groups located at the α–β subunit interface and report changes in both the ligand conformation and the surrounding protein microenvironment. Ab initio computational modeling suggests that the change in ¹⁹F chemical shift results primarily from changes in the α-site ligand conformation. Structures of α-aminoacrylate F6 and F9 complexes and quinonoid F6 and F9 complexes show the α- and β-subunits have closed conformations wherein access of ligands into the α- and β-sites from solution is blocked. Internal and external aldimine structures show the α- and β-subunits with closed and open global conformations, respectively. These results establish that β-subunits exist in two global conformational states, designated open, where the β-sites are freely accessible to substrates, and closed, where the β-site portal into solution is blocked. Switching between these conformations is critically important for the αβ-catalytic cycle.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aX-ray diffraction 3acrystal structure 3aenzyme substrates 3aligands 3amodels 3amolecular conformation 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphosphates 3atryptophan synthase1 aHilario, Eduardo1 aDierkers, Adam1 aNgo, Huu1 aBorchardt, Dan1 aNeubauer, Thomas

F.10aThermoregulatory Responses of Heat Acclimatized Buffaloes to Simulated Heat Waves  aNAL-light  aClimate change is seen as a significant threat to the sustainability of livestock production systems in many parts of the world, particularly in tropical regions. Extreme meteorological events can result in catastrophic production and death of livestock. Heat waves in particular can push vulnerable animals beyond their survival threshold limits. However, there is little information about buffalo responses to sudden changes in the thermal environment, specifically the heat waves. This study aimed to quantify the thermoregulatory and blood biochemical responses of heat-acclimatized buffaloes to a simulated heat wave. The experiment was designed in a climatic chamber with two periods of 4 days each. Twelve heat acclimated buffalo heifers aged 18 months were used. The climatic chamber environment was set as follows: 4-day period (P1) simulating the same weather conditions of a summer in humid tropical climate used as a baseline, with daily cycle with Ta and RH at 27 ± 1 °C and 76% from 0600 h to 1900 h and 24 ± 1 °C and 80% from 1900 h to 0600 h, and 4-day period (P2), simulating a daily heat wave cycle, from 0600 h to 1900 h with Ta and RH kept at 36 °C and 78% and from 1900 h to 0600 h, 27 °C and 74%. All animals were subject to both treatments and data were analyzed by a repeated measure analysis of variance, with post-hoc pooling comparison performed by Tukey’s test. In P2, there was observed a significant increase in respiratory frequency (p < 0.01), found four times in P1. The sweating rates were quite high in both periods; still, there were significant increases in P2 compared to P1 (p < 0.01) (4931 and 3201 g/m²/h, respectively). A slight but significant increase in rectal temperature was observed during the day (p < 0.01), with a rising until 1900 h. The simulated heat wave in P2 did not affect the values of the erythrogram or leukogram, excluding the significant reduction in K⁺ (p < 0.05). The low heat storage and the subsequent fast and full recovery of the thermal balance late afternoon appear to be related to the high sweating rate values.

The results showed that after KAM pretreatment, both the numbers of down- and up-regulated differentially expressed proteins were significantly lower than those in the DON group. Gene ontology analysis revealed that differentially expressed proteins were enriched in cell adhesion molecule binding, cell junction, and cell junction assembly. Further study demonstrated that KAM pretreatment affected the expression and assembly of tight junction and adherens junction proteins through the PKA pathway and MAPK/ERK pathway to improve the barrier integrity of the Caco-2 cell monolayer, and nutraceutical approach based on bioactive phytochemicals to improve the body's immunity might be an effective strategy to combat the adverse effects of mycotoxins on intestinal barrier function.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3acell adhesion molecules 3adeoxynivalenol 3adietary supplements 3afood chain 3agene ontology 3ahuman cell lines 3aimmunity 3aintestines 3akaempferol 3amodels 3apretreatment 3aprotective effect 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteomics 3atight junctions1 aLi, Li1 aZhang, Genyi0 tFood & function.g2020 Aug. 19, v. 11, no. 8 p.7266-7279dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0fo01579b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01827naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245006900168300001600237520060700253592002800860650001300888650001400901650002300915650001200938650001800950650004400968650001901012650001101031650001801042653001801060653001901078653001701097653001201114653001201126653001601138700002101154700002301175773011201198856008601310852000901396655001201405IND50059298020221118020335.0190408e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005929802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2012.07.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRíos, Luis,10aHydroxylation of vegetable oils using acidic resins as catalysts  ap. 183-187.  aA new modification of the Prileschajew method to produce hydroxylated vegetable oils using in situ generated peracetic acid and acidic resins, of the sulfonated polystyrene type, as heterogeneous catalysts is reported.

Recent findings reveal an important role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the development of DPN and identify a potential new therapeutic target. Schwann cells (SC), the myelinating cells in peripheral nervous system, are highly susceptible to ER homeostasis. Grape seed proanthocyanidins (GSPs) have been reported to improve DPN of type 1 diabetic rats and relieve ER stress in skeletal muscles and pancreas of T2DM. We investigated the potential role of ER stress in SC in regulating DPN of T2DM and assessed whether early intervention of GSPs would prevent DPN by modulating ER stress. The present study was performed in Sprague–Dawley rats made T2DM with low-dose streptozotocin and a high-carbohydrate/high-fat diet and in rat SC cultured in serum from type 2 diabetic rats. Diabetic rats showed a typical characteristic of T2DM and slowing of nerve conduction velocity (NCV) in sciatic/tibial nerves. The lesions of SC, Ca2+ overload and ER stress were present in sciatic nerves of diabetic rats, as well as in cell culture models. GSPs administration significantly decreased the low-density lipoprotein level and increased NCV in diabetic rats. GSPs or their metabolites also partially prevented cell injury, Ca2+ overload and ER stress in animal and cell culture models. Therefore, ER stress is implicated in peripheral neuropathy in animal and cell culture models of T2DM. Prophylactic GSPs treatment might have auxiliary preventive potential for DPN partially by alleviating ER stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSchwann cells 3aanimal disease models 3aanimal stress 3ablood serum 3acalcium 3acell culture 3adiet 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3agrape seeds 3ahomeostasis 3alow density lipoprotein 3ametabolites 3anerve tissue 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apancreas 3aperipheral nervous system 3aperipheral nervous system diseases 3aproanthocyanidins 3arats 3askeletal muscle 3astreptozotocin 3atibia 0aCalcium 0aDiabetes 0aEndoplasmic reticulum stress 0aNeuroprotection 0aProanthocyanidins 0aSchwann cells1 aDai, Xiaoqian1 aZhang, Zhaofeng1 aJiang, Yanfei1 aMa, Xiaotao1 aCai, Xiaxia1 aLi, Yong0 tJournal of nutritional biochemistry.g2014 July, v. 25 p.765-772dElsevier Inc.x0955-28637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnutbio.2014.03.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03268naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001700166245018800183300001500371520145700386592002801843650002001871650001901891650001201910650001501922650001101937650002301948650001301971650001501984650001901999650001702018650002702035650001702062650001502079650001202094650004302106650004502149650002202194650003502216653002002251653003002271653001602301653001702317653000902334653000802343653001002351653001202361653001002373653000902383700001502392700001502407700001602422773013802438856008102576852000902657655001202666IND60650458420221122172022.0190710e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065045842DNAL7 a274443592pmid7 a10.1017/S00074853160006752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPuggioni, V.10aQualitative Sybr Green real-time detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms responsible for target-site resistance in insect pests: the example of Myzus persicae and Musca domestica  ap. 96-105.  aChemical insecticides have been widely used to control insect pests, leading to the selection of resistant populations. To date, several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have already been associated with insecticide resistance, causing reduced sensitivity to many classes of products. Monitoring and detection of target-site resistance is currently one of the most important factors for insect pest management strategies. Several methods are available for this purpose: automated and high-throughput techniques (i.e. TaqMan or pyrosequencing) are very costly; cheaper alternatives (i.e. RFLP or PASA–PCRs) are time-consuming and limited by the necessity of a final visualization step. This work presents a new approach (QSGG, Qualitative Sybr Green Genotyping) which combines the specificity of PASA–PCR with the rapidity of real-time PCR analysis. The specific real-time detection of Cq values of wild-type or mutant alleles (amplified used allele-specific primers) allows the calculation of ΔCqW–M values and the consequent identification of the genotypes of unknown samples, on the basis of ranges previously defined with reference clones. The methodology is applied here to characterize mutations described in Myzus persicae and Musca domestica and we demonstrate it represents a valid, rapid and cost-effective technique that can be adopted for monitoring target-site resistance in field populations of these and other insect species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMusca domestica 3aMyzus persicae 3aalleles 3aautomation 3aclones 3acost effectiveness 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3ainsect control 3ainsect pests 3ainsecticide resistance 3ainsecticides 3amonitoring 3amutants 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3asequence analysis 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 0aSNPs genotyping 0aqualitative real-time PCR 0aM. persicae 0aM. domestica 0aR81T 0akdr 0as-kdr 0akdr-his 0aM918L 0aMACE1 aChiesa, O.1 aPanini, M.1 aMazzoni, E.0 tBulletin of entomological research.g2017 Feb., v. 107, no. 1 p.96-105dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl46143x1475-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00074853160006753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03110naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002800152245010000180300001600280500001900296520160400315592002801919650001501947650000901962650001501971650003601986650002102022650001502043650001702058650001902075650000702094650001602101650001102117650001902128650002002147650001602167650002102183650001202204653002302216653001602239700002202255700002402277700002302301700002802324700002102352773013502373856008702508852000902595655001202604IND60730686820221116144358.0210513e20210601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073068682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.03.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNajar, Muzaffar Hussain10aStructural changes in trypsin induced by the bile salts: An effect of amphiphile hydrophobicity  ap. 121-128.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe present study reports the multi-technique results of the interaction of a series of bile salts, sodium cholate (NaC), sodium taurocholate (NaTC), sodium deoxycholate (NaDC), and sodium taurodeoxycholate (NaTDC) with trypsin under the experimental conditions of 25 °C and pH 7.0. The interactions between trypsin and the bile salts were characterized by the surface tension measurements and various spectroscopic techniques like UV–Visible absorption, steady-state fluorescence, and circular dichroism. The results of surface tension measurements reveal a strong interaction of trypsin (50 μM) with the increasing concentration of bile salts, being higher with the bile salt of greater hydrophobicity. The critical aggregation concentration of bile salts in the presence of trypsin (C₁) showed that the bile salts interact strongly with the trypsin in the order of NaTDC > NaDC > NaTC > NaC. UV–visible, steady-state fluorescence, and circular dichroism spectroscopic results confirmed significant unfolding of trypsin due to its interaction with the bile salts, the extent of which followed the same sequence as observed in the surface tension results. It could be concluded that the hydrophobic bile salts that show lower C₁ values and have less delocalized charge, are more effective in unfolding the trypsin. The study would help understand the hydrophobicity-driven unfolding of proteins aided by biological surfactants like bile salts and help devise efficient proteolytic enzyme-based detergent formulations and understand the role of such amphiphiles as antimicrobial agents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abile 3abile salts 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3adeoxycholic acid 3adetergents 3afluorescence 3ahydrophobicity 3apH 3aproteolysis 3asodium 3asodium cholate 3asurface tension 3asurfactants 3ataurocholic acid 3atrypsin 0aCircular dichroism 0aTensiometry1 aChat, Oyais Ahmad1 aBhat, Parvaiz Ahmad1 aMir, Mohammad Amin1 aRather, Ghulam Mohamamd1 aDar, Aijaz Ahmad0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2021 June 01, v. 180 p.121-128dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.03.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02925naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245014900184300001300333520144800346592002801794650002201822650002301844650001601867650000901883650002501892650002201917650001501939650002701954650002401981651000902005651002002014653001102034653001702045653001902062653002402081653001602105653002202121700001702143700001602160700001902176700002202195773013602217856008102353852000902434655001202443IND60650458520221122172031.0190710e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065045852DNAL7 a278067332pmid7 a10.1017/S00074853160006872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorrêa, A.S.10aAncient origin and recent range expansion of the maize weevil Sitophilus zeamais, and its genealogical relationship to the rice weevil S. oryzae  ap. 9-20.  aArcheological records attest the early association of Sitophilus with stored cereals from the beginning of agriculture on Asia. The maize weevil (Sitophilus zeamais) became particularly damaging to maize, a cereal crop domesticated on Mesoamerica. We investigated the late evolutionary history of the maize weevil to gain insights on its origin, timing of association with maize, and genealogical relationship to the almost morphologically indistinguishable rice weevil (Sitophilus oryzae). Two mitochondrial genes (cytochrome oxidase subunit I and cytochrome oxidase subunit II) and the nuclear ribosomal gene region were partially sequenced. Analyses showed that the maize weevil shared no haplotypes with the rice weevil; instead, each species exhibited distinct mitogroups and ribogroups. The two weevil species likely split about 8.7 million years ago (95% highest posterior density: 4.0–15.0). Microsatellite data analyses sorted the 309 specimens from 15 populations of the maize weevil into three genotypic groups, which displayed low genetic differentiation and widespread occurrence worldwide. The maize weevil and the rice weevil are each a distinct species; both of which emerged prior to the onset of agriculture. The maize–maize weevil association took place after maize became widespread as a global crop. The maize weevil populations lack spatial genetic structure at the regional, continental, and intercontinental scales.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSitophilus oryzae 3aSitophilus zeamais 3aarchaeology 3acorn 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amitochondrial genes 3aAsia 3aCentral America 0acereal 0amaize weevil 0aphylogeography 0apopulation genetics 0aSSR markers 0astored grain pest1 aVinson, C.C.1 aBraga, L.S.1 aGuedes, R.N.C.1 ade Oliveira, L.O.0 tBulletin of entomological research.g2017 Feb., v. 107, no. 1 p.9-20dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl46143x1475-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00074853160006873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03716naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245012400155300001800279520242000297592002802717650000802745650002102753650001802774650003802792650001702830650002002847650002102867650001102888650001302899650001202912650001802924650002502942650001302967650002002980650001803000650002203018650001203040700001303052700001703065773010403082856007503186852000903261655001203270IND60531285120221118051028.0160723e20130917xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053128512DNAL7 a10.1021/bi40089632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPiao, Xijun10aBifacial Peptide Nucleic Acid Directs Cooperative Folding and Assembly of Binary, Ternary, and Quaternary DNA Complexes  ap. 6313-6323.  aWe report herein the structuring of single-stranded thymine-rich DNA sequences into peptide–DNA hairpin triplex structures via designed melamine–thymine nucleobase recognition. Melamine-displaying α-peptides were synthesized with the general form (EM*)ₙ, where M* denotes a lysine residue side chain derivatized with melamine, a bifacial hydrogen bond complement for thymine. We have found that (EM*)ₙ peptides, which we term bifacial peptide nucleic acid (bPNA), function as a noncovalent template for thymine-rich DNA tracts. Unstructured DNA of the general form dTₙCₘTₙ are bound to (EM*)ₙ peptides and fold into cooperatively melting 1:1 bPNA–DNA hairpin complexes with dissociation constants in the submicromolar to low nanomolar range for n = 4–10. As the length of the interface (n) is decreased, the melting temperature of the bPNA–DNA complex drops significantly, though Kd increases are less substantial, suggestive of strong enthalpy–entropy compensation. This is borne out by differential scanning calorimetry analysis, which indicates enthalpically driven bPNA–DNA base-stacking that becomes markedly less exothermic as the recognition surface n decreases in size. The recognition interface tolerates a high number of “mismatches” and indicates half-site, or monofacial, recognition between melamine and thymine may occur if only 1 complementary nucleobase is available. Association correlates directly with fractional thymine content, with optimal binding when the number of T–T sites match the number of melamine units. Interestingly, when a DNA host has more T–T sites than melamine sites on bPNA, two or three bPNAs can bind to a single DNA, resulting in ternary and quaternary complexes that have higher thermal stability than the binary (1:1) bPNA–DNA complex, suggestive of cooperative multisite binding. In contrast, when two bPNAs of different lengths bind to the same DNA host, a ternary complex is formed with two melting transitions, corresponding to independent melting of each bPNA component from the complex. These data demonstrate that melamine-displaying bPNA recognize thymine-rich DNA in predictable and multifaceted ways that allow binding affinity, structure stability, and stoichiometry to be tuned through simple bPNA length modification and matching with DNA length. Synthetic bPNA structuring elements may be useful tools for biotechnology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abinding capacity 3abiotechnology 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3adissociation 3aheat production 3ahydrogen bonding 3alysine 3amelamine 3amelting 3amelting point 3anucleotide sequences 3apeptides 3aprotein folding 3astoichiometry 3athermal stability 3athymine1 aXia, Xin1 aBong, Dennis0 tBiochemistry.g2013 Sept. 17, v. 52, no. 37 p.6313-6323dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbi40089633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02864naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245009300164300001800257520168000275592002801955650001201983650001401995650002202009650001702031650001902048650001102067650001202078650003702090700001402127700005702141700005602198773017002254856008102424852000902505655001202514IND60769659220221119142057.0220309e20220223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076965922DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.1c049682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Shuncheng10aNonthermal Plasma Catalytic Ammonia Synthesis over a Ni Catalyst Supported on MgO/SBA-15  ap. 3292-3302.  aNonthermal plasma (NTP)-enabled ammonia synthesis has been recently considered a sustainable technique as compared to the Haber–Bosch (HB) process. Herein, we demonstrated the NTP catalytic ammonia synthesis using mesoporous silica (SBA-15)-supported Ni catalysts under ambient conditions. Specifically, two types of MgO-modified SBA-15 were developed (as the catalyst support) by the in situ doping and incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) methods, respectively. Experimental results demonstrated that the addition of Mg in SBA-15 via the IWI method favored the ammonia synthesis rate under NTP conditions. The developed Ni-Mg₀.₀₂/SBA-15-IWI catalyst exhibited the highest ammonia synthesis rate and energy efficiency value of 4.4 mmol h–¹ gcₐₜ–¹ and 1.05 gNH₃ kWh–¹, respectively, outperforming the Ni/SBA-15 and Ni-Mg₀.₀₂/SBA-15-In situ catalysts (i.e., the doping of Mg via the in situ method). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and energy-dispersive system (EDS) mapping analysis showed that the addition of Mg (on SBA-15) via the IWI method favored the dispersion of Ni active sites on the surface of the catalyst and the interaction between Ni and the SBA-15 support, i.e., uniform distribution of Ni nanoparticles of 5.1 ± 1.1 nm in the Ni-Mg₀.₀₂/SBA-15-IWI catalyst, which enhanced the ammonia synthesis performance. Finally, the developed Ni-Mg₀.₀₂/SBA-15-IWI catalyst displayed a slight decrease in the ammonia synthesis rate from ∼4.42 to ∼3.89 mmol h–¹ gcₐₜ–¹ over 40 h on stream, which could be attributed to the aggregation of Ni particles based on the postreaction HRTEM analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3acatalysts 3aenergy efficiency 3aporous media 3aprocess design 3asilica 3astreams 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aShao, Yan1 aChen, Huanhao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9623-80421 aFan, Xiaolei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9039-67360 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2022 Feb. 23, v. 61, no. 9 p.3292-3302dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.1c049683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02891naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245009000172300001600262500001900278520166500297592002801962650001401990650002002004650002802024650001302052650002202065650002302087650001402110650001202124650001702136650002202153650002302175650002302198700001502221700002002236773014402256856008402400852000902484655001202493IND60689289120221117215810.0200421e20030101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068928912DNAL7 a10.1080/096374803100013223232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWebster-Gandy, J.10aSexual dimorphism in fat patterning in a sample of 5 to 7-year-old children in Oxford  ap. 467-471.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIt is now well recognised that, in addition to total body fat, fat distribution is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease and insulin resistance/diabetes in both adults and children. Traditionally, sexual dimorphism in fat patterning has been regarded as occurring at puberty. The aim of this study was to investigate gender differences in fat patterning in a group of children in Oxford. Anthropometric data was collected for 95 girls and 97 boys aged 5-7 years. Body mass index, percentage body fat and fat patterning indices were calculated using skinfold thickness measurements. While girls at this age had significantly larger percentage body fat and skinfolds, the fat patterning indices showed no differences between genders and no indication of greater truncal adiposity. The boys had a larger mean waist-hip ratio (0.96±0.04) compared with the girls (0.93±0.04) (P<0.001). The larger ratio in boys was the outcome of the smaller hip circumference in the boys reflecting less gluteal adiposity. This suggests that even at this young age there is clear evidence of sexual dimorphism in fat patterning, with girls showing greater subcutaneous adiposity mainly contributed by gluteal fat. The present study confirms the findings of American and European workers that sexual dimorphism of fat patterning in children is present at 5-7 years of age. Second, that these differences in fat patterning can be detected using simple anthropometric measurements such as hip circumference and skinfold thicknesses. The significance and importance of hip circumference measurements in predicting health outcome is an area that merits further investigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadiposity 3abody mass index 3acardiovascular diseases 3adiabetes 3ahip circumference 3ainsulin resistance 3anutrition 3apuberty 3arisk factors 3asexual dimorphism 3askinfold thickness 3awaist-to-hip ratio1 aWarren, J.1 aHenry, C.

The study undertaken has quantified this phenomenon using a bespoke test cell allowing a flat sheet membrane channel to be viewed directly during operation and the accumulated solids determined by digital image processing. Sludging behaviour has then been correlated both with the sludge properties, from sludge samples taken from both an industrial and municipal MBR, and the permeability decline rate data.The work has revealed the expected trends in fouling propensity, as quantified by the exponent n of the Δp/Δt = m.exp(nJ) correlation from classical flux-step tests. With zero membrane aeration the industrial samples exhibited sludging, the filling of the complete thickness of the membrane channel with sludge solids, whereas for municipal sludge the solids formed a cake layer which did not fill the channel. In the absence of sludging the permeability decline followed the expected pattern of increasing at the elevated soluble COD and capillary suction time values of the industrial sludge, compared with municipal sludge at the same solids concentration range (8–12 g.L⁻¹). However, there was no evident correlation between fouling (permeability decline without sludging) and sludging: incipient sludging did not appear to influence permeability, though can be assumed to negatively impact on long-term operation, or relate to the sCOD concentration. Sludging instead appeared to depend on the sludge physical properties, and primarily the viscosity: sludge samples at high viscosities were found to exhibit a different air-scour pattern to that at normal MLSS concentrations.Outcomes suggest that sludging is caused by rheological conditions promoting bubble coalescence and bubble stream constriction, reducing the exposure of the membrane surface to scouring air.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaeration 3aair 3achemical oxygen demand 3adigital images 3afouling 3aimage analysis 3amembrane bioreactors 3apermeability 3asludge 3astreams 3aviscosity 0aMembrane bioreactors 0aSludge 0aClogging 0aSludging 0aFouling 0aRheology1 aQiblawey, H.1 aOdai, A.1 aJamaleddin, J.1 aNasser, M.1 aJudd, S.J.0 tWater research.g2018 Nov. 01, v. 144 p.46-54dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2018.07.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03403naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002300155245011000178300001600288520176000304592002802064650002202092650001202114650002502126650001202151650001902163650002602182650001402208650002102222650001402243650001202257650001402269650001302283650001902296650001902315650002002334650001202354650003802366650001402404650001102418653001402429653001902443653001802462653002802480653003702508653001302545653001302558700002202571700002502593700002102618773009902639856009002738852000902828655001202837IND60614369120221119024735.0190318e20190115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061436912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2018.09.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRobinson, Georgina14aThe effect of resource quality on the growth of Holothuria scabra during aquaculture waste bioremediation  ap. 101-108.  aReducing dependency on environmentally unsustainable formulated feeds, most of which include limited reserves of fishmeal as a protein source, is a priority for the aquaculture industry, particularly for intensive culture systems. One approach is to increase nitrogen reuse within the system by feeding nitrogen-rich aquaculture effluent to deposit feeders, thereby closing the aquaculture nitrogen-loop. This study, for the first time and on a laboratory-scale, has reared juveniles of the sea cucumber Holothuria scabra at high densities solely on particulate organic waste from a commercial-scale land-based abalone recirculating aquaculture system. Furthermore, growth rates and biomass yields were increased significantly by adjusting the effluent C:N from 5:1 to 20:1 by adding exogenous organic carbon sources (glucose, starch and cellulose), so fuelling accelerated heterotrophic bacterial production within the redox-stratified tank sediment. Sea cucumber juveniles reared solely on effluent had a biomass density of 711 g m−2 after four months whereas animals reared on starch-amended effluent (the best performing treatment) had a final density of 1011 g m−2. Further optimisation of this approach could increase biomass yields and pave the way for the commercial cultivation of deposit feeding animals on waste streams, thus contributing to more environmentally sustainable aquaculture. Here, the nitrogen that originated from fishmeal is not lost through the discharge of aquaculture effluent; rather, it is immobilised into single cell biomass that is up-cycled into high-value secondary biomass. We demonstrate that sea cucumbers can be produced at high density through the manipulation of the C:N ratio of aquaculture effluent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolothuria scabra 3aabalone 3aaquaculture industry 3abiomass 3abioremediation 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3acellulose 3afeed formulation 3afish meal 3aglucose 3ajuveniles 3anitrogen 3aorganic carbon 3aorganic wastes 3aprotein sources 3arearing 3arecirculating aquaculture systems 3asediments 3astarch 0aC/N ratio 0aDeposit feeder 0aStoichiometry 0aSustainable aquaculture 0aRecirculating aquaculture system 0aSediment 0asandfish1 aCaldwell, Gary S.1 aJones, Clifford L.W.1 aStead, Selina M.0 tAquaculture.g2019 Jan. 15, v. 499 p.101-108dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2018.09.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02985naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245014100174500002200315520168900337592002802026650002402054650001702078650000902095650001902104650001202123650001302135650001402148650002002162650001102182653002102193653001202214653002402226653002102250653002702271700002902298700003002327700001902357773009002376856008802466852000902554655001202563IND60656921320221119144631.0190815e20190806xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065692132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.earscirev.2019.1029242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlyukin, Yury I.10aFluid inclusion phase ratios, compositions and densities from ambient temperature to homogenization, based on PVTX properties of H2ONaCl  aPre-press version  aFluid inclusions are the best tool to characterize the properties of fluids in paleo-geological environments, and the most widely used methods applied to fluid inclusions are petrographic analysis and microthermometry. Here, we present a comprehensive review of the phase characteristics of fluid inclusions, represented by the binary system H2ONaCl, from ambient temperature to homogenization. We quantify the changes in compositions, densities and volume fractions of liquid, vapor and halite as temperature is increased. Fluid inclusions of any bulk density, salinity, or homogenization behavior show a decrease in the volume fraction of vapor (i.e., shrinkage of the bubble) during heating to ~400 °C. For fluid inclusions that homogenize to vapor, this leads to a phenomenon referred to in previous studies as “homogenization by inversion,” wherein the volume fraction of vapor decreases during heating to ~380 °C, and increases with continued heating thereafter. Inclusions with salinity less than ~10 wt% NaCl show a rapid increase in volume fraction of vapor with heating above ~380 °C, and plateau at >90 vol% vapor, leading to apparent homogenization at temperatures well below the actual homogenization. Inclusions containing a fluid with the critical density may exhibit reversals in the volume fraction of vapor during heating. Inclusions having the critical density and low salinities will generally homogenize by fading of the meniscus while the volume fraction of vapor is quite low (<10 vol%) and may be misinterpreted as homogenizing to the liquid.

The safety limits of these compounds were recognized by measuring the activities of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and the levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and total lipids of rat serum. The free and total phenolic compounds (400, 800, and 1600 ppm) and butylated hydroxy toluene (BHT) (200 ppm) were daily ingested for 7 weeks. The administration of olive total and free phenolic compounds at 400 and 800 ppm did not cause any significant changes on ALT and AST activities and serum total lipids. These compounds at 1600 ppm caused significant increase in ALT and AST activities and the content of total lipids. Both olive phenolic compounds were superior to that of BHT in increasing HDL-cholesterol level. Nutritional experiments demonstrated that BHT at 200 ppm caused an enlargement in the kidney and liver of the rat compared with the administration of total and free olive phenolic compounds at 1200 and 1600 ppm. Microscopical examination of kidney and liver tissues of rats administered free and total phenolic compounds at 1200 ppm had the same histological character as that of control rats, while the administration of BHT (200 ppm) and phenolic compounds (1600 ppm) induced severe damage to the tissues of the rat kidney and liver.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalanine transaminase 3aaspartate transaminase 3ablood serum 3acultivars 3ahigh density lipoprotein cholesterol 3ahistology 3akidneys 3aliver 3anutrition 3aolives 3arats 3atoluene1 aEl-baroty, G.S.1 aBasuny, Amany M.0 tInternational journal of food sciences and nutrition.g2003 Jan. 1, v. 54, no. 3 p.159-174dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2066x1465-34787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09637480310001363063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03465naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245010600166300001600272520190200288592002802190650002202218650002402240650002102264650003702285650000902322650002102331650003302352650002402385650002502409650003302434650001802467650001702485650001602502650002502518653001402543653001802557653002302575653002802598653000802626700001802634700001602652700005502668700001802723700002702741773009702768856008502865852000902950655001202959IND60609785820221119101421.0200427e20181101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060978582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2018.07.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilfert, P.10aVivianite as the main phosphate mineral in digested sewage sludge and its role for phosphate recovery  ap. 312-321.  aPhosphate recovery from sewage sludge is essential in a circular economy. Currently, the main focus in centralized municipal wastewater treatment plants (MWTPs) lies on struvite recovery routes, land application of sludge or on technologies that rely on sludge incineration. These routes have several disadvantages. Our study shows that the mineral vivianite, Fe₂(PO₄)₃ × 8H₂O, is present in digested sludge and can be the major form of phosphate in the sludge. Thus, we suggest vivianite can be the nucleus for alternative phosphate recovery options. Excess and digested sewage sludge was sampled from full-scale MWTPs and analysed using x-ray diffraction (XRD), conventional scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX), environmental SEM-EDX (eSEM-EDX) and Mössbauer spectroscopy. Vivianite was observed in all plants where iron was used for phosphate removal. In excess sludge before the anaerobic digestion, ferrous iron dominated the iron pool (≥50%) as shown by Mössbauer spectroscopy. XRD and Mössbauer spectroscopy showed no clear correlation between vivianite bound phosphate versus the iron content in excess sludge. In digested sludge, ferrous iron was the dominant iron form (>85%). Phosphate bound in vivianite increased with the iron content of the digested sludge but levelled off at high iron levels. 70–90% of all phosphate was bound in vivianite in the sludge with the highest iron content (molar Fe:P = 2.5). The quantification of vivianite was difficult and bears some uncertainty probably because of the presence of impure vivianite as indicated by SEM-EDX. eSEM-EDX indicates that the vivianite occurs as relatively small (20–100 μm) but free particles. We envisage very efficient phosphate recovery technologies that separate these particles based on their magnetic properties from the complex sludge matrix.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aanaerobic digestion 3acircular economy 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3airon 3aland application 3amagnesium ammonium phosphate 3amagnetic properties 3amunicipal wastewater 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asewage sludge 3aspectroscopy 3auncertainty 3awastewater treatment 0aVivianite 0aSewage sludge 0aPhosphate recovery 0aMössbauer spectroscopy 0aXRD1 aDugulan, A.I.1 aGoubitz, K.1 aKorving, L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4753-01401 aWitkamp, G.J.1 aVan Loosdrecht, M.C.M.0 tWater research.g2018 Nov. 01, v. 144 p.312-321dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2018.07.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03416naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245012600168300001400294520160400308592002801912650004401940650003701984650001302021650002502034650002502059650001202084650001902096650002602115650002002141650001902161650002002180650001402200650001302214650003402227650003302261650001302294650002502307650002102332650002002353650002302373653001602396653002402412653002702436653002002463653001602483653002302499700002302522700001702545700001702562700002502579700001902604773010902623856008502732852000902817655001202826IND60592382020221116190345.0190207e20180515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059238202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2018.02.0632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, Ambreen10aFabrication and characterization of polysulfone/modified nanocarbon black composite antifouling ultrafiltration membranes  ap. 71-82.  aMembrane fouling in membrane filtration technology is the major obstacle in maximizing its efficiency leading to short membrane lifetime and high operating cost. Here we reported that the use of oxidized nanocarbon black (ONC) in the preparation of composite ultrafiltration membrane, suppresses the fouling together with improved hydrophilicity and water permeate flux. Nanocarbon black (NC) was oxidized using ammonium persulfate, while morphology, nature and extent of oxidized groups were determined through scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and ion exchange capacity (IEC) measurement. The dispersion of the ONC was stable in organic solvent (NMP) and in DI water even after 6 months. Oxidized nanocarbon black was incorporated in polysulfone matrix to prepare nanocomposite membranes (CNC) through phase inversion method. The influence of ONC on surface morphology, surface chemical composition, hydrophilicity, mechanical strength, surface negative charge, porosity, ultrafiltration and antifouling characteristics were evaluated. The results showed that inclusion of 1.0 wt% ONC enhance water permeate flux from 188.5 to 307 L m−2 h−1, protein rejection up to 97.6%, highest flux recovery ratio of 89.4% after three cycle permeation and lowest irreversible fouling of 10.5%. Considering relatively low cost, excellent antifouling properties and mechanical strength of CNC membranes, make it potential candidate as antifouling membrane for water purification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aammonium 3aartificial membranes 3achemical composition 3afouling 3ahydrophilicity 3aion exchange capacity 3amicrofiltration 3ananocomposites 3aoperating costs 3aoxidation 3aporosity 3ascanning electron microscopes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolvents 3astrength (mechanics) 3athermogravimetry 3aultrafiltration 3awater purification 0aPolysulfone 0aOxidized nanocarbon 0aNanocomposite membrane 0aUltrafiltration 0aAntifouling 0aWater purification1 aSherazi, Tauqir A.1 aKhan, Yaqoob1 aLi, Shenghai1 aNaqvi, Syed Ali Raza1 aCui, Zhaoliang0 tJournal of membrane science.g2018 May 15, v. 554 p.71-82dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2018.02.0633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02384naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245013100170300001600301520131900317592002801636650001201664650001901676650002001695650002201715650002101737650001301758650001301771650001501784651001801799700001901817700002301836773008501859856008101944852000902025655001202034IND60123805420221122030655.0150404e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012380542DNAL7 a10.1007/s10021-015-9844-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorse, Jennifer L.10aSoil Denitrification Fluxes in a Northern Hardwood Forest: The Importance of Snowmelt and Implications for Ecosystem N Budgets  ap. 520-532.  aNitrogen (N) is the nutrient that most frequently limits the productivity of forest ecosystems. Understanding N cycling and forest response to altered N inputs and climate change is an ongoing research challenge. In several intensively studied forests in northeastern North America, well-characterized N inputs are not balanced by measured N losses, suggesting that an unmeasured N loss pathway such as denitrification may be important. We studied soil denitrification gas fluxes in northern hardwood forests at the Hubbard Brook long-term ecological research site in New Hampshire, USA, and found that denitrification in apparently oxic soils could account for N losses greater than half of annual atmospheric N inputs. Denitrification rates were strongly affected by elevation and season, with higher rates occurring at high elevation plots and during snowmelt. These results suggest that denitrification accounts for a major portion of the increasing amounts of “missing N” reported for this site, and that a significant amount of the anthropogenic N that enters terrestrial ecosystems in northeastern North America is returned to the atmosphere as N₂. These dynamics are highly vulnerable to change, however, as soil moisture levels and conditions during snowmelt are changing rapidly along with climate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adenitrification 3aforest ecosystems 3ahardwood forests 3anitrogen 3asnowmelt 3asoil water 3aNew Hampshire1 aDurán, Jorge,1 aGroffman, Peter M.0 tEcosystems.g2015 Apr., v. 18, no. 3 p.520-532dSpringer-Verlagx1432-98407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-015-9844-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03955naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005400146245016500200300002000365520180400385592002802189596009802217596010102315596010402416596010402520596010202624596009202726596007602818650001502894650001302909650001102922650001402933650002302947650001302970650001802983650001903001650001403020650001303034700001503047700005603062700001603118700001703134700005903151773017303210856008103383852000903464655001203473IND60792552220221120220400.0220907e20220823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079255222DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.2c016242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xiao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9235-073110aStructure Evolution of Ni–Cu Bimetallic Catalysts Derived from Layered Double Hydroxides for Selective Hydrogenation of Furfural to Tetrahydrofurfuryl Alcohol  ap. 12953-12965.  aThe hydrogenation of furfural containing multifunctional group often needs the high-efficiency cooperation of multiple catalytic active centers, which is greatly determined by the regulation of the surface and interface structure of multicomponent catalytic materials. Based on such circumstance, a series of highly dispersed supported bimetallic Cu–Ni catalysts prepared by the in situ topological transformation of layered double hydroxides have been investigated for the one-pot hydrogenation of furfural. Compared with the supported monometallic Cu and Ni catalysts, the optimized bimetallic Cu₁Ni₃/MgAlO catalyst presents highly efficient and good selectivity in the hydrogenation of furfural at the bath reactor. The selectivity to tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol reaches 94.0% with a complete conversion of furfural at 110 °C under 3 MPa of H₂ for 3 h. The results of TEM and in situ FT-IR confirm that the Ni-rich Cu–Ni alloy in the Cu₁Ni₃/MgAlO catalyst generates a strong synergistic effect, which shifts the adsorption configuration of furfural from parallel or vertical adsorption to tilted adsorption so as to significantly improve the catalytic performance. The intrinsic catalytic performances of CuₓNiy/MgAlO catalysts indicate that the TOFC═O and TOFC═C values can be balanced through construction of the structure of the catalyst for achieving the synergistic effect between Cu and Ni significantly to enhance the one-pot selective hydrogenation of furfural to tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol. Additionally, the Cu₁Ni₃/MgAlO catalyst presents excellent reusability by six-cycle testing. The above results indicate that the Cu₁Ni₃/MgAlO with the cooperation of multiple catalytic active centers is a promising catalyst for the selective hydrogenation of furfural.  aPublisher supplied data  a21978031cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a22161132005cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a2021-MS-125cNatural Science Foundation of Liaoning Provincedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100005047  aDUT2021TB03cCentral University Basic Research Fund of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100018594  aDUT21LK02cCentral University Basic Research Fund of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100018594  a2021J12GX025cScience and Technology Innovation Fund in Dalian Citydhttps://doi.org/NA  aXLYC1908033cLiaoning Revitalization Talent Programdhttps://doi.org/NA 3aadsorption 3aalcohols 3aalloys 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3afurfural 3ahydrogenation 3aprocess design 3asynergism 3atopology1 aLiu, Wenqi1 aLuo, Jingjie1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0736-30691 aNiu, Hongyu1 aLi, Rongrong1 aLiang, Changhai1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7959-251X0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2022 Aug. 23, v. 61, no. 35 p.12953-12965dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.2c016243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02985naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245009900173300001600272520160000288592002801888650002301916650000901939650001401948650001501962650000901977650002601986650002702012650001602039650001202055650001602067650003102083650002502114653002502139653001602164653001602180653001202196653001002208653001302218700001802231700002002249700001602269700002002285773009902305856009002404852000902494655001202503IND60614369520221119025004.0200501e20181201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061436952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2018.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeiva, P.M.L.10aPhysical and chemical characteristics of fertile and infertile eggs of wild Caiman latirostris  ap. 287-291.  aIn oviparous species, physico-chemical characteristics of eggs are an indicator of maternal physiological traits and environmental conditions of the site where the females develop. In this study, we aim to (a) determine the physico-chemical characteristics of eggs from wild Caiman latirostris populations; (b) evaluate if fertile and infertile eggs differ in physico-chemical characteristics associated with suchest reproductive success; and (c) compare the present results with findings in other crocodilian species to identify characteristics that would be associated with reproductive biology and adaptations to their environments. Eggs were collected and identified, and different morphometric variables (percentage of components, and protein, total lipids and fatty acid composition) were determined. Fertile and infertile eggs did not differ in weight or component (eggshell, yolk and albumen) percentages of total egg weight. Fatty acid profiles of yolk differed between fertile and infertile eggs in C14:0, C16:1 and C17:1. However, the comparison of profiles among clutches showed differences in 12 fatty acids. We also observed differences in percentage of egg components respect to other crocodilian species, particularly of albumen, which had a lower proportion in C. latirostris. Our results suggest that egg infertility may not be related to maternal lipid investment. We propose using yolk of infertile eggs (which is similar to that of fertile eggs) as a non-invasive method to identify and evaluate the difference in FA composition of eggs for breedings female of varyns diets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaiman latirostris 3adiet 3aegg shell 3aegg weight 3aeggs 3aenvironmental factors 3afatty acid composition 3afatty acids 3afemales 3amorphometry 3aphysicochemical properties 3areproductive success 0aBroad-snouted caiman 0aEgg albumen 0aFatty Acids 0aProtein 0aLipid 0aEgg yolk1 aLabaque, M.C.1 aFernandez, M.E.1 aPiña, C.I.1 aSimoncini, M.S.0 tAquaculture.g2018 Dec. 01, v. 497 p.287-291dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2018.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02588naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245012700171300001600298520137000314592002801684650001001712650001201722650000901734650001301743653002401756653001801780653002201798653001001820653002001830653001701850700002601867700002801893700002501921700001601946700001801962773011601980856008502096852000902181655001202190IND60568245520221120121558.0170516e20170603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056824552DNAL7 a10.1080/17538947.2016.12340072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColtekin, Arzu,10aPerceptual complexity of soil-landscape maps: a user evaluation of color organization in legend designs using eye tracking  ap. 560-581.  aWe compared the ability of two legend designs on a soil-landscape map to efficiently and effectively support map reading tasks with the goal of better understanding how the design choices affect user performance. Developing such knowledge is essential to design effective interfaces for digital earth systems. One of the two legends contained an alphabetical ordering of categories, while the other used a perceptual grouping based on the Munsell color space. We tested the two legends for 4 tasks with 20 experts (in geography-related domains). We analyzed traditional usability metrics and participants’ eye movements to identify the possible reasons behind their success and failure in the experimental tasks. Surprisingly, an overwhelming majority of the participants failed to arrive at the correct responses for two of the four tasks, irrespective of the legend design. Furthermore, participants’ prior knowledge of soils and map interpretation abilities led to interesting performance differences between the two legend types. We discuss how participant background might have played a role in performance and why some tasks were particularly hard to solve despite participants’ relatively high levels of experience in map reading. Based on our observations, we caution soil cartographers to be aware of the perceptual complexity of soil-landscape maps.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolor 3aexperts 3asoil 3asoil map 0aSoil-landscape maps 0alegend design 0avisual complexity 0acolor 0aempirical study 0aeye tracking1 aBrychtová, Alžběta1 aGriffin, Amyq(Amy L.),1 aRobinson, Anthony C.1 aImhof, Mark1 aPettit, Chris0 tInternational journal of digital earth.g2017 June 3, v. 10, no. 6 p.560-581dTaylor & Francisx1753-89557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17538947.2016.12340073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02751naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001200139245011800151520168300269592002801952650002001980650001302000650001502013650002202028650001302050650001802063650001902081650001502100650000902115650001402124651001002138700001402148700001902162773012602181856007302307852000902380655001202389IND60652004420221119175115.0190712e20170703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065200442DNAL7 a10.3390/su90711642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Sen10aAssessing the Role of Policies on Land-Use/Cover Change from 1965 to 2015 in the Mu Us Sandy Land, Northern China  aPolicy has long been considered one of the major driving forces for land-use/cover change. However, research on the interactions between land-use/cover change (LUCC) and relevant policies remains limited. The agropastoral ecotone is a typical area of policy implementation and LUCC. Therefore, this study integrates the use of multisource and multiresolution remote sensing and topographic and field-based datasets for the case of the Mu Us Sandy Land (MUSL) in northern China. The research aim was to quantify LUCC from 1965 to 2015 and describe the relationship between policy changes and land-use types during three stages: the stage of the Great Cultural Revolution, the stage of the modernization of the economy, and the stage of the Great Ecological Project. The results indicated that land use was affected by different national policies because of the national approach to land use during different periods. In the stage of the Great Cultural Revolution, the amount of cultivated land increased, and the environment deteriorated under the influence of leftists. In the stage of the modernization of the economy, vegetation coverage improved after the initial damage, and cultivated and artificial surfaces also increased. In the stage of the Great Ecological Project, cultivated land and unused land decreased, and woodland and sparse vegetation increased with the implementation of the Grain for Green Project (GGP). However, cultivated land increased but wood land and sparse vegetation decreased significantly by the end of the GGP. The coverage of artificial surfaces increased and grasslands decreased due to the encroachment of artificial surfaces into grasslands.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aecotones 3agrasslands 3aissues and policy 3aland use 3amodernization 3aremote sensing 3atopography 3awood 3awoodlands 3aChina1 aWang, Tao1 aYan, Changzhen0 tSustainability.g2017 July 03, v. 9, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su90711643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02973naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002100186245007400207300002000281506007600301520137500377592002801752506003701780650000801817650001201825650002101837650001101858650002001869650002601889650001201915650001301927650002401940650002601964653002401990653001802014653001602032653001902048700003302067700002002100700001802120700001502138700002602153700002402179773017602203856007902379852000902458655001202467IND60178623020221207113133.0150604e20140610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017862302DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.14040971112doi7 aPMC40607182pmcid7 a249121812pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEspinosa, Javier10aPipX, the coactivator of NtcA, is a global regulator in cyanobacteria  ap. E2423-E2430.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTo modulate the expression of genes involved in nitrogen assimilation, the cyanobacterial P II-interacting protein X (PipX) interacts with the global transcriptional regulator NtcA and the signal transduction protein P II, a protein found in all three domains of life as an integrator of signals of the nitrogen and carbon balance. PipX can form alternate complexes with NtcA and P II, and these interactions are stimulated and inhibited, respectively, by 2-oxoglutarate, providing a mechanistic link between P II signaling and NtcA-regulated gene expression. Here, we demonstrate that PipX is involved in a much wider interaction network. The effect of pipX alleles on transcript levels was studied by RNA sequencing of S. elongatus strains grown in the presence of either nitrate or ammonium, followed by multivariate analyses of relevant mutant/control comparisons. As a result of this process, 222 genes were classified into six coherent groups of differentially regulated genes, two of which, containing either NtcA-activated or NtcA-repressed genes, provided further insights into the function of NtcA–PipX complexes. The remaining four groups suggest the involvement of PipX in at least three NtcA-independent regulatory pathways. Our results pave the way to uncover new regulatory interactions and mechanisms in the control of gene expression in cyanobacteria.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA 3aalleles 3aammonium nitrate 3acarbon 3agene expression 3amultivariate analysis 3amutants 3anitrogen 3asignal transduction 3atranscription factors 0anitrogen regulation 0atranscription 0atranslation 0aphotosynthesis1 aRodríguez-Mateos, Francisco1 aSalinas, Paloma1 aLanza, Val F.1 aDixon, Ray1 aCruz, Fernando de la,1 aContreras, Asuncion0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2014 June 10, v. 111, no. 23 p.E2423-E2430dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.14040971113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04044naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245012400158300001800282500002000300520233300320592002802653596007802681596006902759596003402828650002702862650002302889650002402912650002502936650001302961650001202974650001202986650001202998650003003010650001803040650002103058650001703079650002403096650001403120700001803134700001603152700002003168700005703188700006103245700002303306773012703329856007303456852000903529655001203538IND60747097420221120163802.0210811e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074709742DNAL7 a10.1111/jfd.134532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSayed, Mohamed10aVirulence and live vaccine potential of Edwardsiella piscicida phoP and phoQ mutants in catfish against edwardsiellosis  ap. 1463-1474.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEdwardsiella piscicida is a Gram‐negative facultative intracellular bacterium causing edwardsiellosis in catfish, the largest aquaculture industry in the United States. A safe and effective vaccine is an urgent need to avoid economic losses associated with E. piscicida outbreaks. PhoP/PhoQ is a two‐component signal transduction system (TCS) that plays an important role in bacterial pathogenesis through sense and response to environmental and host stress signals. This study aimed to explore the contribution of PhoQ/PhoP in E. piscicida virulence and develop live attenuated vaccines against E. piscicida infection in channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) and hybrid catfish (channel catfish ♀ × blue catfish (I. furcatus) ♂). In the current study, two in‐frame deletion mutants were constructed by deleting phoP (ETAC_09785) and phoQ (ETAC_09790) genes in E. piscicida strain C07‐087, and the virulence and protection efficacy of the constructed strains were evaluated in catfish following intraperitoneal injection. Both EpΔphoP and EpΔphoQ strains had a delayed adaptation to oxidative stress (0.2% H₂O₂) compared to E. piscicida wild type. The EpΔphoP and EpΔphoQ mutants produced significantly less biofilm compared to wild‐type E. piscicida. Notably, EpΔphoP and EpΔphoQ mutants were significantly attenuated in channel catfish compared with wild‐type E. piscicida (6.63% and 4.17% versus 49.16% mortalities), and channel catfish vaccinated with EpΔphoP and EpΔphoQ were significantly protected (95.65% and 97.92% survival) against E. piscicida infection at 21 days post‐vaccination. In hybrid catfish, EpΔphoP was significantly more attenuated than EpΔphoQ, but EpΔphoQ provided significantly better protection than EpΔphoP. EpΔphoP and EpΔphoQ strains both induced specific antibodies in channel catfish against E. piscicida at 14 and 21 days post‐vaccination. This result indicated that EpΔphoP and EpΔphoQ mutants were safe and protective in channel catfish fingerlings, while EpΔphoP was safe in hybrid catfish. Our findings show that PhoP and PhoQ are required for adaptation to oxidative stress and biofilm formation and may help E. piscicida face tough environmental challenges; thus, functional PhoP and PhoQ are critical for a successful infection.  aPublisher supplied data  cCenter for Biomedical Research Excellence in Pathogen–Host Interactions  aP20GM103646‐08cNational Institute of General Medical Sciences  cNational Institutes of Health 3aEdwardsiella piscicida 3aIctalurus furcatus 3aIctalurus punctatus 3aaquaculture industry 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3acatfish 3ahybrids 3aintraperitoneal injection 3alive vaccines 3aoxidative stress 3apathogenesis 3asignal transduction 3avirulence1 aOzdemir, Ozan1 aEssa, Manal1 aOlivier, Alicia1 aKarsi, Attila1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6845-33461 aLawrence, Mark L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4570-55921 aAbdelhamed, Hossam0 tJournal of fish diseases.g2021 Sept., v. 44, no. 9 p.1463-1474dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl10108x0140-77757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfd.134533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02084naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002200141245009200163300001800255500001400273520057700287592002800864650001400892650001600906650001800922650002200940650001100962650001800973650002300991650001301014650001401027651001301041653001301054653001301067653002301080653002401103700002501127700002001152700002401172700002101196700001601217700002001233700001701253700002401270700001601294773018401310856007501494852000901569655001201578IND60692030920221119095323.0200502e20040101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069203092DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.68.14032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSHIRASUKA, Yukako10aNeoculin as a New Taste-modifying Protein Occurring in the Fruit of Curculigo latifolia  ap. 1403-1407.  aNAL-light  aA unique taste-modifying activity that converts the sense of sourness to the sense of sweetness occurs in the fruit of the plant Curculigo latifolia, intrinsic to West Malaysia.

The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results reveal that the two samples, which were composed of bundle-like lamellae, had similar crystallinity and particularly high contents of the β-crystal. However, they behaved differently when stretched at 25 °C and 90 °C. Based on the detailed characterization of morphological evolutions during stretching by 2D-WAXD and SEM measurements, a mechanism of pore formation in stretching β-iPP is presented. We found that the phase transformation of β-smectic and β–α are not the primary origin of pore formation in stretching β-iPP, instead, the micropores are directly initiated from the substantially weak interfaces between β-lamellae. Since the bundle-like β-lamella without fully developed spherulites is an asymmetric three dimensional structure, the lamellae at different angles to the tensile axis would lead to various deformational modes during stretching. Therefore, it is the polydispersity of β-lamellae in β-iPP that causes the poor pore size distribution in stretching β-iPP membrane.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acrystal structure 3acrystallization 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3amicropores 3apolypropylenes 3aporosity 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3awide-angle X-ray scattering1 aXiang, Ming1 aCao, Ya1 aKang, Jian1 aYang, Feng0 tRSC advances.g2014 Aug. 21, v. 4, no. 69 p.36689-36701dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra03589e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03317naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010000167300001400267520178700281592002802068650001902096650002602115650001102141650001302152650001002165650003102175650002502206650001702231650003502248650001002283650001002293653000802303653000802311653000702319653000802326653000702334653000802341653003502349653002502384653001502409653001302424653001602437653002602453700001802479700002102497700001802518700002202536773012302558856008502681852000902766655001202775IND60541198920221121041613.0190318e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054119892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2015.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHammer, Nora10aMethodology of a dynamic test bench to test ultra-high-frequency transponder ear tags in motion  ap. 81-92.  aThe electronic identification of sheep and goats has been obligatory in the European Union since 2010 by means of low-frequency radio-frequency identification systems. The identification of pigs and cattle is currently based on a visual ear tag, but electronic animal identification is gaining in importance. The European Union already offers the additional use of electronic identification systems for cattle in their council regulation. Besides the low-frequency radio-frequency identification, an ultra-high-frequency ear tag is a possibility for electronic animal identification. The benefits of the latter frequency band are the high range, the possibility of quasi-simultaneous reading and a high data transmission rate. First systematic laboratory tests were carried out before testing the ear tags in practice. Therefore, a dynamic test bench was built. The aim of the experiments presented in this study was to compare different ear tags under standardised conditions and select the most suitable for practical use. The influence of different parameters was tested and a standard test procedure to evaluate the quality of the transponder ear tag was developed.The experiments showed that neither the transponder holder material (polyvinyl chloride vs. extruded polystyrene) nor the reader settings examined (triggered read vs. presence sensing) had a significant influence on the average of readings of the different transponder types. The parameter ‘number of rounds’ (10 vs. 15 vs. 20) did not show a significant effect either. However, significant differences between speed (1.5ms−1,3.0ms−1), transponder orientation and the fourteen transponder types were found. The two most suitable transponder ear tags for cattle and pigs have been determined by comparison.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aanimal identification 3acattle 3aear tags 3agoats 3alaboratory experimentation 3apoly(vinyl chloride) 3apolystyrenes 3aradio frequency identification 3asheep 3aswine 0aARR 0aERP 0aPS 0aPVC 0aTR 0aXPS 0aRadio-frequency identification 0aUltra-high-frequency 0aTest bench 0aEar tags 0aTransponder 0aAnimal identification1 aAdrion, Felix1 aJezierny, Dagmar1 aGallmann, Eva1 aJungbluth, Thomas0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2015 Apr., v. 113 p.81-92dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2015.02.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03822naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094024002200138024001900160040001800179100001700197245016400214300001400378506007600392520185100468592002802319506003702347650001802384650001802402650001002420650002002430650000902450650001702459650002202476650001602498650001802514650001102532650001902543650001202562650001802574650000902592650001602601650001402617650001602631650001502647650001702662650001702679653002602696653000802722653002302730653002202753653001602775653000802791700001702799700001502816700002002831700001902851700002402870700001602894700001602910700002002926700001602946773007502962856009003037852000903127655001203136IND60562513920221207134841.0170208e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056251392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.11.0052doi7 aPMC46844512pmcid7 a265843492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiao, Wenbin10aMesenchymal stem cells engineered to express selectin ligands and IL-10 exert enhanced therapeutic efficacy in murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis  ap. 87-97.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSystemic administration of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) affords the potential to ameliorate the symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) in both preclinical and clinical studies. However, the efficacy of MSC-based therapy for MS likely depends on the number of cells that home to inflamed tissues and on the controlled production of paracrine and immunomodulatory factors. Previously, we reported that engineered MSCs expressing P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) and Sialyl-Lewisx (SLeX) via mRNA transfection facilitated the targeted delivery of anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) to inflamed ear. Here, we evaluated whether targeted delivery of MSCs with triple PSGL1/SLeX/IL-10 engineering improves therapeutic outcomes in mouse experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a murine model for human MS. We found PSGL-1/SLeX mRNA transfection significantly enhanced MSC homing to the inflamed spinal cord. This is consistent with results from in vitro flow chamber assays in which PSGL-1/SleX mRNA transfection significantly increased the percentage of rolling and adherent cells on activated brain microvascular endothelial cells, which mimic the inflamed endothelium of blood brain/spinal cord barrier in EAE. In addition, IL-10-transfected MSCs show significant inhibitory activity on the proliferation of CD4+ T lymphocytes from EAE mice. In vivo treatment with MSCs engineered with PSGL-1/SLeX/IL-10 in EAE mice exhibited a superior therapeutic function over native (unmodified) MSCs, evidenced by significantly improved myelination and decreased lymphocytes infiltration into the white matter of the spinal cord. Our strategy of targeted delivery of performance-enhanced MSCs could potentially be utilized to increase the effectiveness of MSC-based therapy for MS and other central nervous system (CNS) disorders.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aT-lymphocytes 3aanimal models 3abrain 3aclinical trials 3aears 3aencephalitis 3aendothelial cells 3aendothelium 3aglycoproteins 3ahumans 3ainterleukin-10 3aligands 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3amyelination 3asclerosis 3aspinal cord 3astem cells 3atherapeutics 3atransfection 0aMesenchymal stem cell 0aMSC 0aMultiple sclerosis 0amRNA transfection 0aCell homing 0aEAE1 aPham, Victor1 aLiu, Linan1 aRiazifar, Milad1 aPone, Egest J.1 aZhang, Shirley Xian1 aMa, Fengxia1 aLu, Mengrou1 aWalsh, Craig M.1 aZhao, Weian0 tBiomaterials.g2016 Jan., v. 77 p.87-97dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.11.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02913naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100004200147245012700189520105500316592002801371650002701399650001301426650001001439650001201449650001701461650002701478650001701505650001901522650001201541650001401553650000901567650002001576650002001596650000701616650001501623650003201638650002601670650001101696650002301707650000901730653001701739653002201756653001701778653002201795700006901817700002201886700003501908700002401943700003201967700003901999700008502038773012202123856008102245852000902326655001202335IND60730462420221118092047.0211030e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073046242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1112392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCavalcanti, Natália Sufiatti Holanda10aDonkey milk and fermented donkey milk: are there differences in the nutritional value and physicochemical characteristics?  aThis study aimed to evaluate the nutritional value and physicochemical characteristics of fresh donkey milk and fermented donkey milk. Furthermore, the impact of the refrigerated storage (4 °C, 21 days) on the characteristics of the fermented milk was evaluated. The fermented milk had higher acidity (lower pH values and higher titratable acidity) and presented lower lactose, mineral (calcium, phosphorous, magnesium, sodium, and zinc), and amino acid (mainly essential amino acids) contents than milk. Otherwise, it had a better fatty acid profile (lower saturated fatty acid content, and higher monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acid contents). The fermented milk storage resulted in decreases in the lactose content, improvements in the amino acid profile, and maintenance of the mineral content. However, negative impacts were observed on the fatty acid profile. It can be concluded that both donkey milk and fermented milk donkey present important nutritional value, and the fermented milk could be refrigerated stored up to 21 days.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acid composition 3aass milk 3aasses 3acalcium 3acold storage 3afatty acid composition 3afermentation 3afermented milk 3alactose 3amagnesium 3amilk 3amineral content 3anutritive value 3apH 3aphosphorus 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3asaturated fatty acids 3asodium 3atitratable acidity 3azinc 0aAsinine milk 0aNutritional value 0aFermentation 0aStorage stability1 aPimentel, Tatiana Colombo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4600-89321 aMagnani, Marciane1 aPacheco, Maria Teresa Bertoldo1 aAlves, Susana Paula1 aBranquinho Bessa, Rui José1 aMarília da Silva Sant'ana, Amanda1 ade Cássia Ramos do Egypto Queiroga, Rita1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4540-67010 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2021 June, v. 144 p.111239-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1112393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03120naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245013400161300001600295500001900311520139300330592002801723596005901751596005901810596008901869650002201958650002501980650002302005650001802028650001202046650001702058650001902075650001702094650001102111650001702122650000902139700001802148700001702166700001702183700001502200700005202215700001502267700002402282700001602306700001602322700001402338700001602352773013102368856008202499852000902581655001202590IND60730877220221120114006.0210313e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073087722DNAL7 a10.1007/s00226-021-01269-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhan, Ke12aA cost effective strategy to fabricate STA@PF@Cu2O hierarchical structure on wood surface: aimed at superhydrophobic modification  ap. 565-583.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCuprous oxide nanoparticles (Cu₂O NPs), phenol formaldehyde (PF) resin, and stearic acid (STA) were used to fabricate hierarchical core/shell structures to endow wood with superhydrophobic function, in which the preparation of Cu₂O NPs and the synthesis of PF were carried out simultaneously in one system. The Cu₂O NPs with the shape of a symmetrical tetrahexahedron were prepared in this work, and this novel shape is beneficial for creating a superhydrophobic surface. A relatively rough structure in micro/nanoscale was formed on the wood surface after being sprayed with PF@Cu₂O coating, which played a vital role in the fabrication of superhydrophobic wood surfaces, as expected. Morphological analysis and surface free energy calculations verified that STA reduced the surface free energy. Application of 12 layers of PF@Cu₂O coating followed by 2 h immersion in STA ethanol solution produced wood surfaces with low water permeability and high water contact angles of 153.3°, 153.2°, 150.5° on cross, radial, and tangential sections, respectively. Abrasion tests coupled with subsequent exposure to acidic and alkaline conditions indicated that the coating was resistant to both mechanical wear and chemical degradation. This two-step coating strategy used inexpensive ingredients and could have potential to application as water repellency protection of wood timber.  aPublisher supplied data  a31660175cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31760184cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2018HB025cProject of Yunnan Reserve Talents of Young Academic and Technical Leaders 3aGibbs free energy 3achemical degradation 3acost effectiveness 3acuprous oxide 3aethanol 3aformaldehyde 3ahydrophobicity 3apermeability 3aphenol 3astearic acid 3awood1 aLu, Quanxiong1 aXia, Sengwei1 aGuo, Congnan1 aZhao, Sisi1 aGao, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3670-42241 aYang, Long1 aMorrell, Jeffrey J.1 aYi, Tengfei1 aXie, Linkun1 aLei, Hong1 aDu, Guanben0 tWood science and technology.g2021 Mar., v. 55, no. 2 p.565-583dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl45947x0043-77197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00226-021-01269-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03356naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001800141245011500159300001800274500001900292520165300311592002801964650002101992650003502013650002502048650001602073650001802089650002602107650002402133650002802157650002102185650001202206650001602218650001702234650002102251650001602272650002902288650003402317650003102351653003302382653003202415653003302447653003402480700001802514700001902532700001902551773018402570856007502754852000902829655001202838IND60692031120221119095225.0200502e20040101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069203112DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.68.14142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCHOI, Il-Dong10aCloning and Characterization of the Catabolite Control Protein A Gene from Bacillus stearothermophilus No. 236  ap. 1414-1423.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe gene encoding the catabolite control protein A (CcpA) of Bacillus stearothermophilus No. 236, a strong xylanolytic bacterium, was cloned, sequenced, and expressed in Escherichia coli. The nucleotide sequence of the ccpA gene corresponded to an open reading frame of 1,005 bp that encodes a polypeptide of 334 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 36,902 kDa. The CcpA protein belonging to the LacI/GalR family of transcriptional regulators was produced by a recombinant E. coli strain expressing the B. stearothermophilus No. 236 ccpA gene and purified to apparent homogeneity. The transcription start site was mapped at a position 63 nucleotides upstream of the translation initiation codon, and a presumed promoter sequence was also identified. The deduced amino acid sequence of the ccpA gene product contained the helix-turn-helix motif found in many DNA-binding proteins, and showed the highest identity (62%) with CcpA from B. subtilis. The B. stearothermophilus No. 236 ccpA gene was demonstrated to be able to complement a B. subtilis ccpA mutant that exhibited two distinct mutant phenotypes: a growth defect and a release of carbon catabolite repression (CCR). These results indicate that the ccpA gene product of B. stearothermophilus No. 236 is functionally active also in B. subtilis. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay with the purified CcpA revealed that the CcpA of B. stearothermophilus No. 236 bound specifically to the xynA creB (catabolite responsive element B) sequence. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the CcpA protein participates in CCR of B. stearothermophilus No. 236 xynA gene.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aGeobacillus stearothermophilus 3aamino acid sequences 3aamino acids 3abiotechnology 3acatabolite repression 3agel electrophoresis 3ahelix-turn-helix motifs 3amolecular weight 3amutants 3anucleotides 3apolypeptides 3apromoter regions 3astart codon 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription initiation site 3axylanolytic microorganisms 0acatabolite control protein A 0aBacillus stearothermophilus 0acarbon catabolite repression 0acatabolite responsive element1 aHA, Gyong-Sik1 aKIM, Kyung-Nam1 aCHOI, Yong-Jin0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2004 Jan. 1, v. 68, no. 7 p.1414-1423dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.68.14143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01612naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245007900169300001600248520059800264592002800862650001800890650001200908650001100920650001900931650001100950650001400961650001200975651002000987653001801007653001401025653002301039773010901062856008201171852000901253655001201262IND60621437220221118040047.0181117s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062143722DNAL7 a10.1177/1564826502023004072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTagwireyi, Julia10aCan Biotechnology Help Meet the Nutrition Challenge in Sub-Saharan Africa?  ap. 358-359.  aThe successful efforts in the 1980s to redress nutrition problems in sub-Saharan Africa are being eroded.

Its widespread exposure vis-a-vis low dose effects led to a reduction in its safety dose and imposition of ban on its use in infant feeding bottles. This restriction paved the way for the gradual market entry of its analogues. However, their structural similarity to BPA has put them under surveillance for endocrine disrupting potential. The application of these analogues is increasing and so are the studies reporting their toxicity. This review highlights the reasons which led to the ban of BPA and also reports the exposure and toxicological data available on its analogues. Hence, this compilation is expected to answer in a better way whether the replacement of BPA by these analogues is safer or more harmful?  aPublisher supplied data 3abisphenol A 3afeeding bottles 3amarkets 3amonitoring 3aplastics 3atoxicity 0aBisphenols 0aEndocrine disruption 0aAnalogues 0aToxicity1 aAhmad, Masood0 tChemosphere.g2016 Sept., v. 158 p.131-142dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.05.0703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03011naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001800191245008500209300001800294506007600312520091600388592002801304506003701332650001501369650001801384650002001402650001501422650002601437650001501463650001301478650001301491650001401504650002901518650001701547700006001564700002001624700001201644700002001656700002301676700002501699700001901724700002101743700002201764700002401786700002601810700002001836700001701856700001901873700001901892700001601911700002201927700003101949700001901980700002201999700001802021700001702039700006002056773012802116856008402244852000902328655001202337IND60693203420221207131848.0200505e20200110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069320342DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.9b052742doi7 aPMC72030012pmcid7 a319227252pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHong, Xinying10aLeukocyte and Dried Blood Spot Arylsulfatase A Assay by Tandem Mass Spectrometry  ap. 6341-6348.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLiquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assays were developed to measure arylsulfatase A (ARSA) activity in leukocytes and dried blood spots (DBS) using deuterated natural sulfatide substrate. These new assays were highly specific and sensitive. Patients with metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) and multiple sulfatase deficiency (MSD) displayed a clear deficit in the enzymatic activity and could be completely distinguished from normal controls. The leukocyte assay reported here will be important for diagnosing MLD and MSD patients and for monitoring the efficacy of therapeutic treatments. ARSA activity was measured in DBS for the first time without an antibody. This new ARSA DBS assay can serve as a second-tier test following the sulfatide measurement in DBS for newborn screening of MLD. This leads to an elimination of most of the false positives identified by the sulfatide assay.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantibodies 3aarylsulfatase 3aenzyme activity 3aleukocytes 3aliquid chromatography 3amonitoring 3aneonates 3apatients 3ascreening 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atherapeutics1 aKumar, Arun Babu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8306-41031 aDaiker, Jessica1 aYi, Fan1 aSadilek, Martin1 aDe Mattia, Fabiola1 aFumagalli, Francesca1 aCalbi, Valeria1 aDamiano, Roberta1 aDella Bona, Maria1 ala Marca, Giancarlo1 aVanderver, Adeline L.1 aWaldman, Amy T.1 aAdang, Laura1 aSherbini, Omar1 aWoidill, Sarah1 aSuhr, Teryn1 aKurtzberg, Joanne1 aBeltran-Quintero, Maria L.1 aEscolar, Maria1 aAiuti, Alessandro1 aFinglas, Alan1 aOlsen, Amber1 aGelb, Michael H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7000-52190 tAnalytical chemistry.g2020 Jan. 10, v. 92, no. 9 p.6341-6348dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.9b052743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02991naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002000188245010600208300001200314506007600326520141600402592002801818596003701846506003701883650002101920650002501941650001701966650001101983650002601994650001502020650001802035650001702053650001702070650002202087650005202109650000902161650002002170651001302190700001702203700001602220700002002236700001902256773013102275856008202406852000902488655001202497IND60574609120221207133533.0210514e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057460912DNAL7 a287244162pmid7 aPMC55181172pmcid7 a10.1186/s12906-017-1870-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Kyung Won,10aProtective effects of chebulic acid on alveolar epithelial damage induced by urban particulate matter  ap. 373.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Chebulic acid (CA) isolated from T. chebula, which has been reported for treating asthma, as a potent anti-oxidant resources. Exposure to ambient urban particulate matter (UPM) considered as a risk for cardiopulmonary vascular dysfunction. To investigate the protective effect of CA against UPM-mediated collapse of the pulmonary alveolar epithelial (PAE) cell (NCI-H441), barrier integrity parameters, and their elements were evaluated in PAE. METHODS: CA was acquired from the laboratory previous reports. UPM was obtained from the National Institutes of Standards and Technology, and these were collected in St. Louis, MO, over a 24-month period and used as a standard reference. To confirm the protection of PAE barrier integrity, paracellular permeability and the junctional molecules were estimated with determination of transepithelial electrical resistance, Western Blotting, RT-PCR, and fluorescent staining. RESULTS: UPM aggravated the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in PAE and also decreased mRNA and protein levels of junction molecules and barrier integrity in NCI-H441. However, CA repressed the ROS in PAE, also improved barrier integrity by protecting the junctional parameters in NCI-H411. CONCLUSIONS: These data showed that CA resulted in decreased UPM-induced ROS formation, and the protected the integrity of the tight junctions against UPM exposure to PAE barrier.  aPublisher supplied data  aK1420071cKorea University Grant0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aWestern blotting 3aalternative medicine 3aantioxidants 3aasthma 3aelectrical resistance 3aepithelium 3amessenger RNA 3aparticulates 3apermeability 3aprotective effect 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3arisk 3atight junctions 3aMissouri1 aNam, Mi-Hyun1 aLee, Hee-Ra1 aHong, Chung-Oui1 aLee, Kwang-Won0 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2017 Dec., v. 17, no. 1 p.373-373dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-017-1870-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02607naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002000141245015300161520138200314592002801696650001201724650003601736650001101772650003301783650002001816650001101836650001301847650002401860650002601884650002201910650001701932651001101949651001001960700002701970700002101997773011902018856007502137852000902212655001202221IND60715299520221118131012.0201026e20200924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071529952DNAL7 a10.3390/land91003472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Chunhong 10aGlobal and Local Modeling of Land Use Change in the Border Cities of Laredo, Texas, USA and Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, Mexico: A Comparative Analysis  aThis paper estimates global logistic regression and logistic geographically weighted regression (GWR) models of urban growth in the adjacent border cities of Laredo, Texas in the United States and Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas in Mexico, for two time periods from 1985 to 2014. Historical land use and land cover patterns were monitored through Landsat imagery from the United States Geological Survey to identify instances of urban growth through land type change. Data on socioeconomic variables related to urban growth were collected from various sources and used as independent variables. In both time periods, the logistic GWR was proven to be a complementary model for the global logistic regression to explore the urban growth effect. In addition, GWR outperformed the global logistic regression model with respect to goodness of fit. These results suggest that local models are complementary to global models to empirically analyze the determinants of urban growth in study areas that contain political borders, presumably because the relationships between socioeconomic factors and urban growth are characterized by spatial heterogeneity in such areas. The spatial variable of the relationship between urban growth and the neighborhood interactions and proximity effect present the idea of complexity and interconnections between the land use change and associated factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aUnited States Geological Survey 3acities 3aland use and land cover maps 3aland use change 3amodels 3apolitics 3aregression analysis 3asocioeconomic factors 3aspatial variation 3aurbanization 3aMexico 3aTexas1 aJensen, Jennifer  L.R.1 aWeaver, Russell 0 tLand.g2020 Sept. 24, v. 9, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land91003473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03072naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002700139245003200166300001600198500002000214520157800234592002801812650001501840650001101855650001201866650001501878650001601893650001101909650001401920650001401934650002001948650002101968650002101989650001202010650001602022650001502038650001602053650001302069650001902082650000902101650002302110650001302133650001402146650001602160650001202176650000902188650001402197650001302211700001502224700001502239700001802254700001202272773011602284856007302400852000902473655001202482IND60572109620221117183151.0170712e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057210962DNAL7 a10.1111/rda.128302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChastant‐Maillard, S10aCanine and feline colostrum  ap. 148-152.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPuppy and kitten survival over the first weeks is particularly dependent on colostrum, a specific secretion of the mammary gland produced during the first 2 days post‐partum. Colostrum is a source of nutrients and immunoglobulins. It also contributes to the digestive tract maturation. Colostrum differentiates from milk mainly based on its concentration in immunoglobulins G: 20–30 g/L in dog colostrum, 40–50 g/L in cats’ vs <1 g/L in milk. IgG concentration rapidly drops after parturition (−50% in 24 hr). Immune quality of colostrum is highly variable between bitches, with no relationship with maternal blood IgG level, dam's age, breed size or litter size. In addition to systemic immune protection, colostrum also plays a major role for local digestive protection, due to IgA, lysozyme, lactoferrin, white blood cells and various cytokines. Energetic concentration of canine and feline colostrum is not superior to that of mature milk. It depends on colostrum fat concentration and is affected by breed size (higher in breeds <10 kg adult body weight). As puppies and kittens are almost agammaglobulinemic at birth, transfer of IgG from their digestive tract into their bloodstream is crucial for their survival, IgG absorption ending at 12–16 hr after birth. Energetic supply over the two first days of life, as evidenced by growth rate over the two first days of life, also affects risk of neonatal mortality. Early and sufficient suckling of colostrum is thus the very first care to be provided to newborns for their later health and survival.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aadults 3abitches 3ablood flow 3abody weight 3abreeds 3acolostrum 3acytokines 3adigestive tract 3aimmunoglobulin A 3aimmunoglobulin G 3akittens 3alactoferrin 3aleukocytes 3alitter size 3alysozyme 3amammary glands 3amilk 3aneonatal mortality 3aneonates 3anutrients 3aparturition 3apuppies 3arisk 3asecretion 3asuckling1 aAggouni, C1 aAlbaret, A1 aFournier, A.,1 aMila, H0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2017 Apr., v. 52 Suppl S2 p.148-152dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0936-67687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rda.128303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03084naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001800156245009000174300001600264520175000280592002802030650001302058650001702071650001902088650002002107650001502127650001202142650001402154650002002168650002002188650002302208650001202231650001202243651001402255653001802269653002602287653002002313653001702333653001402350653001402364653002002378700002002398773009702418856009002515852000902605655001202614IND50065214720221118043226.0150427e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006521472DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1654-109X.2005.tb00645.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohansson, P.10aPopulation size and fire intensity determine post-fire abundance in grassland lichens  ap. 193-198.  aQuestions: What is the variability in abundance of lichens on grassland soil between and within fields after prescribed fire? Is post-fire lichen abundance an effect of pre-fire population size?Location: Cedar Creek Natural History Area, Minnesota, USA.Methods: Lichen abundance, estimated as ground cover and dominated by Cladonia spp., was mapped in plots in two fields before prescribed burning on 06.10.2003 and 15.10.2003 for the first time since abandonment in the 1950s. The plots were resurveyed one year post-fire.Results: Post-fire cover of Cladonia spp. varied strongly between the fields, most likely due to different weather conditions between the burn events, which resulted in different fire intensities, one of low and one of high intensity. In the field that experienced the low intensity fire, post-fire cover of Cladonia spp. was still relatively high, and showed a positive relationship with pre-fire cover, while no such relationship was found after the high intensity fire. In that field Cladonia spp. experienced high mortality rates irrespective of pre-fire cover.Conclusions: This study provides an example of how species response to disturbance can be a function of population size, but that this relationship can be non-linear; lichens in grassland can survive a low intensity fire proportionally to pre-fire population size, but experience high mortality rates above a fire intensity threshold. The applications of these results are that fire intensity matters to species response to prescribed fire, and that the persistence of climax lichen communities and biodiversity in the study system needs a broad range of fire intervals.Nomenclature: Esslinger (1997).Abbreviation: CCNHA == Cedar Creek Natural History Area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCladonia 3abiodiversity 3afire intensity 3agrassland soils 3agrasslands 3alichens 3amortality 3anatural history 3apopulation size 3aprescribed burning 3astreams 3aweather 3aMinnesota 0aDiploschistes 0aDisturbance threshold 0aExtinction risk 0aLife history 0aOld field 0aPeltigera 0aPrescribed fire1 aReich Peter, B.0 tApplied vegetation science.g2005 Nov., v. 8, no. 2 p.193-198dOpulus Pressx1402-20017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1654-109X.2005.tb00645.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02488naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245014100157300002000298520119200318592002801510650001501538650001201553650001601565650001601581650001201597650001401609650002501623650001801648650001901666650001901685650001501704650001501719650001101734650002101745650002601766700001601792700001801808700002001826773012501846856007401971852000902045655001202054IND60666741420221122162651.0190919e20140922xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066674142DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra06632d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Shoufang10aMolecularly imprinted TiO₂ hybridized magnetic Fe₃O₄ nanoparticles for selective photocatalytic degradation and removal of estrone  ap. 45266-45274.  aAs a widely used photocatalyst, titania (TiO₂) enjoys significant advantages; however, it faces the severe challenge of poor selectivity. And interestingly, molecular imprinting gains great popularity, owing to its desired recognition specificity. Herein, by using estrone as a template molecule, we prepared molecularly imprinted TiO₂ hybridized magnetic ferroferric oxide (Fe₃O₄) nanoparticles through a semi-covalent approach by a liquid phase deposition method, for selective photocatalytic degradation and removal of target estrone with the irradiation of UV light. The obtained Fe₃O₄@SiO₂@imprinted TiO₂ displayed high adsorption capacity, fast kinetics and high selectivity. In the presence of 10 times of coexisting nontarget compounds, the apparent rate constant, kₐₚₚ, for photodegradation of target estrone over the hybridized nanoparticles, was about 6 times of that over net TiO₂. Also, excellent stability during long-time photocatalysis was exhibited. More importantly, the Fe₃O₄@imprinted TiO₂ provided potential application prospectives for photocatalytic removal of trace target organic pollutants in the presence of high-level pollutants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aestrone 3airon oxides 3airradiation 3aliquids 3amagnetism 3amolecular imprinting 3ananoparticles 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aphotolysis 3apollutants 3asilica 3atitanium dioxide 3aultraviolet radiation1 aLu, Hongzhi1 aChen, Lingxin1 aWang, Xiaochuan0 tRSC advances.g2014 Sept. 22, v. 4, no. 85 p.45266-45274dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra06632d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03741naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245011200158520231500270592002802585650001802613650002002631650002502651650003202676650001402708650002902722650001302751650002202764650002002786650001102806650002102817650001402838650002202852650001902874650001502893650001902908650002202927650001602949650001102965651001002976700001802986700001703004700002603021773012903047856007403176852000903250655001203259IND60660540320221119081929.0190823e20190819xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066054032DNAL7 a10.3390/rs111619392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Zihao 10aSpatial Variation of NO<sub>2</sub> and Its Impact Factors in China: An Application of Sentinel-5P Products  aAs an important tropospheric trace gas and precursor of photochemical smog, the accumulation of NO<inf>2</inf> will cause serious air pollution. China, as the largest developing country in the world, has experienced a large amount of NO<inf>2</inf> emissions in recent decades due to the rapid economic growth. Compared with the traditional air pollution monitoring technology, the rapid development of the remote sensing monitoring method of atmospheric satellite has gradually become the critical technical means of global atmospheric environmental monitoring. To reveal the NO<inf>2</inf> pollution situation in China, based on the latest NO<inf>2</inf> products from Sentinel-5P TROPOMI, the spatial&ndash;temporal characteristics and impact factors of troposphere NO<inf>2</inf> column concentration of mainland China in the past year (February 2018 to January 2019) were analyzed on two administrative levels for the first time. Results show that the monthly fluctuation of tropospheric NO<inf>2</inf> column concentration has obvious characteristics of &ldquo;high in winter and low in summer&rdquo;, while the spatial distribution forms a &ldquo;high in East and low in west&rdquo; pattern, bounded by Hu Line. The comparison of Coefficient of Variation (CV) and spatial autocorrelation models at two kinds of administrative scales indicates that although the spatial heterogeneity of NO<inf>2</inf> column concentration is less affected by the observed scale, there is a &ldquo;delayed effect&rdquo; of about one month in the process of NO<inf>2</inf> column concentration fluctuation. Besides, the impact factors analysis based on Spatial Lag Model (SLM) and Geographic Weighted Regression (GWR) reveals that there is a positive correlation between nighttime light intensity, the secondary and tertiary industries proportion and NO<inf>2</inf> column concentration. Furthermore, for regions with serious NO<inf>2</inf> pollution in North China Plain, the whole society electricity consumption and vehicle ownership also play a positive role in increasing the NO<inf>2</inf> column concentration. This study will enlighten the government and policy makers to formulate policies tailored to local conditions, to more effectively implement NO<inf>2</inf> emission reduction and air pollution prevention.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3aautocorrelation 3adeveloping countries 3aelectric energy consumption 3aemissions 3aenvironmental monitoring 3aindustry 3aissues and policy 3alight intensity 3amodels 3anitrogen dioxide 3aownership 3apollution control 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3asmog pollution 3aspatial variation 3atroposphere 3awinter 3aChina1 aYang, Zhiwei 1 aWu, Zhifeng 1 aMarinello, Francesco 0 tRemote Sensing.g2019 Aug. 19, v. 11, no. 16dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs111619393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02935naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245016500172300001400337520152100351592002801872650001101900650002501911650001101936650001701947650000901964650004801973650001502021650001102036650001102047651001002058653001902068653001702087653000902104653001502113653001302128653000802141700002202149700001502171700002002186700002102206700001702227700001402244773010202258856008402360852000902444655001202453IND60606286420221121013123.0180725e20160315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060628642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sedgeo.2015.12.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPe-Piper, Georgia10aQuaternary evolution of the rivers of northeast Hainan Island, China: Tracking the history of avulsion from mineralogy and geochemistry of river and delta sands  ap. 84-99.  aThe mineralogy and geochemistry of sands were investigated in the Nandu and Wanquan rivers, Hainan Island, China, to determine the history of avulsion in the lower reaches of the Nandu River. The study also provided the opportunity to assess the utility of geochemical analysis of sands as a provenance tool. Much of the heavy mineral fraction in the rivers consists of subangular Fe-Ti oxide and Fe-(hydr)oxide minerals, and less stable minerals such as amphibole, epidote, and andalusite, whereas rounded resistant ilmenite, rutile, tourmaline and zircon predominate on the deltaic coast. Mineral assemblage and chemical composition of individual samples are related to specific source areas and river tributaries. The results demonstrate northwestwards flow of the Nandu River during the mid-Holocene and earlier avulsion of the river to the northeast coast, probably during a Late Pleistocene marine highstand. Minor basement tilting, producing little relief, was sufficient to divert the lower reaches of rivers, and this effect was enhanced where basalt flows dammed former river courses. Bulk sample REE geochemistry is largely controlled by the relative abundance of monazite, allanite, titanite, zircon and epidote, derived principally from granites. Detrital geochemistry alone shows too much variability to interpret provenance. However, a smaller number of heavy mineral analyses provide an understanding of the mineralogical origins of geochemical variation, thus enabling interpretations of provenance.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasalt 3achemical composition 3acoasts 3ageochemistry 3airon 3aoxide, hydroxide, and oxyhydroxide minerals 3aprovenance 3arivers 3azircon 3aChina 0aHeavy minerals 0aGeochemistry 0aSand 0aProvenance 0aAvulsion 0aREE1 aPiper, David J.W.1 aWang, Ying1 aZhang, Yongzhan1 aTrottier, Corwin1 aGe, Chendong1 aYin, Yong0 tSedimentary geology.g2016 Mar. 15, v. 333 p.84-99dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11737x0037-07387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sedgeo.2015.12.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02322naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245017500167300001400342506002800356520090100384592002801285506003701313650001201350650001001362650001401372650001001386650001601396650001001412650001401422651000901436653001001445653001401455653002701469653001301496700003201509700001901541700002301560700002701583773018701610856008201797852000901879655001201888IND60785578320221207101355.0191216e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078557832DNAL7 a10.18348/opzool.2019.1.232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBálint,  Zsolt10aNotes on the identity of the male paralectotype of Thecla heodes and description of a new species: Strymon cryptodes sp. nov. from northern Peru (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae)  ap. 23-29.  aResource is Open Access  aA new species, Strymon cryptodes sp. nov. is described from puna grasslands of northern Peru. Its phenotype corresponds with the male paralectotype of a congeneric species originally described as Thecla heodes Druce, 1909, which, in consequence, turns out to be a mixture of two biological species. Males of S. heodes have conspicuous scent patches, absent in S. cryptodes sp. nov. The new species is known from four individuals recently collected in the vicinity of the city of Cajamarca and two historical specimens from other localities in the department of Cajamarca. Based on wing colour patterns and other morphological characters S. cryptodes sp. nov. is placed in the Strymon istapa species-group defined by Robbins & Nicolay (2002), although the presence or absence of male androconial patch and genitalia brush organ are demonstrated not to be a valid diagnostic infrageneric character.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aStrymon 3acolor 3agenitalia 3amales 3anew species 3aodors 3aphenotype 3aPeru 0aandes 0acajamarca 0amale androconial patch 0asyntype.1 aCerdeña Gutiérrez,, José1 aBoyer, Pierre,1 aFlorczyk,  Klaudia1 aPyrcz, Tomasz Wilhelm,0 tOpuscula zoologica Instituti Zoosystematici et Oecologici Universitatis Budapestinensis.g2019 Mar., v. 50, no. 1 p.23-29dEötvös Loránd UniversitywJournal:28187x2063-15887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.18348/opzool.2019.1.233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02597naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002800139245012800167300002000295520135000315592002801665650002401693650002001717650002201737650000901759650001301768650003001781650001801811650001001829650001501839650003301854650001901887650001101906650001201917651001101929651001601940700002001956773012701976856007502103852000902178655001202187IND60535751520221122222034.0160805e20141202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053575152DNAL7 a10.1021/es505175u2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Dabbous, Abdullah
N.10aNumber and Size Distribution of Airborne Nanoparticles during Summertime in Kuwait: First Observations from the Middle East  ap. 13634-13643.  aWe made fast response measurements of size-resolved particle number concentrations (PNCs) and distributions (PNDs) in the 5–1000 nm range close to a busy roadside, continuously for 31 days, in Kuwait. The aims were to understand their dispersion characteristics during summertime and dust events, and association with trace pollutants (NOₓ, O₃, CO, SO₂, and PM₁₀) and meteorological parameters. PNCs were found up to ∼19-times higher (5.98 × 10⁵ cm–³) than those typically found in European roadside environments. Size distributions exhibited over 90% of PNCs in ultrafine size range (<100 nm) and a negligible fraction over 300 nm. Peak PNDs appeared at ∼12 nm, showing an unusually large peak in nucleation mode. Diurnal variations of PNCs coincided with the cyclic variations in CO, NOₓ, and traffic volume during morning and evening rush hours. Despite high traffic volume, PNC peaks were missing during noon hours due to high ambient temperature (∼48 °C) that showed an inverse relationship with the PNCs. Principal Component Analysis revealed three probable sources in the arealocal road traffic, fugitive dust, and refineries. Dust events, categorized by PM₁₀ with over 1000 μg m–³, decreased PNCs by ∼25% and increased their geometric mean diameters (GMDs) by ∼66% compared with nondust periods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acarbon monoxide 3adiurnal variation 3adust 3ageometry 3ameteorological parameters 3ananoparticles 3aozone 3apollutants 3aprincipal component analysis 3asulfur dioxide 3asummer 3atraffic 3aKuwait 3aMiddle East1 aKumar, Prashant0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2014 Dec. 02, v. 48, no. 23 p.13634-13643dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes505175u3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03223naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001400188245014300202300001200345506007600357520147100433592002801904506003701932650002201969650001801991650001602009650001702025650002002042650002102062650001802083650001602101650001502117650001302132650001502145650001302160650001902173650000902192650001302201700001702214700001502231700001402246700001302260700001602273700001902289700001602308700001502324700001702339700001402356700001502370700002002385700002002405773010602425856008102531852000902612655001202621IND60664394020221207084615.0190910e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066439402DNAL7 a10.1186/s12896-015-0224-y2doi7 aPMC46606692pmcid7 a266106012pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQian, Yan12aA novel quantification method for the total demethylation potential of aquatic sample extracts from Bohai Bay using the EGFP reporter gene  ap. 107.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The demethylation potential of environmental pollutants is possibly an innate part of their comprehensive health risk. This paper develops a novel method called TDQ to quantify the demethylation epigenetic toxicity, termed the 5-AZA-CdR demethylation toxic equivalency, of aquatic samples from the heavily polluted Bohai Bay using Hep G2 cell lines transiently transfected with the pEGFP-C3 plasmid containing a methylated promoter of the EGFP reporter gene inserted artificially in vitro. RESULTS: If the aquatic sample extract has strong total demethylation potential to the promoter, its methylation level will decrease, and increased green fluorescence will be observed under microscopy after TDQ co-incubation. The 5-AZA-CdR was selected as a representative demethylation agent to validate the principle of the TDQ method on three levels: significant dose–response relationships between the concentration of 5-AZA-CdR and the methylation level of promoters, mRNA expression level of the EGFP gene, and the fluorescence intensity of EGFP proteins. Twenty extracts from aquatic samples are successfully quantified with the TDQ test. Eight of them return meaningful results ranging from 0.00004 to 0.20053 μM 5-AZA-CdR toxicity equivalents. CONCLUSIONS: The TDQ method is a reliable and rapid assay for the quantification of the DNA demethylation potential of aquatic sample extracts, which may shed light on the safety evaluation of food material.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA demethylation 3adose response 3aepigenetics 3afluorescence 3agene expression 3ahuman cell lines 3amessenger RNA 3amethylation 3amicroscopy 3aplasmids 3apollutants 3aproteins 3areporter genes 3arisk 3atoxicity1 aWang, Xiaoli1 aLv, Zhanlu1 aGuo, Chen1 aHan, Mei1 aWu, Jiabing1 aYang, Yongjian1 aYang, Yishu1 aJiang, Yan1 aWei, Yongjie1 aNie, Jing1 aLiang, Bao1 aZhang, Jinliang1 aWang, Xianliang0 tBMC biotechnology.g2015 Dec., v. 15, no. 1 p.107-107dBioMed CentralwJournal:19124x1472-67507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12896-015-0224-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03041naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006100147245012700208300001400335520143500349592002801784650001401812650001001826650001801836650001501854650001101869650002001880650001801900650001901918650001301937650002601950650001901976650000901995650002302004650002202027650002102049650002102070650001502091653001702106653002302123653001902146653001202165653001602177653002102193653000902214653003002223653001802253653001802271653001102289773009702300856008102397852000902478655001202487IND60531364920221123012900.0160723e20160615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053136492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2016.03.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalker, Kendra L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0307-550510aSeasonal mixing in forest-cover maps for humid tropics and impact of fluctuations in spectral properties of low vegetation  ap. 79-88.  aWith advances in satellite data, computer storage capacities and processing technologies, it is increasingly feasible to map forest cover over large areas at high spatial resolutions that are relevant for most decision-makers. For outputs to be informative, however, they must be accurate. The finer spatial resolution of recent large-scale forest products comes at a cost of lower temporal resolution. With few input images available for a given year, appropriate image selection in the creation of forest cover and forest-cover change maps is critical. This work highlights the need for more careful consideration of seasonality in mapping forest cover in the tropics. While most studies of seasonality on forest mapping focus on deciduousness and potential errors of omission, this study highlights seasonal fluctuations in non-forested vegetation and likely errors of comission. Vegetation indices provided good separability between tropical forests and low vegetation including commercial crops, pasture and young fallow, in the dry season, but not in the wet season. Forest-cover maps and change analyses that combine wet- and dry-season images without accounting for seasonality risk overestimating initial forest cover and subsequent deforestation. Likewise, analyses that do not distinguish between truly aseasonal wet equatorial regions and seasonal regions of the tropics risk overestimating forest cover in the former.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputers 3acrops 3adeforestation 3adry season 3afallow 3aforest products 3ahumid tropics 3aimage analysis 3apastures 3aprocessing technology 3aremote sensing 3arisk 3aseasonal variation 3aspectral analysis 3atropical forests 3avegetation index 3awet season 0aForest cover 0aLand-cover mapping 0aLow vegetation 0aLandsat 0aSeasonality 0aSpectral indices 0aNDVI 0aAccumulated Wetness index 0aSoil moisture 0aHumid tropics 0aPanama0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2016 June 15, v. 179 p.79-88dElsevier Inc.x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2016.03.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02708naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245011000162300002000272520146800292592002801760650001101788650001901799650002501818650001401843650002401857650002401881650001101905650004401916650002201960700001401982700001301996700002302009700002502032700002102057700002102078773012702099856007502226852000902301655001202310IND60535751620221122222047.0160805e20141216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053575162DNAL7 a10.1021/es504047t2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiammar, Daniel E.10aImpacts of Diffusive Transport on Carbonate Mineral Formation from Magnesium Silicate-CO2-Water Reactions  ap. 14344-14351.  aReactions of CO₂ with magnesium silicate minerals to precipitate magnesium carbonates can result in stable carbon sequestration. This process can be employed in ex situ reactors or during geologic carbon sequestration in magnesium-rich formations. The reaction of aqueous CO₂ with the magnesium silicate mineral forsterite was studied in systems with transport controlled by diffusion. The approach integrated bench-scale experiments, an in situ spectroscopic technique, and reactive transport modeling. Experiments were performed using a tube packed with forsterite and open at one end to a CO₂-rich solution. The location and amounts of carbonate minerals that formed were determined by postexperiment characterization of the solids. Complementing this ex situ characterization, ¹³C NMR spectroscopy tracked the inorganic carbon transport and speciation in situ. The data were compared with the output of reactive transport simulations that accounted for diffusive transport processes, aqueous speciation, and the forsterite dissolution rate. All three approaches found that the onset of magnesium carbonate precipitation was spatially localized about 1 cm from the opening of the forsterite bed. Magnesite was the dominant reaction product. Geochemical gradients that developed in the diffusion-limited zones led to locally supersaturated conditions at specific locations even while the volume-averaged properties of the system remained undersaturated.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3amagnesite 3amagnesium carbonate 3amagnesium silicates 3amodels 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asilicate minerals1 aWang, Fei1 aGuo, Bin1 aSurface, J.

One such impact is the entrainment of fish at pump offtakes that can result in vast quantities of fish being permanently removed from rivers. Exclusion screens to prevent fish entrainment at pump offtakes are therefore an important management consideration. In this study, impingement and subsequent injury and mortality of a juvenile freshwater perciform, Golden Perch (Macquaria ambigua), was assessed in the laboratory using a simulated fish exclusion screen under a range of velocities and impingement durations. A 2 mm wedge‐wire screen eliminated the entrainment of 44‐day‐old Golden Perch that were exposed to approach velocities between 0.05 and 0.3 m/s. However, impingement rates of Golden Perch increased significantly with increased approach velocities and rates of injury and mortality increased with impingement duration. Results from this study indicate the primary mechanisms to reduce fish loss at pump offtakes are to design pump offtakes, fitted with fish exclusion screens, which limit approach velocities or impingement duration. Further studies are required to examine a range of species with varying swimming ability at early life‐history stages. Such data will contribute to the growing body of knowledge that supports adaptive management plans to prevent fish loss at water offtake pumps.  aPublisher supplied data  cOrange City Council 3aMacquaria ambigua 3aadaptive management 3aadministrative management 3aaquatic ecosystems 3aenvironmental health 3afish 3afreshwater 3ajuveniles 3alife history 3amortality 3arivers1 aWalsh, Chris T.1 aRodgers, Michael P.1 aBoys, Craig A.0 tEcological management & restoration.g2019 May, v. 20, no. 2 p.136-141dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867073x1442-70017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/emr.123473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03162naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245013500166300001800301520181600319592002802135650001902163650001402182650002602196650001602222650001502238650002502253650001202278650001302290650002002303650002202323653003402345653003402379653003502413653001802448653004902466653001502515773012802530856008502658852000902743655001202752IND60677711620221122145751.0191213e20191202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067771162DNAL7 a10.1080/19440049.2019.16624942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrob, Koni14aThe role of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in a better European regulation of food contact materials – some proposals  ap. 1895-1902.  aFor most substances migrating from food contact materials (FCMs) to food, the producers have to perform the safety assessment as self-control, since only a minor part has been officially evaluated and listed. This implies that the main official control of the safety assessment is by the national control authorities. The present EU legislation requires this, but in its structure, it still reflects the concept of providing specific and detailed regulation for all FCMs. Over the last about 40 years, only a few types of FCMs were covered by specific regulation and even these only partially; the reaction products and impurities (usually the majority of the migrants) were hardly addressed at all. Taking this into account, the focus of the regulation should shift towards implementing and supporting self-assessment by the producers and harmonised control by the control authorities. This also affects the role of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA): presently its main mandate is to evaluate new monomers and additives for plastics to support their authorisation (roughly 10 substances per year) – a niche job when considering the field in its entirety. Since risk assessment and the specification of the requirements to ensure safety are in the remit of EFSA, EFSA should play a key role also in the control of the FCMs on the market. It should be mandated to provide guidelines on safety assessment with requirements that can realistically be implemented (eased where possible), support control authorities in the evaluation of difficult cases and arbitration in cases of disagreement. If private bodies are engaged to approve materials on request of producers in order to be listed, expected to be the most powerful trigger for implementing compliance work, these would have to be closely guided.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aadditives 3afood contact surfaces 3afood safety 3aguidelines 3alaws and regulations 3amarkets 3aplastics 3arisk assessment 3asafety assessment 0aGuidance on safety assessment 0asafety assessment by industry 0asupport of control authorities 0adocumentation 0alisting of approved substances and materials 0awork plans0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2019 Dec. 2, v. 36, no. 12 p.1895-1902dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl35737x1944-00577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19440049.2019.16624943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03492naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245011500207300001600322520184500338592002802183650004402211650002202255650001502277650001502292650001102307650001902318650001802337650001102355650001802366650001302384650002102397650001702418650003302435650001102468650002302479650001702502650001602519650002202535650002102557650001402578650003702592653001102629653001602640653001502656653001902671653001302690700002102703700002202724773010202746856008102848852000902929655001202938IND60547168220221121102434.0160903e20150601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054716822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jes.2014.12.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoel, Chitrakshi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1213-484510aMesoporous carbon adsorbents from melamine–formaldehyde resin using nanocasting technique for CO2 adsorption  ap. 238-248.  aMesoporous carbon adsorbents, having high nitrogen content, were synthesized via nanocasting technique with melamine–formaldehyde resin as precursor and mesoporous silica as template. A series of adsorbents were prepared by varying the carbonization temperature from 400 to 700°C. Adsorbents were characterized thoroughly by nitrogen sorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), elemental (CHN) analysis, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and Boehm titration. Carbonization temperature controlled the properties of the synthesized adsorbents ranging from surface area to their nitrogen content, which play major role in their application as adsorbents for CO2 capture. The nanostructure of these materials was confirmed by XRD and TEM. Their nitrogen content decreased with an increase in carbonization temperature while other properties like surface area, pore volume, thermal stability and surface basicity increased with the carbonization temperature. These materials were evaluated for CO2 adsorption by fixed-bed column adsorption experiments. Adsorbent synthesized at 700°C was found to have the highest surface area and surface basicity along with maximum CO2 adsorption capacity among the synthesized adsorbents. Breakthrough time and CO2 equilibrium adsorption capacity were investigated from the breakthrough curves and were found to decrease with increase in adsorption temperature. Adsorption process for carbon adsorbent–CO2 system was found to be reversible with stable adsorption capacity over four consecutive adsorption–desorption cycles. From three isotherm models used to analyze the equilibrium data, Temkin isotherm model presented a nearly perfect fit implying the heterogeneous adsorbent surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbonization 3amodels 3ananomaterials 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aporous media 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilica 3asorption isotherms 3asurface area 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry 3atitration 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aCarbon 0aNanocasting 0aMesoporous 0aCO2 adsorption 0aIsotherm1 aBhunia, Haripada1 aBajpai, Pramod K.0 tJournal of Environmental Sciences.g2015 June 01, v. 32 p.238-248dElsevier B.V.x1001-07427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2014.12.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02434naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002300153245011400176300001900290520140400309592002801713650001701741650001501758650001401773650001001787650000901797650001301806650001301819650001201832700002601844700002201870773010601892856008901998852000902087655001202096IND60559456920221118054154.0161216e20161215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055945692DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.6b023862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRashwan, Sherif

The current work is a review that addresses the stability, approaches, and emission control of premixed flames in different applications. The study addresses the recent developments made to overcome the combustor operability issues, including flame stability and emission control. The influences of oxidizer and fuel flexibility using oxy-fuel combustion and hydrogen enrichment on combustion efficiency and flame stability are investigated. Furthermore, the influences of operating and combustor design conditions on flame characteristics are discussed. Recent developments in swirl-stabilized combustor are analyzed and summarized. The effect of premixing on emissions is investigated, considering a variety of design and operating conditions in different applications. As per this survey, the application of fully premixed combustion in the industrial area is even so defined; all the same, promising designs are under development. The challenges regarding the application of the premixed combustion technology in the industrial field are discussed. The role of numerical CFD techniques to predict the reacting flow field and heat release in premixed combustion mode is addressed.

Shahriyar reservoir is a dam with a total capacity of 700 million cubic meters (MCM) and a dead volume of 360 MCM. In case of with sedimentation compared with without sedimentation, results showed an annual average increase of 4, 4.3, and 8.7% in TDS of outflow for normal, wet, and dry periods, respectively. There is no significant change in TDS profile of the reservoir in both conditions. According to the average outflow TDS of 1448, 1301, and 1555 mg/L compared with the average inflow TDS of 1714, 1520, and 1835 in normal, wet, and dry conditions, respectively, the effect of dam on inflow TDS adjustment can be also observed. With the mentioned outflow TDS, there is no limitation to use of reservoir water for agricultural purposes based on FAO irrigation guidelines for both scenarios.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFood and Agriculture Organization 3acase studies 3acomputer software 3aguidelines 3airrigation 3atotal dissolved solids 3awater quality 3aIran1 aMotiey Nejad, O.0 tInternational journal of environmental science and technology.g2017 Dec., v. 14, no. 12 p.2623-2636dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1735-14727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13762-017-1317-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02342naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245008000158520133200238592002801570650002801598650001901626650002401645650002001669650001901689650001501708650002901723700001301752700001801765700002101783773012901804856007401933852000902007655001202016IND60660540520221119081908.0190823e20190820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066054052DNAL7 a10.3390/rs111619422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xinlong 10aPattern Statistics Network for Classification of High-Resolution SAR Images  aThe classification of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is of great importance for rapid scene understanding. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been applied to the classification of single-polarized SAR images. However, it is still difficult due to the random and complex spatial patterns lying in SAR images, especially in the case of finite training data. In this paper, a pattern statistics network (PSNet) is proposed to address this problem. PSNet borrows the idea from the statistics and probability theory and explicitly embeds the random nature of SAR images in the representation learning. In the PSNet, both fluctuation and pattern representations are extracted for SAR images. More specifically, the fluctuation representation does not consider the rigorous relationships between local pixels and only describes the average fluctuation of local pixels. By contrast, the pattern representation is devoted to hierarchically capturing the interactions between local pixels, namely, the spatial patterns of SAR images. The proposed PSNet is evaluated on three real SAR data, including spaceborne and airborne data. The experimental results indicate that the fluctuation representation is useful and PSNet achieves superior performance in comparison with related CNN-based and texture-based methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial intelligence 3aimage analysis 3amathematical theory 3aneural networks 3aremote sensing 3astatistics 3asynthetic aperture radar1 aHe, Chu 1 aXiong, Dehui 1 aLiao, Mingsheng 0 tRemote Sensing.g2019 Aug. 20, v. 11, no. 16dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs111619423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03166naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002300142245017500165300001800340500001900358520169600377592002802073650001702101650001502118650002202133650002302155650001302178650001202191650001402203650002002217650001702237650001502254650001102269700006202280700006002342700005802402700006402460773014702524856007602671852000902747655001202756IND60733912720221122035949.0210414e20210324xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073391272DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.1c010862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatwardhan, Anjali10aNickel–Sulfonate Mode of Substrate Binding for Forward and Reverse Reactions of Methyl-SCoM Reductase Suggest a Radical Mechanism Involving Long-Range Electron Transfer  ap. 5481-5496.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMethyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR) catalyzes both the synthesis and the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). Its catalytic site contains Ni at the core of cofactor F₄₃₀. The Ni ion, in its low-valent Ni(I) state, lights the fuse leading to homolysis of the C–S bond of methyl-coenzyme M (methyl-SCoM) to generate a methyl radical, which abstracts a hydrogen atom from coenzyme B (HSCoB) to generate methane and the mixed disulfide CoMSSCoB. Direct reversal of this reaction activates methane to initiate anaerobic methane oxidation. On the basis of the crystal structures, which reveal a Ni–thiol interaction between Ni(II)–MCR and inhibitor CoMSH, a Ni(I)–thioether complex with substrate methyl-SCoM has been transposed to canonical MCR mechanisms. Similarly, a Ni(I)–disulfide with CoMSSCoB is proposed for the reverse reaction. However, this Ni(I)–sulfur interaction poses a conundrum for the proposed hydrogen-atom abstraction reaction because the >6 Å distance between the thiol group of SCoB and the thiol of SCoM observed in the structures appears to be too long for such a reaction. The spectroscopic, kinetic, structural, and computational studies described here establish that both methyl-SCoM and CoMSSCoB bind to the active Ni(I) state of MCR through their sulfonate groups, forming a hexacoordinate Ni(I)–N/O complex, not Ni(I)–S. These studies rule out direct Ni(I)–sulfur interactions in both substrate-bound states. As a solution to the mechanistic conundrum, we propose that both the forward and the reverse MCR reactions emanate through long-range electron transfer from the Ni(I)–sulfonate complexes with methyl-SCoM and CoMSSCoB, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3adisulfides 3aelectron transfer 3ahomolytic cleavage 3ahydrogen 3amethane 3aoxidation 3aoxidoreductases 3aspectroscopy 3asulfonates 3athiols1 aSarangi, Ritimukta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2764-22791 aGinovska, Bojana1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0165-82021 aRaugei, Simone1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9118-84801 aRagsdale, Stephen W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3938-89060 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2021 Mar. 24, v. 143, no. 14 p.5481-5496dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c010863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02497naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245014200165500002200307520108700329592002801416650002001444650002101464650002401485650002201509650000701531650002201538650001601560650002201576653003001598653002401628653002401652653002501676653001701701653001401718700001501732700001501747700001501762700001301777700001601790700001401806700001601820773009601836856008601932852000902018655001202027IND60567114320221118022821.0170710s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056711432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.04.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNi, Fang10aImprovingthecatalytic properties and stability of immobilized γ-glutamyltranspeptidase by post-immobilization with PharmalyteMT 8∼10.5  aPre-press version  aγ-Glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) is a dimeric protein that specifically catalyzes the transfer of γ-glutamyl in the optimum pH range of 8.5-9.0, but has poor in vitro stability under the alkaline conditions.

In the present study, we assessed hummingbird-plant network metrics at three sites along an altitudinal gradient in the Sierra Madre Occidental corresponding to tropical forest (148 and 289 m a.s.l.), ecotone (1131 and 1423 m a.s.l.) and pine-oak forest (1800 and 2218 m a.s.l.). We evaluated variation in the specialization (d’) of the hummingbird species and their visited plant species across altitude. We determined if hummingbird species inside the modules of the general network were separated by biogeographical origin, migratory behavior, or morphology. We assessed whether the role in the modular partition of hummingbird and plant species in the general network was related to traits of species. Finally, determined which traits were associated with the importance of different species within the network. We recorded 1050 interactions between 20 species of hummingbirds and 64 species of plants. We found that network metrics in the ecotone differed from other sites, reflecting the convergence between temperate and tropical forest flora and the midpoint in hummingbirds' altitudinal migration. As in previous studies, we found that hummingbird specialization was related to the bill length and found that the migratory status, particularly the altitudinal migratory species, was associated with the hummingbird specialization. The abundance of hummingbird species and flowers (ornithophilous and non-ornithophilous) along the gradient plays a central role in the importance within the network and in the formation of the modules.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3abird pollination 3aecotones 3aflora 3ageographical distribution 3ahummingbirds 3amigratory behavior 3amigratory species 3atropical forests 3aMexico 0aAltitudinal gradient 0aBiotic interactions 0aHummingbird migration 0aOrnithophilous 0aSierra Madre Occidental1 aArenas-Navarro, Maribel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3540-80411 aVilla-Galaviz, Edith1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2783-78771 aDíaz-Infante, Sergio1 aCoro Arizmendi, Ma. delq(María),0 tActa oecologica.g2021 Oct., v. 112 p.103762-dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:2127x1146-609X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actao.2021.1037623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02885naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245010400163300001400267500001500281520129100296592002801587650002301615650001401638650001001652650001801662650002501680650002101705650001401726650001801740650003201758650001901790650001301809650002301822650002401845650003701869651002101906653001501927653001601942653003801958653001401996653001702010653002902027653002902056700001702085700001702102700001902119700001902138773009602157856008102253852000902334655001202343IND60606309120221120215422.0180725e20160215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060630912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2016.01.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Na-Rae10aImprovement of depressive behavior by Sweetme Sweet Pumpkin™ and its active compound, β-carotene  ap. 39-45.  a2019-12-06  aSweetme Sweet Pumpkin™ (SSP, baked Cucurbita moschata Duch.) has been used to treat patients with depression in Korea. However, the role of SSP in improving depression has not been elucidated yet. Thus, we assessed the antidepressant-like effect of SSP and its active compound, β-carotene, with the forced swimming test (FST).SSP and β-carotene were orally administered once a day for 28days. The levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK), and estrogen receptor-beta (ER-β) were analyzed by Western blotting and quantitative real-time-polymerase chain reaction.After 28days, treatment with SSP and β-carotene significantly decreased the immobility time during the FST. SSP significantly increased the levels of serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain. The levels of BDNF, pERK, and ER-β were significantly increased in the SSP- and β-carotene-administered groups compared with the control group. In addition, the groups treated with SSP and β-carotene showed significantly reduced levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 compared with the control group.In conclusion, these findings suggest the potential of SSP and β-carotene as a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of depression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCucurbita moschata 3aserotonin 3abrain 3ainterleukin-6 3aforced swimming test 3aWestern blotting 3aestrogens 3abeta-carotene 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3anorepinephrine 3apatients 3aactive ingredients 3aoral administration 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aKorean Peninsula 0aDepression 0aβ-carotene 0aBrain-derived neurotrophic factor 0aSerotonin 0atherapeutics 0aCucurbita moschata Duch. 0aSweetme Sweet Pumpkin™1 aKim, Hee-Yun1 aKim, Min-ho,1 aKim, Hyung-Min1 aJeong, Hyun-Ja0 tLife sciences.g2016 Feb. 15, v. 147 p.39-45dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2016.01.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02723naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245014100168300001600309520122600325592002801551650003601579650002501615650001501640650003201655650001101687650002201698650002301720650001701743650001001760650001301770650002201783650001201805651000901817700002001826700002001846700002401866700002201890700001701912700001601929700005601945773017102001856008402172852000902256655001202265IND60638238420221117235726.0190426e20190319xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063823842DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jnatprod.8b004352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCho, Hyo-Moon10aPrenylated Phenolic Compounds from the Leaves of Sabia limoniacea and Their Antiviral Activities against Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus  ap. 702-713.  aPorcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a serious swine epidemic, has been rampant in Asia since the 1990s. Despite the widespread use of PEDV vaccines, the occurrence of PEDV variants requires the discovery of new substances that inhibit these viruses. During a search for PEDV inhibitory materials from natural sources, seven new sabphenosides (1–7) and a new flavonoid (8), as well as eight known phenolic compounds (9–16), were obtained from the leaves of Sabia limoniacea. The structural determination of the new phenolic derivatives (1–8) was accomplished using comprehensive spectroscopic methods. Their absolute configurations were assigned by a combination of the ECD exciton chirality method following selective reduction and calculation of their ECD spectra. The bioactivities of the isolated compounds were measured based on their abilities to inhibit viral replication of PEDV. Among the test compounds, 15 and 16 exhibited the most promising antiviral activities, with IC₅₀ values of 7.5 ± 0.7 μM and 8.0 ± 2.5 μM against PEDV replication. This study suggests that compounds 15 and 16 could serve as new scaffolds for the treatment of PEDV infection through the inhibition of PEDV replication.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPorcine epidemic diarrhea virus 3aantiviral properties 3aflavonoids 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aleaves 3aoptical isomerism 3aphenolic compounds 3aspectroscopy 3aswine 3avaccines 3avirus replication 3aviruses 3aAsia1 aHa, Thi-Kim-Quy1 aDang, Lan-Huong1 aPham, Ha-Thanh-Tung1 aTrần, Văn Ơn,1 aHuh, Jungmoo1 aAn, Jin-Pyo1 aOh, Won-Keun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0761-30640 tJournal of natural products.g2019 Mar. 19, v. 82, no. 4 p.702-713dAmerican Chemical Society and American Society of PharmacognosywJournal:jnl11422x1520-60257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jnatprod.8b004353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02456naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245009200160300001800252520138100270592002801651650001501679650002201694650001301716650001701729650002601746650001501772650000901787650001401796650003101810700001801841700001901859700002101878773011101899856007502010852000902085655001202094IND60529850320170413000000.0160720e20141007xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052985032DNAL7 a10.1021/ac50150292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchädle, Thomas10aFingerprinting Oils in Water via Their Dissolved VOC Pattern Using Mid-Infrared Sensors  ap. 9512-9517.  aAn infrared attenuated total reflection (IR-ATR) method for detecting, differentiating, and quantifying hydrocarbons dissolved in water relevant for oil spills by evaluating the “fingerprint” of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) associated with individual oil types in the mid-infrared spectral range (i.e., 800–600 cm–¹) is presented. In this spectral regime, these hydrocarbons provide distinctive absorption features, which may be used to identify specific hydrocarbon patterns that are characteristic for different crude and refined oils. For analyzing the “VOC fingerprint” resulting from various oil samples, aqueous solutions containing the dissolved hydrocarbons from different crude oils (i.e., types “Barrow”, “Goodwyn”, and “Saladin”) and refined oils (i.e., “Petrol” and “Diesel”) were analyzed using a ZnSe ATR waveguide as the optical sensing element. To minimize interferences from the surrounding water matrix and for amplifying the VOC signatures by enrichment, a thin layer of poly(ethylene-co-propylene) was coated onto the ATR waveguide surface, thereby enabling the establishment of suitable calibration functions for the quantification of characteristic concentration patterns of the detected VOCs. Multivariate data analysis was then used for a prelininary classification of various oil-types via their VOC patterns.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3agasoline 3ahydrocarbons 3amultivariate analysis 3aoil spills 3aoils 3apetroleum 3avolatile organic compounds1 aPejcic, Bobby1 aMyers, Matthew1 aMizaikoff, Boris0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2014 Oct. 07, v. 86, no. 19 p.9512-9517dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac50150293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02936naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245014100155300002000296520171000316592002802026650001902054650001802073650002202091650002602113650001302139650001002152650001402162650001602176650001602192700001302208700001702221700002102238700001402259700001502273700001702288700001302305773012502318856007402443852000902517655001202526IND60666741720221122195526.0190919e20140916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066674172DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra06638c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Wang14aThe improvement of thin film barrier performances of organic–inorganic hybrid nanolaminates employing a low-temperature MLD/ALD method  ap. 43850-43856.  aThe investigations reported in this study were carried out to determine the feasibility and properties of alucone/Al₂O₃ hybrid nanolaminate films for thin film encapsulation (TFE) at low temperature, using an integrated molecular layer deposition (MLD) and atomic layer deposition (ALD) process. The combination of alucone (MLD) and Al₂O₃ (ALD), with O₃ serving as the oxidant in place of conventional H₂O, has been evaluated experimentally. In our studies, O₃-based encapsulation layers were observed to be smoother, displaying an average roughness of 0.342 ± 0.016 nm with three laminate layers. However, H₂O-based laminates showed a much higher roughness of 0.843 ± 0.024 nm under identical conditions. Estimates of water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) yielded significantly better results for O₃-based laminates, with values decreasing linearly from 3.22 × 10⁻³ g m⁻² per day to 2.37 × 10⁻⁵ g m⁻² per day as the number of laminate layers increased from one to three, while a gentle decline trend from 1.83 × 10⁻³ g m⁻² per day to 5.92 × 10⁻⁴ g m⁻² per day was obtained for the H₂O-based laminate. This indicates that the hybrid nanolaminates exhibited improved water barrier properties when O₃ was used as the oxidant instead of H₂O. In particular, the O₃-based films did not decrease the performance of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). In fact, the lifetime of OLEDs with O₃-based encapsulation was approximately two-fold longer than the H₂O-based encapsulation. Thus, we believe that the alucone/Al₂O₃ hybrid encapsulation film, in which O₃ serves as the oxidant, is a promising candidate for use in future OLED applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3aencapsulation 3afilms (materials) 3alight emitting diodes 3aoxidants 3aozone 3aroughness 3atemperature 3awater vapor1 aYu, Duan1 aBo, Sun Feng1 aQiang, Yang Yong1 aDan, Yang1 aPing, Chen1 aHui, Duan Ya1 aYi, Zhao0 tRSC advances.g2014 Sept. 16, v. 4, no. 83 p.43850-43856dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra06638c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02019naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245013300159300001800292500001900310520098400329592002801313650002001341650002301361650001701384650001401401700001701415700005301432773014701485856007601632852000901708655001201717IND60733912820221122031218.0210414e20210401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073391282DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.1c011062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Jiefeng10aCatalytic Enantioselective Dehydrogenative Si–O Coupling to Access Chiroptical Silicon-Stereogenic Siloxanes and Alkoxysilanes  ap. 5301-5307.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA rhodium-catalyzed enantioselective construction of triorgano-substituted silicon-stereogenic siloxanes and alkoxysilanes is developed.

Further utility of this process was illustrated by the construction of CPL-active (circularly polarized luminescence) silicon-stereogenic alkoxysilane small organic molecules. Optically pure bis-alkoxysilane containing two silicon-stereogenic centers and three pyrene groups displayed a remarkable gₗᵤₘ value with a high fluorescence quantum efficiency (gₗᵤₘ = 0.011, ΦF = 0.55), which could have great potential application prospects in chiral organic optoelectronic materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3adehydrogenation 3aenantioselectivity 3afluorescence 3asiloxanes1 aChen, Shuyou1 aHe, Chuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9983-75260 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2021 Apr. 01, v. 143, no. 14 p.5301-5307dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c011063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04110naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002300171245015900194300001600353520174700369592002802116650001602144650001402160650001402174650001802188650001702206650001202223650001802235650001002253650001302263650001502276650001102291650001602302650001802318650001902336650003202355650004902387650007402436650003302510650002902543650003002572650003302602650001302635650001302648650001502661650004302676650002902719650004102748650001402789650004202803650003202845650002602877650004102903650007502944650006303019650003703082700002703119700002203146700002603168700002003194700002503214773009703239856005503336852000903391655001203400IND4478351320221119082537.0120815e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447835132DNAL7 a223725252pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-313X.2012.04972.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWidhalm, Joshua R.10aPhylloquinone (vitamin K1) biosynthesis in plants: two peroxisomal thioesterases of lactobacillales origin hydrolyze 1,4‐dihydroxy‐2‐naphthoyl‐coa  ap. 205-215.  aIt is not known how plants cleave the thioester bond of 1,4‐dihydroxy‐2‐naphthoyl‐CoA (DHNA‐CoA), a necessary step to form the naphthoquinone ring of phylloquinone (vitamin K1). In fact, only recently has the hydrolysis of DHNA‐CoA been demonstrated to be enzyme driven in vivo, and the cognate thioesterase characterized in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis. With a few exceptions in certain prokaryotic (Sorangium and Opitutus) and eukaryotic (Cyanidium, Cyanidioschyzon and Paulinella) organisms, orthologs of DHNA‐CoA thioesterase are missing outside of the cyanobacterial lineage. In this study, genomic approaches and functional complementation experiments identified two Arabidopsis genes encoding functional DHNA‐CoA thioesterases. The deduced plant proteins display low percentages of identity with cyanobacterial DHNA‐CoA thioesterases, and do not even share the same catalytic motif. GFP‐fusion experiments demonstrated that the Arabidopsis proteins are targeted to peroxisomes, and subcellular fractionations of Arabidopsis leaves confirmed that DHNA‐CoA thioesterase activity occurs in this organelle. In vitro assays with various aromatic and aliphatic acyl‐CoA thioester substrates showed that the recombinant Arabidopsis enzymes preferentially hydrolyze DHNA‐CoA. Cognate T‐DNA knock‐down lines display reduced DHNA‐CoA thioesterase activity and phylloquinone content, establishing in vivo evidence that the Arabidopsis enzymes are involved in phylloquinone biosynthesis. Extraordinarily, structure‐based phylogenies coupled to comparative genomics demonstrate that plant DHNA‐CoA thioesterases originate from a horizontal gene transfer with a bacterial species of the Lactobacillales order.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aCyanidium 3aSorangium 3aSynechocystis 3abiosynthesis 3aenzymes 3agene transfer 3agenes 3agenomics 3ahydrolysis 3aleaves 3aperoxisomes 3aphylloquinone 3aplant proteins 2aAcyl Coenzyme Axmetabolism 2aArabidopsisxcytologyxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aGene Knockout Techniques 2aGene Transfer, Horizontal 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aGenomics 2aGenotype 2aHydrolysis 2aLactobacillalesxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aMutagenesis, Insertional 2aPeroxisomesxenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Leavesxenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteins 2aSubstrate Specificity 2aSynechocystisxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aThiolester Hydrolasesxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aVitamin K 1xanalogs & derivativesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aVitaminsxchemistryxmetabolism.1 aDucluzeau, Anne‐Lise1 aBuller, Nicole E.1 aElowsky, Christian G.1 aOlsen, Laura J.1 aBasset, Gilles J.

The aim of this study therefore, was to evaluate growth and physiological response in two cultivars of the cowpea, irrigated with saline water and subjected to different levels of potassium under sheltered conditions. Seeds of the cultivars, EC 790 and EC 104 were used, which were exposed to increasing levels of salinity, using irrigation water with an electrical conductivity (CEa) of 0.8, 2.2, 3.6 and 5.0 dS m-1, and increasing rates of potassium (K) in the form of KCl (0.5,1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 g KCl per pot). Readings were taken of leaf gas exchange and plant growth (length of main stem, stem diameter and total dry matter) at 47 and 55 days after planting (DAP) respectively. Increases in the salinity of the irrigation water reduced the length of the main stem, the stem diameter and total dry matter in both cultivars. The larger levels of potassium together with the salinity resulted in a depressive effect on the growth of the main stem and on stomatal conductance, compared to the isolated effect of salinity, indicating an enhanced osmotic effect. The existence of an interaction between salinity and potassium is an indication that the optimal level of the nutrient depends on salinity levels in the root zone of the plants, and is important information in the management of crops in saline environments. = A intensidade do estresse causado pela salinidade nas culturas irá depender, principalmente, do nível de tolerância da espécie ou cultivar e das estratégias de manejo utilizadas. Dessa forma, objetivou-se com este trabalho avaliar o crescimento e as respostas fisiológicas de duas cultivares de feijão-caupi, irrigadas com água salina e submetidas a diferentes níveis de potássio, em condições de ambiente protegido. Foram utilizadas sementes das cultivares CE 790 e CE 104, as quais foram submetidas a níveis crescentes de salinidade, utilizando-se água de irrigação com condutividade elétrica (CEa) de 0,8; 2,2; 3,6 e 5,0 dS m-1 e doses crescentes de potássio (K) na forma de KCl (0,5; 1,0; 2,0 e 4,0 g por vaso KCl). Aos 47 e aos 55 dias após o plantio (DAP) foram realizadas leituras das trocas gasosas foliares e de crescimento das plantas (comprimento da haste principal, diâmetro do caule e matéria seca total), respectivamente. O aumento da salinidade da água de irrigação reduziu o comprimento da haste principal, diâmetro do caule e matéria seca total, em ambas as cultivares. As maiores doses de potássio em conjunto com a salinidade proporcionaram efeito depressivo no crescimento da haste principal e na condutância estomática, em comparação ao efeito isolado da salinidade, sendo um indicativo da intensificação dos efeitos osmóticos. A existência de interações entre salinidade e potássio é um indicativo de que a dose ótima desse nutriente depende da salinidade na zona radicular das plantas, sendo uma informação importante para o manejo de cultivos em ambientes salinos.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acowpeas 3acultivars 3aelectrical conductivity 3agas exchange 3airrigation 3airrigation water 3aleaves 3aosmotic pressure 3aphysiological response 3aplant growth 3apotassium 3arhizosphere 3asaline water 3asalinity 3astomatal conductance 0aPotassium fertilisation 0aSalt stress 0aVigna unguiculata1 aLacerda, Claudivan Feitosa de1 aBarbosa, Francisca Edineide Lima1 aAmorim, Aiala Vieria1 a Isabel Cristina da Silva Araujo1 aCavalcante, Lourival Ferreira0 tAgro@mbiente on-line.g2015 June, v. 9, no. 2 p.111-118dUniversidade Federal de RoraimawJournal:27788x1982-84707nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02537naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245011700157520147100274592002801745650002501773650001901798650001501817650001201832650001101844650002901855650001701884650001101901650001701912651001001929700001701939700001901956773012801975856007502103852000902178655001202187IND60766967420221117200828.0220211e20220122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076696742DNAL7 a10.3390/rs140305262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xuechen 10aDecoupling Relationship between Urbanization and Carbon Sequestration in the Pearl River Delta from 2000 to 2020  aRapid urbanization has a significant impact on the ecological environment. Net primary productivity (NPP) can effectively reflect the growth of urban vegetation and the carbon sequestration capacity of an ecosystem. Taking the rapidly growing Pearl River Delta (PRD) as our study area, the relative contributions of human activities and climate change to NPP were analyzed using an improved two-step method based on residual trend analysis. The decoupling index was used to compare the coordinated development of socioeconomic factors and the NPP in different time periods. This study lays the foundation for formulating comprehensive and reasonable urban low-carbon development measures. The results showed that (1) NPP decreased significantly before 2010, but by 2019, NPP in most regions of the PRD showed a slight increase. The NPP of new urban land was better than that of original urban land. (2) The negative contribution of climatic factors to NPP was clearer than that of human activities, and human activities contributed positively to NPP outside urban land. (3) The decoupling status of socioeconomic factors and NPP is improving, and the degree of decoupling in 2010–2019 was higher than that in 2000–2010. In conclusion, as the first forest urban agglomeration in China, the PRD has shown a good implementation of carbon sequestration policies, which can provide a reference for the coordinated development of urbanization and carbon sequestration.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3aforests 3ahumans 3anet primary productivity 3ariver deltas 3arivers 3aurbanization 3aChina1 aLuo, Yuhang 1 aWu, Jiansheng 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Jan. 22, v. 14, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs140305263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02673naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245018100166300001600347520112800363592002801491650002301519650001901542650001301561650001201574650002201586650002401608650001101632650001701643650002301660650001601683650002601699650001501725650001901740653002801759653002601787653002501813653001901838700002201857700001601879700001701895700001601912700001701928700001401945700001701959773009701976856008502073852000902158655001202167IND60720065820221120173950.0210201e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072006582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2020.11.1332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBi, Shaojie14aThe metabolic performance and microbial communities of anaerobic digestion of chicken manure under stressed ammonia condition: A case study of a 10-year successful biogas plant  ap. 644-651.  aTo increase the knowledge of microbial adaptation for high degradation ability under ammonia stressed conditions, the metabolic performance and the microbial community in a full-scale chicken manure anaerobic digestion (AD) plant, operated over a 10-year, were investigated. The methanogenic pathway employing labeled acetate (2–¹³C), aceticlastic methanogenesis activity, and the Illumina sequencing of microbiome structure at the plant were analyzed. The obtained results show that this active plant achieved a methane yield of 310 ± 43 mL/g-volatile solids (VS), high stability under an ammonium-N level of 6.2 ± 0.1 g/L, and an organic loading rate of 2.5 g-VS/(L·d). The extremely long adaptation developed the unique microbe communities, and the hydrogentrophic methanogens Methanobrevibacter (76%) and Methanoculleus (18%) were dominant in the main digester. The acetoclastic methanogenic pathway reached 42%, contributing to the deep degradation. The current study thus may lay the foundation for illustrating the successful full-scale AD of nitrogen-rich materials under stressed operating conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMethanobrevibacter 3aMethanoculleus 3aacetates 3aammonia 3aammonium nitrogen 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiogas 3acase studies 3amethane production 3amethanogens 3amicrobial communities 3amicrobiome 3apoultry manure 0aFull-scale biogas plant 0aMicrobial acclimation 0aMethanogenic pathway 0aChicken manure1 aWesterholm, Maria1 aHu, Wanrong1 aMahdy, Ahmed1 aDong, Taili1 aSun, Yingcai1 aQiao, Wei1 aDong, Renjie0 tRenewable energy.g2021 Apr., v. 167 p.644-651dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2020.11.1333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02774naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010200166300002000268520125200288592002801540650001401568650000801582650001601590650002201606650001701628650001501645650001501660650002001675650001601695650002201711650001301733650001301746650001301759650001801772650001601790650000701806650001801813650001301831650001501844700002001859700002101879700001801900700001901918700001801937700003201955700001801987773014902005856008102154852000902235655001202244IND60523473320221119125023.0160619e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052347332DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-016-6475-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSayed, Murtaza10aDegradation of quinolone antibiotic, norfloxacin, in aqueous solution using gamma-ray irradiation  ap. 13155-13168.  aThis study reports the efficiency of gamma-ray irradiation to degrade quinolone antibiotic, norfloxacin, in aqueous solution. Laboratory batch experiments were conducted to determine the “pseudo-first” order degradation kinetics of norfloxacin in the concentration ranges of 3.4–16.1 mg L⁻¹ by gamma-ray irradiation. The dose constant was found to be dependent on the initial concentration of norfloxacin and gamma-ray irradiation dose rate (D ᵣ). The saturation of norfloxacin sample solutions with N₂, air or N₂O, and the presence of tert-butanol and 2-propanol showed that •OH played more crucial role in the degradation of norfloxacin. The second order rate constants of •OH, eₐq ⁻, and •H with norfloxacin were calculated to be 8.81 × 10⁹, 9.54 × 10⁸, and 1.10 × 10⁹ M⁻¹ s⁻¹, respectively. The effects of various additives including CO₃ ²⁻, HCO₃ ⁻, NO₃ ⁻, NO₂ ⁻, and thiourea and the pH of the medium on the degradation of norfloxacin were also investigated. Norfloxacin degradation was lower in surface water and wastewater than in ultrapure water. Several degradation byproducts of norfloxacin were identified from which the possible degradation pathway was proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3aair 3aantibiotics 3aaqueous solutions 3abicarbonates 3abyproducts 3acarbonates 3agamma radiation 3airradiation 3aisopropyl alcohol 3anitrates 3anitrites 3anitrogen 3anitrous oxide 3anorfloxacin 3apH 3asurface water 3athiourea 3awastewater1 aKhan, Javed Ali1 aShah, Luqman Ali1 aShah, Noor S.1 aKhan, Hasan M.1 aRehman, Faiza1 aKhāna, Ābadura Rahamāna,1 aKhan, Asad M.0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2016 July, v. 23, no. 13 p.13155-13168dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-6475-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03505naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245012300163300001500286520165900301592002801960650001601988650002502004650003802029650001402067650001402081650001102095650001202106650003302118650004202151650003002193650001002223650002002233650002002253650000902273650001102282650003102293650001302324650002402337650001302361650002302374650001702397651001002414653002002424653001002444653001102454653000802465653001202473653001102485700001302496700001302509700001402522700001302536700001502549700001702564700001602581700001202597700001802609700001702627773009702644856008102741852000902822655001202831IND60606309220221120215313.0180725e20160215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060630922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2016.01.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Wentao10aHepatic IGF-1R overexpression combined with the activation of GSK-3β and FOXO3a in the development of liver cirrhosis  ap. 97-102.  aLiver cirrhosis is the common pathological histology manifest among a number of chronic liver diseases and liver cancer. Circulating levels of insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1) have been recently linked to liver cirrhosis and the development of liver cancer. Herein, we hypothesized that IGF-1R overexpression combining the activation of GSK-3β and FOXO3a were involved in the development of human and murine chronic liver cirrhosis.Liver samples of patients were screened from the Tissue Bank of the China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University. Mice liver fibrosis model was performed using intraperitoneal injection of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) for 12weeks. Serum IGF-1 levels were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Microscopical examination of liver parenchyma was performed using conventional H&E and Masson's staining. Moreover, we investigated the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) signaling pathway at different period after CCl4 administration.Serum IGF-1 levels were significantly decreased in patients with liver cirrhosis, which is concomitant with the declined circulating levels of IGF-1 in 8 to 12weeks CCl4-treated mice. Furthermore, the expression of IGF-1R was significantly higher at 12w compared with control group. In addition, activation of the GSK-3β and FOXO3a were activated during the process of murine chronic liver injury.The present study demonstrates that decreased circulating IGF-1 levels are involved in human and murine chronic liver disease. Interestingly, overexpression of the IGF-1R, and activation of GSK3β and FOXO3a might be the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of liver cirrhosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3acarbon tetrachloride 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ahistology 3ahospitals 3ahumans 3ainsulin 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3ainsulin-like growth factor I receptor 3aintraperitoneal injection 3aliver 3aliver cirrhosis 3aliver neoplasms 3amice 3amodels 3aparenchyma (animal tissue) 3apatients 3asignal transduction 3astaining 3atau-protein kinase 3atissue banks 3aChina 0aLiver cirrhosis 0aIGF-1 0aIGF-1R 0aAKT 0aGSK-3β 0aFoxO3a1 aLi, Jing1 aCai, Yan1 aWu, Qiong1 aPan, Yue1 aChen, Yang1 aChen, Yujing1 aZheng, Xiao1 aLi, Wei1 aZhang, Xuewen1 aE, Changyong0 tLife sciences.g2016 Feb. 15, v. 147 p.97-102dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2016.01.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03217naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245010800162300001800270520162500288592002801913650001501941650003201956650002401988650001902012650002802031650002502059650002502084650001302109650001102122650002302133650000902156650002102165650001002186650003102196650001702227650001102244650000902255650001002264650001202274650001202286650000902298650000902307700001702316700001602333700001802349700001902367700001602386700002102402773015002423856008102573852000902654655001202663IND60585601520221118060356.0171111e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058560152DNAL7 a10.1007/s13762-017-1334-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParida, S.10aTrace metal concentrations in euryhaline fish species from Chilika lagoon: human health risk assessment  ap. 2649-2660.  aFive trace metals, viz. copper (Cu), chromium (Cr), iron (Fe), mercury (Hg) and zinc (Zn), in three organs (muscle, gills and liver) of four selected fish species (Mugil cephalus, Eleutheronema tetradactylum, Etroplus suratensis and Daysciaena albida) from Chilika lagoon were studied monthly to assess the concentration level and human health risk via consumption. The average and range of metal concentrations (μg g⁻¹) in flesh of the fish species were found to be: Cu (4.15, 3.47–5.03), Cr (0.25, 0.04–0.63), Fe (19.72, 14.51–27.30), Hg (0.07, 0.05–0.08) and Zn (8.09, 4.41–11.36). The metal concentrations measured in the edible muscles of all fish species were found lower as compared to the contents in liver and gill. Analysis of variance revealed a significant difference in trace metal accumulation among the organs (p < 0.001), but the difference among the seasons and fish species was insignificant (p > 0.05), with the exception of Zn accumulation (p < 0.05). The estimated daily intake (EDI) of the trace metals through the consumption of fish as a dietary component varied widely from 0.48 to 21.33% with respect to the corresponding permissible tolerable daily intake (PTDI). The target hazard quotients (THQs) calculated considering these EDIs for individual metals indicated that the Cr and Cu metals dominantly contributed (avg. THQ = 0.198) to represent the hazard index (HI) than other metals (avg. THQ = 0.029). The average HI determined for all the species was <1 (0.484, ranged 0.255–0.605), indicating that these fish species of Chilika are safe for human consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDaysciaena 3aEleutheronema tetradactylum 3aEtroplus suratensis 3aMugil cephalus 3aacceptable daily intake 3aanalysis of variance 3aaverage daily intake 3achromium 3acopper 3aeuryhaline species 3afish 3afish consumption 3agills 3ahealth effects assessments 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3airon 3aliver 3amercury 3amuscles 3arisk 3azinc1 aBarik, S.

Discharge estimates using remote sensing thus have a great potential to supplement ground observations. There are remote sensing methods established to estimate discharge based on single parameter derived relationships; however, they are limited to specific sections due to their empirical nature. In this study, we propose an innovative method to estimate daily discharges for continental rivers (with river channel widths >800m (Birkett and Beckley, 2010)) using two satellite derived parameters. Multiple satellite altimetry data and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data are used to provide a time series of river stages and effective river width. The derived MODIS and altimetry data are then used to optimize unknown parameters in a modified Manning's equation. In situ measurements are used to derive rating curves and to provide assessments of the estimated results. The Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency values for the estimates are between 0.60 and 0.97, indicating the power of the method and accuracy of the estimations. A comparison with a previously developed empirical multivariate equation for estimating river discharge shows that our method produces superior results, especially for large rivers. Furthermore, we found that discharge estimates using both effective river width and stage information consistently outperform those that only use stage data.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aequations 3afreshwater 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3aremote sensing 3arivers 3asatellites 3aspatial data 3atime series analysis 3awatersheds 0aAltimetry 0aDischarge 0aRemote sensing1 aWang, Lei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7201-87151 aYang, Kun1 aChen, Deliang1 aWang, Zhongjing1 aLi, Xiuping1 aZhou, Jing1 aLiu, Wenbin1 aKuria, David0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2016 June 15, v. 179 p.36-53dElsevier Inc.x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2016.03.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04199naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002900133040001800162100002000180245011100200300001800311506007600329520180100405592002802206506003702234650002102271650002902292650002202321650001702343650001202360650001502372650002002387650002502407650002402432650001002456650002202466650001202488650001402500650001402514650002102528650001702549650002602566650001202592650005402604650001302658650007502671650003002746650002802776650004302804650002802847650004802875650004302923650003902966650002903005650004803034650000903082650004403091650000903135650001403144650002903158700001903187700002103206700001903227700002003246773011103266856007903377852000903456655001203465IND4487130620221207102548.0120501e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448713062DNAL7 a216660762pmid7 aPMC32327252pmcid7 a10.1128/EC.05126-112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNett, Jeniel E.10aInterface of Candida albicans Biofilm Matrix-Associated Drug Resistance and Cell Wall Integrity Regulation  ap. 1660-1669.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCandida albicans frequently infects medical devices by growing as a biofilm, i.e., a community of adherent organisms entrenched in an extracellular matrix. During biofilm growth, Candida spp. acquire the ability to resist high concentrations of antifungal drugs. One recently recognized biofilm resistance mechanism involves drug sequestration by matrix β-1,3 glucan. Using a candidate gene approach, we investigated potential C. albicans β-1,3-glucan regulators, based on their homology to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, including SMI1 and protein kinase C (PKC) pathway components. We identified a role for the SMI1 in biofilm matrix glucan production and development of the associated drug resistance phenotype. This pathway appears to act through transcription factor Rlmp and glucan synthase Fks1p. The phenotypes of these mutant biofilms mimicked those of the smi1Δ/smi1Δ biofilm, and overexpression of FKS1 in the smi1Δ/smi1Δ mutant restored the biofilm resistant phenotype. However, control of this pathway is distinct from that of the upstream PKC pathway because the pkc1Δ/pkc1Δ, bck1Δ/bck1Δ, mkk2Δ/mkk2Δ, and mkc1Δ/mkc1Δ biofilms retained the resistant phenotype of the parent strain. In addition, resistance to cell-perturbing agents and gene expression data do not support a significant role for the cell wall integrity pathway during the biofilm formation. Here we show that Smi1p functions in conjunction with Rlm1p and Fks1p to produce drug-sequestering biofilm β-glucan. Our work provides new insight into how the C. albicans biofilm matrix production and drug resistance pathways intersect with the planktonic cell wall integrity pathway. This novel connection helps explain how pathogens in a multicellular biofilm community are protected from anti-infective therapy.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCandida albicans 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aantifungal agents 3abeta-glucans 3abiofilm 3acell walls 3adrug resistance 3aextracellular matrix 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3amedical equipment 3amutants 3apathogens 3aphenotype 3aprotein kinase C 3atherapeutics 3atranscription factors 2aAnimals 2aAntifungal Agentsxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aBiofilms 2aCandida albicansxdrug effectsxmetabolismxpathogenicityxphysiology. 2aCandidiasisxdrug therapy 2aCathetersxmicrobiology 2aCell Wallxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aDrug Resistance, Fungal 2aFluconazolexpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aFungal Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungal 2aGene Knockout Techniques 2aGlucosyltransferasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMice 2aProtein Kinase Cxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRats 2aVirulence 2abeta-Glucansxmetabolism1 aSanchez, Hiram1 aCain, Michael T.1 aRoss, Kelly M.1 aAndes, David R.0 tEukaryotic cell.g2011 Dec., v. 10, no. 12 p.1660-1669dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx1535-97787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/EC.05126-113Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle04367naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002000112245012200132300001600254520252200270592002802792650001002820650002702830650002302857650002202880650002302902650001702925650002602942650002702968650002102995650001503016650001703031650001303048650002503061650002403086650001603110650001503126650001303141650001803154650001403172650001403186650001503200650002603215650003103241650001603272650001703288650000903305650002503314650001603339650001303355650001503368650000903383650000903392650001703401650001403418650001703432653001803449653002603467653002203493653002503515700002503540773011903565852000903684655001203693IND60595596720221118120534.0180605e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059559672DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiller, M. Ryan10aFlorpyrauxifen-benzyl Weed Control Spectrum and Tank-Mix Compatibility with Other Commonly Applied Herbicides in Rice  ap. 319-325.  aFlorpyrauxifen-benzyl is a new herbicide being developed for rice. Research is needed to understand its spectrum of control and optimal tank-mix partners. Multiple greenhouse and field experiments were conducted to evaluate florpyrauxifen-benzyl efficacy and tank-mix compatibility. In greenhouse experiments, florpyrauxifen-benzyl at 30 g ai ha⁻¹ provided ≥75% control of all weed species evaluated (broadleaf signalgrass, barnyardgrass, Amazon sprangletop, large crabgrass, northern jointvetch, hemp sesbania, pitted morningglory, Palmer amaranth, yellow nutsedge, rice flatsedge, smallflower umbrellasedge), and control was similar to or better than other herbicide options currently available in rice. Barnyardgrass was controlled 97% with florpyrauxifen-benzyl at 30 g ha⁻¹, ultimately reducing height (86%) and aboveground biomass (84%). In these field studies at 30 g ha⁻¹, no antagonism was observed when florpyrauxifen-benzyl was tank-mixed with contact (acifluorfen, bentazon, carfentrazone, propanil, and saflufenacil) or systemic (2,4-D, bispyribac, cyhalofop, fenoxaprop, halosulfuron, imazethapyr, penoxsulam, quinclorac, and triclopyr) rice herbicides. Although not every tank-mix or weed species was evaluated, the lack of antagonistic interactions herein highlights the flexibility and versatility of this new herbicide. Once florpyrauxifen-benzyl becomes commercially available, it will be beneficial to tank-mix this new herbicide with others without sacrificing efficacy, so as to apply multiple sites of action together and thus lessen the risk for evolution of herbicide resistance.

TiO2 resulted in significant reduction in MB absorption and a shift of MB absorption peak from 664 nm to 658 nm after a short time of irradiation. The maximum degradation of MB was observed when the concentration of TiO2 in the aqueous suspension was 0.5 g L−1. TiO2 was also very effective with inhibiting growth of both Gram-negative bacteria E. coli and P. aeruginosa, although it took more than 60 min to observe the inactivation effects. The photocatalytic inactivation toward E. coli and P. aeruginosa by TiO2 showed a similar trend with much higher effectiveness toward E. coli under the same experimental conditions. The inactivation kinetic behaviors could be explained by the modified Langmuir–Hinshelwood model, and well fitted to a pseudo-first order kinetic equation. The reaction rate constant for E. coli and P. aeruginosa were 7.768 × 106 cfu mL−1 min−1 and 5.655 × 106 cfu mL−1 min−1, respectively. The adsorption equilibrium constant for E. coli was 1.053 × 10−8 mL cfu−1, while it was 1.438 × 10−8 mL cfu−1 for P. aeruginosa. These results further demonstrate that in an aqueous system, TiO2 nanoparticles can effectively both degrade organic compounds and inhibit Gram-negative bacteria under UVA light. Compared with the degradation activity of TiO2 toward organic compounds, its antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria would be delayed by 60 min. The antimicrobial activity of TiO2 against Gram-negative bacteria could vary with bacterial species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aabsorption 3aadsorption 3aantimicrobial properties 3aequations 3airradiation 3amethylene blue 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3aphotolysis 3atitanium dioxide 0aTiO2 0aPhotocatalytic activity 0aMethylene blue 0aE. coli 0aP. aeruginosa1 aLi, Can1 aZhuang, Hong1 aZhang, Jianhao0 tFood control.g2013 Dec., v. 34, no. 2 p.372-377dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2013.04.0463Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02836naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012400166300001800290520144700308592002801755650001401783650001401797650002301811650001101834650001601845650002301861650001401884650001901898650001601917650001301933650001801946650001201964650002301976650001101999650001602010700003302026700001702059700002502076700001902101700001802120773015002138856008102288852000902369655001202378IND60585601620221118061747.0171111e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058560162DNAL7 a10.1007/s13762-017-1343-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDinh, Thi Thao10aStarch-assisted sol–gel synthesis of magnetic CuFe2O4 powder as photo-Fenton catalysts in the presence of oxalic acid  ap. 2613-2622.  aMagnetic photo-Fenton catalysts based on spinel CuFe₂O₄ were successfully prepared by the starch-assisted sol–gel method. Various synthetic conditions such as annealing temperatures (700, 800 and 900 °C) and molar ratios of Cu²⁺/Fe³⁺/C₆H₁₀O₅ in the precursor solution (from 1:2:2 to 1:2:4) were, respectively, used in order to study the influences of annealing temperatures and precursor starch contents on the magnetic and catalytic properties of CuFe₂O₄ powders. The photo-Fenton catalytic activity was evaluated via the degradation of methylene blue under ultraviolet and visible irradiation with H₂C₂O₄ as a new oxidizing agent. According to the results, when the annealing temperature increased to 800 °C, the spinel CuFe₂O₄ phase amount was increased, which strongly enhances the photo-Fenton catalytic performance. However, above 800 °C, the catalytic activity was reduced, due to the increase in particle size. The starch content also affected the surface Cu²⁺ content and the particle size of catalysts. The catalyst prepared at 800 °C with the molar Cu²⁺/Fe³⁺/C₆H₁₀O₅ ratio of 1:2:3 presented the best photo-Fenton performance, owing to its highest surface Cu²⁺ content. This catalyst also exhibits ferromagnetic properties (saturation magnetization of 25.836 emu/g and coercivity of 1010.23 Oe), which allows them to be easily separated from the solution by a magnet.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannealing 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acopper 3airradiation 3amagnetic materials 3amagnetism 3amethylene blue 3aoxalic acid 3aoxidants 3aparticle size 3apowders 3asol-gel processing 3astarch 3atemperature1 aNguyễn, Thị Tố Quyên,1 aQuan, Gia Co1 aNguyen, Vo Dong Nghi1 aTran, Hon Quoc1 aLe, Tien Khoa0 tInternational journal of environmental science and technology.g2017 Dec., v. 14, no. 12 p.2613-2622dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1735-14727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13762-017-1343-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01925naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245011000159300002000269520080200289592002801091650002201119650002801141650001401169650002301183650001101206650001801217650001601235650001301251700001901264700002501283700002301308700002501331773012401356856007401480852000901554655001201563IND60666741920221122195557.0190919e20141015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066674192DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra06640e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Praveen10aCCSO nano catalyzed solid phase synthesis of 3-oxo-5,6-disubstituted-2,3-dihydropyridazine-4-carbonitrile  ap. 51239-51243.  aCo-doped Ce₀.₉₄Ca₀.₀₅Sr₀.₀₁O₁.₉₄ (CCSO) nano particles have been successfully synthesized by an auto-combustion method and were characterized by XRD, TEM and AFM analyses.

Thus, a highly economically efficient one-pot solvent free synthesis of pyridazine was developed, which is promoted by the CCSO nano catalyst. The benefits of the reaction are its very short time (2–4 min) and high yields (90–95%).

Two different types of operation including that of stable and periodic charging with steady discharging are analyzed. Three different solid fillers are utilized, including quartzite rock, slag pebbles, and alumina ceramics. The effects of charging/discharging flow rate ratio and non-charging periods on thermocline thickness and energy storage power have been investigated. The results show significant influences of the charging/discharging flow rate ratio. When charging is steady, the discharge performance of a packed-bed tank is better than that of a pure molten-salt tank at lower flow rate ratios. The thermocline thickness of the packed-bed tank is higher than that of a pure molten-salt tank for different solid materials. Compared with quartzite rock and slag pebbles, alumina ceramics achieves a higher thermal gradient. In periodic charging mode, as the cycle’s number of charging periods increases, thermocline thickness increases linearly. Operating at higher charging rates and shorter non-charging periods, the discharge outlet temperature of molten-salt becomes more stable for the steam generation process and hence, the discharge performance is improved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3aenergy 3amathematical models 3aquartzite 3aslags 3asolar energy 3asteam 3atemperature 0aThermal energy storage 0aPacked-bed 0aConcentrated solar power 0aSimultaneous charging/discharging operation 0aThermocline1 aWang, Xiaohui1 aXu, Chao1 aDu, Xiaoze0 tRenewable energy.g2021 July, v. 172 p.1417-1432dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2020.11.1393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03459naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245010100166300001600267520223400283592002802517650002502545650001102570650001602581650001402597650001902611650001802630650001602648650001402664650002902678650002302707650001002730650000902740650001102749650001202760700001702772700001402789700002102803700001502824773009302839856008402932852000903016655001203025IND50060195920221119160637.0141112e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006019592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.livsci.2012.08.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoder, C.L.10aLactation feed intake in purebred and F1 sows and its relationship with reproductive performance  ap. 187-199.  aDaily feed intake during lactation was recorded on purebred Yorkshire (n=1587), Landrace (n=2197), and F1 Yorkshire x Landrace (n=6932) litters from day 1 to 22 of lactation. Lactation feed intake (LFI) curves were predicted using a mixed model which included fixed effects of breed, season, parity group (PG), day of lactation, interactions of day with breed and PG, and a covariate for litter size after cross-fostering. Random effects included litter, contemporary group (herd–year–month), dam, and sire nested within breed. Least squares means for each day were used to express LFI curves by breed through day 22 of lactation. Yorkshire and Landrace LFI curves were not different (P=0.09), though both differed from the LFI curve (P<0.05) of F1 sows. Due to a limited number of observations in late lactation, LFI data from days 19 to 22 were not included. Evaluation of the difference in feed intake between 2 consecutive days (DC) of lactation resulted in the following classifications: 3 periods for purebreds, day 1 to 6 (PB1), day 7 to 10 (PB2), and day 11 to 18 (PB3); 2 periods for F1 sows, day 1–5 (C1) and day 6–18 (C2). Average rate of change in intake (ARC), average daily intake (ADI), and variation from predicted LFI values (VAR) metrics were estimated for each period in purebred and F1 sows. Parity group 1 in both purebred and F1 sows had the lowest ARC and ADI metrics, but highest VAR (P<0.05) in each period of lactation. Similar differences were observed for seasonal effects (P<0.05) as LFI curves during summer months represented lower ARC and ADI and higher VAR values compared to all other seasons. For all breeds, increased ARC and ADI metrics resulted in higher 21-day litter weaning weights (P<0.05), while decreasing VAR metrics late in lactation (PB3 and C2) resulted in higher 21-day litter weaning weights and shorter wean-to-first service intervals (P<0.05). Average rate of change increased more quickly in early periods (PB1, PB2, C1) and was lower in late lactation (PB3, C2). An increase in average rate of change in intake, average daily intake, and decreased variation from predicted LFI values during a period of lactation resulted in improved measures of maternal performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaverage daily intake 3abreeds 3afeed intake 3alandraces 3alate lactation 3aleast squares 3alitter size 3apurebreds 3areproductive performance 3aseasonal variation 3asires 3asows 3asummer 3aweaning1 aSchwab, C.R.1 aFix, J.S.1 aDuttlinger, V.M.1 aBaas, T.J.0 tLivestock science.g2012 Dec., v. 150, no. 1-3 p.187-199dElsevier B.V.x1871-14137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2012.08.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02818naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245011800158520183400276592002802110650001602138650001702154650001502171700001802186700001402204700001802218700001702236700001802253700002102271773012802292856007502420852000902495655001202504IND60766967620221117200909.0220211e20220122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076696762DNAL7 a10.3390/rs140305282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Yanming 12aA New Space-to-Ground Microwave-Based Two-Way Time Synchronization Method for Next-Generation Space Atomic Clocks  aThe accuracy of time synchronization can be significantly increased by enhancing the performance of atomic clocks. Future-generation time-frequency loads will be equipped with the latest ultrahigh-precision atomic clocks (with a day stability better than 10⁻¹⁷) and will leverage advantages of the space environment such as microgravity and low interference to operate a new generation of high-performance time-frequency payloads on low-orbit spacecraft. Moreover, using the high-precision time-frequency system of ground stations, low-time-delay high-performance time-frequency transmission networks, which have the potential to achieve ultrahigh-precision time synchronization, will be constructed. By considering full link error terms above the picosecond level, this paper proposes a new space-to-ground microwave two-way time synchronization method for scenarios involving low-orbit spacecraft and ground stations. Using the theoretical principles and practical application scenarios related to this method, a theoretical and simulation verification platform was developed to research the impact of the attitude, phase center calibration, and orbit determination errors on the single-frequency two-way time synchronization method. The effectiveness of this new method was verified. The results showed that when the attitude error is less than 72 arc seconds (0.02°), the phase center calibration error is less than 1 mm, and the precision orbit determination (POD) error is less than 10 cm (three-axis). After disregarding nonlink error terms such as equipment noise, this method can attain a space-to-ground time synchronization accuracy of better than 1.5 ps, and the time deviation (TDEV) of the transfer link is better than 0.7 ps @ 100 s, which results in ultrahigh-precision space-to-ground time synchronization.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalibration 3amicrogravity 3aspacecraft1 aGao, Shuaihe 1 aBai, Yan 1 aPan, Zhibing 1 aLiu, Yinhua 1 aLu, Xiaochun 1 aZhang, Shougang 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Jan. 22, v. 14, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs140305283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02295naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245021900174300001600393520099200409592002801401650001001429650001101439650004301450650002001493650001501513650001901528650001101547653002601558653004701584653003301631653001701664700001901681700002301700773010201723856008701825852000901912655001201921IND60112495020221122040039.0190408e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011249502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2013.05.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPirsaheb, Meghdad10aDetermination of organophosphorous pesticides in summer crops using ultrasound-assisted solvent extraction followed by dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction based on the solidification of floating organic drop  ap. 378-385.  aThe ultrasound-assisted solvent extraction (UASE) followed by dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction based on the solidification of floating organic drop (DLLME-SFO) has been developed for extraction and determination of organophosphorous pesticides from summer crops. Organophosphorous pesticides were determined by high performance liquid–liquid chromatography-ultraviolet detector (HPLC-UV). Some effective parameters on extraction were studied and optimized. Under the optimum conditions, recoveries for different fruits are in the range of 44.0–61.0%. The calibration graphs are linear in the range of 5–800 μg kg−1 and limit of detections (LODs) are in the range of 1–4 μg kg−1. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) for 100 μg kg−1 of OPPs in different fruits are in the range of 5.5–9.1 (n = 5).

The films were obtained with different Ti/Zn ratios (0, 0.20, 0.40, 0.45, 0.50, 0.67, 0.84, and 1) by the sol-gel route. The initial level of benzene concentration was 110 ± 10 ppm. The process was carried out under different conditions of relative humidity (RH): 25, 50, and 80 % in a batch-type reactor, at room temperature. The results show benzene degradation near to 95 % at t = 240 min, where the multicomponent oxide semiconductor has a Ti/Zn ratio of 0.67. Meanwhile, with the TiO₂ thin films, only a degradation of 70 % was reached at the same measurement conditions. This synergistic effect on the photocatalytic activity is a result of the coupling of both semiconductor oxides. An adverse effect on the photocatalytic activity was observed as the relative humidity increases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aambient temperature 3abenzene 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3apollutants 3arelative humidity 3asemiconductors 3asol-gel processing 3asynergism 3atitanium dioxide 3azinc 3azinc oxide1 aTorres-Delgado, G.1 aCastanedo-Pérez, R.1 aZelaya-Ángel, O.0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2016 July, v. 23, no. 13 p.13191-13199dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-6438-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03010naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245011400173300001600287520182500303592002802128650001702156650001602173650001602189650002602205650002802231650001502259650002402274653001202298653001502310653002602325653001502351653001802366653001602384700002302400773010702423856008502530852000902615655001202624IND50060606620221120235249.0190215e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006060662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2012.09.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDapporto, Leonardo14aThe generalist–specialist continuum: Testing predictions for distribution and trends in British butterflies  ap. 229-236.  aRecognizing how different species react to environmental changes provides fundamental information for conservation biology. Population and distribution trends in changing environments have been hypothesized to be highly dependent on the degree of generalism and dispersal capacity. However, different outcomes are expected for different situations. Assessing these is complicated by the paucity of reliable data over time and by the lack of continuous variables measuring the degree of species’ generalism and dispersal capability. We demonstrate the value of applying two newly constructed indices, that measure the degree of species’ generalism and dispersal ability, to recently published reliable data on distribution and population trends for British butterflies. We tested linear and non-linear relationships between distribution trends and species’ characteristics and found that distribution cover (number of occupied squares) is highly, positively correlated with degree of generalism and dispersal ability. However, we found that distribution trends (fraction of area gained or lost over the last 10years) has a non-linear, ‘U’ shaped, relationship with generalism and no relationship with dispersal ability. The non-linear relationship revealed that specialists have the highest positive trends and mid generalists the most negative trends. In accordance with a recent review, we concluded that specialists can monopolize restricted resources on fragmented habitats as long as these are large, and profit from local conservation measures, while extreme generalists can profit from any resource and can move easily among suitable patches. Intermediate species cannot competitively engage either of these alternative strategies and are thus most seriously affected by the recent environmental changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogeography 3abutterflies 3acorrelation 3ahabitat fragmentation 3apopulation distribution 3aprediction 3aprofits and margins 0aClimate 0aGeneralism 0aHabitat fragmentation 0aSpecialism 0aVulnerability 0aButterflies1 aDennis, Roger L.H.0 tBiological conservation.g2013 Jan., v. 157 p.229-236dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2012.09.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01996naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245006900168300001300237520089600250592002801146650000801174650001301182650002001195650001401215650002101229650002401250650001701274653001301291653001401304653003401318653003301352653002101385700001601406773010501422856008601527852000901613655001201622IND60540863220221121042134.0190318e20150420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054086322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.11.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Wen Jen10aPegylation effect of chitosan based polyplex on DNA transfection  ap. 7-14.  aThe aim of this study was to develop hepatocyte-targeting non-viral polymeric nono-carriers for gene delivery.

Selection of suitable regions for apiaries mainly depends on the availability of honey bee plants in the apiary region. Identifying honey bee plants in specific region is very essential for honey and pollen production from honey bee colonies. Lacking the information about the beneficial plants for honey bees including; plant name, flowering time and potential benefit to honey bee colonies could be considered as a limitation for beekeeping development. So far honey bee plants are not well studied in Egypt. This review paper presents potential honey bee plants in Egypt using the available publications. The studies on honey bee plants in Egypt were also reviewed. This work can be considered as a guide for beekeepers and researchers. Moreover, the presented plants here can be used in comparing honey bee plants of Egypt with other countries to get a better understanding of honey bee flora.

The efficiency of this approach is dependent on shoot nickel concentration and harvestable biomass. In a field experiment conducted on an Austrian serpentine site, the phytomining efficiency of the two plant species Odontarrhena chalcidica (syn. Alyssum murale) and Noccaea goesingensis was evaluated. O. chalcidica was planted in three treatments: control, sulphur application (0.46 g S kg−1 soil) and intercropping with the legume Lotus corniculatus. For N. goesingensis the treatments control, high-density planting (110 plants m−2) and intercropping were implemented. Given the experimental set-up, shoot biomass, shoot Ni concentration and thus the total amount of harvested Ni were on average higher for O. chalcidica. The highest Ni yield was achieved with O. chalcidica, reaching 55 kg Ni ha−1 in the sulphur treatment. N. goesingensis showed the maximum yield in the high-density treatment with 36 kg Ni ha−1. However, high-density planting of N. goesingensis and sulphur application to O. chalcidica plots did not significantly increase the Ni yield compared to the control. Intercropping with L. corniculatus tended to decrease the shoot biomass of both species. Planting of the hyperaccumulators led to a decrease of DTPA-extractable Ni and to an increase of soil pH, with the exception of sulphur-amended plots. Likewise, rhizosphere soil pH was higher than bulk soil values. Our data suggest that in particular O. chalcidica is suitable for Ni phytomining on the tested site. Measures to further increase the Ni yield and to optimise crop management will be evaluated in follow-up experiments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlyssum murale 3aLotus corniculatus 3aNoccaea 3abiomass 3afield experimentation 3ahyperaccumulators 3aintercropping 3alegumes 3anickel 3aplanting 3arhizosphere 3aserpentine 3aserpentine soils 3asoil pH 3asulfur 0aAgromining 0aHyperaccumulation 0aField experiment 0aUltramafic soil 0aBioavailability1 aHipfinger, Christina1 aRidard, Charline1 aPuschenreiter, Markus1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7298-4163 https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7298-41630 tJournal of environmental management.g2019 July 15, v. 242 p.522-528dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.04.0733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02829naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245010300159300002000262520126900282592002801551650001601579650001801595650001401613650001301627650001401640650001601654650002501670650002501695650001901720650001801739650002601757653003801783653002001821653002101841653003201862700005401894700001801948700001201966700001601978700001501994700005602009700005202065773014202117856007902259852000902338655001202347IND60754965820221119161916.0211027e20211012xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075496582DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c173452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Yan12aA Bioinspired Hydrogel-Elastomer Hybrid Surface for Enhanced Mechanical Properties and Lubrication  ap. 50461-50469.  aDeveloping surfaces that realize lubrication and durable wear resistance under high pressure has great implications in areas ranging from electromechanical systems to advanced biomedical devices but has proven challenging. Inspired by the zonal and transitional structure of articular cartilage, we fabricate a hydrogel-elastomer hybrid surface, where the hydrogel interpenetrates into the polymer elastomer substrate as a transitional and bonding zone, that exhibits a low coefficient of friction and wear resistance under a high load. First, we entrap benzophenone within the surface of polymer substrates such as polydimethylsiloxane, polyvinylchloride, and polyurethane. The hybrid surface is then achieved through initiating polymerization of the acrylamide monomer on the polymer surface upon ultraviolet irradiation. We observe an interpenetration area of the hydrogel and the polymer substrate. The hybrid surface shows a low coefficient of friction (∼0.05) under a very high load (over 100 atm contact pressure). It conserves the lubrication property over 100,000 cycles under a 10.9 MPa pressure and shows slight wear. This work brings a new perspective on designing surfaces with a lubrication property and wear resistance, showing broad applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylamides 3abenzophenones 3acartilage 3afriction 3ahydrogels 3alubrication 3apoly(vinyl chloride) 3apolydimethylsiloxane 3apolymerization 3apolyurethanes 3aultraviolet radiation 0ahydrogel-elastomer hybrid surface 0awear resistance 0ainterpenetration 0ain situ photopolymerization1 aWang, Jing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7501-87021 aYu, Wei-jiang1 aYu, Yan1 aLi, Ren-yun1 aGao, Qiang1 aRen, Ke-feng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5456-984X1 aJi, Jian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9870-40380 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Oct. 12, v. 13, no. 42 p.50461-50469dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c173453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03244naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245016700158520203400325592002802359650001202387650001902399650000902418650001502427650002002442650001502462650001302477650001502490651001002505700001802515700002002533700001902553700001702572700001602589700001302605700001602618773012802634856007502762852000902837655001202846IND60768519820221116181345.0220225e20220213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076851982DNAL7 a10.3390/rs140408952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Saisai 10aBlue-Sky Albedo Reduction and Associated Influencing Factors of Stable Land Cover Types in the Middle-High Latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere during 1982–2015  aLand surface albedo (LSA) directly affects the radiation balance and the surface heat budget. LSA is a key variable for local and global climate research. The complexity of LSA variations and the driving factors highlight the importance of continuous spatial and temporal monitoring. Snow, vegetation and soil are the main underlying surface factors affecting LSA dynamics. In this study, we combined Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) products and ERA5 reanalysis products to analyze the spatiotemporal variation and drivers of annual mean blue-sky albedo for stable land cover types in the middle-high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere (30~90°N) from 1982 to 2015. Snow cover (SC) exhibited a decreasing trend in 99.59% of all pixels (23.73% significant), with a rate of −0.0813. Soil moisture (SM) exhibited a decreasing trend in 85.66% of all pixels (22.27% significant), with a rate of −0.0002. The leaf area index (LAI) exhibited a greening trend in 74.38% of all pixels (25.23% significant), with a rate of 0.0014. Blue-sky albedo exhibited a decreasing trend in 98.97% of all pixels (65.12% significant), with a rate of −0.0008 (OLS slope). Approximately 98.16% of all pixels (57.01% significant) exhibited a positive correlation between blue-sky albedo and SC. Approximately 47.78% and 67.38% of all pixels (17.13% and 25.3% significant, respectively) exhibited a negative correlation between blue-sky albedo and SM and LAI, respectively. Approximately 10.31%, 20.81% and 68.88% of the pixel blue-sky albedo reduction was mainly controlled by SC, SM and LAI, respectively. The decrease in blue-sky albedo north of 40°N was mainly caused by the decrease in SC. The decrease in blue-sky albedo south of 40°N was mainly caused by SM reduction and vegetation greening. The decrease in blue-sky albedo in the western Tibetan Plateau was caused by vegetation greening, SM increase and SC reduction.

The introduction of an aminomethyl group on the phenyl group led to monomer X, which was found to thermally stabilize a 9-mer DNA:RNA duplex, presumably through the partial neutralization of the negative charge of the backbone. By also taking advantage of the stacking interactions in the major groove of two or more of the monomer X, an extremely high thermal stability was obtained. A regioisomer of the phenyltriazole substituent, that is the 5-(4-phenyl-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl)-2′-deoxyuridine monomer Y, was found to destabilize the DNA:RNA duplex significantly, but stacking in the major groove compensated for this when two to four monomers were incorporated consecutively. Finally, the 5-phenyl-2′-deoxyuridine monomer Z was incorporated for comparison, and it was found to give a more neutral influence on duplex stability indicating less efficient stacking interactions. The duplexes were investigated by CD spectroscopy and MD simulations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3aneutralization 3anucleosides 3aoligonucleotides 3aorganic chemistry 3apositional isomers 3athermal stability 3atriazoles1 aHornum, Mick1 aNielsen, Lise J.1 aEnderlin, Gérald1 aAndersen, Nicolai

The project plans to transform its biomass into valuable product and bring profitable for famers. The powered raw sample was treated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) as followed the design experiment. The use of response surface method is helping researcher to save time and effort but still gain meaningful predicted value that closed to the actual value. The highest total sugar was given when the pretreatment condition is solid to liquid ratio of 0.05, 1% NaOH, 1% H₂O₂ for 72 h. The efficiency of hydrolysis can reach 47% after 24 h with cellulase enzyme at 50 °C, 150 rpm and highest ethanol concentration was obtained on the fifth day of fermentation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCyperus difformis 3aOryza sativa 3abiomass 3acellulases 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3afermentation 3agrain yield 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydrolysis 3aliquids 3anutrients 3aresponse surface methodology 3arice 3asodium hydroxide 3asolar radiation 3asugars1 aUnpaprom, Yuwalee0 t3 Biotech.g2019 June, v. 9, no. 6 p.218-218dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:22884x2190-572X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-019-1754-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02422naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002100094024002200115024001900137040001800156100001900174245010100193300001300294520116700307592002801474650001501502650002001517650002401537650001701561650000901578650001501587650001901602700002101621700003001642700002301672773014701695856006701842856009501909990002302004852000902027655001202036IND60644648520221118034910.0190517e20090116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064464852DNAL7 a10.3791/9902doi7 aPMC27818262pmcid7 a192291772pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Hae Young10aIsolation and culture of post-natal mouse cerebellar granule neuron progenitor cells and neurons  ap. e990.  aThe cerebellar cortex is a well described structure that provides unique opportunities for studying neuronal properties and development1,2. Of the cerebellar neuronal types (granule cells, Purkinje cells and inhibitory interneurons), granule neurons are by far the most numerous and are the most abundant type of neurons in the mammalian brain. In rodents, cerebellar granule neurons are generated during the first two post-natal weeks from progenitor cells in the outermost layer of the cerebellar cortex, the external granule layer (EGL). The protocol presented here describes techniques to enrich and culture granule neurons and their progenitor cells from post-natal mouse cerebellum. We will describe procedures to obtain cultures of increasing purity3,4, which can be used to study the differentiation of proliferating progenitor cells into granule neurons5,6. Once the progenitor cells differentiate, the cultures also provide a homogenous population of granule neurons for experimental manipulation and characterization of phenomena such as synaptogenesis, glutamate receptor function7, interaction with other purified cerebellar cells8,9 or cell death7.  aPublisher supplied data 3acerebellum 3acerebral cortex 3aglutamate receptors 3ainterneurons 3amice 3astem cells 3asynaptogenesis1 aGreene, Lloyd A.1 aMason, C.

In search of success, the performance management uses a variety of models, techniques and methods, some taken from other systems and improved and others of its own, focusing on strategy and differentiating features that provide a strong competitive advantage. The Balanced Scorecard (BSC) model identifies several dimensions of the organization, representing areas where organizations need to achieve results at department, team or individual level. According to the type of the agricultural company, there can be esential financial aspect, customers, internal processes, knowledge and learning, service quality, market share etc. The company under study, S.C. Agrocomplex Lunca Paşcani S.A., is representative in terms of ownership, farm and profile of the agricultural production in Moldavia region. According to the methodology developed, starting from the strategy of S.C. Agrocomplex Lunca Paşcani S.A. we identified the strategic objectives for each situation and the level of reaching the objectives using several indicators. In the second stage of the BSC analysis, the indicators are defined according to the management priorities of S.C. Agrocomplex Lunca Paşcani S.A. in four categories, corresponding to the four dimensions of the classical model: customer perspective, perspective of processes within the company, employee perspective and financial perspective  aPublisher supplied data 3aconsumers (people) 3afarms 3alearning 3amarket share 3amodels 3aownership 3ateams 3aMoldova 0aAgricultural company 0aPerformance management 0aBalanced Scorecard (BSC) model1 aBrezuleanu, Carmen Olguţa1 aBrad, I.1 aIancu, T.1 aCiani, A.0 tCercetări agronomice în Moldova.g2015 July 1, v. 48, no. 2 p.109-120dDe Gruyter Openx2067-18657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/cerce-2015-00353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03035naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001600145245013000161500001400291520169900305592002802004650003502032650001102067650001502078650002402093650001302117650000902130650002202139650001202161650002302173650002002196650001202216650002802228650002602256700001502282700001802297700001402315700001502329700001902344700001802363773012002381856007902501852000902580655001202589IND60732117920221119211658.0210326e20210317xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073211792DNAL7 a10.3390/insects120302532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Shuang 10aAntagonism between PTP1B and PTK Mediates Adults’ Insulin-Like Signaling Regulation of Egg Diapause in the Migratory Locust  aNAL-light  aDiapause is a physiological development arrest state that helps insects to adapt to seasonality and overcome adverse environmental conditions. Numerous reports have indicated that insulinlike and fork head transcription factor (FOXO) are involved in the regulation of diapause in insects. However, the upstream modulators of the insulin-like signaling pathway (ISP) involved in diapause regulation are still unknown. Here, we used RNAi and an inhibitor to treat PTK and PTP1B in adult tissues and injected Prx V or RNAi Prx V under both short and long photoperiod conditions and monitored effects on the expression of ISP genes, the phosphorylation levels for IR and IRS, the activity of NADPH oxidase, the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and energy metabolism, seeking to identify both proteins and broader cellular metabolism influences on diapause regulation. We found that under short photoperiod conditions PTP1B in female adults induces egg diapause, whereas PTK in female adults inhibits egg diapause. Intriguingly, we also found that the antioxidant enzyme Prx V is a negative regulator of NADPH oxidizing reaction and apparently decreases ROS production and NADPH-OX activity. In contrast, all the eggs laid by adults that were treated with a series of knockdown or purified-protein injection experiments or inhibitor studies and that were reared under long photoperiod conditions hatched successfully. Thus, our results suggest a mechanism wherein diapause-related proteins (PTP1B, PTK, and Prx V) of female adults are the upstream modulators that regulate offspring eggs’ diapause process through the insulin-like signaling pathway under short photoperiod conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNAD(P)H oxidase (H2O2-forming) 3aadults 3aantagonism 3aantioxidant enzymes 3adiapause 3aeggs 3aenergy metabolism 3afemales 3amigratory behavior 3aphosphorylation 3aprogeny 3areactive oxygen species 3atranscription factors1 aWang, Jie 1 aCui, Dongnan 1 aHao, Kun 1 aChen, Jun 1 aTu, Xiongbing 1 aZhang, Zehua 0 tInsects.g2021 Mar. 17, v. 12, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects120302533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04927naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003900135040001800174100001300192245013900205300001600344506007600360520183000436536047802266592002802744596006302772596008002835596007902915596018502994596007203179506003703251650002403288650003103312650002003343650003803363650001303401650001903414650001103433650001903444650001703463650001803480650001803498650001003516650001603526650001603542650001003558650000903568650001603577650003503593650003103628650001303659650001203672650003803684650003203722653003303754653002803787653004503815653002303860653001903883700001303902700001703915700001703932700001903949700001603968773011403984856008604098852000904184655001204193IND60689948020221207141430.0211113e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068994802DNAL7 a316087482pmid7 aPMC68078622pmcid7 a10.1080/13880209.2019.16727542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiu, Min10aTerrestrosin D from Tribulus terrestris attenuates bleomycin-induced inflammation and suppresses fibrotic changes in the lungs of mice  ap. 694-700.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aContext: Terrestrosin D (TED), from Tribulus terrestris L. (Zygophyllaceae), exhibits anti-tumour and anti-inflammatory activities. However, its effects on bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary inflammation and the subsequent fibrotic changes remain unclear. Objective: To examine the anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects of TED against BLM in murine pulmonary tissues. Materials and methods: Male SPF mice received saline (control), TED (10 mg/kg), BLM (2.5 mg/kg), or BLM (2.5 mg/kg) + TED (10 mg/kg) group. BLM was administered as a single intranasal inoculation, and TED was intraperitoneally administered once daily. After 2 and 6 weeks of treatment, cell number and differentiation (Giemsa staining) and TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, TGF-β1, and PDGF-AB levels (ELISA) were determined in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Hydroxyproline (Hyp) content in the left pulmonary tissue was also determined (ELISA). The right pulmonary tissue was H&E-stained and assessed for the severity of pulmonary fibrosis using the Ashcroft scoring method. Compared with the BLM group, TED decreased inflammatory cell infiltration; number of macrophages (p < 0.05), neutrophils (p < 0.05), lymphocytes (p < 0.05); percentage of macrophages in the monocyte-macrophage system (p < 0.05), and levels of TNF-α (p < 0.01), IL-6 (p < 0.01), IL-8 (p < 0.05), TGF-β1 (p < 0.05), and PDGF-AB (p < 0.05) in the BALF. TED also reduced Hyp content (p < 0.05) in the pulmonary tissue and attenuated the BLM-induced deterioration in lung histopathology. Discussion and conclusions: TED can inhibit BLM-induced inflammation and fibrosis in the lungs of mice, which may be related to reduced inflammatory and fibrotic markers. These results could be further tested in humans through clinical studies.  aThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant [81160560]; Natural Science Foundation of Inner Mongolia, China under Grant [2011MS1131; 2015MS0809]; Science and Technology Planning Project of Inner Mongolia, China under Grant [20130414]; Academician expert workstation on Pharmacodynamic, Pharmacokinetics and Safety Evaluation research of Mongolian Medicines (Inner Mongolia Science & Technology Department) under Grant [(2016)66].  aPublisher supplied data  a81160560cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China  a2011MS1131a2015MS0809cNatural Science Foundation of Inner Mongolia, China  a20130414cScience and Technology Planning Project of Inner Mongolia, China  a(2016)66cAcademician expert workstation on Pharmacodynamic, Pharmacokinetics and Safety Evaluation research of Mongolian Medicines (Inner Mongolia Science & Technology Department)  aBYJJ-YF 201732cScience Foundation of Baotou Medical College, China0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aTribulus terrestris 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aclinical trials 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afibrosis 3ahistopathology 3ahumans 3ahydroxyproline 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3ainterleukin-8 3alungs 3alymphocytes 3amacrophages 3amales 3amice 3aneutrophils 3aplatelet-derived growth factor 3arespiratory tract diseases 3astaining 3atissues 3atransforming growth factor beta 1 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aAnti-fibrosis pharmaceutical 0aanti-inflammatory agent 0ableomycin-induced pulmonary inflammation 0apulmonary fibrosis 0ahydroxyproline1 aAn, Ming1 aBian, Mengni1 aYu, Shunbang1 aLiu, Changxiao1 aLiu, Quanli0 tPharmaceutical biology.g2019 Jan. 1, v. 57, no. 1 p.694-700dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2153x1744-51167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13880209.2019.16727543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03137naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001500141245007800156300001600234520154200250592002801792650001901820650003901839650003001878650001601908650002001924650002001944650001601964650002001980650001002000650001502010650002502025650001502050650003402065650001402099650001802113650002602131650001702157650001702174650001002191651001102201651001202212651001102224651001902235653001702254653001802271653002502289653003002314700002902344773012602373856007502499852000902574655001202583IND60696125120221122000146.0200522e20200521xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069612512DNAL7 a10.1017/wsc.2019.592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKudsk, Per10aPesticide Regulation in the European Union and the Glyphosate Controversy  ap. 214-222.  aThe glyphosate controversy before the renewal of the authorization of glyphosate in the European Union (EU) once again turned the spotlight on pesticide regulation in the EU. In the EU, pesticides are attracting more public attention than in other parts of the world, and many nongovernmental organizations specifically target pesticide regulation, trying to influence politicians and other decision makers. Following an overview of the EU pesticide legislation and the impact hitherto on EU agriculture, this paper outlines the glyphosate controversy and presents the outcome of desk studies conducted in Germany, the United Kingdom, France, and Sweden on the potential effects of a glyphosate ban on agricultural productivity and farm income. All studies concluded that the loss of income depends very much on farm type and cropping practice, but they all reached the conclusion that particularly no-tillage farming/conservation agriculture will be facing severe problems without glyphosate to control weeds and terminate cover crops. No-tillage/conservation agriculture is viewed as an effective strategy to prevent soil erosion and loss of nutrients, which could become larger problems without glyphosate. Other issues highlighted in the studies were the impact on resistance management, as glyphosate is largely seen as a “herbicide-resistance breaker.” Without glyphosate, fundamental changes in farming practices in the EU are required, and it is hard to imagine that they will come without a cost, at least in the short term.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aagricultural conservation practice 3aagricultural productivity 3acover crops 3adecision making 3aerosion control 3afarm income 3afarming systems 3afarms 3aglyphosate 3aherbicide resistance 3ano-tillage 3anongovernmental organizations 3anutrients 3apesticide law 3aresistance management 3asoil erosion 3aweed control 3aweeds 3aFrance 3aGermany 3aSweden 3aUnited Kingdom 0aImpact study 0apesticide ban 0aRegulation 1107/2009 0aSustainable Use Directive1 aMathiassen, Solvejg Kopp0 tWeed science.g2020 May 21, v. 68, no. 3 p.214-222dThe Weed Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl2174x0043-17457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/wsc.2019.593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03383naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002600188245013800214300001200352506007600364520159900440592002802039596008702067506003702154650002002191650001802211650001202229650001002241650001002251650002002261650001302281650002702294650001702321650003402338650001402372650001502386650001802401650001602419650001602435650001002451700002102461700002302482700002602505700002202531700002602553700002002579700002302599773011602622856008202738852000902820655001202829IND60644758420221207135354.0190623e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064475842DNAL7 a10.1007/s13205-019-1743-32doi7 aPMC65277312pmcid7 a311147432pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGurjar, Malkhan Singh13aDe novo genome sequencing and secretome analysis of Tilletia indica inciting Karnal bunt of wheat provides pathogenesis-related genes  ap. 219.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTilletia indica is an internationally quarantined fungal pathogen causing Karnal bunt of wheat. The present study carried out that the whole genome of T. indica was sequenced and identified transposable elements, pathogenicity-related genes using a comparative genomics approach. The T. indica genome assembly size of 33.7 MB was generated using Illumina and Pac Bio platforms with GC content of 55.0%. A total of 1737 scaffolds were obtained with N₅₀ of 58,667 bp. The ab initio gene prediction was performed using Ustilago maydis as the reference species. A total number of 10,113 genes were predicted with an average gene size of 1945 bp out of which functionally annotated genes were 7262. A total number of 3216 protein-coding genes were assigned in different categories. Out of a total number of 1877 transposable elements, gypsy had the highest count (573). Total 5772 simple sequence repeats were identified in the genome assembly, and the most abundant simple sequence repeat type was trinucleotide having 42% of total SSRs. The comparative genome analysis suggested 3751 proteins of T. indica had orthologs in five fungi, whereas 126 proteins were unique to T. indica. Secretome analysis revealed the presence of 1014 secretory proteins and few carbohydrate-active enzymes in the genome. Some putative candidate pathogenicity-related genes were identified in the genome. The whole genome of T. indica will provide a window to understand the pathogenesis mechanism, fungal life cycle, survival of teliospores, and novel strategies for management of Karnal bunt disease of wheat.  aPublisher supplied data  aICAR-G/CRP-Genomics/2015-2720/IARI-12-151cIndian Council of Agricultural Research0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aTilletia indica 3aUstilago zeae 3aenzymes 3afungi 3agenes 3agenome assembly 3agenomics 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apathogenesis 3apathogenesis-related proteins 3apathogens 3aprediction 3asmut diseases 3ateliospores 3atransposons 3awheat1 aAggarwal, Rashmi1 aJogawat, Abhimanyu1 aKulshreshtha, Deepika1 aŚarmā, Sapanā,1 aSolanke, Amolkumar U.1 aDubey, Himanshu1 aJain, Rakesh Kumar0 t3 Biotech.g2019 June, v. 9, no. 6 p.219-219dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:22884x2190-572X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-019-1743-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02853naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006100144245013100205300002000336520099800356592002801354650001201382650001601394650001001410650001301420650001301433650001701446650002001463650001401483650001601497650001601513650001701529650001101546650001801557650001301575653001601588653002501604653004801629653002901677653002801706700005601734700005901790700006001849700006101909700006101970700007402031773014202105856007902247852000902326655001202335IND60754965920220219000000.0211027e20211013xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075496592DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c174722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGilarska, Adriana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2517-167X10aAddressing the Osteoporosis Problem—Multifunctional Injectable Hybrid Materials for Controlling Local Bone Tissue Remodeling  ap. 49762-49779.  aNovel multifunctional biomimetic injectable hybrid systems were synthesized. The physicochemical as well as biological in vitro and in vivo tests demonstrated that they are promising candidates for bone tissue regeneration. The hybrids are composed of a biopolymeric collagen/chitosan/hyaluronic acid matrix and amine group-functionalized silica particles decorated with apatite to which the alendronate molecules were coordinated. The components of these systems were integrated and stabilized by cross-linking with genipin, a compound of natural origin. They can be precisely injected into the diseased tissue in the form of a viscous sol or a partially cross-linked hydrogel, where they can serve as scaffolds for locally controlled bone tissue regeneration/remodeling by supporting the osteoblast formation/proliferation and maintaining the optimal osteoclast level. These materials lack systemic toxicity. They can be particularly useful for the repair of small osteoporotic bone defects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapatite 3abiomimetics 3abones 3achitosan 3acollagen 3acrosslinking 3ahyaluronic acid 3ahydrogels 3aosteoblasts 3aosteoclasts 3aosteoporosis 3asilica 3atissue repair 3atoxicity 0abiopolymers 0ainjectable hydrogels 0asilica−apatite-based alendronate carriers 0abiocompatibility in vivo 0abone tissue engineering1 aHinz, Alicja1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8781-84271 aBzowska, Monika1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1921-03341 aDyduch, Grzegorz1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6293-83501 aKamiński, Kamil,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7421-67581 aNowakowska, Maria1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6456-54631 aLewandowska-Łańcucka, Joanna1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5447-49360 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Oct. 13, v. 13, no. 42 p.49762-49779dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c174723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02366naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245014800158300001800306520113100324592002801455650002901483650001201512650002301524650001001547650002201557650001601579650001301595650002201608650001101630650001801641700002301659700001801682700002301700700001701723700002601740773011801766856007501884852000901959655001201968IND60550333920171220000000.0160910e20140404xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055033392DNAL7 a10.1021/jo402645a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSheng, Huaming10aIdentification of the Sulfone Functionality in Protonated Analytes via Ion/Molecule Reactions in a Linear Quadrupole Ion Trap Mass Spectrometer  ap. 2883-2889.  aA tandem mass spectrometric method is presented for the rapid identification of drug metabolites that contain the sulfone functional group. This method is based on a gas-phase ion/molecule reaction of protonated sulfone analytes with trimethyl borate (TMB) that yields a diagnostic product ion, adduct-Me₂O, at high reaction efficiency. A variety of compounds with different functional groups, such as sulfoxides, hydroxylamines, N-oxides, anilines, phenol, an aliphatic amine, and an aliphatic alcohol, were examined to probe the selectivity of this reaction. Except for protonated sulfones, most of the protonated compounds react very slowly or not at all with TMB. Most importantly, none of them give the adduct-Me₂O product. A mechanism that explains the observed selectivity is proposed for the diagnostic reaction and is supported by quantum chemical calculations. The reaction was tested with the anti-inflammatory drug sulindac and its metabolite, sulindac sulfone, which were readily distinguished. The presence of other functionalities in addition to sulfone was found not to influence the diagnostic reactivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanti-inflammatory agents 3aborates 3achemical reactions 3agases 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3amoieties 3aorganic chemistry 3aphenol 3aspectrometers1 aWilliams, Peggy

Threonine 3 of histone H3 is highly conserved, but the significance of its phosphorylation is unclear, and the identity of the corresponding kinase in plants is unknown. Therefore, we characterized the candidate kinase in Arabidopsis thaliana, called AtHaspin. Recombinant AtHaspin in vitro phosphorylates histone H3 at threonine 3. Reduction of H3 threonine 3 phosphorylation level and reduced chromatin condensation in interphase nuclei by AtHaspin RNAi supports the proposition that this kinase is involved in histone H3 phosphorylation in vivo in mitotic cells. In addition, we provide a developmental function for a Haspin kinase. At the whole plant level, altered expression of the kinase induced pleiotropic phenotypes with defects in floral organs and vascular tissue. It reduced fertility and modified adventitious shoot apical meristems that then gave rise to plants with multi‐rosettes and multi‐shoots. Haspin mutant embryos frequently showed alteration in division plane orientation that could be traced back to the earliest divisions of embryo development, thus Haspin contributes to embryonic patterning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aRNA interference 3aadventitious shoots 3achromosomes 3aembryogenesis 3amitosis 3aphenotype 3aphosphorylation 3ashoot meristems 3athreonine 3avascular tissues 2aArabidopsisxembryologyxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCloning, Molecular 2aHistonesxmetabolism 2aInterphase 2aMitosis 2aPhosphorylation 2aProtein Processing, Post-Translational 2aProtein Serine-Threonine Kinasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA Interference 2aThreoninexmetabolism1 aMoghaddam, Ali Mohammad Banaei1 aSchubert, Veit1 aRutten, Twan1 aFuchs, Jörg,1 aDemidov, Dmitri1 aBlattner, Frank R.1 aHouben, Andreas0 tplant journal.g2011 Nov., v. 68, no. 3 p.443-454dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0960-74127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2011.04699.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03151naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011700163300001400280520157200294592002801866650002401894650002601918650002401944650001701968650001501985650001402000650002502014650002002039650002102059650002802080650004102108650001202149650001802161650001402179650001702193650001302210650002002223650001302243650001602256650001702272650001202289651001402301700001902315700002202334700002202356700001602378773013702394856008102531852000902612655001202621IND60626828820221120194445.0181230e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062682882DNAL7 a10.1007/s12275-019-8486-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOh, Junsang10aMetabolomic profiling reveals enrichment of cordycepin in senescence process of Cordyceps militaris fruit bodies  ap. 54-63.  aCordyceps militaris is a species of Cordyceps that is classified in the Cordycipitaceae family and is well known in East Asia as a traditional medicinal mushroom. Its artificial fruit body has been widely cultivated for commercial use in cosmetics, functional food, and medicine. To explore the metabolites associated with fruit body development, we conducted gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses based on developmental stage, which was divided into the growth period (stage 1, stage 2, and stage 3) and aging period (stage 4). We detected 39 biochemical metabolites associated with nucleotide, carbohydrate, and amino acid metabolism. Cordycepin, one of the representative bioactive compounds in C. militaris, was significantly enriched in stage 4 of aging period and is associated with glucose accumulation. The accumulation of cordycepin in stage 4 of aging period also seems to be related to the glutamine and glutamic acid pathway. Our results also showed enrichment of other bioactive compounds such as mannitol and xylitol in stage 4 of aging period. Our metabolomic profiling based on the developmental stages of C. militaris is useful for exploring bioactive compounds (e.g., cordycepin, mannitol, GABA, and xylitol) that are enriched in stage 4 of aging period and understanding the biosynthetic mechanisms associated with cordycepin production. Through optimization of fruit body cultivation by selecting stage 4 of aging period as a harvesting time, our findings can be utilized in food and medical applications of C. militaris in future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCordyceps militaris 3aamino acid metabolism 3abioactive compounds 3abiosynthesis 3acordycepin 3acosmetics 3adevelopmental stages 3afruiting bodies 3afunctional foods 3agamma-aminobutyric acid 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aglucose 3aglutamic acid 3aglutamine 3aharvest date 3amannitol 3amedicinal fungi 3amedicine 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3axylitol 3aEast Asia1 aYoon, Deok-Hyo1 aShrestha, Bhushan1 aChoi, Hyung-Kyoon1 aSung, Gi-Ho0 tjournal of microbiology.g2019 Jan., v. 57, no. 1 p.54-63dThe Microbiological Society of KoreawJournal:jnl4619042x1225-88737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12275-019-8486-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02523naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245015700171500001400328520102700342592002801369650001301397650001501410650001101425650002201436650001801458650001601476650001201492650001301504650001101517650001301528650002701541650001201568650001501580650001401595650001801609650001401627653001501641653002201656653002001678653003701698653002501735700002201760700005601782773010001838856008201938852000902020655001202029IND60713143120221116191330.0201209e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071314312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tca.2020.1788002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmad, Mouhamad Ali10aCalorimetric screening of co-operative effects in adsorption of Co(II) on γ-alumina surface in the presence of Co-complexing anions in aqueous solution  aNAL-light  aThe understanding of the mechanism of co-operative adsorption of Co(II) cations and acetate or citrate anions onto γ-Al₂O₃ from aqueous solutions has been refined on the basis of comparison between the enthalpies of displacement measured in single-solute and bi-solute systems by means of isothermal titration calorimetry. The data processing procedures were adapted to take into account the occurrence of a cobalt-ligand complex in the bulk solution. Considering the bridging role of the adsorbed cobalt cations as a starting point to reproduce the enthalpy of displacement in the cobalt-acetate system, each ligand unit was suggested to bind preferentially to more than one adsorbed metal species and to interact additionally with some electrically neutral binding sites on the oxide surface. In the case of cobalt-citrate couple, the formation of a 1:1 stoichiometry solid-ligand-metal complex and simultaneous adsorption of cobalt cations as bidentate inner-sphere complexes reproduced best the experimental data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aadsorption 3aanions 3aaqueous solutions 3abinding sites 3acalorimetry 3acations 3acitrates 3acobalt 3aenthalpy 3ainformation processing 3aligands 3aoccurrence 3ascreening 3astoichiometry 3atitration 0aγ-alumina 0aCobalt adsorption 0aOrganic ligands 0aIsothermal titration calorimetry 0aCo-operative effects1 aPrelot, Benedicte1 aZajac, Jerzy1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9529-46240 tThermochimica acta.g2020 Dec., v. 694 p.178800-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11747x0040-60317nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tca.2020.1788003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04260naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100009800192245008600290300001500376506007600391520208000467592002802547506003702575650002202612650003002634650002702664650001502691650001902706650001502725650001002740650001202750650001102762650001402773650002602787650001402813650000702827650000902834650001202843650002702855650002002882650001802902653001302920653002202933653002102955653001202976653002002988653000803008653000803016653000803024653000903032653000903041653000903050653000803059653001103067653001103078653001203089653000903101653000703110653001003117653000803127653000803135700010603143700002003249700002103269773011703290856008603407852000903493655001203502IND60637978720221207054911.0191031e20190715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063797872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.04.0762doi7 aPMC65298772pmcid7 a310289562pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdugna, Amare T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9628-7082 https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9628-708210aFate of filter materials and microbial communities during vermifiltration process  ap. 98-105.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe fate of filter materials and microbial communities during the vermifiltration process were studied for 5 months while treating the concentrated greywater. Four filters were filled with 10 cm gravel of which a layer of medium size gravel (5 cm thickness, aggregate size 20–40 mm) at the bottom and a layer of coarse gravel (5 cm thickness, aggregate size 10–20 mm) at the top, then filled with 20 cm sand (d60 = 0.2 mm, d10 = 0.118 mm). Finally, Vermifilter 1 (VF1), control unit and Vermifilter 2 (VF2), were filled with 40 cm fine sawdust (0.05–5 mm) but Vermifilter 3 (VF3), was filled with 40 cm cow dung (0.05–5 mm). Three filters were inoculated with 200 individuals of Eudrilus eugeniae except for the control unit which was filled with sawdust. Five sampling ports were installed on the wall of the filters at 10 cm intervals with reference to the surface of the top layer. Three of the filters were supplied with concentrated greywater and VF1 was supplied with drinking water at the hydraulic loading rate of 16 L m−2.d−1 on batch basis, i.e., four times a day at 8:00 a.m., 11:00 a.m., 2:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. Weekly, samples from influent and effluent, and monthly, samples of filter materials collected via sampling ports, were collected and analyzed.The removal efficiencies of biological oxygen demand (BOD5), total chemical oxygen demand (tCOD), and dissolved chemical oxygen demand (dCOD) of VF2 and VF3 were 5–7% higher than the control unit, but little differences were observed in terms of total suspended solids (TSS). However, the removal efficiencies of nutrients for the control unit was slightly better than VF2 and VF3. The pH and Moisture content (MC) of filter materials increased along the depth, but percentage of volatile solids to total solids (VS/TS) decreased through time due to the high number of microbial communities and earthworms dominating the top layer compared to the bottom. The performance of VF2-sawdust was slightly better than VF3-cow dung to treat concentrated greywater.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEudrilus eugeniae 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3achemical oxygen demand 3acow manure 3adrinking water 3aearthworms 3afeces 3afilters 3agravel 3agreywater 3amicrobial communities 3anutrients 3apH 3asand 3asawdust 3atotal suspended solids 3avermifiltration 3awater content 0aCow dung 0aEudrilus eugeniae 0aFilter materials 0aSawdust 0aVermifiltration 0aVF1 0aVF2 0aVF3 0aBOD5 0atCOD 0adCOD 0aTSS 0aNO3− 0aNO2− 0aPO43− 0aNH4+ 0aMC 0aVS/TS 0aTKN 0aCFU1 aAndrianisa, Harinaivo A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2490-4958 https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2490-49581 aKonate, Yacouba1 aMaiga, Amadou H.0 tJournal of environmental management.g2019 July 15, v. 242 p.98-105dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.04.0763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02252naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245008000155300002000235520124000255592002801495650001201523650001401535650001601549650001401565650001901579650002501598650002201623700001801645700001601663700001501679773013601694856007501830852000901905655001201914IND60538146020221121190110.0160815e20140827xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053814602DNAL7 a10.1021/ie501474t2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Mengxi10aMicroscale Two-Phase Flow Structure in a Modified Gas–Solid Fluidized Bed  ap. 13475-13487.  aTransient signals were registered in a modified fluidized bed and statistically analyzed. Particle agglomerates in the emulsion were identified from signals and the agglomerate properties were investigated. The volume fraction of the bubble phase varied from 0.16 to 0.52 with operation pattern and spatial positions. Mean solid holdup and its standard deviation inside bubbles significantly increased when operation pattern transitioned from bubbling fluidization to turbulent fluidization, while the increasing tendency leveled off in the turbulent regime. The volume fraction of particle agglomerates in the emulsion decreased with increasing superficial gas velocity, varying over the range of 0.2–0.65 with flow regimes. Agglomerate solid holdup slightly fluctuated in the range of 0.608–0.63, barely influenced by switch of operation pattern. Agglomerate frequency varied over the range of 1.5–3.7 Hz and the duration time was <0.3 s for most cases. The correlations of agglomerate volume fraction and frequency were proposed. The terminal velocity and the size of the effective agglomerates in the emulsion phase were calculated via a modified Richardson–Zaki equation and found to be 4.16 m/s and 1.19 mm, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3abubbles 3aemulsions 3aengineering 3aequations 3afluidized beds 3astatistical analysis 3aterminal velocity1 aShen, Zhiyuan1 aYang, Lijun1 aLu, Chunxi0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2014 Aug. 27, v. 53, no. 34 p.13475-13487dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie501474t3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03377naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002400145245013400169300001800303500002000321520231500341592002802656650002802684650001602712650001202728650001102740650001002751650002402761700002002785700002002805700002302825773010302848856007902951852000903030655001203039IND60571785820221119111738.0170712e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057178582DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2435.126702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerschut, Thomas A.10aDisentangling associational effects: both resource density and resource frequency affect search behaviour in complex environments  ap. 1826-1833.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNeighbouring resources have been found to either decrease or increase the likelihood that a consumer organism attacks a focal resource. These phenomena are referred to as associational resistance (AR) and associational susceptibility (AS), respectively. While associational effects have been observed in various field studies, little is known on how resource heterogeneity can cause associational effects. We used a laboratory approach in which we studied the effects of resource density and frequency in the search behaviour of Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism for olfactory‐guided behaviour in insects. We first determined whether D. melanogaster could discriminate between odour sources that differ quantitatively. Secondly, we determined what the effect of resource density and frequency was on the search behaviour of D. melanogaster by combining these resources into various patch arrangements. Finally, we used the outcome of our experiments to disentangle the role of resource density and frequency in associational effects. We found that D. melanogaster has the ability to discriminate between quantitatively different resources, but that the attraction to resource density is constrained by an optimum after which attraction decreases. Furthermore, in heterogeneous environments, flies showed a strong preference towards the more apparent resource, leading to AS for the more apparent resources and AR for the less apparent resource. The strength of this interaction increased with a decreasing frequency of the more apparent resource. These results imply that D. melanogaster mainly selects patches at the level of individual resources. Consequently, when a patch contains qualitatively different resources, the more apparent resource will attract a higher number of flies than the less apparent resource irrespective of the frequency of the apparent resource within the patch. Our study shows that associational effects can be explained by determining the hierarchical level at which a consumer selects its resources. When a consumer selects resources at the individual level rather than at the patch level, our results can be used to explain the population dynamics of host plants and their associated consumers under field conditions.

In this work, peptidomic analyses from two times of day were examined to characterize variation in SCN peptides using three different label-free quantitation approaches: spectral count, spectra index and SIEVE. Of the 448 identified peptides, 207 peptides were analyzed by two label-free methods, spectral count and spectral index. There were 24 peptides with significant (adjusted p-value < 0.01) differential peptide abundances between daytime and nighttime, including multiple peptides derived from secretogranin II, cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript, and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1 inhibitor. Interestingly, more peptides were analyzable and had significantly different abundances between the two time points using the spectral count and spectral index methods than with a prior analysis using the SIEVE method with the same data. The results of this study reveal the importance of using the appropriate data analysis approaches for label-free relative quantitation of peptides. The detection of significant changes in so rich a set of neuropeptides reflects the dynamic nature of the SCN and the number of influences such as feeding behavior on circadian rhythm. Using spectral count and spectral index, peptide level changes are correlated to time of day, suggesting their key role in circadian function.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aamphetamine 3acircadian rhythm 3acocaine 3adiurnal variation 3afeeding behavior 3aneuropeptides 3arats 3asubtilisin1 aLee, Ji Eun1 aZamdborg, Leonid1 aAtkins, Norman1 aMitchell, Jennifer W.1 aLi, Mingxi1 aGillette, Martha U.1 aKelleher, Neil L.1 aSweedler, Jonathan V.0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2014 Jan. 07, v. 86, no. 1 p.443-452dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ac40233783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03237naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245008600177300001800263520189700281592002802178650001302206650001302219650001202232650001602244650001502260650002602275650001902301650001502320650002202335650001402357650002102371650001502392650001902407650003002426650001802456650002002474650002702494650002502521650001602546651001002562773011702572856008102689852000902770655001202779IND60572549420221119101306.0170717e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057254942DNAL7 a10.1007/s11368-015-1253-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchwitzguébel, Jean-Paul10aPhytoremediation of soils contaminated by organic compounds: hype, hope and facts  ap. 1492-1502.  aPURPOSE: The present opinion paper is focused on the phytoremediation of organic pollutants and is based on the lectures given by the author during the International Congress of Phytoremediation of Polluted Soils, held at Vigo, Spain, 29–30 July 2014. The aim of this position paper is (1) to highlight some progress made within the last few years (after the end of COST Action 859 in October 2009) in the phytoremediation of selected organic pollutants and (2) to suggest new research and approaches, which seem important and promising in the opinion of the author to make this environmentally friendly remediation technique more attractive and more successful. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Depending on the type of soil to be treated, as well as on the xenobiotic contaminants, their concentration and ageing, different approaches can be considered and are briefly presented with some recent and successful applications, but also highlighting their limitations and needs for future developments: phytoextraction of hydrophobic xenobiotic compounds like polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs), phytodegradation of xenobiotics and its possible impacts on primary and secondary metabolism of the plant and phytostimulation of rhizospheric microorganisms by root exudates for the rhizodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons. OUTLOOK: Finally, some promising approaches are suggested for overcoming the bottlenecks and making phytoremediation a reliable, mature and sustainable technology: how to deal with mixed pollution; the potential of endophytic bacteria; possible improvements by soil amendments and co-cropping; validation of laboratory results by field experimentation; evolution of regulations from the total concentration of a pollutant to its bioavailable fraction; and the use of biomass for added-value products, fine chemicals and biofuels in biorefineries or the production of ornamental plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3abiorefining 3aendophytes 3afield experimentation 3ahydrophobicity 3ametabolism 3aornamental plants 3apetroleum 3aphytoremediation 3apollutants 3apolluted soils 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3aroot exudates 3asoil amendments 3asustainable technology 3avalue-added products 3axenobiotics 3aSpain0 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2017 May, v. 17, no. 5 p.1492-1502dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1439-01087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-015-1253-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03349naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245010500169300001800274520183400292592002802126650001902154650001002173650001502183650001302198650002302211650001902234650002002253650002002273650002902293650001602322650001102338650001402349650001702363650001602380651000902396653003002405653003602435653002902471653001602500653002002516653001702536700005802553700001902611700001702630773010002647856008702747852000902834655001202843IND60610882320221121211610.0201202e20181015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061088232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.07.0672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsadi, Ehsan12aA bi-objective stochastic location-inventory-routing model for microalgae-based biofuel supply chain  ap. 2235-2261.  aThis paper introduces a viable two-objective model for the design of algae biofuel production and distribution network with integrated formulation of location, inventory and routing decisions. The model consists of an algae biomass production facility, several distribution facilities, multiple extraction sites, and transport vehicles. In this model, the system implementation cost and its pollution impacts via CO₂ emission are considered simultaneously. Our model allows the decision maker to determine the number and location of distribution facilities, the allocation of extraction sites to these facilities, the routes by which extraction sites need to be served, and the minimum inventory level that should be maintained at each distribution facility to achieve the mentioned objectives. In an attempt to bridge the gaps in the literature, the paper tries to incorporate the uncertainty in parameters and also a queueing system into integrated formulation of location, inventory and routing decisions and develop a viable model with economic and environmental objectives considered simultaneously. Since the proposed model belongs to the class of NP-hard problems, two multi-objective metaheuristic algorithms, namely MOPSO and NSGA-II, are tested for solving the formulated model. For this purpose, Taguchi method is used to set the parameters of these algorithms, and then their results are compared in terms of five evaluation criteria. These comparisons show that, for the formulated model, NSGA-II outperforms MOPSO in the majority of evaluation criteria. Finally, the proposed model is evaluated with the real data related to the implementation of an algae biofuel production and distribution network in Iran and the results are further examined. The results demonstrate the good performance of the proposed model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTaguchi method 3aalgae 3aalgorithms 3abiofuels 3abiomass production 3acarbon dioxide 3adecision making 3afuel production 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ainventories 3amodels 3apollution 3asupply chain 3auncertainty 3aIran 0aBi-objective optimization 0aMicroalgae biofuel supply chain 0aMetaheuristic algorithms 0aUncertainty 0aQueueing theory 0aCO2 emission1 aHabibi, Farhad1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1328-47461 aNickel, Stefan1 aSahebi, Hadi0 tApplied energy.g2018 Oct. 15, v. 228 p.2235-2261dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.07.0673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02927naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245007900162300001400241500001500255520151200270592002801782650002001810650001401830650001601844650001501860650001301875650001401888650001001902650000901912650002201921650001601943650000901959650002601968650002101994651001302015653002002028653002502048653001002073653002102083653001002104653001302114700001302127700002002140700001302160700001402173700001302187773010902200856007902309852000902388655001202397IND60481024720160819000000.0160201e20160126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048102472DNAL7 a10.1515/cerce-2015-00382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmānullāh,10aFoliar Nitrogen Management for Improving Growth and Yield of Dryland Wheat  ap. 23-31.  a2019-12-06  aFoliar nitrogen (N) application is considered an important factor affecting phenology, growth, yield, and yield components of dryland wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). A field experiment was conducted to study effects of foliar N on dryland wheat (cv. Prisabk-2004) at the Agronomy Research Farm, The University of Agriculture Peshawar, Pakistan, during winter 2010-2011. The experiment was laid out in randomized complete block design using four replications. A plot size of 3 m by 4 m, having 8 rows, 4 m long and 30 cm apart was used. A total of 80 kg N ha⁻¹ in the form of urea was applied. Out of 80 kg N ha⁻¹, 70 kg N ha⁻¹ was applied to the soil at sowing time, and the remaining 10 kg N ha⁻¹ was applied in the form of foliar spray (2% N). The required foliar N was applied in various combinations (splits) at different growth stages viz. 30, 60, 90 and 120 days after emergence (DAE). Phenological development (days to anthesis and physiological maturity) was delayed, yield components and yield increased significantly (p ≤ 0.05) with foliar N over control (water spray without N). Wheat grain yield increased to the highest level (4427 kg ha⁻¹) when 100 % foliar N was applied (no split) at 90 DAE, followed by 4050 kg ha⁻¹ at 120 DAE, while the control (no foliar N) resulted in the lowest grain yield (2573 kg ha⁻¹). We concluded from this study that 2 % foliar N application in a single split either at 90 or 120 DAE could improve wheat productivity under dryland condition.  aPublisher supplied data 3afoliar spraying 3aflowering 3asowing date 3aarid lands 3anitrogen 3aphenology 3awheat 3asoil 3aTriticum aestivum 3agrain yield 3aurea 3afield experimentation 3ayield components 3aPakistan 0aMoisture stress 0adevelopmental stages 0aWheat 0aYield components 0aYield 0aFoliar N1 aAlam, I.1 aHidāyatullāh,1 aKhan, I.1 aKumar, M.1 aShah, A.0 tCercetări agronomice în Moldova.g2016 Jan. 26, v. 48, no. 3 p.23-31dDe Gruyter Openx2067-18657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/cerce-2015-00383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02861naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245008400163300001600247520181500263592002802078650001702106650001602123650001402139650002402153650002202177650002702199650001102226650001402237650001402251650001102265651001402276773013202290856008002422852000902502655001202511IND60651344620221117215922.0190711e20140415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065134462DNAL7 a10.3390/resources30204162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLane, Ruth.,10aUnderstanding the Dynamic Character of Value in Recycling Metals from Australia  ap. 416-431.  aIndustrial ecology (IE) argues the need for an efficient materials economy based on recycling where environmental degradation associated with inputs of new materials and outputs of waste or pollution is minimal. There is often an assumption that efficiency in the use of materials equates to economic efficiency; however, this is not necessarily the case. Central to this tension between engineering and economic approaches to materials efficiency are different conceptual framings of value. Because a large scale shift towards valuing waste materials as future resources involves changes to existing practices of a great many actors and organizations, ranging from consumers and household disposal practices, through to government agencies and multi-national corporations, it cannot be assumed that all operate with similar conceptions of value. This paper reviews current understandings of value in IE and argues that they need to be expanded to accommodate approaches to valuing used goods and materials that manifest across different spatial scales, from household disposal practices to national policy to global production networks (GPNs). The paper focuses, in particular, on understandings of value relevant to metals recycling in Australia and contrast material flow models from IE with other models of material flows and transformations available in the social sciences, including anthropological analysis of the movement of objects through different regimes of value within society and analysis in economic geography that highlights spatial and structural dimensions influential in commodity chains and networks for used products and materials. It concludes by reflecting on the significance of the dynamic and creative tensions inherent in the production of value for recycled metals from Australia.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorporations 3aengineering 3ageography 3agovernment agencies 3aissues and policy 3amaterial flow analysis 3ametals 3apollution 3arecycling 3awastes 3aAustralia0 tResources.g2014 Apr. 15, v. 3, no. 2 p.416-431dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21558x2079-92767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/resources30204163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02656naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245011300164520116000277592002801437650002701465650002801492650001301520650001801533650002001551650001001571650001301581650001401594650001501608650001801623650001301641650002601654651001001680653002101690653001401711653001401725653002601739653002501765653002001790700001201810700001401822700001701836700002001853700001601873700001401889700002001903773012101923856008502044852000902129655001202138IND60781837120221119075904.0220816e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078183712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pestbp.2022.1051642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Wenyu10aInvestigation of resistance mechanisms to bentazone in multiple resistant Amaranthus retroflexus populations  aRedroot amaranth (Amaranthus retroflexus L.) is a noxious weed that affects soybean production in China. Experiments were conducted to determine the molecular basis of resistance to bentazone. Whole-plant dose-response experiments showed that two populations (R1 and R2) exhibited resistance to bentazone with resistance indices of 9.01 and 6.85, respectively. Sequencing of the psbA gene revealed no amino acid substitution in the two populations. qRT–PCR analysis verified that psbA gene expression in R1 and R2 populations was increased significantly after treatment with bentazone, which was 3-fold and 5-fold higher than that in S1 and S2 populations, respectively. The P450 inhibitor malathion significantly reduced the level of resistance in the R1 and R2 populations when used prior to bentazone treatment. The R1 population exhibited multiple resistance to thifensulfuron-methyl and lactofen, caused by target site mutations (Asp-376-Glu in ALS, Arg-128-Gly in PPO2). In conclusion, increased gene expression of the psbA gene and enhanced herbicide metabolism seem to be the basis of resistance to bentazone in these A. retroflexus populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmaranthus retroflexus 3aamino acid substitution 3abentazon 3adose response 3agene expression 3agenes 3alactofen 3amalathion 3ametabolism 3anoxious weeds 3asoybeans 3athifensulfuron methyl 3aChina 0aRedroot amaranth 0aBentazone 0apsbA gene 0aResistance mechanisms 0aMetabolic resistance 0aGene expression1 aCao, Yi1 aLiu, Zhen1 aWei, Shouhui1 aHuang, Hongjuan1 aLan, Yuning1 aSun, Ying1 aHuang, Zhaofeng0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2022 Aug., v. 186 p.105164-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl1414x0048-35757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pestbp.2022.1051643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02284naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245007900170500001900249520104900268592002801317650002601345650001801371650001901389650002101408650001301429650001501442650002101457653001601478653001601494653002401510653001901534653001501553700004001568700002601608700001801634700002001652773010601672856008701778852000901865655001201874IND60717693120221118022800.0201213e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071769312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2020.1244082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBani, Alessia10aInfluence of photobioreactor set-up on the survival of microalgae inoculum  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCultivation of specific microalgae is still difficult in an industrial setup as contamination and balancing the economic cost are not always possible. Understanding the ecology of cultivation of microalgae is therefore necessary to implement stable production. The aim of the study was to understand how different types of photobioreactors and types of culture medium influenced the survival of a specific microalgae inoculum, S. almeriensis. The bacterial and microalgae community were studied using Illumina sequencing. Only the closed configuration was able to maintain the inoculated species while all the other systems developed a different eukaryotic community due to contamination and the higher fitness of contaminants. Photobioreactor configuration was more important than medium in shaping the eukaryotes community, while the bacterial community was influenced strongly by both. Results showed that even a well-adapted strain is maintained only in the closed reactor while the open reactors are colonized by a multispecies consortium.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacterial communities 3aculture media 3aeconomic costs 3aeukaryotic cells 3ainoculum 3amicroalgae 3aphotobioreactors 0aBioreactors 0aMetagenomic 0aMicrobial community 0aS. almeriensis 0aWastewater1 aFernandez, Francisco Gabriel Acién1 aD'Imporzano, Giuliana1 aParati, Katia1 aAdani, Fabrizio0 tBioresource technology.g2021 Jan., v. 320 p.124408-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2020.1244083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03046naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245013400162300002000296520179600316592002802112650002302140650001502163650002302178650002202201650001402223650001802237650001902255650001902274653001802293653000902311653001902320653001302339653002002352700001502372700001702387700001502404773013002419856007802549852000902627655001202636IND60549137120221120165405.0160907e20160907xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054913712DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b069682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Yanmin10aEffects of Organic Molecules with Different Structures and Absorption Bandwidth on Modulating Photoresponse of MoS2 Photodetector  ap. 23362-23370.  aOrganic dye molecules possessing modulated optical absorption bandwidth and molecular structures can be utilized as sensitizing species for the enhancement of photodetector performance of semiconductor via photoinduced charge transfer mechanism. MoS₂ photodetector were modified by drop-casting of methyl orange (MO), rhodamine 6G (R6G), and methylene blue (MB) with different molecular structures and extinction coefficients, and enhanced photodetector performance in terms of photocurrent, photoresponsity, photodetectivity, and external quantum efficiency were obtained after modification of MO, R6G, and MB, respectively. Furthermore, dyes showed different modulating abilities for photodetector performance after combination with MoS₂, mainly due to the variation of molecular structures and optical absorption bandwidth. Among tested dyes, deposition of MB onto monolayer MoS₂ grown by CVD resulted in photocurrent ∼20 times as high as pristine MoS₂ due to favorable photoinduced charge transfer of photoexcited electrons from flat MB molecules to the MoS₂ layer. Meanwhile, the corresponding photoresponsivity, photodetectivity, and an external quantum efficiency are 9.09 A W¹–, 2.2 × 10¹¹ Jones, 1729% at 610 nm, respectively. Photoinduced electron-transfer measurements of the pristine MoS₂ and dye-modified MoS₂ indicated the n-doping effect of dye molecules on the MoS₂. Additionally, surface-enhanced Raman measurements also confirmed the direct correlation with charge transfer between organic dyes and MoS₂ taking into account the chemically enhanced Raman scattering mechanism. Present work provides a new clue for the manipulation of high-performance of two-dimensional layered semiconductor-based photodetector via the combination of organic dyes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aabsorption 3achemical structure 3aelectron transfer 3aelectrons 3amethyl orange 3amethylene blue 3asemiconductors 0aphotodetector 0aMoS2 0adye-sensitized 0an-doping 0acharge transfer1 aZheng, Wei1 aQiu, Yunfeng1 aHu, PingAn0 tACS applied materials .g2016 Sept. 07, v. 8, no. 35 p.23362-23370dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.6b069683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02080naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002800135245007400163300001600237500002000253520093000273592002801203650001101231650002101242650001401263650001601277650002101293650001901314650001701333650001901350650000801369650001401377650002201391650002601413651001101439700002101450773013001471852000901601856007201610655001201682IND9202987920221119234521.0211024e199008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920298792DNAL7 a10.2307/32357862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBradshaw, Richard H.

Frequent disturbances by fire, blow‐down, insect attack and flood have been the chief influence on vegetation dynamics. The gradual climatically induced replacement of Betula pubescens by Picea abies is superimposed on the disturbance dynamics. Picea first became established during the Little Ice Age, which was the longest period without fire in the record. A thin layer of volcanic ash from Iceland confirms the chronology at the onset of the Little Ice Age. The present importance of Pinus sylvestris and Ericaceae on the island is a product of a recent increase in disturbance frequency. The disturbance regime ensures that the communities stay in equilibrium with prevailing climate.  aPublisher supplied data 3apollen 3aBetula pubescens 3aEricaceae 3aPicea abies 3aPinus sylvestris 3aboreal forests 3afire ecology 3aforest ecology 3amor 3adisasters 3aplant communities 3aecological succession 3aSweden1 aZackrisson, Olle0 tJournal of vegetation science.g1990 Aug., v. 1, no. 4 p.519-528dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl46820x1100-92337nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2307/32357863Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03138naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001500145245016800160300001400328520168200342592002802024650002502052650001902077650002702096650001702123650002502140650001302165650001002178650001102188650002002199650002402219650001702243650002102260650001702281650001402298650001002312650001002322653001602332653001202348653001002360653002002370700002102390700001502411700002102426773010902447856007902556852000902635655001202644IND60481024820160819000000.0160201e20160126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048102482DNAL7 a10.1515/cerce-2015-00392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhajeh, M.10aImprovement of Germination Characteristics and Enhancement of Antioxidant Enzymes Activity of Safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.) Aged Seeds by Used of Gibberellin  ap. 33-41.  aSeed priming is one of the methods that can be taken to counteract the adverse effects of abiotic stress, also Seed priming treatments have been used to reduce the damage of aging and invigorate their performance in many crops. Objective of this study was to evaluation the effect of gibberellin on germination characteristics and antioxidant enzymes of safflower seeds after aging. Experimental design was a factorial one with complete randomized design with three replications. The first factor was priming by gibberellin (0 and 50 ppm) and non-primed seeds (control) and the secondary factor was combinations of four levels of aging (0, 1, 3 and 5 days of aging, at 43°C). The results showed that the priming and aging effects on germination percentage, germination index, normal seedling percentage, seedling length, vigor index, catalase and ascorbate peroxidase were significant, but on mean time to germination not significant. Results showed that, the highest germination characteristics such as; germination percentage, germination index, normal seedling percentage, seedling length, vigor index, catalase and ascorbate peroxidase were attained from priming by gibberellins, under non aged conditions. Also, our results indicated that seed aging is related to decrease of enzymes activity and may contribute to low seed germination efficiency, also priming increases enzyme activity and increases enzyme activity with priming treatment may contribute to improve germination characteristics. The general decreases in enzyme activity in the seed lowers the respiratory capacity, which in turn lowers both the energy (ATP) and assimilates supply of the germinating seed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarthamus tinctorius 3aabiotic stress 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aantioxidants 3aascorbate peroxidase 3acatalase 3acrops 3aenergy 3aenzyme activity 3aexperimental design 3agibberellins 3aseed germination 3aseed priming 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3avigor 0aGermination 0aPriming 0aAging 0aEnzyme activity1 aTabatabaei, S.A.1 aAnsari, O.1 aSharif Zadeh, F.0 tCercetări agronomice în Moldova.g2016 Jan. 26, v. 48, no. 3 p.33-41dDe Gruyter Openx2067-18657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/cerce-2015-00393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02586naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001600192245014600208500001900354506007600373520117100449592002801620506003701648650001501685650001601700650001101716650001401727650001701741650002601758653002001784653001701804653001401821700001801835700001901853700002001872700002001892700002301912700001701935773009401952856008502046852000902131655001202140IND60690761920221207082710.0200508e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069076192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2018.e008532doi7 aPMC61971732pmcid7 a303645002pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHo, Michael10aComparison of simultaneous multi-slice readout-segmented EPI and conventional single-shot EPI for diffusion tensor imaging of the ulnar nerve  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTo compare conventional single-shot echo planar imaging (ss-EPI) and simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) readout-segmented EPI (rs-EPI) for magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the ulnar nerve.This study was approved by the local ethics committee. Ten healthy volunteers (mean age 30.4 ± 4.01 years; range 25–36 years) underwent 3T DTI of the ulnar nerve at the level of the cubital tunnel. DTI was performed based on ss-EPI as well as SMS rs-EPI sequences. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), image quality, and DTI parameters in the ulnar nerve (fractional anisotropy, FA; mean diffusivity, MD) were compared between the two sequences by two independent radiologists.Acquisition time was 5:12 min for ss-EPI and 5:18 min for SMS rs-EPI. Between the two sequences, no significant differences were found for derived DTI measures FA (p = 0.11) and MD values (p = 0.93). Compared to conventional ss-EPI, SMS rs-EPI yielded significantly less ghosting artifacts (p = 0.04) but inferior nerve depiction (p = 0.001) and worse overall image quality (p = 0.008).SMS rs-EPI is not advantageous over ss-EPI in DTI of the ulnar nerve at the level of the cubital tunnel.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanisotropy 3adiffusivity 3aethics 3amagnetism 3anerve tissue 3asignal-to-noise ratio 0aMedical imaging 0aNeuroscience 0aNeurology1 aBecker, Anton1 aUlbrich, Erika1 aManoliu, Andrei1 aKuhn, Félix P.1 aEberhard, Matthias1 aFilli, Lukas0 tHeliyon.g2018 Oct., v. 4, no. 10 p.e00853-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2018.e008533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02289naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245013700173300001600310520096200326592002801288650001701316650001701333650001901350650003001369650001601399650001101415650001401426650000901440650001101449650001201460650001501472650001601487650002201503650001401525650002001539650002301559650001901582650001101601700002101612700002301633773011101656856005501767852000901822655001201831IND4487619620221116221144.0120815e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448761962DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1744-7348.2012.00563.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaslam, Marouane10aElevated CO2 may impair the beneficial effect of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi on the mineral and phytochemical quality ofÂ lettuce  ap. 180-191.  aArbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can improve growth and nutritional quality of greenhouseâgrown lettuces cultivated at ambient CO2. Moreover, mycorrhizal symbiosis is predicted to be important in defining plant responses to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Our main objective was to assess the effects of elevated CO2 on growth and nutritional quality of greenhouseâgrown lettuces inoculated or not with AMF. Results showed that the accumulation of mineral nutrients (e.g. P, Cu, Fe) and antioxidant compounds (carotenoids, phenolics, anthocyanins, ascorbate) induced by AMF in leaves of lettuces cultivated at ambient CO2 may diminish or disappear under elevated CO2. It is hypothesized that a relevant quantity of photoassimilates could be used for improving shoot growth and spreading mycorrhizal colonization in detriment to the secondary metabolism. However, important differences can be found among different cultivars of lettuces.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidants 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3acarotenoids 3acopper 3acultivars 3airon 3aleaves 3alettuce 3ametabolism 3amycorrhizae 3amycorrhizal fungi 3anutrients 3anutritive value 3aphenolic compounds 3aplant response 3ashoots1 aGarmendia, Idoia1 aGoicoechea, Nieves0 tAnnals of applied biology.g2012 Sept., v. 161, no. 2 p.180-191dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0003-47467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7348.2012.00563.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03179naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245010600161300002000267520157400287592002801861650001501889650002301904650002001927650001501947650003301962650002201995650001102017650001402028650001702042650001802059650001402077650001302091650001502104650001602119650002602135650002402161653004002185653002002225653003102245653002502276653003102301700001402332700001302346700001502359700001602374700001702390700001402407773012702421856008002548852000902628655001202637IND60549137220221120191326.0160907e20160907xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054913722DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b070172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKou, Bei-Bei10aDNA Enzyme-Decorated DNA Nanoladders as Enhancer for Peptide Cleavage-Based Electrochemical Biosensor  ap. 22869-22874.  aHerein, we developed a label-free electrochemical biosensor for sensitive detection of matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7) based on DNA enzyme-decorated DNA nanoladders as enhancer. A peptide and single-stranded DNA S₁-modified platinum nanoparticles (P₁-PtNPs-S₁), which served as recognition nanoprobes, were first immobilized on electrode. When target MMP-7 specifically recognized and cleaved the peptide, the PtNPs-S₁ bioconjugates were successfully released from electrode. The remaining S₁ on electrode then hybridized with ssDNA1 (I₁) and ssDNA2 (I₂), which could synchronously trigger two hybridization chain reactions (HCRs), resulting in the in situ formation of DNA nanoladders. The desired DNA nanoladders not only were employed as ideal nanocarriers for enzyme loading, but also maintained its catalytic activity. With the help of hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), manganese porphyrin (MnPP) with peroxidase-like activity accelerated the 4-chloro-1-naphthol (4-CN) oxidation with generation of insoluble precipitation on electrode, causing a very low differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) signal for quantitative determination of MMP-7. Under optimal conditions, the developed biosensor exhibited a wide linear ranging from 0.2 pg/mL to 20 ng/mL, and the detection limit was 0.05 pg/mL. This work successfully realized the combination of DNA signal amplification technique with artificial mimetic enzyme-catalyzed precipitation reaction in peptide cleavage-based protein detection, offering a promising avenue for the detection of other proteases.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3acatalytic activity 3adetection limit 3aelectrodes 3ahybridization chain reaction 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aiodine 3amanganese 3ananocarriers 3ananoparticles 3aoxidation 3aplatinum 3aporphyrins 3aproteinases 3aquantitative analysis 3asingle-stranded DNA 0amatrix metalloproteinases-7 (MMP-7) 0aDNA nanoladders 0amanganese porphyrin (MnPP) 0asignal amplification 0a4-chloro-1-naphthol (4-CN)1 aZhang, Li1 aXie, Hua1 aWang, Ding1 aYuan, Ya-Li1 aChai, Ya-Qin1 aYuan, Ruo0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2016 Sept. 07, v. 8, no. 35 p.22869-22874dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b070173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01634naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245016100164300001800325520038800343592002800731650002300759650001600782650001100798650002100809650002300830650002900853650001000882650002200892650002100914700001200935700001500947700001200962700001900974700001700993700001701010773011901027856008101146852000901227655001201236IND60550558420221120184039.0160911e20160617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055055842DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.6b007342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiao, Maozhong10aLewis Acid Catalyzed Regiospecific Cross-Dehydrative Coupling Reaction of 2-Furylcarbinols with β-Keto Amides or 4-Hydroxycoumarins: A Route to Furyl Enols  ap. 5228-5235.  aLewis acid catalyzed directly dehydrative carbon–carbon bond formation reaction of 2-furylcarbinols with β-keto amides provides a straightforward method for regioselective synthesis of (Z)-furyl enols.

It covers the period from 2018 to 2048 and includes forest purchase costs, management simulation, timber transport to mills, timber processing and veneer production, and finally the selling of sawmill, veneer and forest products. Data from the Croatian National Forest Inventory and forest habitats map were used as a basis for analyses. Spatial data on private forests, roads and timber process plants at the national level were also integrated into the analyses. For the forest management simulation, the MOSES 3.0 simulator was used, and the QGis 3.4 software was used for spatial analyses of forests, roads and mils. Based on data from several world stock exchanges that cover companies of the forestry sector, a real (inflation-free) discount rates were used. The financial analyses showed which forest categories have positive investment potential and under which conditions. Results pointed out that multi-aged European beech forests have the highest internal rate of return (8.45%) and are the only one which would meet the expectations of a financially rational investor using criteria of a risk-adjusted inflation-free discount rate of 8%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus sylvatica subsp. sylvatica 3abusiness enterprises 3acomputer software 3adiscount rate 3aforest habitats 3aforest inventory 3aforest management 3aforest products 3aforests 3anational forests 3aprivate forestry 3aroads 3asawmills 3aspatial data 3aCroatia1 aČavlović, Jura1 aIštvanić, Josip1 aDolinar, Denis1 aLepoglavec, Kruno0 tSmall-scale forestry.g2020 Mar., v. 19, no. 1 p.19-38dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:J000000151x1873-76177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11842-019-09429-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01789naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245011400152300001800266520072100284592002801005650001401033650001301047650001401060650001301074650002201087650001401109650001501123700001801138700002001156700001701176700001601193700001601209773011801225856007501343852000901418655001201427IND60550334320221123035756.0160910e20140404xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055033432DNAL7 a10.1021/jo402745b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yabo10aDirect C–H Arylation of Thiophenes at Low Catalyst Loading of a Phosphine-Free Bis(alkoxo)palladium Complex  ap. 2890-2897.  aAn efficient phosphine-free direct C–H arylation of thiophenes at the α-position has been developed at low catalyst loading of bis(alkoxo)palladium complex (Cat.I, 0.1–0.2 mol %). The developed synthetic method can be applied to the synthesis of α-aryl/heteroaryl thiophenes from aryl or heteroaryl bromides in good to excellent yields and is compatible with the substrates bearing electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups. The reactivities of the 2- and 5-positions of thiophenes are equivalent and not dependent on steric hindrance under optimal conditions. This condition can also be applied to other heterocyclic moieties such as benzothiophene, benzofuran, and pyrrole with high conversion yields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarylation 3abromides 3acatalysts 3amoieties 3aorganic chemistry 3apalladium 3athiophenes1 aWang, Jingran1 aHuang, Mengmeng1 aWang, Zhiwei1 aWu, Yusheng1 aWu, Yangjie0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2014 Apr. 04, v. 79, no. 7 p.2890-2897dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjo402745b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02700naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245021600169500001900385520119400404592002801598650002101626650004601647650001701693650001501710650001901725650001901744653002701763653001801790653003101808653002601839653003701865700001601902700001701918700001501935700001601950700001801966700001701984700001902001700001802020773012002038856008702158852000902245655001202254IND60717693320221118022731.0201213e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071769332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2020.1244112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChu, Qingnan10aInsights into the molecular transformation in the dissolved organic compounds of agro-waste-hydrochars by microbial-aging using electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHydrochars-based dissolved organic matters (DOM) are easily available to organisms and thus have important influence on the biota once applying hydrochars as environment amendment. Thus, positive modifications on molecular composition of DOM is indispensable before hydrochars application. In this study, the impacts of microbial-aging by anaerobic fermentation on DOM of agro-waste-hydrochars was systematically assessed. Results revealed that microbial-aging caused lower DOM release but higher DOM molecular diversity. Moreover, microbial-aging resulted in the production of more biodegradable compounds, including lipids and proteins, and reduced the aromaticity of DOM. The highly oxygenated molecules (O/C > 0.6) were shifted into lower-order ones in the hydrochars-based DOM, suggesting the transformation of hydrophilic compounds into hydrophobic ones. Additionally, microbial-aging promoted the degradation of phenols by 99.0–98.9%, phenolic acids 37.8–73.5%, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by 83.4–90.4% in hydrochar-based DOM. Overall, this study demonstrates that microbial-aging changes the molecular characteristics of hydrochars-based DOM in a positive manner.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3afermentation 3ahydrochars 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 0aAnaerobic fermentation 0aESI-FT-ICR-MS 0aHydrothermal carbonization 0aMolecular composition 0aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons1 aXue, Lihong1 aWang, Bingyu1 aLi, Detian1 aHe, Huayong1 aFeng, Yanfang1 aHan, Lanfang1 aYang, Linzhang1 aXing, Baoshan0 tBioresource technology.g2021 Jan., v. 320 p.124411-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2020.1244113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03086naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003900135040001800174100002100192245007700213500001900290506007600309520152300385592002801908506003701936650002501973650001901998650001602017650001902033650001702052650003502069650002002104650001002124650001302134650001602147650001602163650001602179650004302195650000902238650001802247650002102265653001902286653002702305653001402332700001502346700001902361773009302380856008602473852000902559655001202568IND60690762120221207092519.0201202e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069076212DNAL7 a300943592pmid7 aPMC60772402pmcid7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2018.e006622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElkhidir, Yassir14aThe impact of photofunctionalized gold nanoparticles on osseointegration  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe aims of this study were to create a new surface topography using simulated body fluids (SBF) and Gold Nanoparticles (GNPs) and then to assess the influence of UV Photofunctionalization (PhF) on the osteogenic capacity of these surfaces.Titanium plates were divided into six groups All were acid etched with 67% Sulfuric acid, 4 were immersed in SBF and 2 of these were treated with 10 nm GNPs. Half of the TiO₂ plates were photofunctionalized to be compared with the non-PhF ones. Rat's bone marrow stem cells were seeded into the plates and then CCK8 assay, cell viability assay, immunofluorescence, and Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were done after 24 hours. Gene expression analysis was done using real time quantitative PCR (qPCR) one week later to check for the mRNA expression of Collagen-1, Osteopontin and Osteocalcin. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was assessed after 2 weeks of cell seeding.Our new topography has shown remarkable osteogenic potential. The new surface was the most biocompatible, and the 10 nm GNPs did not show any cytotoxicity. There was a significant increase in bioactivity, enhanced gene expressions and ALP activity.GNPs enhances osteogenic differentiation of stem cells and Photofunctionalizing GNPs highly increases this. We have further created a novel highly efficient topography which highly enhances the speed and extent of osseointegration. This may have great potential for improving treatment outcomes for implant, maxillofacial as well as orthopedic patients.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalkaline phosphatase 3abone formation 3abone marrow 3acell viability 3acytotoxicity 3afluorescent antibody technique 3agene expression 3agenes 3ananogold 3aorthopedics 3aosteocalcin 3aosteopontin 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arats 3asulfuric acid 3aviability assays 0aNanotechnology 0aBiomedical engineering 0aDentistry1 aLai, Renfa1 aFeng, Zhiqiang0 tHeliyon.g2018 July, v. 4, no. 7 p.e00662-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2018.e006623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03025naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245016700168300001600335520179300351592002802144650001302172650001702185650001102202650002202213650001402235650001502249650001202264651001902276651001702295651001102312651001502323651001702338700001802355700002002373773015202393856008502545852000902630655001202639IND60779099320221120093721.0220604e20220603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077909932DNAL7 a10.25226/bboc.v142i2.2022.a42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAllport, Gary14aThe status and distribution of three species of Sternula terns on the eastern coast of Africa and in the western Indian Ocean, with two species new for Mozambique  ap. 190-208.  aThe status of three Sternula terns in southern and eastern Africa and the Indian Ocean is updated based on observations in Mozambique during October 2009–August 2021. Damara Tern S. balaenarum and Saunders's Tern S. saundersi, both new to Mozambique, were found at the San Sebastian Peninsula in August 2018 and have been recorded regularly since. Damara Tern arrived in May, numbers were lower June–July, with a peak of 100+ in August–October. Breeding plumage was assumed by late October and all departed in early November; those aged were all adults. Observations of ringed birds suggested they originated from colonies in South Africa. Numbers of Damara Tern reached the Key Biodiversity Area designation threshold population for the site in 2020. These are the first records of large numbers of Damara Tern in the Indian Ocean, whilst timings suggest the species is partly transient at the site and may also occur further north. Saunders's Tern was recorded at San Sebastian in all months except March and April, with 5–80 regularly present, and peak numbers perhaps in October–December. Birds were observed in a range of plumages in all months, from non-breeding, transitional to full breeding. Courtship feeding was observed in September–November suggesting at least some attempt to breed locally, although disturbance is high. Birds in non-breeding plumage may stem from Northern Hemisphere breeding localities. Little Tern S. albifrons was a numerous migrant in southern Mozambique in October–May, peaking in April when large numbers were observed during pelagic trips to the continental shelf edge, and at onshore roost sites including San Sebastian. Smaller numbers fed in coastal lagoons and freshwater lakes.

The situations in Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou and Hunan provinces clearly improved over the period but they remain provinces with high-incidence, and consequently influence the epidemic situation of surrounding provinces and possibly the whole country. Summer and autumn were high-incidence seasons. Farmers, students and pre-school children represent the high-risk populations, and rates of cases in farmers increased, those for students decreased, and pre-school children remained unchanged. Provinces with active surveillance programs reported a total of 2346 individual cases, of which 88.53% were associated with canines. Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) of rabies cases was not significantly improved, whereas PEP in post-exposure population was good. In rural regions of China, canine density was reduced somewhat, and the immunization rate increased slightly. Finally we show that while the epidemic decreased 2007 to 2011 in China, cases continued to be diffused in certain regions. Lack of standardization of PEP on rabies cases was the main reason of morbidity. The high density and low immunization of dog in rural areas and the defective situation of PEP are still continuous occurrences in China and remain a cause for concern.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautumn 3adisease control 3adogs 3afarmers 3ahumans 3aimmunization 3amonitoring 3amorbidity 3apreschool children 3arabies 3arural areas 3astatistical analysis 3astudents 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aAnimals 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aDog Diseasesxepidemiology 2aDogs 2aEpidemics 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aRabiesxepidemiologyxveterinary. 2aSeasons 2aYoung Adult 3aChina 0aChinaxepidemiology.1 aZhou, Hang1 aWu, Hui1 aTao, Xiao-yan1 aRayner, Simon1 aWang, Shu-mei1 aTang, Qing1 aLiang, Guo-dong0 tVirologica Sinica.g2012 Apr., v. 27, no. 2 p.132-143dSpringer-Verlagx1674-07697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12250-012-3244-y  aDNAL 7aarticle02945naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002000188245009200208300001600300500001500316506007600331520120200407592002801609506003701637650002101674650002401695650005601719650003201775650003001807650001801837650002201855650001501877650003801892650001201930650003401942650003101976650001502007650004002022650001402062653003202076653002302108653002402131653002202155700001502177700002102192773011202213856008102325852000902406655001202415IND50070683520221207101838.0150210e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007068352DNAL7 a10.1007/s10344-013-0743-62doi7 aPMC70881422pmcid7 a322149402pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlbayrak, Harun12aA serological survey of selected pathogens in wild boar (Sus scrofa) in northern Turkey  ap. 893-897.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDuring the hunting season in March 2012, a total of 93 blood samples were collected from wild boars (Sus scrofa) shot in the area of northern Turkey (Samsun and Gumushane provinces). These blood samples were examined by enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) for the presence of antibodies to classical swine fever virus (CSFV), Aujeszky’s disease virus (ADV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), swine influenza virus (SIV), porcine parvovirus (PPV), swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV), hepatitis E virus (HEV), African swine fever virus (ASFV), porcine rotavirus (PRV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV). Out of 93 serum samples examined, 65 (69.9 %) were positive for PRV, 22 (23.7 %) were positive for ADV, 5 (5.4 %) were positive for BVDV, 4 (4.3 %) were positive for PPV and 2 (2.2 %) were positive for PRRSV. All sera were negative for ASFV, SVDV, HEV, SIV, PRCV, TGEV and CSFV. The results, recorded for the first time in Turkey, supported the hypothesis that wild boar act as a potential reservoir of selected viruses and thus have a role in the epidemiology of these diseases.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOrthohepevirus A 3aserological surveys 3aPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 3aClassical swine fever virus 3aAfrican swine fever virus 3aEnterovirus B 3aInfluenza A virus 3aSus scrofa 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aviruses 3aBovine viral diarrhea virus 1 3aUngulate protoparvovirus 1 3awild boars 3aTransmissible gastroenteritis virus 3apathogens 0aBovine viral diarrhea virus 0aPorcine parvovirus 0aHuman enterovirus B 0aHepatitis E virus1 aOzan, Emre1 aCavunt, Abdullah0 tEuropean journal of wildlife research.g2013 Dec., v. 59, no. 6 p.893-897dSpringer-Verlagx1612-46427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10344-013-0743-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03394naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245015900157300001600316520190300332592002802235650001802263650002102281650001902302650002202321650002202343650002302365650001702388650002102405650001302426650002502439650001902464650001902483650001202502650001502514650000902529650001802538650001902556650001902575650001902594650002002613700001302633700001502646700001602661700001902677773010802696856007502804852000902879655001202888IND60529613220221119035636.0160717e20140107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052961322DNAL7 a10.1021/ac402389w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Wanjun10aFacile Preparation of Well-Defined Hydrophilic Core–Shell Upconversion Nanoparticles for Selective Cell Membrane Glycan Labeling and Cancer Cell Imaging  ap. 482-489.  aMolecular imaging enables in situ visualization of biomolecules in living organisms and creates numerous opportunities for basic biological research and early disease diagnosis. As luminescent probes for molecular imaging, lanthanide-doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) exhibit superior performance compared to conventional fluorescent dyes in many ways, including high tissue penetration depth and minimized autofluorescence and photobleaching, making them particularly advantageous for imaging analysis. Although various synthesis methods have been reported, the preparation of high quality, water-soluble UCNPs remains challenging. For in situ imaging, glycans on the cell surface are particularly attractive due to their key roles in cellular activity and disease occurrence and development. However, glycan imaging is a challenging task due to their diverse structures and incompatibility with genetically encoded fluorescent tagging techniques. Herein, we report a new type of highly water-soluble, lectin-functionalized core–shell UCNP synthesized by surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP) for selective cell membrane glycan labeling and cancer cell imaging. SI-ATRP modification results in controlled growth of hydrophilic polymers on the UCNP surface and well-defined core–shell structure, producing UCNPs with improved biocompatibility and intact luminance property. Furthermore, the numerous functional groups on the polymer brush shell provide a large number of binding sites and 3D support for lectin immobilization. The increased loading density and diversified architecture of the immobilized lectins facilitates multivalent binding between the lectins and the glycans on the cell surface and leads to selective labeling of highly metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HCCHM3) in vitro and successful in vivo imaging of HCCHM3 inoculated mice.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding sites 3abiocompatibility 3acell membranes 3achemical elements 3adisease diagnosis 3adisease occurrence 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3ahepatoma 3ahydrophilic polymers 3ahydrophilicity 3aimage analysis 3alectins 3ametastasis 3amice 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3aphotobleaching 3apolymerization 3apolysaccharides1 aPeng, Bo1 aTian, Fang1 aQin, Weijie1 aQian, Xiaohong0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2014 Jan. 07, v. 86, no. 1 p.482-489dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac402389w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03762naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100007000141245009200211300001600303520203800319592002802357650001002385650002302395650001302418650003002431650001102461650001102472650001502483650001502498650001302513650002702526650002602553650001902579650002202598650001702620651001402637651001102651651001302662651001202675653002902687653001602716653002502732653001902757653001502776653001802791653001302809700002302822700002702845700002902872700001702901700002402918700002002942773012602962856007503088852000903163655001203172IND60696125720221122020100.0200522e20200521xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069612572DNAL7 a10.1017/wsc.2020.142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCamargo, Edinalvo Rabaioli1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8025-104210aCurrent Situation Regarding Herbicide Regulation and Public Perception in South America  ap. 232-239.  aSouth American countries are important agricultural players worldwide. Pesticides are key components of their production systems and, in some cases, complement environmentally sound systems, such as no-till, which contributes to preserving soil productivity. In this review, presented in the symposium Global Perspective on Herbicides Being Banned during the 2019 Weed Science Society of America meeting, we describe the regulatory framework and current situation of restricted and banned herbicides in South America. We also discuss where the pressure for herbicide bans is coming from and the opportunities for improving herbicide use and public perception. Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Uruguay were chosen as representative countries of the region. They all have regulatory systems in place for pesticide registration and reevaluation based on science. Glyphosate, paraquat, and some 2,4-D formulations are in the spotlight. Glyphosate is being reevaluated in Brazil and, although banned within the city limits in some cities in Argentina and Uruguay, it can still be used in agriculture. Paraquat is prohibited for aerial applications in Colombia and is the only herbicide that needs a professional prescription in Uruguay. It was reevaluated in Brazil, resulting in a use-restriction phase in effect until 2020, when it will be permanently banned. Ester formulations of 2,4-D have been banned in Brazil since the early 2000s and have restrictions in some provinces in Argentina, where 2,4-D butyl and isobutyl esters will be prohibited starting April 2021. In Uruguay, atrazine is the only herbicide banned for agricultural use. The regulatory frameworks ensure that herbicides on the market are effective and safe. Reevaluation is an important part of the system and is conducted when there are reasonable concerns. There are opportunities to continue training pesticide handlers and applicators and to communicate the importance of adopting the best management practices where herbicides are part of the production system.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4-D 3aaerial application 3aatrazine 3abest management practices 3acities 3aesters 3aglyphosate 3ano-tillage 3aparaquat 3apesticide registration 3aproduction technology 3apublic opinion 3asoil productivity 3aweed science 3aArgentina 3aBrazil 3aColombia 3aUruguay 0aCrop protection products 0aenvironment 0aenvironmental impact 0aherbicide bans 0apesticides 0apublic health 0atoxicity1 aZapiola, Maria Luz1 ade Avila, Luis Antonio1 aGarcia, Milton Alejandro1 aPlaza, Guido1 aGazziero, Dionísio1 aHoyos, Veronica0 tWeed science.g2020 May 21, v. 68, no. 3 p.232-239dThe Weed Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl2174x0043-17457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/wsc.2020.143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02801naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245010200170300002000272520169400292592002801986650001202014650001302026650001102039650002202050650000902072650001302081650001102094650000702105650001802112650001302130650000902143700001602152700002002168773014902188856008102337852000902418655001202427IND60523471820221119125015.0160619e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052347182DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-016-6456-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBestgen, Janile O.10aEffects of extraction methods and factors on leaching of metals from recycled concrete aggregates  ap. 12983-13002.  aLeaching of metals (calcium (Ca), chromium (Cr), copper, (Cu), iron (Fe), and zinc (Zn)) of recycled concrete aggregates (RCAs) were investigated with four different leachate extraction methods (batch water leach tests (WLTs), toxicity leaching procedure test (TCLP), synthetic precipitation leaching procedure test (SPLP), and pH-dependent leach tests). WLTs were also used to perform a parametric study to evaluate factors including (i) effects of reaction time, (ii) atmosphere, (iii) liquid-to-solid (L/S) ratio, and (iv) particle size of RCA. The results from WLTs showed that reaction time and exposure to atmosphere had impact on leaching behavior of metals. An increase in L/S ratio decreased the effluent pH and all metal concentrations. Particle size of the RCA had impact on some metals but not all. Comparison of the leached concentrations of metals from select RCA samples with WLT method to leached concentrations from TCLP and SPLP methods revealed significant differences. For the same RCA samples, the highest metal concentrations were obtained with TCLP method, followed by WLT and SPLP methods. However, in all tests, the concentrations of all four (Cr, Cu, Fe, and Zn) metals were below the regulatory limits determined by EPA MCLs in all tests with few exceptions. pH-dependent batch water leach tests revealed that leaching pattern for Ca is more cationic whereas for other metals showed more amphoteric. The results obtained from the pH-dependent tests were evaluated with geochemical modeling (MINTEQA2) to estimate the governing leaching mechanisms for different metals. The results indicated that the releases of the elements were solubility-controlled except Cr.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3achromium 3acopper 3aexposure duration 3airon 3aleaching 3amodels 3apH 3aparticle size 3atoxicity 3azinc1 aCetin, Bora1 aTanyu, Burak F.0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2016 July, v. 23, no. 13 p.12983-13002dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-6456-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03009naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024003700113040001800150100001900168245004300187300001600230500000900246520169000255592002801945650002701973650002602000650002602026650002002052650001102072650002802083650001802111650000902129650001902138650001102157650002102168650001302189651001302202700002102215773012102236852000902357856011202366856008402478961001302562655001202575IND2322469720221122231216.0191228e200101  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232246972DNAL7 a10113/220632hdl7 a10.2135/cropsci2001.411139x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpringer, T.L.10aNitrogen Fertilization of Buffalograss  ap. 139-142.  aepub  aBecause native, shortgrass prairies are not typically fertilized and otherwise extensively managed, little information is available on their response to nitrogen (N) fertilization. An experiment was conducted in 1997 and 1998 to study the effects of N fertilization on forage yield and quality, forage height, and subsequent nitrate accumulation in the soil of a rangeland site consisting primarily of buffalograss [Buchloë dactyloides (Nutt.) Engelm.]. The N treatments were 0, 34, 68, 102, and 136 kg ha⁻¹ arranged in a Latin square design. An increase (P < 0.05) in forage dry matter (DM) yield was obtained with 34 kg ha⁻¹ N. Greater (P < 0.05) forage yields were achieved with an additional 102 kg ha⁻¹ N (total 136 kg ha⁻¹ N). Forage yields averaged 2540 kg ha⁻¹ in 1997 and 2340 kg ha⁻¹ in 1998. Nitrogen fertilization increased crude protein (CP) of buffalograss forage. Each unit of 34 kg ha⁻¹ N linearly increased CP up to approximately122 g kg⁻¹ of DM forage. Weather conditions influenced in vitro digestible dry matter (IVDDM). As long as moisture conditions were favorable for forage growth, IVDDM increased linearly with N fertilization rate. In 1997, IVDDM ranged from 565 g kg⁻¹ for the control to 658 g kg⁻¹ for the 102 kg ha⁻¹ N application rate. In 1998, IVDDM declined linearly (P < 0.05) with N fertilization rate. In vitro digestible dry matter averaged 539 g kg⁻¹ for the control to 482 g kg⁻¹ for the 136 kg ha⁻¹ N application rate. Nitrogen fertilization of buffalograss dominated semiarid rangeland can enhance forage production and quality. Nitrate accumulation in the soil was insignificant over the study period.  aPublisher supplied data 3ain vitro digestibility 3aBouteloua dactyloides 3aplant characteristics 3anutritive value 3aheight 3adry matter accumulation 3acrude protein 3aurea 3asoil fertility 3ayields 3aapplication rate 3anitrates 3aOklahoma1 aTaliaferro, C.M.0 tCrop science.g2001 Jan., v. 41, no. 1 p.139-142dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/220633Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2001.411139x3Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02464naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245013500159300001800294520137500312592002801687650001401715650001001729650004601739650002301785650001501808650001301823650001301836700001901849700001301868700001901881700001801900773011201918856007502030852000902105655001202114IND60529849220221120232718.0160720e20140916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052984922DNAL7 a10.1021/ac502656a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jun-Ting10aSolvent-Assisted Electrospray Ionization for Direct Analysis of Various Compounds (Complex) from Low/Nonpolar Solvents and Eluents  ap. 8937-8942.  aElectrospray ionization (ESI) is a powerful ionization technique with a wide range of applications. However, the analytes in low/nonpolar solvents cannot be analyzed directly in electrospray ionization–mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), because low/nonpolar solvents are incompatible with ESI, because of their low conductivity. To circumvent this problem, we introduce an electrospray-based ionization method termed solvent-assisted electrospray ionization (SAESI). With the help of electrospray solvents at the tip of the spray needle, compounds in “non-electrospray ionization-friendly” solvents can be ionized directly using solvent-assisted electrospray ionization–mass spectrometry (SAESI-MS). The key features that the assistant solvent can be chosen flexibly and makes little interference to samples lead to better ionization performance in detection of organic reaction intermediates and real-time analysis of polymers and chiral drugs separated by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and normal phase liquid chromatography (NPLC). Furthermore, it can achieve online hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange reaction and even mitigate the signal suppression caused by strong acid modifiers in liquid chromatography. In addition, all parts of this device are commercially available and it only requires two parameters to be optimized, which makes SAESI easy to handle.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeuterium 3adrugs 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3agel chromatography 3aionization 3apolymers 3asolvents1 aWang, Hao-Yang1 aZhu, Wei1 aCai, Ting-Ting1 aGuo, Yin-Long0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2014 Sept. 16, v. 86, no. 18 p.8937-8942dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac502656a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02757naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009800166300001600264520136700280592002801647650002701675650002501702650002401727650002101751650001301772650001401785650001501799650001001814650004201824650002101866650001201887650001101899650002301910650001401933650001001947650001401957650001401971700001901985700001302004700002002017700001902037700002902056773010002085856008102185852000902266655001202275IND60120988820221118155539.0150213e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012098882DNAL7 a10.1007/s00203-014-0962-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuecine, M.

To solve this problem, many genetically modified microorganisms that colonize the same pests have been developed. Thus, the endophytic bacterium Pantoea agglomerans (33.1), which has been recently described as a promising sugarcane growth promoter, was genetically modified with the pJTT vector (which carries the gene cry1Ac7) to control the sugarcane borer, Diatraea saccharalis. Firstly, the bioassays for D. saccharalis control by 33.1:pJTT were conducted with an artificial diet. A new in vivo methodology was also developed, which confirmed the partial control of larvae by 33.1:pJTT. The 33.1:pJTT strain was inoculated into sugarcane stalks containing the D. saccharalis larvae. In the sugarcane stalks, 33.1:pJTT was able to increase the mortality of D. saccharalis larvae, impair larval development and decrease larval weight. Sugarcane seedlings were inoculated with 33.1:pJTT, and re-isolation confirmed the capacity of 33.1:pJTT to continuously colonize the sugarcane. These results prove that P. agglomerans (33.1), a sugarcane growth promoter, can be improved by expressing the Cry protein, and the resulting strain is able to control the sugarcane borer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aDiatraea saccharalis 3aPantoea agglomerans 3aartificial diets 3abacteria 3abioassays 3aendophytes 3agenes 3agenetically engineered microorganisms 3agrowth promotion 3ainsects 3alarvae 3alarval development 3amortality 3apests 3aseedlings 3asugarcane1 aAraújo, W.

During the late Miocene (Messinian), a continental fault-controlled basin (of nearly 500-km² width) was filled by precipitated travertine and detrital terrigenous strata, characterized by a wedge-shaped geometry that thinned northward, with a maximum thickness of nearly 70m. This mixed travertine–terrigenous succession was investigated in terms of lithofacies types, depositional environment and architecture and the variety of precipitated travertine fabrics.Deposited as beds with thickness ranging from centimetres to a few decimetres, carbonates include nine travertine facies types: F1) clotted peloidal micrite and microsparite boundstone, F2) raft rudstone/floatstone, F3) sub-rounded radial coated grain grainstone, F4) coated gas bubble boundstone, F5) crystalline dendrite cementstone, F6) laminated boundstone, F7) coated reed boundstone and rudstone, F8) peloidal skeletal grainstone and F9) calci-mudstone and microsparstone. Beds of terrigenous deposits with thickness varying from a decimetre to >10m include five lithofacies: F10) breccia, F11) conglomerate, F12) massive sandstone, F13) laminated sandstone and F14) claystone.The succession recorded the following three phases of evolution of the depositional setting: 1) At the base, a northward-thinning thermogene travertine terraced slope (Phase I, travertine slope lithofacies association, F1–F6) developed close to the extensional fault system, placed southward with respect to the travertine deposition. 2) In Phase II, the accumulation of travertines was interrupted by the deposition of colluvial fan deposits with a thickness of several metres (colluvial fan lithofacies association, F10 and F12), which consisted of massive breccias, adjacent to the alluvial plain lithofacies association (F11–F14) including massive claystone and sandstone and channelized conglomerates. Travertine lenses, of 2–3-m thickness, appeared intermittently alternating with the colluvial fan breccias. 3) In the third phase, the filled fault-controlled basin evolved into an alluvial plain with ponds rich in coated reed travertines, which record the influence of freshwater (travertine flat lithofacies association, F7–F9).This study shows the stratigraphic architecture and sedimentary evolution of a continental succession, wherein the hydrothermal activity and consequent travertine precipitation were driven by the extensional tectonic regime, with faults acting as fluid paths for the thermal water. Fault activity created the accommodation space for travertine and colluvial fan accumulation. Erosion of the uplifted footwall blocks provided the source of sediments for the colluvial fan breccias, which alternated with the thermogene travertine precipitation. Climatic oscillations might have led to the recharge of the aquifer that fed the hydrothermal vents.The studied continental succession in an extensional basin provides valuable information about the interplay between thermogene travertine and alluvial/colluvial deposition, which in turn might improve the understanding of similar fault-controlled continental depositional systems in outcrops and the subsurface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMiocene epoch 3aalluvial plains 3aaquifers 3abasins 3acarbonates 3afreshwater 3ageometry 3aponds 3asandstone 3asediments 3atectonics 3aItaly 0aThermogene travertines 0aalluvial deposits 0acontinental rift basin 0aMessinian 0aCentral Italy1 aDella Porta, Giovanna1 aCapezzuoli, Enrico0 tSedimentary geology.g2016 Mar. 01, v. 332 p.13-39dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11737x0037-07387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sedgeo.2015.11.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02496naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245006200157300001800219520146900237592002801706650001901734650002701753650001601780650002101796650001301817650002001830650002101850650001501871650002501886700001801911700002101929773011201950856007502062852000902137655001202146IND60529849320221120232537.0160720e20140916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052984932DNAL7 a10.1021/ac502687z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Maogen10aElectrochemical Coupled-Enzyme Assays at Carbon Nanotubes  ap. 9330-9334.  aThe recently developed internally calibrated electrochemical continuous enzyme assay (ICECEA) has proved to work well for single-enzyme systems. In the present work, its relevance to more challenging coupled-enzyme measurements was investigated by using a model enzyme pair comprising aspartate transaminase (AST) and malic dehydrogenase. The ICECEA was performed at an electrode modified with carbon nanotubes (CNTs), which were dispersed in a polysaccharide chitosan that acted as an adhesive. The 7 min assay required a 100 μL sample and relied on an AST-free calibration. It had a limit of detection equal to 5.0 pM AST (0.10 U L–¹) with no need for the incubation period. Its linear range extended up to 3500 pM (70 U L–¹). Perhaps the most promising was the fact that the assay and its calibration could be performed in the same solution even though the composition of the assay solution for the coupled-enzyme assays is typically more complex than that for the single-enzyme assays. This and the fast electrode kinetics of the signal transducing reaction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide at CNTs accounted for the low limit of detection. The unique shape of the ICECEA amperogram allowed for the selective determination of AST in the complex matrix of serum samples containing redox active potentially interfering species. Given these advantages, the prospects for the ICECEA in the development of other coupled-enzyme assays were also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aaspartate transaminase 3ablood serum 3acarbon nanotubes 3achitosan 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3amalate dehydrogenase1 aKarra, Sushma1 aGorski, Waldemar0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2014 Sept. 16, v. 86, no. 18 p.9330-9334dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac502687z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04332naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245010400178300001300282520278700295592002803082650000803110650001203118650002303130650001703153650002303170650002603193650001403219650001703233650001703250650001503267650003503282650002003317650001303337650002003350650001403370650002203384650000903406650002703415650001203442653002203454653000903476653002203485653001703507653001703524653001503541653001503556700002103571773010403592856008503696852000903781655001203790IND60536106620221122071500.0190215e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053610662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2014.11.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThomsen, Philip Francis10aEnvironmental DNA – An emerging tool in conservation for monitoring past and present biodiversity  ap. 4-18.  aThe continuous decline in Earth’s biodiversity represents a major crisis and challenge for the 21st century, and there is international political agreement to slow down or halt this decline. The challenge is in large part impeded by the lack of knowledge on the state and distribution of biodiversity – especially since the majority of species on Earth are un-described by science. All conservation efforts to save biodiversity essentially depend on the monitoring of species and populations to obtain reliable distribution patterns and population size estimates. Such monitoring has traditionally relied on physical identification of species by visual surveys and counting of individuals. However, traditional monitoring techniques remain problematic due to difficulties associated with correct identification of cryptic species or juvenile life stages, a continuous decline in taxonomic expertise, non-standardized sampling, and the invasive nature of some survey techniques. Hence, there is urgent need for alternative and efficient techniques for large-scale biodiversity monitoring. Environmental DNA (eDNA) – defined here as: genetic material obtained directly from environmental samples (soil, sediment, water, etc.) without any obvious signs of biological source material – is an efficient, non-invasive and easy-to-standardize sampling approach. Coupled with sensitive, cost-efficient and ever-advancing DNA sequencing technology, it may be an appropriate candidate for the challenge of biodiversity monitoring. Environmental DNA has been obtained from ancient as well as modern samples and encompasses single species detection to analyses of ecosystems. The research on eDNA initiated in microbiology, recognizing that culture-based methods grossly misrepresent the microbial diversity in nature. Subsequently, as a method to assess the diversity of macro-organismal communities, eDNA was first analyzed in sediments, revealing DNA from extinct and extant animals and plants, but has since been obtained from various terrestrial and aquatic environmental samples. Results from eDNA approaches have provided valuable insights to the study of ancient environments and proven useful for monitoring contemporary biodiversity in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. In the future, we expect the eDNA-based approaches to move from single-marker analyses of species or communities to meta-genomic surveys of entire ecosystems to predict spatial and temporal biodiversity patterns. Such advances have applications for a range of biological, geological and environmental sciences. Here we review the achievements gained through analyses of eDNA from macro-organisms in a conservation context, and discuss its potential advantages and limitations for biodiversity monitoring.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aanimals 3aaquatic ecosystems 3abiodiversity 3acost effectiveness 3aenvironmental science 3ajuveniles 3ametagenomics 3amicrobiology 3amonitoring 3anatural resources conservation 3aplants (botany) 3apolitics 3apopulation size 3asediments 3asequence analysis 3asoil 3aspecies identification 3asurveys 0aEnvironmental DNA 0aeDNA 0aDNA metabarcoding 0aConservation 0aBiodiversity 0aMonitoring 0aExtinction1 aWillerslev, Eske0 tBiological conservation.g2015 Mar., v. 183 p.4-18dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2014.11.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02794naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002900140245016000169300002000329520144700349592002801796650003701824650001901861650001401880650002201894650000901916650001901925650001701944650001301961650001301974650001401987650001902001650001902020650001102039650001702050650002402067650002602091700001802117700001802135773012402153856007402277852000902351655001202360IND60666740420221122071253.0190919e20141015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066674042DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra06605g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrover, Inderpreet Singh10aInfluence of thermal treatment and Au-loading on the growth of versatile crystal phase composition and photocatalytic activity of sodium titanate nanotubes  ap. 51342-51348.  aA coalescence influence of Au-loading followed by calcination at 800 °C led to a notable change in crystal-structure, morphology, phase composition and photocatalytic activity of titanate-nanostructures. After calcination at 800 °C, bare sodium titanate nanotubes (TNT) having a BET surface area (SBET) of 176 m² g⁻¹ is transformed into sodium titanate nanorods of SBET = 21 m² g⁻¹, whereas calcination of Au-loaded (Au⁺³, Au⁰ and Au-nanoparticle (AuNP)) TNT at 800 °C led to a variety of fragmented particles having different crystal structures, SBET (21–39 m² g⁻¹), shape and sizes (50–75 nm), attributed to strain induced thermal decomposition of TNT after Au-loading, and the oxidation state of Au is determined by XPS analysis. The comparative photocatalytic activity of these as-prepared catalysts to that of P25-TiO₂ under UV-light were evaluated for the photooxidation of the insecticide imidacloprid which gradually degraded to various intermediate photoproducts and finally decomposed to CO₂. The degradation of imidacloprid follows pseudo-first order kinetics, where 0.5 wt% Au⁰-deposited-TNT after calcination exhibits the highest photocatalytic activity (rate constant k = 8.9 × 10⁻³ min⁻¹), which is comparatively explained on the basis of their crystal phase, surface-area, morphology and the relaxation time of photoexcited electron–hole pairs, as measured by time resolved spectroscopy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3acrystal structure 3agold 3aheat treatment 3aimidacloprid 3ananogold 3ananorods 3ananotubes 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotooxidation 3asodium 3asurface area 3athermal degradation 3aultraviolet radiation1 aSingh, Satnam1 aPal, Bonamali0 tRSC advances.g2014 Oct. 15, v. 4, no. 93 p.51342-51348dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra06605g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02770naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245016700165300001600332520141700348592002801765650001101793650001501804650001401819650001901833650001901852650001701871650001901888650001701907650001401924653002001938653002201958653002201980653002102002653002102023700001702044700001602061700002202077700005602099773008702155856008502242852000902327655001202336IND60754475720221120214731.0211123e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075447572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2021.10.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Kaixu10aDual BN quantum dot/Ag co-catalysts synergistically promote electron-hole separation on g-C3N4 nanosheets for efficient antibiotics oxidation and Cr(VI) reduction  ap. 355-366.  aThe urgent challenge of semiconductor photocatalysis technology is to prevent the rapid recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs on the basis of making full use of solar energy. Fortunately, the co-catalysts usually play a non-negligible role in achieving high photocatalytic performance. Herein, BN quantum dots (BNQDs) and Ag as novel dual co-catalysts are introduced on g-C₃N₄ (CN) nanosheets that could transfer carriers rapidly in a large area, boosting the photocatalytic performance of CN. Specifically, Ag is a bright choice for improving solar energy utilization and serving as electron sinks, while BNQDs could act as superior photoinduced-hole extractors. The photogenerated electron-hole pairs are finally pulled apart due to the synergistic effect of the dual co-catalysts, stimulating a large number of photogenerated electrons and holes to participate in their respective redox reactions efficiently. In consequence, the CN/Ag/BNQDs(3) ternary composites exhibit stronger oxidizing and reducing properties, which are reflected in the oxidative degradation efficiency of TC (80.54%) and the ability to reduce Cr(Ⅵ) (88.93%) within 60 min were 3.04 and 10.03 times than pure CN. This research paves a path for the design of photocatalysts with high-efficiency carrier separation capabilities, and broadens the way for the application of co-catalysts in the field of photocatalysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3ananosheets 3aoxidation 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aquantum dots 3asemiconductors 3asolar energy 3asynergism 0aBN quantum Dots 0aDual co-catalysts 0aCharge separation 0aCr(VI) reduction 0aG-C3N4 nanosheet1 aLv, Mingsong1 aXie, Qijing1 aZhang, Chengliang1 aShi, Haifeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8234-50770 tCarbon.g2022 Jan., v. 186 p.355-366dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2021.10.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03363naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245021700163300001800380520176000398592002802158650001302186650001302199650002102212650002702233650001402260650000902274650000902283650001502292650001402307650001402321650001402335650001502349650001502364650001902379650002202398650001002420650002402430650001202454650001902466650001602485650001002501650001302511650001602524700001802540700001802558700001702576773015002593856008102743852000902824655001202833IND60585600320221118060305.0171111e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058560032DNAL7 a10.1007/s13762-017-1356-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKanu, M.

Standard techniques were adopted for measurement of mineral magnetic and geochemical parameters. The analyses of magnetic parameters revealed that the samples were dominated by ferrimagnetic minerals and multidomain grains. This implied that the magnetic fractions in the samples might be of anthropogenic origin. Results also indicate that the samples were dominated by low coercive, magnetically soft minerals. Thermomagnetic curves confirmed magnetite as the remanence bearing magnetic mineral having a Curie point temperature of ~580 °C. The strong association observed between magnetic susceptibility, susceptibility of anhysteric remanent magnetization and saturation isothermal remanent magnetization and aluminum, titanium, manganese, iron, chromium and lead demonstrated that these metals occurred as ferrimagnetic particles of technogenic origin resulting from vehicular sources. Assessment of pollution status of the road deposited sediment identified silicon and lead as the priority pollutants of concern. Generally, pollution load index was <1 (mean, 0.66 ± 0.14), indicating that the samples were not polluted in the overall, but the metals were in the buildup stage requiring constant monitoring. The sources of pollutants from principal component and cluster analyses identified the sources of pollution to be mainly from vehicular emissions such as brake linings, exhaust materials, tire wear, corroded metal parts, abrasion of lubricating oil and road construction materials. This study found that mineral magnetic techniques offer great potential as pollution proxy for soil pollution studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3achromium 3acluster analysis 3aconstruction materials 3aemissions 3airon 3alead 3alubricants 3amagnetism 3amagnetite 3amanganese 3amonitoring 3apollutants 3apollution load 3aroad construction 3aroads 3asediment deposition 3asilicon 3asoil pollution 3atemperature 3atires 3atitanium 3aurban areas1 aBasavaiah, N.1 aMeludu, O.

Medfly Ceratitis capitata CcapObp22 shows 37% identity and close phylogenetic affinities with Drosophila melanogaster OBP69a/pheromone‐binding protein related protein 1. The CcapObp22 gene is transcribed in the antennae and maxillary palps, suggesting an active role in olfaction. Here, we recombinantly produced CcapObp22, obtaining a 13.5 kDa protein capable of binding multiple strongly hydrophobic terpene compounds, including medfly male pheromone components. The highest binding affinity [half maximal effective concentration (EC50) = 0.48 µM] was to (E,E)‐α‐farnesene, one of the most abundant compounds in the male pheromone blend. This odorant was used in cocrystallization experiments, yielding the structure of CcapOBP22. The monomeric structure shows the typical OBP folding, constituted by six α‐helical elements interconnected by three disulphide bridges. A C‐terminal seventh α‐helix constitutes the wall of a deep, L‐shaped hydrophobic cavity. Analysis of the electron density in this cavity suggested trapping of farnesene in the crystal structure, although with partial occupancy. Superposition of the CcapOBP22 structure with related seven‐helical OBPs highlights striking similarity in the organization of the C‐terminal segment of these proteins. Collectively, our molecular and physiological data on medfly CcapOBP22 suggest its involvement in intersex olfactory communication.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018–2022cMinistero dell'Istruzione, dell'Università e della Ricerca  a10205cEuropean Community’s Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007‐2013)  a7551cEuropean Community’s Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007‐2013)  aTechnical Contract No. 16966cFAO/IAEA, Vienna, Austria  cGiovanni Armenise‐Harvard Foundation 3aCeratitis capitata 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aantennae 3abinding capacity 3acrystal structure 3adisulfide bonds 3afarnesene 3agenes 3ahydrophobicity 3ainsects 3amales 3amedian effective concentration 3aodor compounds 3aodorant receptors 3aolfactory organs 3apalps 3apheromones 3aphylogeny 3asmell 3atranscription (genetics) 3atrapping1 aCiossani, G.1 aScolari, F.1 aDi Cosimo, A.1 aNenci, S.1 aField, L.

In previous study it was found that BmCRT is responsible for prevention of host classical complement pathway activation via its interaction with first component C1q of the human host. Therefore, BmCRT is an essential protein for parasite survival and an important drug target to fend filariasis. In the present study, we have carried out a systamatic biophysical characterization of BmCRT protein. Unfolding of BmCRT was found to be non-cooperative two-state process in the presence of both denaturant GdmCl and urea. The results also illustrated that protein lost its 50% activity at 1.5M GdmCl and 3M Urea. Partially unfolded and molten-globule like intermediate state was observed at 0.8 to 1.2M GdmCl while Urea unfolding showed intermediate state at 1.2 to 1.6M. Unfolding pathway monitored with the help of apolar quencher, favor above observations. All of these findings support the presence of detectable intermediate state during unfolding pathway of BmCRT. Furthermore, this study indicates that BmCRT is more stable towards temperature (Tm=65°C), pH and trypsin digestion. These differences in properties as compared to host can be fruitfully utilized for synthesis of compounds effective against the parasite.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrugia malayi 3acalreticulin 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3acomplement 3adrugs 3afilariasis 3afluorescence 3ahost-parasite relationships 3ahumans 3amonitoring 3apH 3aparasites 3atemperature 3atrypsin 3aurea 0aBrugia malayi Calreticulin 0aUnfolding 0aUrea/GdmCl 0aANS 0aBmCRT 0aHuC1q 0aNHS 0aBSA 0agC1q 0aMG1 aGupta, Smita1 aSaxena, Jitendra Kumar0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.04.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02291naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245011900169300001800288520106900306592002801375596004701403650002101450650002301471650002101494650001701515650001901532650001901551650001401570700002001584700006701604700005601671773012001727856008501847852000901932655001201941IND60787670020220809000000.0220809e20220727xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078767002DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.2c007092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWolff, Patrick10aiPP/PE Multiblock Copolymers for Plastic Blend Recycling Synthesized by Coordinative Chain Transfer Polymerization  ap. 6435-6442.  aRecycling of blends of widely used plastics is a key challenge of the envisioned circular economy, and thus, protocols permitting the efficient synthesis of effective compatibilizers are highly desirable. We report herein that coordinative chain transfer polymerization permits the efficient one-pot synthesis of multiblock architectures of strictly linear polyethylene or high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and isotactic polypropylene (iPP). Various block copolymers having an iPP backbone and HDPE side chains were synthesized and used to compatibilize HDPE/iPP plastic blends. The synthesized block copolymers differ in their overall molecular weights and have different HDPE side chain lengths and numbers. A block copolymer with a molecular weight of Mₚ = 33,700 g × mol–¹ including 4.5 HDPE side chains with a molecular weight of Mₙ = 600 g × mol–¹ showed the highest efficiency for compatibilizing 30/70 wt % blends of HDPE/iPP with a 5 wt % compatibilizer addition.

To decipher the role of β-catenin in transformation, we classified β-catenin activity in 85 cancer cell lines in which we performed genome-scale loss-of-function screens and found that β-catenin active cancers are dependent on a signaling pathway involving the transcriptional regulator YAP1. Specifically, we found that YAP1 and the transcription factor TBX5 form a complex with β-catenin. Phosphorylation of YAP1 by the tyrosine kinase YES1 leads to localization of this complex to the promoters of antiapoptotic genes, including BCL2L1 and BIRC5. A small-molecule inhibitor of YES1 impeded the proliferation of β-catenin-dependent cancers in both cell lines and animal models. These observations define a β-catenin-YAP1-TBX5 complex essential to the transformation and survival of β-catenin-driven cancers.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal models 3acarcinogenesis 3acolon 3agenes 3aneoplasms 3aphosphorylation 3apro-apoptotic proteins 3asignal transduction 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atyrosine1 aNijhawan, Deepak1 aCox, Andrew G.1 aLi, Xingnan1 aNeal, James T.,1 aSchafer, Eric J.1 aZack, Travis I.1 aWang, Xiaoxing1 aTsherniak, Aviad1 aSchinzel, Anna C.1 aShao, Diane D.1 aSchumacher, Steven E.1 aWeir, Barbara A.1 aVazquez, Francisca1 aCowley, Glenn S.1 aRoot, David E.,1 aMesirov, Jill P.,1 aBeroukhim, Rameen1 aKuo, Calvin J.1 aGoessling, Wolfram1 aHahn, William C.0 tCell.g2012 Dec. 21, v. 151, no. 7 p.1457-1473dElsevier Inc.x0092-86747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2012.11.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02622naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245010500169300001600274520124000290592002801530650001201558650001701570650001901587650001101606650001401617650001601631650001701647650001201664653000701676653000801683653000801691653001001699653000901709653001001718653000801728653000801736653000801744653000801752653000801760653001901768653001001787653002801797700002401825700002201849700002101871773012101892856008202013852000902095655001202104IND60089727820221119143649.0160728e20130412xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008972782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.03.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoetscher, Erika10aAssay to measure the secretion of sphingosine-1-phosphate from cells induced by S1P lyase inhibitors  ap. 345-348.  aInhibitors of the sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) degrading enzyme S1P lyase (SPL) may be useful in the therapy of inflammatory diseases by preventing lymphocyte recruitment to diseased tissues. Here we describe a cellular assay for such inhibitors, which takes advantage of the observation that a fraction of the intracellular S1P accumulated in the presence of SPL inhibitors is secreted into the medium of cultured cells. The secreted S1P is then quantified using an S1P-sensitive reporter cell line. In the routine assay protocol, human HEK293T cells are treated with SPL inhibitors in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors and sphingosine; while the phosphatase inhibitors are included to prevent the degradation of S1P secreted from the cells, sphingosine is added as source for intracellular S1P that is prone to SPL degradation. The secreted S1P in the supernatant of the cell cultures is then quantified by measuring calcium flux induced in CHO-K1 cells expressing the human S1P3 receptor. Using this method SPL inhibitors were shown to induce a concentration-dependent increase of extracellular S1P under the conditions used; thus, the assay allows for the ranking of SPL inhibitors according to their potency on living cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acell culture 3acultured cells 3ahumans 3asecretion 3asphingosine 3atherapeutics 3atissues 0aAM 0aBSA 0aFCS 0aFLIPR 0aHBSS 0aHEPES 0aPBS 0aPCR 0aS1P 0aSph 0aSPL 0aCellular assay 0aLyase 0aSphingosine-1-phosphate1 aSchneider, Karolina1 aBeerli, Christian1 aBillich, Andreas0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2013 Apr. 12, v. 433 p.345-348dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.03.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03074naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245014300171520164700314592002801961650001401989650002002003650001402023650001802037650002302055650001402078650001902092650001802111650001102129650001502140650001502155650001802170653002302188653001902211653001802230653003002248653002002278653001902298653001302317653000802330700001702338700001602355700001502371773011102386856008602497852000902583655001202592IND60714112920221119213327.0220103e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071411292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2020.1096822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodrigues, F.J.10aEncapsulated probiotic cells: Relevant techniques, natural sources as encapsulating materials and food applications – A narrative review  aThe administration of probiotic microorganisms in adequate amounts is constantly related to health benefits. To promote beneficial effects, these microorganisms must not be affected by exposure to environmental factors and must be able to adhere and colonize the human gastrointestinal tract. Several encapsulation techniques and encapsulating materials are available to produce probiotic particles, however, it is essential that the process must not be aggressive, reducing or preventing injuries and cell losses, besides, the particle properties obtained must be adequate for the proposed purpose. At the same time, the global market for supplements and probiotic foods has been growing significantly, and cell encapsulation appears as an alternative to incorporate probiotics into different food matrices. This review discusses and updates the main techniques, and the traditional and emerging polysaccharides for encapsulation of probiotic cells, as well as the advantages and possibilities of incorporating produced particles into food matrices. Currently, various scientific studies report the use of different encapsulation techniques, such as extrusion, emulsion, spray drying, spray chilling and fluidized bed to encapsulate probiotics properly. The alginate is still widely used to produce probiotic particles, however, there has been a growing interest in its total or partial substitution with others polysaccharides, such as gums, mucilages, prebiotic compounds and microbial exopolysaccharides, which improve the protection and survival of encapsulated cells and allow their incorporation into dairy and non-dairy food products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalginates 3adigestive tract 3aemulsions 3aencapsulation 3aexopolysaccharides 3aextrusion 3afluidized beds 3afood research 3ahumans 3aprebiotics 3aprobiotics 3aworld markets 0aMicroencapsulation 0aImmobilization 0aWall material 0aGastrointestinal survival 0aFunctional food 0aNon-dairy food 0aMucilage 0aGum1 aCedran, M.F.1 aBicas, J.L.1 aSato, H.H.0 tFood research international.g2020 Nov., v. 137 p.109682-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2020.1096823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02767naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245011800175300001600293520163400309592002801943650001101971650001401982650001601996650001502012650001502027650001802042650001902060650002102079650001302100651001302113700002402126700002202150700002002172773011102192856008102303852000902384655001202393IND60584441020221118184600.0171024e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058444102DNAL7 a10.1007/s11273-017-9533-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuidugli-Cook, Michelle10aField-based assessment of wetland condition, wetland extent, and the National Wetlands Inventory in Kentucky, USA  ap. 517-532.  aThe economic and ecological importance of wetlands is well documented, but there are few studies that have assessed wetland condition and extent for the United States. Many states, including Kentucky, have had no statewide field evaluation of wetlands of any kind. The National Wetland Inventory (NWI) is the largest database for mapped wetlands in the United States and the most comprehensive source of wetland information for Kentucky, but its value for determining wetland condition is limited. Therefore, our objectives were to document wetland extent and condition and assess the agreement between the NWI and field-based wetland characteristics in Kentucky. We conducted field and remote-sensing based assessments of 352 wetlands across the state. NWI-mapped and field-assessed wetlands had similar large-scale patterns; however, for individual wetlands, classification often disagreed. Based on our wetland assessment method, wetlands appear to be of moderate condition, although we found differences among basins, dominant vegetation types, and landscape positions and much variation as many sites scored very low and high. Our findings support previous work showing that rapid assessments are valuable for determining wetland condition for ambient monitoring and other applications. Also, our results provide the foundation for future status and trends studies and suggest an urgent need to update the NWI in Kentucky and elsewhere. We suggest that the NWI could be improved by using newer technology that increases wetland mapping accuracy and including predictions of wetland condition using the enhanced NWI approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3adatabases 3ainventories 3amonitoring 3aprediction 3arapid methods 3aremote sensing 3avegetation types 3awetlands 3aKentucky1 aRichter, Stephen C.1 aScott, Barbara J.1 aBrown, David R.0 tWetlands ecology and management.g2017 Oct., v. 25, no. 5 p.517-532dSpringer Netherlandsx0923-48617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11273-017-9533-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02541naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245010700167300001600274520103500290592002801325650002101353650001401374650001601388650001001404650001301414650002001427650001401447650002101461653000701482653000901489653000801498653001501506653001501521653000901536653000901545653000801554653000901562653001001571653000901581653000801590653000901598653002301607653002901630653002001659653002501679653002601704700001901730700002601749773012101775856008201896852000901978655001201987IND60089727920221119143715.0160728e20130412xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008972792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.03.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuzuki, Sawami10aEpigenetic regulation of the metallothionein-1A promoter by PU.1 during differentiation of THP-1 cells  ap. 349-353.  aWe recently demonstrated that metallothionein (MT)-1 A is a direct target gene negatively regulated by PU.1. In this study, we revealed that the expression of PU.1 was increased and accompanied by downregulation of MT-1A expression during TPA-induced THP-1 monocyte differentiation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis demonstrated that PU.1 and the methyl CpG binding protein (MeCP) 2 bound to the same −887 to −602 region in the MT-1A promoter, and the binding of these proteins to this promoter was enhanced during differentiation. Consistently, bisulfite sequencing analyses around this region revealed that the proportion of methylated CpG sites was obivously increased during differentiation. In addition, ChIP analysis demonstrated that acetylated histone H4 around this region tended to be reduced and this may also play a role in the reduction of MT-1A expression during differentiation. Taken together, these findings suggest that MT-1A is epigenetically regulated by PU.1 during monocytic differentiation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding proteins 3achromatin 3aepigenetics 3agenes 3ahistones 3ametallothionein 3amonocytes 3aprecipitin tests 0aMT 0aChIP 0aAML 0aK562PU.1KD 0aK562PU.1OE 0aHDAC 0aDnmt 0aTPA 0aDMSO 0aGAPDH 0aHSCs 0aROS 0aPU.1 0aMetallothionein-1A 0aMonocyte differentiation 0aDNA methylation 0aHistone modification 0aEpigenetic regulation1 aNakano, Hiroko1 aTakahashi, Shinichiro0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2013 Apr. 12, v. 433 p.349-353dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.03.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01993naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001200155245011000167300001600277520092300293592002801216650002401244650001901268650001201287653003501299653002901334653001501363653003701378700002101415700001701436700001401453773009001467856008901557852000901646655001201655IND60605079020221120075659.0180720e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060507902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2014.11.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, S.10aInfluence of fibre architecture on the tensile, compressive and flexural behaviour of 3D woven composites  ap. 195-207.  aThis paper presents a comprehensive study on the tensile, compressive, and flexural performance of six types of 3D woven carbon-fibre/epoxy composites which were manufactured using a traditional narrow fabric weaving loom and resin transfer moulding.

The mechanical performance was found to be affected by the distribution of resin rich regions and the waviness of the load-carrying fibres, which were determined by the fibre architectures. The binding points within the resin rich regions were found to be the damage initiation sites in all weave types under all loading conditions, which were confirmed with both visual observation and digital image correlation strain maps.

In this study, both the cell wall integrity and mineral chelators/antinutrients (phytic acid and pectin) were investigated as natural barriers in common bean cotyledons. To examine the cell wall integrity as a physical barrier for mineral diffusion, soluble mineral content was determined in a cooked cotyledon sample before and after disruption of intact cell walls. While this study showed that the cell wall in cooked common bean cotyledons does not hinder mineral diffusion, it also demonstrated that the presence of antinutrients decreases mineral bioaccessibility. It was shown that a certain mineral fraction is naturally bound to phytic acid and/or pectin and, by enzymatically degrading these antinutrients, the antinutrient-chelated mineral fraction decreased. Moreover, although pH changes are occurring during simulated digestion experiments, which might affect charge of the antinutrients and thus their chelating capacity for minerals, no difference in mineral distribution over antinutrients was observed due to digestion. In addition, this study showed that mineral bioaccessibility in common bean cotyledons could be potentially increased by degrading antinutrients during digestion in the small intestinal phase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aantinutritional factors 3abeans 3abioavailability 3acell walls 3acotyledons 3adigestion 3afood research 3ain vitro digestion 3aintestines 3amineral content 3apH 3apectins 3aphytic acid 0aPhaseolus vulgaris L. 0aCell wall integrity 0aPectin 0aPhytic acid 0aIn vitro digestion 0aMineral bioaccessibility1 aPallares Pallares, Andrea1 aVancoillie, Flore1 aHendrickx, Marc1 aGrauwet, Tara0 tFood research international.g2020 Nov., v. 137 p.109685-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2020.1096853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03959naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001400143245012600157300001600283520184600299592002802145650001802173650001802191650001502209650001402224650001602238650001902254650001702273650003102290650002102321650001902342650001602361650001002377650001502387650001402402650002602416650001202442650001702454653001502471653003302486653001402519653005202533653001502585653001502600700001902615700002102634700002002655700002102675700001702696700002702713700002302740700002202763700001902785700002002804700001902824700002302843700001402866700002402880700003602904700002002940700001902960700002002979700002302999773012903022856007703151852000903228655001203237IND60674342020221118115339.0191025e20190701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067434202DNAL7 a10.1093/toxsci/kfz0792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yutai10aUse of a Bile Salt Export Pump Knockdown Rat Susceptibility Model to Interrogate Mechanism of Drug-Induced Liver Toxicity  ap. 180-198.  aInhibition of the bile salt export pump (BSEP) may be associated with clinical drug-induced liver injury, but is poorly predicted by preclinical animal models. Here we present the development of a novel rat model using siRNA knockdown (KD) of Bsep that displayed differentially enhanced hepatotoxicity to 8 Bsep inhibitors and not to 3 Bsep noninhibitors when administered at maximally tolerated doses for 7 days. Bsep KD alone resulted in 3- and 4.5-fold increases in liver and plasma levels, respectively, of the sum of the 3 most prevalent taurine conjugated bile acids (T3-BA), approximately 90% decrease in plasma and liver glycocholic acid, and a distinct bile acid regulating gene expression pattern, without resulting in hepatotoxicity. Among the Bsep inhibitors, only asunaprevir and TAK-875 resulted in serum transaminase and total bilirubin increases associated with increases in plasma T3-BA that were enhanced by Bsep KD. Benzbromarone, lopinavir, and simeprevir caused smaller increases in plasma T3-BA, but did not result in hepatotoxicity in Bsep KD rats. Bosentan, cyclosporine A, and ritonavir, however, showed no enhancement of T3-BA in plasma in Bsep KD rats, as well as Bsep noninhibitors acetaminophen, MK-0974, or clarithromycin. T3-BA findings were further strengthened through monitoring TCA-d4 converted from cholic acid-d4 overcoming interanimal variability in endogenous bile acids. Bsep KD also altered liver and/or plasma levels of asunaprevir, TAK-875, TAK-875 acyl-glucuronide, benzbromarone, and bosentan. The Bsep KD rat model has revealed differences in the effects on bile acid homeostasis among Bsep inhibitors that can best be monitored using measures of T3-BA and TCA-d4 in plasma. However, the phenotype caused by Bsep inhibition is complex due to the involvement of several compensatory mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetaminophen 3aanimal models 3abile salts 3abilirubin 3ablood serum 3aclarithromycin 3acyclosporine 3agene expression regulation 3aglycocholic acid 3ahepatotoxicity 3ahomeostasis 3aliver 3amonitoring 3aphenotype 3asmall interfering RNA 3ataurine 3atransporters 0abile acids 0abile salt export pump (BSEP) 0aknockdown 0aliquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) 0abiomarkers 0amicrobiome1 aEvers, Raymond1 aHafey, Michael J1 aCheon, Kyeongmi1 aDương, Hồng,1 aLynch, Donna1 aLaFranco-Scheuch, Lisa1 aPacchione, Stephen1 aTamburino, Alex M1 aTanis, Keith Q1 aGeddes, Kristin1 aHolder, Daniel1 aZhang, Nanyan Rena1 aKang, Wen1 aGonzalez, Raymond J1 aGalijatovic-Idrizbegovic, Alema1 aPearson, Kara M1 aLebron, Jose A1 aGlaab, Warren E1 aSistare, Frank D.,0 tToxicological sciences.g2019 July 01, v. 170, no. 1 p.180-198dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl4010831x1096-09297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/toxsci/kfz0793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02754naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245023600177300001100413520132700424592002801751650001501779650003501794650001201829650002001841650001001861650001201871650002001883650001101903650000701914650001101921650001301932650002501945650001501970700001801985700002502003700001702028700002202045700002302067773013902090856008202229852000902311655001202320IND60588942820221120110239.0180619e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058894282DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-018-3689-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFındıkoğlu, MaralSelin10aDetermination of Cadmium in Tap, Sea and Waste Water Samples by Vortex-Assisted Dispersive Liquid-Liquid-Solidified Floating Organic Drop Microextraction and Slotted Quartz Tube FAAS After Complexation with a Imidazole Based Ligand  ap. 37.  aThis study presents a combination of dispersive liquid-liquid-solidified floating organic drop microextraction (DLLSFODM) and slotted quartz tube (SQT) with conventional flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) to improve the sensitivity for cadmium determination. A ligand namely 2-(4-methylphenyl)-1H-imidazo-[4,5-f]-[1,10]-phenanthroline which has not been used in trace analyte determination was used to form a cadmium complex. Stepwise optimization of parameters affecting complex formation (pH, ligand, and buffer solution) and extraction (extraction and dispersive solvents, salt effect and mixing) was done to maximize cadmium absorbance. The slotted quartz tube was fitted onto the flame burner and optimized to increase residence time of atoms in the flame. Instrumental parameters such as sample and fuel flow rate were also optimized to further enhance the absorbance signal for cadmium. Using optimal parameters and values, the limits of detection and quantification were determined to be 0.81 and 2.69 μg L⁻¹, respectively. Low percent relative standard deviations (< 6.0%) indicated good precision for both extraction and instrumental measurements. Recovery tests were used to determine the accuracy of the method and the recovery results obtained were between 88 and 113%.

Moreover, our newly established analytical method exhibited good sensitivity, limit of detection, limit of quantitation, and selectivity. The accuracy and reliability of analytical results were challenged by method validation and comparison with the results of the liquid chromatography method, where a linear correlation of more than 0.99 was achieved.

However, land‐use changes in such regions and delays between plan design and implementation may render optimized plans obsolete before implementation occurs. To measure the shelf life of cost‐efficient conservation plans, we simulated a land‐acquisition and restoration initiative aimed at conserving species at risk in Canada's farmlands. We accounted for observed changes in land‐acquisition costs and in agricultural intensity based on censuses of agriculture taken from 1986 to 2011. For each year of data, we mapped costs and areas of conservation priority designated using Marxan. We compared plans to test for changes through time in the arrangement of high‐priority sites and in the total cost of each plan. For acquisition costs, we measured the savings from accounting for prices during site selection. Land‐acquisition costs and land‐use intensity generally rose over time independent of inflation (24–78%), although rates of change were heterogeneous through space and decreased in some areas. Accounting for spatial variation in land price lowered the cost of conservation plans by 1.73–13.9%, decreased the range of costs by 19–82%, and created unique solutions from which to choose. Despite the rise in plan costs over time, the high conservation priority of particular areas remained consistent. Delaying conservation in these critical areas may compromise what optimized conservation plans can achieve. In the case of Canadian farmland, rapid conservation action is cost‐effective, even with moderate levels of uncertainty in how to implement restoration goals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3acost effectiveness 3ainflation 3aland use change 3aland values 3aprices 3aprioritization 3arisk 3ashelf life 3auncertainty 3aCanada1 aKerr, Jeremy T.0 tConservation biology.g2017 Aug., v. 31, no. 4 p.837-847dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl42603x0888-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cobi.128863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03134naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245012900160300001400289520144900303592002801752596012101780596004401901650001801945650001601963650002501979650002402004650001002028650001802038650002502056650001102081650002202092650002402114650002602138650001302164653001702177653001002194653000902204653002002213700001902233700001702252700001802269700002002287700002202307700002002329700002402349700001802373773012702391856007702518852000902595655001202604IND60674342120221118115915.0191025e20190701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067434212DNAL7 a10.1093/toxsci/kfz0802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Ting Hua10aTungsten Blocks Murine B Lymphocyte Differentiation and Proliferation Through Downregulation of IL-7 Receptor/Pax5 Signaling  ap. 45-56.  aTungsten is an emerging environmental toxicant associated with several pediatric leukemia clusters, although a causal association has not been established. Our previous work demonstrated that tungsten exposure resulted in an accumulation of pre-B cells in the bone marrow, the same cell type that accumulates in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). To better understand the relevant molecular mechanisms, we performed RNA-sequencing on flow sorted pre-B cells from control and tungsten-exposed mice. Tungsten decreased the expression of multiple genes critical for B cell development, including members of the interleukin-7 receptor (IL-7R) and pre-B cell receptor signaling pathways, such as Jak1, Stat5a, Pax5, Syk, and Ikzf3. These results were confirmed in an in vitro model of B cell differentiation, where tungsten arrested differentiation at the pro-B cell stage and inhibited proliferation. These changes were associated with decreased expression of multiple genes in the IL-7R signaling pathway and decreased percentage of IL-7R, phosphorylated STAT5 double-positive cells. Supplementation with IL-7 or overexpression of Pax5, the transcription factor downstream of IL-7R, rescued the tungsten-induced differentiation block. Together, these data support the hypothesis that IL-7R/Pax5 signaling axis is critical to tungsten-mediated effects on pre-B cell development. Importantly, many of these molecules are modulated in ALL.  aPublisher supplied data  aRGPIN-2015-04919cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canadadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100000038  cCole Foundation Postdoctoral Fellowship 3aB-lymphocytes 3abone marrow 3acell differentiation 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3ainterleukin-7 3alymphocytic leukemia 3amodels 3asequence analysis 3asignal transduction 3atranscription factors 3atungsten 0aB lymphocyte 0aIL-7R 0aPax5 0aDifferentiation1 aBolt, Alicia M1 aZhou, Xiang,1 aPlourde, Dany1 aDe Jay, Nicolas1 aGuilbert, Cynthia1 aYoung, Yoon Kow1 aKleinman, Claudia L1 aMann, Koren K0 tToxicological sciences.g2019 July 01, v. 170, no. 1 p.45-56dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl4010831x1096-09297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/toxsci/kfz0803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02865naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245007500176300001600251520174600267592002802013650001702041650001902058650002002077650002402097650001402121650001202135650002002147651001102167653002002178653002602198653000902224653001902233653001302252700002902265773009202294856008402386852000902470655001202479IND60566820120221123033752.0170709s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056682012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.proenv.2017.03.1062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlexandri, Eleftheria10aEnergy Upgrade of Existing Dwellings in Greece; Embodied Energy Issues  ap. 196-203.  aWhen energy upgrade measures are suggested for existing buildings, usually the market availability of the selected technology, in relation to costs are taken into consideration; the latter are usually expressed as the investment payback period, in relation to the savings from energy bills that are achieved. Yet, the embodied energy payback period is not taken into consideration, in relation to the respective energy savings; this payback period is considered to be very crucial since it is an indicator of whether the specific energy saving measures should be followed, so that their embodied energy is paid back within the rest of the building's life span, showing finally whether the building should be energy upgraded or not, from a holistic energy point of view.In this work a “typical” dwelling building apartment is considered in all four climatic zones of Greece. Materials and techniques are examined on this building, so as to achieve the minimum requirements of the existing legislative energy upgrade, as well as transforming it into a nearly zero energy building (nZEB). The parameters used are according to the Greek legislationwith regards to occupancy and building use. Materials and techniques investigated are chosen with market availability criteria. A parametric analysis of materials and techniques with different embodied energies is considered and their payback periods are examined for all case studies. Conclusions are drawn on which materials and techniques should be preferred and which should be avoided for the energy upgrade of existing buildings in the climatic zones of Greece, in order to achieve the minimum legislative energy consumption requirements or an nZEB, based on their energy payback period.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aclimatic zones 3aembodied energy 3aenergy conservation 3alongevity 3amarkets 3aspecific energy 3aGreece 0aembodied energy 0aenergy payback period 0anZEB 0aenergy upgrade 0adwelling1 aAndroutsopoulos, Andreas0 tProcedia Environmental Sciences.g2017, v. 38 p.196-203dElsevier B.V.x1878-02967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.proenv.2017.03.1063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03333naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245008800180300001600268520169600284536017301980592002802153596001302181650001502194650001902209650001802228650001402246650001502260650001202275650001002287650001302297650001502310650001602325650002602341650000902367650002102376650003102397653006702428653001602495653002102511653002502532653002402557700001902581700001902600773012502619856008602744852000902830655001202839IND60773340920221122151900.0220413e20220403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077334092DNAL7 a10.1080/07388551.2021.19408312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEspinosa-Ortiz, Erika J.10aPotential use of fungal-bacterial co-cultures for the removal of organic pollutants  ap. 361-383.  aFungi and bacteria coexist in a wide variety of natural and artificial environments which can lead to their association and interaction – ranging from antagonism to cooperation – that can affect the survival, colonization, spatial distribution and stress resistance of the interacting partners. The use of polymicrobial cultivation approaches has facilitated a more thorough understanding of microbial dynamics in mixed microbial communities, such as those composed of fungi and bacteria, and their influence on ecosystem functions. Mixed (multi-domain) microbial communities exhibit unique associations and interactions that could result in more efficient systems for the degradation and removal of organic pollutants. Several previous studies have reported enhanced biodegradation of certain pollutants when using combined fungal-bacterial treatments compared to pure cultures or communities of either fungi or bacteria (single domain systems). This article reviews: (i) the mechanisms of pollutant degradation that can occur in fungal-bacterial systems (e.g.: co-degradation, production of secondary metabolites, enhancement of degradative enzyme production, and transport of bacteria by fungal mycelia); (ii) case studies using fungal-bacterial co-cultures for the removal of various organic pollutants (synthetic dyes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, pesticides, and other trace or volatile organic compounds) in different environmental matrices (e.g. water, gas/vapors, soil); (iii) the key aspects of engineering artificial fungal-bacterial co-cultures, and (iv) the current challenges and future perspectives of using fungal-bacterial co-cultures for environmental remediation.  aThe authors acknowledge the support by the National Science Foundation under [Grant #1736255] (BuG ReMeDEE), and the NSF EPSCoR RII Track-1 CREWS Research Seed Funding.  aPublisher supplied data  a1736255] 3aantagonism 3abiodegradation 3abiotechnology 3acoculture 3aecosystems 3aenzymes 3afungi 3amycelium 3apollutants 3aremediation 3asecondary metabolites 3asoil 3astress tolerance 3avolatile organic compounds 0aBioremediation; bacteria; fungi; fungal-bacterial interactions 0aco-cultures 0asoil remediation 0awastewater treatment 0awaste gas treatment1 aRene, Eldon R.1 aGerlach, Robin0 tCritical reviews in biotechnology.g2022 Apr. 3, v. 42, no. 3 p.361-383dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2047x1549-78017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07388551.2021.19408313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01483naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245009200168300001800260520056500278592002800843650001200871650002100883650002300904650001100927700005400938773012100992856008301113852000901196655001201205IND60743274420221117231200.0210707e20210622xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074327442DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.1c012432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Xiaosheng10aYnonylation of Acyl Radicals by Electroinduced Homolysis of 4-Acyl-1,4-dihydropyridines  ap. 4960-4965.  aHerein we report the conversion of 4-acyl-1,4-dihydropyridines (DHPs) into ynones under electrochemical conditions.

Whereas core subunits are translated on mitochondrial ribosomes, others are imported after cytosolic translation. How imported subunits are ushered to assembly intermediates containing mitochondria-encoded subunits is unresolved. Here, we report a comprehensive dissection of early cytochrome c oxidase assembly intermediates containing proteins required for normal mitochondrial translation and reveal assembly factors promoting biogenesis of human respiratory-chain complexes. We find that TIM21, a subunit of the inner-membrane presequence translocase, is also present in the major assembly intermediates containing newly mitochondria-synthesized and imported respiratory-chain subunits, which we term MITRAC complexes. Human TIM21 is dispensable for protein import but required for integration of early-assembling, presequence-containing subunits into respiratory-chain intermediates. We establish an unexpected molecular link between the TIM23 transport machinery and assembly of respiratory-chain complexes that regulate mitochondrial protein synthesis in response to their assembly state.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogenesis 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3ahumans 3alinkage (genetics) 3aprotein synthesis 3aprotein transport 3aproteins 3aribosomes 3atranslation (genetics)1 aDennerlein, Sven1 aWiese, Heike1 aReinhold, Robert1 aPacheu-Grau, David1 aLorenzi, Isotta1 aSasarman, Florin1 aWeraarpachai, Woranontee1 aShoubridge, Eric A.1 aWarscheid, Bettina1 aRehling, Peter0 tCell.g2012 Dec. 21, v. 151, no. 7 p.1528-1541dElsevier Inc.x0092-86747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2012.11.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02934naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001400171245013200185300001600317520140100333592002801734650001901762650003701781650002201818650001901840650001701859650001101876650002701887650001701914650001401931650001401945650001201959650004701971650001102018650002902029650002202058650001702080650002102097650000902118650001402127650001702141651002202158700001602180700001602196700001602212773012402228856005502352852000902407655001202416IND4480130920221121045311.0120515e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448013092DNAL7 a225833282pmid7 a10.1111/j.1439-0388.2011.00955.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRendo, F.10aEffects of a 10‐year conservation programme on the genetic diversity of the Pottoka pony – new clues regarding their origin  ap. 234-243.  aHere, we present the results of a genetic analysis of 463 Pottoka ponies corresponding to four generations, using 17 microsatellite markers. Ten years after the beginning of the Pottoka conservation programme, the values for the genetic diversity of the breed are still high and stable, indicating the success of the programme. We found null alleles in Pottoka for the ASB23, HMS3 and HTG10 microsatellites. Together with information obtained from other pony breeds from the Iberian Peninsula, this finding indicates that these microsatellites should not be used for phylogenetic analyses or parentage tests, at least for these breeds. The high heterozygosity exhibited by this breed in comparison to other ponies, together with its genetic proximity to the centroid of the allele frequencies, suggest that Pottoka allele frequencies are close to those initially exhibited by the ancestors of current European ponies. The results obtained in the current work, together with results from previous studies of ponies and horses from the Iberian Peninsula, corroborate the idea of a unique origin of all ponies from the European Atlantic Area. In contrast, our results do not corroborate the idea that these are derived from a domestication event in the Iberian Peninsula, nor that they have incorporated ancient Iberian horse genes into their genetic pool to a larger extent than other horse breeds.  aPublisher supplied data 3agene frequency 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3agenetic variation 3aheterozygosity 3ahorse breeds 3ahorses 3amicrosatellite repeats 3anull alleles 3aparentage 3aphylogeny 2aAnimals 2aConservation of Natural Resourcesxmethods 2aFemale 2aGene Frequencyxgenetics 2aGenetic Variation 2aHeterozygote 2aHorsesxgenetics 2aMale 2aPhylogeny 2aTime Factors 3aIberian Peninsula1 aIriondo, M.1 aManzano, C.1 aEstonba, A.0 tJournal of animal breeding and genetics.g2012 June, v. 129, no. 3 p.234-243dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-26687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0388.2011.00955.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03183naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245005600154300001600210500002000226520190700246592002802153650001702181650002102198650002302219650002202242650001102264650002002275650002502295650000902320650002202329650002702351650001502378650001502393651001002408700001702418700001502435700001402450700002302464700001802487700001702505773012002522856007402642852000902716655001202725IND60587426820221122091853.0180102e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058742682DNAL7 a10.1111/cobi.128972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLü, Yihe10aRepresentation of critical natural capital in China  ap. 894-902.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aTraditional means of assessing representativeness of conservation value in protected areas depend on measures of structural biodiversity. The effectiveness of priority conservation areas at representing critical natural capital (CNC) (i.e., an essential and renewable subset of natural capital) remains largely unknown. We analyzed the representativeness of CNC‐conservation priority areas in national nature reserves (i.e., nature reserves under jurisdiction of the central government with large spatial distribution across the provinces) in China with a new biophysical‐based composite indicator approach. With this approach, we integrated the net primary production of vegetation, topography, soil, and climate variables to map and rank terrestrial ecosystems capacities to generate CNC. National nature reserves accounted for 6.7% of CNC‐conservation priority areas across China. Considerable gaps (35.2%) existed between overall (or potential) CNC representativeness nationally and CNC representation in national reserves, and there was significant spatial heterogeneity of representativeness in CNC‐conservation priority areas at the regional and provincial levels. For example, the best and worst representations were, respectively, 13.0% and 1.6% regionally and 28.9% and 0.0% provincially. Policy in China is transitioning toward the goal of an ecologically sustainable civilization. We identified CNC‐conservation priority areas and conservation gaps and thus contribute to the policy goals of optimization of the national nature reserve network and the demarcation of areas critical to improving the representativeness and conservation of highly functioning areas of natural capital. Moreover, our method for assessing representation of CNC can be easily adapted to other large‐scale networks of conservation areas because few data are needed, and our model is relatively simple.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3aclimatic factors 3aconservation areas 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3anatural capital 3aprimary productivity 3asoil 3aspatial variation 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3atopography 3avegetation 3aChina1 aZhang, Liwei1 aZeng, Yuan1 aFu, Bojie1 aWhitham, Charlotte1 aLiu, Shuguang1 aWu, Bingfang0 tConservation biology.g2017 Aug., v. 31, no. 4 p.894-902dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl42603x0888-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cobi.128973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02870naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024003800129040001800167100002400185245017000209300001600379520158400395592002801979650002102007650001302028650001902041650002402060650001302084650001102097650001002108650002402118650001202142650001502154650001602169650001302185651001602198651001802214700002702232773011102259856008102370852000902451655001202460IND60584441520221118184234.0171024e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058444152DNAL7 a10.1007/s11273-017-9537-z2doi7 a10.1007/s11273-017-9537-z2chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWyman, Katherine E.10aBlack tern (Chlidonias niger) breeding site abandonment in U.S. Great Lakes coastal wetlands is predicted by historical abundance and patterns of emergent vegetation  ap. 583-596.  aBreeding colonies of black terns (Chlidonias niger) have become increasingly rare in U.S. Great Lakes coastal wetlands since the mid-twentieth century, with an almost 90% decline in the number of active colony sites since 1991. Although the specific causes of this wetland species’ decline are unknown, habitat loss and degradation are thought to be a major barrier to conservation. Using data from the Great Lakes Colonial Waterbird Survey, we took a unique regional and historical approach to investigate the relationship between black tern colony site abandonment and a suite of local and landscape-scale habitat features in U.S. Great Lakes coastal wetlands. We employed logistic regression models and a combination of stepwise selection procedures to identify the best predictive model for black tern colony abandonment. According to the selected model, breeding colonies with fewer nests were more likely to be abandoned over the following decadal observation period than breeding colonies with more nests. Colony sites were also more likely to be abandoned when vegetation within the wetland shifted towards larger, denser clusters. We performed a simulation study that showed that failing to account for association between observations from the same site affected model selection results, but that cross-validation error for the selected model remained low unless site effects were very strong. Results of this study suggest that focus on protection of sites harboring large numbers of black terns and vegetation management will help limit further colony abandonments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlidonias niger 3abreeding 3abreeding sites 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitats 3amodels 3anests 3aregression analysis 3asurveys 3avegetation 3awater birds 3awetlands 3aGreat Lakes 3aUnited States1 aCuthbert, Francesca J.0 tWetlands ecology and management.g2017 Oct., v. 25, no. 5 p.583-596dSpringer Netherlandsx0923-48617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11273-017-9537-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02293naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010500166300001800271520103100289592002801320650001801348650002401366650002101390650001801411650001801429650001301447650001601460650001501476700001701491700003001508700002601538700002601564700001701590700002501607700002601632700001601658700002301674773008301697856008201780852000901862655001201871IND60092660720221117020702.0141103e20121221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009266072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2012.11.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuga, Valbona10aExosomes Mediate Stromal Mobilization of Autocrine Wnt-PCP Signaling in Breast Cancer Cell Migration  ap. 1542-1556.  aStroma in the tumor microenvironment plays a critical role in cancer progression, but how it promotes metastasis is poorly understood. Exosomes are small vesicles secreted by many cell types and enable a potent mode of intercellular communication. Here, we report that fibroblast-secreted exosomes promote breast cancer cell (BCC) protrusive activity and motility via Wnt-planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling. We show that exosome-stimulated BCC protrusions display mutually exclusive localization of the core PCP complexes, Fzd-Dvl and Vangl-Pk. In orthotopic mouse models of breast cancer, coinjection of BCCs with fibroblasts dramatically enhances metastasis that is dependent on PCP signaling in BCCs and the exosome component, Cd81 in fibroblasts. Moreover, we demonstrate that trafficking in BCCs promotes tethering of autocrine Wnt11 to fibroblast-derived exosomes. This work reveals an intercellular communication pathway whereby fibroblast exosomes mobilize autocrine Wnt-PCP signaling to drive BCC invasive behavior.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aautocrine signaling 3abreast neoplasms 3acell movement 3acell polarity 3aexosomes 3afibroblasts 3ametastasis1 aZhang, Liang1 aViloria-Petit, Alicia M.1 aOgunjimi, Abiodun A.1 aInanlou, Mohammad R.1 aChiu, Elaine1 aBuchanan, Marguerite1 aHosein, Abdel Nasser1 aBasik, Mark1 aWrana, Jeffrey L.0 tCell.g2012 Dec. 21, v. 151, no. 7 p.1542-1556dElsevier Inc.x0092-86747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2012.11.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02579naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245008300170300001600253520121000269592002801479650000901507650001401516650001001530650001201540650001401552650001001566650003201576650001301608650001201621650001701633650001701650650001301667650001001680653001201690653002201702653002301724700002501747700001701772700001701789700002401806700002001830700003301850773012001883856008502003852000902088655001202097IND60535495620221121075726.0190416s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053549562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aaspro.2015.12.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSobczak, Paweł10aExtrusion of Cereals with Admixture of Soya Bean Grains from Traditional Crops  ap. 236-240.  aThe paper presents characteristics of mixtures of soya bean extrusion process with wheat and corn and soya beans’ meals with these cereals. On the Polish market, soybeans come mostly from traditional crops, for this reason its cultivation is much more expensive than soybeans derived from GM crops. Refuse soybean contains a large amount of fat that can be used as an additive enriching animal feed fat. It is however essential first soybeans processing. The extrusion process is one of the processing method refused soybean or whole soybeans as a component in extruded blends. The study used with isolated hulled and unhulled soybeans. From the analysis of the results obtained for the extrudates of mixtures with wheat and corn with addition of soya bean grains, it can be concluded that both the cutting strength and the hardness of the extrudates was higher in the case of corn compound. The greatest ratio of expansion was achieved for the extrudates of wheat and unhulled soya bean compound. The highest hardness was obtained by subjecting to extrusion a mixture of unhulled soya bean meal with corn, while introducing meal of hulled soya bean resulted in extrudates with about 70% lower hardness.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorn 3acorn meal 3acrops 3acutting 3aextrusion 3afeeds 3agenetically modified plants 3ahardness 3amarkets 3asolid wastes 3asoybean meal 3asoybeans 3awheat 0asoybean 0aextrusion process 0atraditional crops.1 aZawiślak, Kazimierz1 aKozak, Marta1 aMazur, Jacek1 aPanasiewicz, Marian1 aKobus, Zbigniew1 aŻukiewicz-Sobczak, Wioletta0 tAgriculture and Agricultural Science Procedia.g2015, v. 7 p.236-240dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23292x2210-78437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aaspro.2015.12.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03690naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006000150245012200210300001600332520173000348592002802078596006302106596007702169650001802246650001202264650002202276650001302298650001802311650002202329650001602351650001602367650001402383650001802397650002002415650001002435650002202445650003302467650001102500650001502511650001402526650001502540651001802555653001702573653001502590653001302605653001502618653002002633700001602653700007002669700001902739700006402758700002002822700002002842773013202862856008502994852000903079655001203088IND60758681520221117035644.0211202e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075868152DNAL7 a10.1094/PBIOMES-12-20-0088-R2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEwing, Carrie J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2107-088714aThe Foliar Microbiome Suggests that Fungal and Bacterial Agents May be Involved in the Beech Leaf Disease Pathosystem  ap. 335-349.  aBeech leaf disease (BLD) is a recently discovered disease that is causing severe damage to American beech (Fagus grandifolia) in northeastern North America. The recently described nematode Litylenchus crenatae subsp. mccannii was detected in BLD-affected foliage and may be associated with the disease. However, speculation on the direct role of the nematode in infection still remains. In this study, we profiled the microbial communities associated with asymptomatic, symptomatic, and naïve (control) American beech foliage by using a high-throughput sequence-based metabarcoding analysis of fungi, bacteria, phytoplasmas, and nematodes. We then used both a differential abundance analysis and indicator species analysis as well as several diversity metrics to try and discover microbes associated only with symptomatic foliage. To do so, we amplified the organism-specific phylogenetic informative regions of the 16S, 18S, and internal transcribed spacer (ITS)1 regions using Illumina MiSeq. Our results detected the amplicon sequence variant (ASV) associated with the nematode L. crenatae subsp. mccannii but in all symptom types. However, four ASVs associated with the bacterial genera Wolbachia, Erwinia, Paenibacillus, and Pseudomonas and one ASV associated with the fungal genus Paraphaeosphaeria were detected only in symptomatic samples. In addition, we identified significant differences based on symptom type in both the α- and β-diversity indices for the bacterial and fungal communities. These results suggest that L. crenatae subsp. mccannii may not be fully responsible for BLD but, rather, that other microbes may be contributing to the syndrome, including the putative nematode endosymbiont Wolbachia sp.  aPublisher supplied data  a20176703026610cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture  cOhio Agricultural Research and Development Center, Ohio State University 3aDNA barcoding 3aErwinia 3aFagus grandifolia 3aNematoda 3aPaenibacillus 3aParaphaeosphaeria 3aPhytoplasma 3aPseudomonas 3aWolbachia 3aendosymbionts 3afoliar diseases 3afungi 3aindicator species 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aleaves 3amicrobiome 3aphylogeny 3aphytobiome 3aNorth America 0abacteriology 0aendophytes 0amycology 0anematology 0aplant pathology1 aSlot, Jason1 aBenitez Ponce, M.

In many countries, timber production is no longer the main ecosystem service provided, thus other aspects such as biodiversity conservation are taken into account. One of the strategies developed to do so is to define, at the stand level, areas where final cuttings are not allowed. These areas can be found dispersed or aggregated (comprised of multiple stands) throughout the forest, helping to maintain a percentage of mature forest that fulfils conservation goals. In this study, we have developed a strategic forest planning model that allows us to integrate several retention systems compared to the business-as-usual treatment traditionally used. Production, technical and environmental criteria have been considered in order to analyse the degree of conflict between them by designing a pay-off matrix. Using multicriteria techniques conflicting objectives were assessed, and decision makers’ interactions have been introduced. These interactions range from criteria selection to the allocation of preferential weights to each criterion until the best solution among a set of possible alternatives is identified. The presented analytical procedure is based on the extended goal programming method applied in an exemplary forest in central Spain. Our results show that the proposed methodology allows deriving solutions that are acceptable for decision makers while estimating physical and economic opportunity costs of conservation measures in timber volume and Euros respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity conservation 3adecision making 3aecosystem services 3aforests 3amodels 3aopportunity costs 3atimber production 3aSpain 0aStrategic forest management 0aVariable retention 0aBlack vulture 0aEcosystem services 0aGoal programming1 aPardos, Marta1 aDíaz Balteiro, Luis,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4435-27400 tForest ecology and management.g2019 Feb. 15, v. 433 p.585-593dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2018.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03267naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245015600174300001600330520158700346592002801933596002901961596002501990596010002015650002302115650002402138650001402162650001502176650001302191650002202204650001502226650001602241650000902257650001302266651000902279653002402288653001402312653001702326653001202343653002002355700002302375700001802398700007002416700006102486773013202547856008502679852000902764655001202773IND60758681620221117035439.0211202e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075868162DNAL7 a10.1094/PBIOMES-12-20-0089-R2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNavarro, Krystel A.10aComparison of the Species Communities of Phytophthora, Pythium, and Phytopythium Associated with Soybean Genotypes in High Disease Environments in Ohio  ap. 288-304.  aThe roles that specific cultivars with different levels and types of resistance may play on the diversity and abundance of Phytophthora, Phytopythium, and Pythium spp. communities were compared. Three soybean cultivars were planted in a total of 11 different high disease environments in Ohio and seedlings were collected for direct isolation and amplicon sequencing of the rhizosphere soil. Plant population and yields were lower for the moderately susceptible cultivar Sloan compared with the cultivars Kottman, with high partial resistance to Phytophthora sojae, and Lorain, with high partial resistance to both Pythium spp. and Phytophthora sojae. Based on both direct isolation and amplicon sequencing, distinct communities with key indicator species were identified at each environment, including differences at 14 and 25 day after planting for two environments. The environment had the largest influence on the community composition. Soybean genotype did influence the abundance of the hemibiotroph Phytophthora sojae but not species of Phytopythium or Pythium. In addition, from all environments and cultivars, operational taxonomic units (OTUs) classified as Pythium attrantheridium, P. heterothallicum, and P. sylvaticum were always detected. This is also the first report of an OTU of P. periilum from soils and the first one to recover undescribed species that match the sequence of Pythium sp.

We applied the model to the Fukuyama inner harbour in the Seto Inland Sea and Tokyo Bay and compared our results with field data. The numerical results show good agreement with the field results. We demonstrate that steelmaking slag can control advection-diffusion with regard to concentration of hydrogen sulphide.

Our strategy harnesses the power of palladium-catalyzed trimethylenemethane chemistry (Pd-TMM) to form the key spirooxindole motif in a catalytic, asymmetric fashion. Upon the conversion of this spirooxindole to a vinyl epoxide electrophile, the piperidine ring is directly added via a diastereoselective metalation followed by an SN2′ addition.

The approach can determine in situ pH with precision better than 0.1 pH units at pressures, temperatures, and ionic strengths typical of geologic carbon sequestration systems. A custom-built high pressure NMR probe was used to collect ¹³C NMR spectra of ¹³C-labeled CO₂ reactions with NaOH solutions and Mg(OH)₂ suspensions at pressures up to 107 bar and temperatures of 80 °C. The quantitative nature of NMR spectroscopy allows the concentration ratio [CO₂]/[HCO₃–] to be experimentally determined. This ratio is then used with equilibrium constants calculated for the specific pressure and temperature conditions and appropriate activity coefficients for the solutes to calculate the in situ pH. The experimentally determined [CO₂]/[HCO₃–] ratios agree well with the predicted values for experiments performed with three different concentrations of NaOH and equilibration with multiple pressures of CO₂. The approach was then applied to experiments with Mg(OH)₂ slurries in which the change in pH could track the dissolution of CO₂ into solution, rapid initial Mg(OH)₂ dissolution, and onset of magnesium carbonate precipitation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abicarbonates 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3aionic strength 3aisotope labeling 3amagnesium carbonate 3amagnesium hydroxide 3amodels 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apH 3aslurries 3asodium hydroxide 3asolutes 3astable isotopes 3atemperature1 aWang, Fei1 aZhu, Yanzhe1 aHayes, Sophia

This study compares the effects of time-restricted versus free access self-feeding on the growth, feeding behavior and daily digestive enzyme rhythms of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). In an experiment that lasted 6 weeks, fish (109.9 g) were divided into two groups: group 1 had free access to a self-feeder (FA); group 2 received three meals per day (2 h per meal) at dawn, midday and dusk via a time-restricted self-feeder (TR). At the end of the experiment, the fish were sampled every 3 h over a 24-h period. The results showed that the TR fish quickly synchronized their feeding behavior to the feeding window and their blood glucose showed a significant postprandial increase, while FA fish displayed no statistically significant rhythms (P>0.05). Pepsin activity of TR fish also showed a significant daily rhythm (P<0.05) with the acrophase at the second feed and a decrease over the next 12 h. Average daily trypsin, lipase and amylase levels of FA fish were significantly lower than those of TR fish (P<0.01); however, the growth performance of both groups was similar (P>0.05). In conclusion, the study failed to confirm a link between the entrainment of daily digestive enzyme profiles and growth performance, with the TR group showing comparatively poor blood glucose regulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmo salar 3aamylases 3ablood glucose 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3afeeding behavior 3afish 3agrowth performance 3anutrient utilization 3apepsin 3atrypsin1 aLiu, Ying1 aYi, Mengmeng1 aZheng, Jimeng1 aTian, Huiqin1 aDu, Yishuai1 aLi, Xian1 aSun, Guoxiang0 tChinese journal of oceanology and limnology.g2017 July, v. 35, no. 4 p.729-736dScience Pressx0254-40597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-017-5346-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02852naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001900186245006600205300002000271506007600291520146000367592002801827506003701855650001701892650001301909650001301922650002701935650001101962650001701973650001101990650002602001650001502027650001902042650002602061650001402087700001602101700003702117773017602154856007902330852000902409655001202418IND60172321320221207061200.0150602e20121016xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017232132DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12068511092doi7 aPMC34795132pmcid7 a230279682pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBiniek, Krysta10aSolar UV radiation reduces the barrier function of human skin  ap. 17111-17116.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe ubiquitous presence of solar UV radiation in human life is essential for vitamin D production but also leads to skin photoaging, damage, and malignancies. Photoaging and skin cancer have been extensively studied, but the effects of UV on the critical mechanical barrier function of the outermost layer of the epidermis, the stratum corneum (SC), are not understood. The SC is the first line of defense against environmental exposures like solar UV radiation, and its effects on UV targets within the SC and subsequent alterations in the mechanical properties and related barrier function are unclear. Alteration of the SC’s mechanical properties can lead to severe macroscopic skin damage such as chapping and cracking and associated inflammation, infection, scarring, and abnormal desquamation. Here, we show that UV exposure has dramatic effects on cell cohesion and mechanical integrity that are related to its effects on the SC’s intercellular components, including intercellular lipids and corneodesmosomes. We found that, although the keratin-controlled stiffness remained surprisingly constant with UV exposure, the intercellular strength, strain, and cohesion decreased markedly. We further show that solar UV radiation poses a double threat to skin by both increasing the biomechanical driving force for damage while simultaneously decreasing the skin’s natural ability to resist, compromising the critical barrier function of the skin.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiomechanics 3acohesion 3acracking 3aenvironmental exposure 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3alipids 3amechanical properties 3aphotoaging 3askin neoplasms 3aultraviolet radiation 3avitamin D1 aLevi, Kemal1 aDauskardt, R.

To determine whether the storage period may be shortened, the most cold-tolerant life stage of the cowpea weevil was identified. Laboratory studies showed that the egg stage was most tolerant to -18 °C and that adults were most susceptible. To examine the efficacy of cold storage disinfestation, bags of black-eyed peas, Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp., infested with cowpea weevil eggs were buried within garbanzo bean bins placed in a commercial cold storage facility kept at approximately -18 °C and removed after 7, 14, and 21 d. Survival was highest in eggs located at the center of the bins and coincided with the slowest cooling rate. Although temperatures within the bins did not reach -18 °C until after 14-19 d, egg mortality was estimated to be >98% after just 7 d of exposure. Complete mortality of eggs occurred after 14 d of cold storage. A 2-wk treatment regimen may be sufficient for control of cowpea weevil in organic legumes. 3afrozen storage 3acowpeas 3ainsect control 3afreezers 3adevelopmental stages 3aspatial distribution 3afood storage 3astorage temperature 3astorage insects 3achickpeas 3aCallosobruchus maculatus 3astorage time 3astored product protection 3adisinfestation 3aorganic foods 3acold tolerance 3amortality 3adry beans 3aCurculionidae 2aAnimals 2aColeoptera. 2aCicer 2aFreezing 2aHealth Food 2aInsect Controlxmethods 2aSeeds 0abins1 aValero, K.A.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2003 Dec., v.  96, no.  6 p.1952-1957dEntomological Society of Americax0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0022-0493-96.6.19523Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/113163Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080315b20080404c00000000  aINDdNZMe2004/05/27  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02256naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245008700160300001600247520099900263592002801262650000801290650001301298650002001311650001901331650001001350650002701360650001801387651001001405653002501415653001801440653001801458653002801476653002401504700001501528700001601543700001701559700001701576700001501593773012301608856008201731852000901813655001201822IND60734118420221117083642.0211003e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073411842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jes.2021.03.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQi, Jing10aPre-oxidation enhanced cyanobacteria removal in drinking water treatment: A review  ap. 160-168.  aCyanobacterial bloom has many adverse effects on source water quality and drinking water production. The traditional water treatment process can hardly achieve satisfactory removal of algae cells. This review examines the impact of pre-oxidation on the removal of cyanobacteria by solid-liquid separation processes. It was reported that the introduction of chemical oxidants such as chlorine, potassium permanganate, and ozone in algae-laden water pretreatment could improve algae removal by the subsequent solid-liquid separation processes. However, over dosed oxidants can result in more serious water quality risks due to significant algae cell lysis and undesirable intracellular organic matter release. It was suggested that moderate pre-oxidation may enhance the removal of cyanobacteria without damaging algae cells. In this article, effects of moderate pretreatment on the solid-liquid separation processes (sedimentation, dissolved air flotation, and membrane filtration) are reviewed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3achlorine 3amicrofiltration 3aorganic matter 3aozone 3apotassium permanganate 3awater quality 3aChina 0aCyanobacterial bloom 0aPre-oxidation 0aSedimentation 0aDissolved air flotation 0aMembrane filtration1 aMa, Baiwen1 aMiao, Shiyu1 aLiu, Ruiping1 aHu, Chengzhi1 aQu, Jiuhui0 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2021 Dec., v. 110 p.160-168dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12417x1001-07427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2021.03.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01723naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245011700173300001600290520077200306592002801078650001401106650002101120650001501141700002501156700002001181773011401201856008601315990002301401852000901424655001201433IND60113170020221120085447.0141111e20110601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011317002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jelechem.2011.01.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMolina, Ángela,10aReaction layer thickness of a catalytic mechanism under transient and stationary chronopotentiometric conditions  ap. 173-179.  aExpressions for the reaction layer thickness of a catalytic mechanism at planar and spherical electrodes, deduced for transient and stationary chronopotentiometric conditions for three types of programmed currents (constant current, power time current and exponential time current) are presented.

However, it remains unclear how the hydrological conditions due to dam construction control the processes of nitrogen transformation in reservoir waters. To address this issue, we examined the spatial-temporal characteristics of nitrate concentrations, δ¹⁵N-NO₃⁻, δ¹⁸O-NO₃⁻, δ¹⁸O-H₂O, relative water column stability (RWCS), and related environmental factors in a subtropical eutrophic reservoir (Hongfeng Reservoir, HFR), Southwest China. We found that denitrification was the most important nitrogen transformation process in the HFR and that higher denitrification intensity was associated with increased RWCS in summer, which suggested hydrological control of the denitrification process. In contrast, low RWCS conditions favored the nitrification process in the HFR in winter. Additionally, dissolved oxygen (DO; p < 0.05) and nitrate concentrations (p < 0.01) had significant impacts on the denitrification rate. We also found that the spatiotemporal RWCS variations were a prerequisite for regulating DO/nitrate stratification and the coupling/decoupling of nitrification-denitrification at the local and global scales. This study would advances our knowledge of the impacts of RWCS and thermal stratification on nitrogen transformation processes in reservoirs.  aPublisher supplied data 3adenitrification 3aeutrophication 3ahydrology 3anitrates 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3anitrous oxide 3aoxygen 3asummer 3atemperature profiles 3awinter 3aChina 0aThermal stratification 0aRWCS 0aDenitrification 0aNitrogen transformation 0aReservoir1 aLi, Xiao-Dong1 aLi, Siqi1 aDing, Shiyuan1 aLi, Qinkai1 aYang, Mengdi1 aLv, Hong1 aWang, Yiyao0 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2022 Jan., v. 111 p.208-219dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12417x1001-07427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2021.02.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02267naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100002000167245013100187300001600318520109300334592002801427653001401455653001401469653001301483653001501496653001501511653001001526653000901536653003101545653003801576700002301614700002501637773013101662856011501793852000901908655001201917IND60125187220221118193226.0151102e200606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012518722DNAL7 a10.1647/1082-6742(2006)20[101:MSASIA]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSouza, Marcy J.10aMultifocal Sialoceles and Sialoliths in a Yellow-naped Amazon Parrot (Amazona ochrocephala auropalliata) With Chronic Ptyalism  ap. 101-104.  aA yellow-naped Amazon parrot (Amazona ochrocephala auropalliata) was presented with a 1-year history of feather-destructive behavior with an incidental 14-year history of ptyalism. Palpation, radiographs, fluoroscopy, and biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of multiple sialoceles and sialoliths throughout the cervical region. Treatment for ptyalism was not necessary in this parrot; however, treatment in other species generally involves surgical resection or medical treatment with anticholinergics or botulinum toxin A injections. Clinical signs associated with both the presence of sialoceles and feather-destructive behavior improved briefly with changes in husbandry and medical treatment including antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medications. There have been few reports of this lesion in avian species, except for occasional reports in pigeons where the underlying cause is thought to be either hypovitaminosis A or herpesviral infection. This parrot was on a nutritionally adequate diet and had a negative antibody titer for Pacheco's disease, and no underlying cause was identified.  aPublisher supplied data 0asialocele 0asialolith 0aptyalism 0asalivation 0asialorrhea 0aavian 0abird 0ayellow-naped Amazon parrot 0aAmazona ochrocephala auropalliata1 aWilson, G.

At pH 7.2, two well defined peaks with peak potential (Eₚ) of ∼1225mV and ∼1335mV were appeared for the oxidation of ASA and CAF, respectively. Anodic peaks for ASA and CAF showed a systematic increase in peak current with increase in concentration in the range 0.02–100μM with sensitivity of 0.16 and 0.17μA/μM, respectively. Detection limits (3σ/slope) for ASA and CAF were found to be 0.01 and 0.008μM, respectively whereas, the limit of quantifications were found to be 0.032 and 0.026μM, respectively.

Experimental results demonstrate that the CO₂ solubility in the synthetic formation brines can be reliably represented by that in the synthetic NaCl+CaCl₂ brines. We extended our previously developed model (PSUCO2) to calculate CO₂ solubility in aqueous mixed-salt solution by using the additivity rule of the Setschenow coefficients of the individual ions (Na⁺, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, K⁺, Cl–, and SO₄²–). Comparisons with previously published models against the experimental data reveal a clear improvement of the proposed PSUCO2 model. Additionally, the path of the maximum gradient of the CO₂ solubility contours divides the P-T diagram into two distinct regions: in Region I, the CO₂ solubility in the aqueous phase decreases monotonically in response to increased temperature; in region II, the behavior of the CO₂ solubility is the opposite of that in Region I as the temperature increases.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3achlorides 3aions 3amagnesium 3amodels 3apotassium 3asodium 3asolubility 3atemperature1 aDilmore, Robert1 aAllen, Douglas E.,1 aHedges, Sheila W.1 aSoong, Yee1 aLvov, Serguei N.0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2015 Feb. 03, v. 49, no. 3 p.1972-1980dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes505550a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02987naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011700164300001600281520151900297592002801816650001501844650002701859650001901886650002501905650002401930650001201954650001501966650002201981650001302003650003502016650001302051650002102064650001602085650001302101650002102114650001302135650001902148651001002167700001502177700001402192700001402206700001902220700001802239700001802257773011602275856008102391852000902472655001202481IND60575014220221118062524.0170728e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057501422DNAL7 a10.1007/s00343-017-5339-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Rongfeng10aSulfated polysaccharides with antioxidant and anticoagulant activity from the sea cucumber Holothuria fuscogliva  ap. 763-769.  aSea cucumber is a traditional nutritional food and medicinal resource with many bioactive components in China. Holothuria fuscogliva is a big sea cucumber with a rich of bioactive polysaccharides. To investigate the bioactivities of the polysaccharides from sea cucumber H. fuscogliva, we prepared the sulfated polysaccharides (HfP) from sea cucumber H. fuscogliva using a protease hydrolysis method. Antioxidant activities of HfP were investigated, including hydroxyl radical scavenging activity and superoxide radical scavenging activity. And, the anticoagulant activities of HfP were studied, including the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PT) and thrombin time (TT). The average molecular weight was 1 867.1 Da, with a sulfate content of 20.7%. In addition, the molar ratio of monosaccharide composition of HfP was Man: Rha: Glc A: Glc: Gal: Xyl: Fuc=0.083 6: 0.437: 0.134: 0:1.182: 0.748: 1. It had a strong antioxidant activity, the hydroxyl and superoxide radical scavenging activity EC₅₀ of HfP was 3.74 and 0.037 mg/mL, respectively. It also showed a good anticoagulant activity in our study. The APTT of HfP was much higher than that of heparin sodium, and the PT and TT of HfP was close to that of heparin sodium at a low concentration. Therefore, HfP shows a good antioxidant and anticoagulant activity and it may become a potential candidate of the natural antioxidant and anticoagulant and will have a good application future in health product or medicine industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolothuria 3aanticoagulant activity 3aanticoagulants 3aantioxidant activity 3abioactive compounds 3aheparin 3ahydrolysis 3ahydroxyl radicals 3aindustry 3amedian effective concentration 3amedicine 3amolecular weight 3aprothrombin 3asulfates 3asuperoxide anion 3athrombin 3athromboplastin 3aChina1 aYu, Huahua1 aYue, Yang1 aLiu, Song1 aXing, Rong’e1 aChen, Xiaolin1 aLi, Pengcheng0 tChinese journal of oceanology and limnology.g2017 July, v. 35, no. 4 p.763-769dScience Pressx0254-40597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-017-5339-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03457naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006400148245007400212300001400286520147000300592002801770650002101798650001101819650002001830650001001850650001301860650002001873650001401893650001301907650002101920650001101941650003001952650001301982650002901995653003202024653000902056653002402065653002502089653001502114700006602129700005702195700006102252700001402313700002102327700002102348700002002369700006002389700006002449700002002509700006502529700005602594773013702650856008302787852000902870655001202879IND60741646220221116154119.0210715e20210827xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074164622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.06.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKobayashi, Yoshifumi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1838-420110aEzh2 knockout in mesenchymal cells causes enamel hyper-mineralization  ap. 72-78.  aEnhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is the catalytic core of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which primarily methylates lysine 27 on histone H3 (H2K27me3), generating transcriptionally suppressed heterochromatin. Since EZH2 suppresses expression of genes involved in dentin formation, we examined the role of EZH2 in tooth development. Intriguingly, microCT analysis of teeth from mice with conditional Ezh2 knockout in uncommitted mesenchymal cells showed hyper-mineralization of enamel, which is produced by the epithelial-lineage cells, ameloblasts. Scanning electron microscopy analysis and nano-indentation of the incisor enamel from knockout mice revealed smaller inter-rod spaces and higher hardness compared to wild type enamel, respectively. Interestingly, expression of the calcium channel subunit gene, Orai2, was decreased compared to its competitor, Orai1, both in knockout mouse incisors and the ex vivo culture of ameloblasts with the surrounding tissues under EZH2 inhibition. Moreover, histological analysis of incisor from knockout mice showed decreased ameloblastin and expedited KLK4 expression in the ameloblasts. These observations suggest that EZH2 depletion in dental mesenchymal cells reduces enamel matrix formation and increases enamel protease activity from ameloblasts, resulting in enamel hyper-mineralization. This study demonstrates the significant role of the suppressive H3K27me3 mark for heterochromatin on enamel formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium channels 3aenamel 3aenzyme activity 3agenes 3ahardness 3aheterochromatin 3ahistology 3ahistones 3aknockout mutants 3alysine 3amicro-computed tomography 3aresearch 3atranscription (genetics) 0aEnamel hyper-mineralization 0aEZH2 0aHistone methylation 0aDental follicle cell 0aAmeloblast1 aQuispe-Salcedo, Angela1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6449-46311 aBodas, Sanika1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5089-03371 aMatsumura, Satoko1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2774-35601 aLi, Erhao1 aJohnson, Richard1 aChoudhury, Marwa1 aFine, Daniel H.1 aNadimpalli, Siva1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9281-48421 aDuncan, Henry F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8690-23791 aDudakovic, Amel1 aVan Wijnen, Andre J.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4458-09461 aShimizu, Emi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1209-22860 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2021 Aug. 27, v. 567 p.72-78dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.06.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03427naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001100137245017800148300001800326500002000344520167600364592002802040596005902068596008902127650001602216650002202232650002302254650001802277650001702295650001702312650003102329650002402360650001002384650002802394650002702422650001202449650001502461650001202476650001302488650002902501650002602530700001402556700001202570700001802582700001902600700001902619700005402638773012502692856007102817852000902888655001202897IND60647172720221118060803.0190617e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064717272DNAL7 a10.1002/ps.53162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Bo10aTranscription factors CncC/Maf and AhR/ARNT coordinately regulate the expression of multiple GSTs conferring resistance to chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin in Spodoptera exigua  ap. 2009-2019.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Glutathione S‐transferases (GSTs) are a superfamily of multifunctional dimeric proteins existing in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. They are involved in the detoxification of both endogenous and exogenous electrophiles, including insecticides. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of GST genes in insects are poorly understood. RESULTS: We first identified at least three GST genes involved in resistance to the insecticides chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin. Analysis of upstream sequences revealed that three GSTs (SeGSTo2, SeGSTe6 and SeGSTd3) harbor the same cap ‘n’ collar C/muscle aponeurosis fibromatosis (CncC/Maf) binding site, and SeGSTo2 and SeGSTe6 contain the aryl hydrocarbon receptor/aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (AhR/ARNT) binding site. Luciferase reporter assay showed co‐transfection of reporter plasmid containing the SeGSTe6 promoter with CncC and/or Maf expressing constructs significantly boosted transcription. Similarly, AhR and/or ARNT expressing constructs also significantly increased the promoter activities. The co‐transfection of mutated reporter plasmid with CncC/Maf or AhR/ARNT did not increase transcription activity anymore. Constitutive over‐expression of CncC, Maf and AhR was also found in the HZ16 strain, which might be the molecular mechanism for up‐regulated expression of multiple detoxification genes conferring resistance to insecticides. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that CncC/Maf and AhR/ARNT coordinately regulate the expression of multiple GST genes involved in insecticide resistance in Spodoptera exigua. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data  a31272063cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aKYCX17_0571cPostgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province 3aLewis acids 3aSpodoptera exigua 3aaromatic compounds 3abinding sites 3achlorpyrifos 3acypermethrin 3agene expression regulation 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3aglutathione transferase 3ainsecticide resistance 3ainsects 3aluciferase 3amuscles 3aplasmids 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors1 aHuang, He1 aWei, Qi1 aRen, Miaomiao1 aMburu, David K1 aTian, Xiangrui1 aSu, Jianya1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4870-394X0 tPest management science.g2019 July, v. 75, no. 7 p.2009-2019dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl59519x1526-498X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.53163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03438naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245012900162300001600291520182800307592002802135650002502163650001302188650001702201650002302218650001602241650002602257650001902283650001302302650001202315650001002327650001302337650001702350650003102367651001002398651001702408653001802425653001602443653001802459653001502477653001602492653001602508653001502524653001502539653001802554700001702572700001402589700001602603700001702619773015602636856008302792852000902875655001202884IND60644933720221120215858.0190809e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064493372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2019.05.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNajar, B.10aEssential oils and volatile emission of eight South African species of Helichrysum grown in uniform environmental conditions  ap. 178-187.  aThis paper reported for the first time the aroma profile and essential oil composition of eight species of Helichrysum endemic in South Africa but grown in Italy (CREA-Sanremo collection). The volatiles of all the studied Helichrysum were dominated by monoterpene hydrocarbons, except for H. basalticum, where sesquiterpene hydrocarbons was the main class of compounds with β-caryophyllene (13.7%) and α-guaiene (11.9%) as major components.Despite the great diversity of compounds obtained in the volatile emission (more than 130), only four compounds were responsible for at least 34% of the identified fraction. These compounds were: sabinene (16.0%), β-caryophyllene and α-guaiene in H. basalticum; sabinene (57.7%) in H. foetidum; (Z)-β-ocimene (34.6%), tricyclene (16.2%) and myrcene (10.0%) in H. incanatum; myrcene (29.3%), tricyclene (21.5%) and limonene in H. indicum; tricyclene (32.1%) and (E)-3-hexanol acetate (20.1%) in H. montanum; limonene (10.3%), sabinene (8.9%), 1-decene (7.6%) and 1-hexanol (7.0%) in H. mutabile; α- and β-pinene in H. patulum (27.6% and 44.9%, respectively) and α-pinene (36.3%) and α-fanchene(15.6%) in H. setosum.The EOs composition of these species was also different from each other with sesquiterpene compounds as the prevalent class. Valerianol (16.3%, os, in H. basalticum), ledol (16.3%, os, in H. foetidum), β-caryophyllene (11.0% and 13.4%, sh, in H. indicum and H. patulum, respectively), viridiflorol (18.3%, os, in H. montanum) and valerianol (30.1%, os in H. setosum) were found to be the main constituents. It is worthy to highlighting that the H. incarnatum EO showed a similar behaviour to that of the spontaneous emission with a predominance of monoterpene hydrocarbons (60.7% in EO vs 81.4% in VOC), both represented by (Z)-β-ocimene as main constituent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelichrysum foetidum 3aacetates 3aalpha-pinene 3abeta-caryophyllene 3abeta-pinene 3aenvironmental factors 3aessential oils 3alimonene 3amyrcene 3aodors 3asabinene 3aviridiflorol 3avolatile organic compounds 3aItaly 3aSouth Africa 0aH. basalticum 0aH. foetidum 0aH. incarnatum 0aH. indicum 0aH. montanum 0aH. mutabile 0aH. patulum 0aH. setosum 0aaroma profile1 aCervelli, C.1 aFerri, B.1 aCioni, P.L.1 aPistelli, L.0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2019 Aug., v. 124 p.178-187dElsevier B.V.aSouth African Association of BotanistswJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2019.05.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02698naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100003100141245016200172300001400334520167800348592002802026653002002054653001602074653001002090653001302100653002502113700002402138700001902162773012902181856007702310852000902387655001202396IND60125187720221118194116.0151102e200606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012518772DNAL7 a10.1647/2005-005R.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSiegal-Willott, Jessica L.10aLack of Detectable Antibody Response in Greater Flamingos (Phoenicopterus ruber ruber) After Vaccination Against West Nile Virus With a Killed Equine Vaccine  ap. 89-93.  aGreater flamingos (Phoenicopterus ruber ruber), an endangered and popular zoo bird species, are susceptible to West Nile virus (WNV) infection, often with a fatal outcome. To determine whether vaccination of greater flamingos produced an immunologic response with measurable antibody titers and to monitor for adverse effects of vaccination on health status, a vaccine trial against WNV infection, using a killed vaccine licensed for use in horses, was performed in 1-month-old flamingo chicks. Fifteen chicks determined to be seronegative for WNV were divided into 2 groups: Group A (n == 8) received 2, 1-ml IM doses of vaccine 3 weeks apart; and Group B (n == 7) received 1, 0.5-ml IM dose, followed by 2, 1-ml IM doses, all given 3 weeks apart. A booster vaccination of 1 ml was administered to all birds 280 days after the initial vaccination series. Antibody titers were measured after the initial immunization and before and 3 weeks after the booster vaccination by plaque-reduction neutralization testing (PRNT). A positive titer at the 90%% plaque-reduction cut-off was not detected after initial vaccination or booster vaccination in any of the birds studied, but serum neutralizing activity was detected in 60%% of the samples after the booster at 50%%––82%% plaque reduction at a 1:20 dilution. No adverse effects of vaccination were observed. The lack of a demonstrable antibody response to WNV vaccination in the flamingos may be attributable to the lack of species specificity of the vaccine, poorly developed immune system in 1-month-old flamingo chicks, poor sample handling or storage, or inadequate vaccine dose volume or frequency of administration.  aPublisher supplied data 0aWest Nile virus 0avaccination 0aavian 0aflamingo 0aPhoenicopterus ruber1 aCarpenter, James W.1 aGlaser, Amy L.0 tJournal of avian medicine and surgery.g2006 June, v. 20, no. 2 p.89-93dAssociation of Avian Veterinariansx1082-67427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1647%2F2005-005R.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02958naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245011300171300001600284520161000300592002801910650002101938650002601959650002701985650001602012650002902028650002602057650002702083650001802110650002502128650002002153650001102173650001402184650001702198650001002215650001402225650001702239650001402256700003102270700001802301773009902319856008502418852000902503655001202512IND60080873020221119125217.0140812e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008087302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.exppara.2012.12.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRico-Mata, Rosa10aEffect of antimicrobial peptides derived from human cathelicidin LL-37 on Entamoeba histolytica trophozoites  ap. 300-306.  aThe human cathelicidin hCAP18/LL-37 is an antimicrobial protein consisting of a conserved N-terminal prosequence called the cathelin-like domain and a C-terminal peptide called LL-37. This peptide contains 37 amino acid residues, and several truncated variants obtained from natural sources or by chemical synthesis differ in their capability to damage Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria as well as Candida albicans. KR-12 is the shortest peptide (12 amino acids) of LL-37 that has conserved antibacterial activity. In addition to LL-37, other active cathelicidin-derived peptides have been reported; for instance, the peptides KR-20, a 20-aa derivative of LL-37, and KS-30, a 30-aa derivative of LL-37, have been found in human sweat. Both peptides exhibit an overall increased antibacterial and antifungal activity when compared with LL-37. We investigated the effect of LL-37 and three peptides derived from this antimicrobial molecule, KR-12, KR-20 and KS-30, on the integrity of Entamoeba histolytica trophozoites. The four peptides showed effects on E. histolytica integrity and viability in the concentration range of 10–50μM. The peptides KR-12, KR-20, KS-30 and LL-37 differed in their capability to damage the parasite integrity, with KR-20 being the most effective and with KR-12 and LL-37 being less active. These results demonstrate the ability of antimicrobial peptides derived from human cathelicidin to damage Entamoeba trophozoites. Moreover, it was shown that the integrity of the peptides is altered in the presence of an ameba soluble fraction with cysteine protease activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida albicans 3aEntamoeba histolytica 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aamino acids 3aantibacterial properties 3aantifungal properties 3aantimicrobial proteins 3acathelicidins 3acysteine proteinases 3aenzyme activity 3ahumans 3aparasites 3aparasitology 3asweat 3asynthesis 3atrophozoites 3aviability1 aDe Leon-Rodriguez, Luis M.1 aAvila, Eva E.0 tExperimental parasitology.g2013 Mar., v. 133, no. 3 p.300-306dElsevier Inc.x0014-48947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2012.12.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02813naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002600186245010400212300002000316506007600336520107800412592002801490506003701518650002101555650001301576650002201589650001201611650001801623650002201641650001501663650001101678650001201689650002001701650001101721653002601732653001401758653001101772653002001783700002001803700002601823700002101849700002001870700002201890700001801912700001801930700002401948700002301972773017601995856007902171852000902250655001202259IND60172322120221207055937.0150602e20121016xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017232212DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12076531092doi7 aPMC34794692pmcid7 a230352512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaestre-Reyna, Manuel10aStructural basis for promiscuity and specificity during Candida glabrata invasion of host epithelia  ap. 16864-16869.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe human pathogenic yeast Candida glabrata harbors more than 20 surface-exposed, epithelial adhesins (Epas) for host cell adhesion. The Epa family recognizes host glycans and discriminates between target tissues by their adhesin (A) domains, but a detailed structural basis for ligand-binding specificity of Epa proteins has been lacking so far. In this study, we provide high-resolution crystal structures of the Epa1A domain in complex with different carbohydrate ligands that reveal how host cell mucin-type O -glycans are recognized and allow a structure-guided classification of the Epa family into specific subtypes. Further detailed structural and functional characterization of subtype-switched Epa1 variants shows that specificity is governed by two inner loops, CBL1 and CBL2, involved in calcium binding as well as by three outer loops, L1, L2, and L3. In summary, our study provides the structural basis for promiscuity and specificity of Epa adhesins, which might further contribute to developing anti-adhesive antimycotics and combating Candida colonization.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCandida glabrata 3aadhesins 3aantifungal agents 3acalcium 3acell adhesion 3acrystal structure 3aepithelium 3ahumans 3aligands 3apolysaccharides 3ayeasts 0amolecular recognition 0aT-antigen 0alectin 0afungal pathogen1 aDiderrich, Rike1 aVeelders, Maik Stefan1 aEulenburg, Georg1 aKalugin, Vitali1 aBrückner, Stefan1 aKeller, Petra1 aRupp, Steffen1 aMösch, Hans-Ulrich1 aEssen, Lars-Oliver0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 Oct. 16, v. 109, no. 42 p.16864-16869dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12076531093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03232naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002500155245014700180300001300327520201400340592002802354650000802382650001102390650001602401650001302417650001102430650001902441650002302460650002102483650001302504653002102517653000902538653003602547653001602583653002102599653001102620700001902631773007402650856008902724852000902813655001202822IND60545393020221119170221.0160901e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054539302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2014.08.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrafft, Marie Pierre10aSelected physicochemical aspects of poly- and perfluoroalkylated substances relevant to performance, environment and sustainability—Part one  ap. 4-19.  aThe elemental characteristics of the fluorine atom tell us that replacing an alkyl chain by a perfluoroalkyl or polyfluorinated chain in a molecule or polymer is consequential.

It was eventually discovered, however, that PFASs with seven or more carbon-long perfluoroalkyl chains had disseminated in air, water, soil and biota worldwide, are persistent in the environment and bioaccumulative in animals and humans, raising serious health and environmental concerns. Further use of long-chain PFASs is environmentally not sustainable. Most leading manufacturers have turned to shorter four to six carbon perfluoroalkyl chain products that are not considered bioaccumulative. However, many of the key performances of PFASs decrease sharply when fluorinated chains become shorter. Fluorosurfactants become less effective and less efficient, provide lesser barrier film stability, etc. On the other hand, they remain as persistent in the environment as their longer chain homologues. Surprisingly little data (with considerable discrepancies) is accessible on the physicochemical properties of the PFASs under examination, a situation that requires consideration and rectification. Such data are needed for understanding the environmental and in vivo behaviour of PFASs. They should help determine which, for which uses, and to what extent, PFASs are environmentally sustainable.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acarbon 3aemulsifying 3afluorine 3ahumans 3ahydrophobicity 3aoptical properties 3aperfluorocarbons 3apolymers 0aFluorosurfactant 0aPFOA 0aSelf-assembled interfacial film 0aPersistence 0aBioconcentration 0aHealth1 aRiess, Jean G.0 tChemosphere.g2015 June, v. 129 p.4-19dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2014.08.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02672naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245012100161300001800282520138800300592002801688650002401716650002401740650002501764650000901789650001001798650001101808650001301819650001101832650002701843650002201870650001701892650001901909650002201928700002101950700002401971700002201995700002502017773012402042856007502166852000902241655001202250IND60536262120170606000000.0160806e20150203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053626212DNAL7 a10.1021/es50571592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoulter, David P.10aFluctuating Water Temperatures Affect Development, Physiological Responses and Cause Sex Reversal in Fathead Minnows  ap. 1921-1928.  aNatural and human activities can result in both high temporal and spatial variability in water temperature. Rapid temperature changes have the potential to dramatically affect physiological processes in aquatic organisms and, due to their limited mobility, fish early life stages are particularly vulnerable to ambient temperature fluctuations. In this study, we examined how the magnitude and frequency of temperature fluctuations affect survival, growth, development, expression of thermoresponsive genes, and gonadal differentiation in fathead minnows, Pimephales promelas. We exposed individuals (0 to 4 days post fertilization) of known genotypic sex to fluctuations of Δ4 °C over 12-h, Δ8 °C over 12- and 24-h, and three stable temperatures (21, 25, and 29 °C) for up to 45 d. Expression of hsp70 in fish exposed to the highest-magnitude, highest-frequency fluctuating treatment cycled in concert with temperature and was upregulated initially during exposure, and may have contributed to temperature fluctuations having little effect on time to and size at hatching (whole-organism responses). This treatment also caused fish to undergo nondirectional sex reversal. These results indicate that hsp70 may be involved in mediating thermal stress from subdaily temperature fluctuations and that sex determination in fathead minnows can be influenced by cycling temperatures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPimephales promelas 3aambient temperature 3adevelopmental stages 3afish 3agenes 3agonads 3ahatching 3ahumans 3aphysiological response 3asex determination 3asex reversal 3athermal stress 3awater temperature1 aHöök, Tomas

We previously reported that Cdc2-like kinase 2 (Clk2) promotes neural development in Xenopus embryos by regulating morphogen signaling. However, the functions of other Clk family members and their roles in early embryonic development remain unknown. Here, we show that in addition to Clk2, Clk1 and Clk3 play a role in the formation of neural tissue in Xenopus. clk1 and clk3 are co-expressed in the developing neural tissue during early Xenopus embryogenesis. We found that overexpression of clk1 and clk3 increases the expression of neural marker genes in ectodermal explants. Furthermore, knockdown experiments showed that clk3 is required for the formation of neural tissues. These results suggest that Xenopus Clk3 plays an essential role in promoting neural development during early embryogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aXenopus 3acentral nervous system 3aectoderm 3aembryogenesis 3aneurodevelopment 3aprotein kinases 3aresearch 3avertebrates 0aClk3 0aNeural development 0aXenopus embryogenesis 0aAutism spectrum disorder1 aNakamura, Makoto1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5527-50741 aTakebayashi-Suzuki, Kimiko1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0721-07161 aFatchiyah, Fatchiyah1 aSuzuki, Atsushi0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2021 Aug. 27, v. 567 p.99-105dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.06.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01298naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245010100153300002000254520026200274592002800536650002300564650002100587650001300608650001600621700002000637700001300657700001800670700002200688700001700710700001400727773013600741856007400877852000900951655001200960IND60660947220221119115302.0190827e20150616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066094722DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cc02026c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Yue10aN-Fused BDOPV: a tetralactam derivative as a building block for polymer field-effect transistors  ap. 10514-10516.  aAn N-fused BDOPV derivative, NBDOPV, was designed and synthesized.

Multiple factors may influence decision making, including the local environmental capacity of a given area and individual and cultural preferences. This study compares zooarchaeological data from sites across the length and breadth of the Holocene Near East with modelled patterns of land use. The goal is to determine how far variation in the capacities of local landscapes impacted the choices made in animal production. Our approach allows us to investigate trends through time as well as between different regions of the Near East. The spatial and temporal scales employed also mean we can investigate the relationship between food production and climate trends. We find substantial patterning in the choices made in animal production, reflecting complex and regionally diverse production approaches. We demonstrate a prioritisation of individual and societal preferences to produce specific animals which is rarely impacted by either short or long term changes in aridity. We also find that the emergence of urban sites has a major impact on provisioning structures, and argue that the resulting organisational forms may have resulted in urban sustainability at the expense or rural sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolocene epoch 3aanimal production 3aanimals 3aclimate 3adry environmental conditions 3afood production 3aland use 3aprioritization 3aMiddle East 0aZooarchaeology 0aNear east 0aMesopotamia 0aLevant 0aClimate change1 aWelton, L.1 ade Gruchy, M.1 aLawrence, D.0 tQuaternary international.g2021 Sept. 10, v. 595 p.54-87dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2021.03.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03005naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245010000164300001600264520158200280592002801862650002201890650001601912650002401928650001101952650001101963650001401974650002301988650001502011650002202026650002202048650001702070650001402087650001302101650001802114650001602132650001802148650001102166650001302177650001302190650002202203650001102225651002102236700001802257700001802275773011602293856008102409852000902490655001202499IND60575014520221118062706.0170728e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057501452DNAL7 a10.1007/s00343-017-6076-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Jee Eun10aDynamic genetic features of eukaryotic plankton diversity in the Nakdong River estuary of Korea  ap. 844-857.  aEstuaries are environments where freshwater and seawater mix and they display various salinity profiles. The construction of river barrages and dams has rapidly changed these environments and has had a wide range of impacts on plankton communities. To understand the dynamics of such communities, researchers need accurate and rapid techniques for detecting plankton species. We evaluated the diversity of eukaryotic plankton over a salinity gradient by applying a metagenomics tool at the Nakdong River estuary in Korea. Environmental samples were collected on three dates during summer and autumn of 2011 at the Eulsukdo Bridge at the mouth of that river. Amplifying the 18S rDNA allowed us to analyze 456 clones and 122 phylotypes. Metagenomic sequences revealed various taxonomic groups and cryptic genetic variations at the intra- and inter-specific levels. By analyzing the same station at each sampling date, we observed that the phylotypes presented a salinity-related pattern of diversity in assemblages. The variety of species within freshwater samples reflected the rapid environmental changes caused by freshwater inputs. Dinophyceae phylotypes accounted for the highest proportion of overall diversity in the seawater samples. Euryhaline diatoms and dinoflagellates were observed in the freshwater, brackish and seawater samples. The biological data for species composition demonstrate the transitional state between freshwater and seawater. Therefore, this metagenomics information can serve as a biological indicator for tracking changes in aquatic environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aDinophyceae 3aaquatic environment 3aautumn 3aclones 3aestuaries 3aeuryhaline species 3afreshwater 3agenetic variation 3aindicator species 3ametagenomics 3aphylotype 3aplankton 3arapid methods 3aresearchers 3aribosomal DNA 3arivers 3asalinity 3aseawater 3aspecies diversity 3asummer 3aKorean Peninsula1 aChung, Ik Kyo1 aLee, Sang-Rae0 tChinese journal of oceanology and limnology.g2017 July, v. 35, no. 4 p.844-857dScience Pressx0254-40597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-017-6076-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02933naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245020600168300001400374500001900388520179600407592002802203650001002231650001702241650001102258650001302269653002602282653001802308653002202326653001302348653001302361653000802374773010702382856008502489852000902574655001202583IND60734119320221117084347.0210624e20210920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073411932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2021.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakakura, Jun10aTowards improved identification of obsidian microblade and microblade-like debitage knapping techniques: A case study from the Last Glacial Maximum assemblage of Kawanishi-C in Hokkaido, Northern Japan  ap. 65-78.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aUntil recently, several hypotheses on the origin(s) and dispersion of microblade technology in Northeast Asia have been presented and discussed. Although various definitions of microblade and bladelet have been proposed in diverse geographic and chronological contexts, several researchers may agree that the pressure knapping technique for microblade production plays a paramount role in the process of significant changes in lithic technology and human behaviours between marine isotope stages (MIS) 3 and 2. One of the main topics in the study of microblade technology in Northeast Asia is establishing a systematic and reliable method for identifying microblade knapping techniques that are quantitatively verified. This paper attempts to present a more improved method for identifying microblade knapping techniques by dealing with the analysis of fracture wings which are the reliable indicators of the crack velocity. The focus of this paper is on identifying obsidian microblade-like debitage knapping techniques in the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) assemblage of Kawanishi-C in Hokkaido, Northern Japan. The results of fracture wing analysis show that the microblade-like longitudinal debitage production at the Kashiwadai-C site was employed by not pressure but percussion techniques. This gives new insights into the diversity of microblade and microblae-like debitage reduction sequences in the LGM Hokkaido and complex process of significant changes in lithic technology, especially in relation to the emergence of microblade technology. In addition, this study shows that the analysis of fracture wings can allow appropriate technological evaluation of the microblades and microblade-like longitudinal debitage production in the period before and around the LGM in Northeast Asia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJapan 3acase studies 3ahumans 3aisotopes 0aMicroblade technology 0aFracture wing 0aPressure knapping 0aObsidian 0aHokkaido 0aLGM0 tQuaternary international.g2021 Sept. 20, v. 596 p.65-78dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2021.04.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03763naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245011600185300001800301520195300319592002802272650001802300650001602318650001002334650001402344650001202358650002202370650001102392650001502403650000902418650001602427650001302443650001002456650001702466650001102483650003402494650002102528650001602549650001202565650001202577650001002589650002002599650004602619650002402665650002002689650001702709650003302726650003302759650003202792650004202824650003302866700002002899773008402919852000903003856008103012930003303093946001103126655001203137IND60438831520221121212111.0151023e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043883152DNAL7 a170863982pmid7 a10.1007/s00425-006-0426-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aD’Angeli, S.10aOsmotin induces cold protection in olive trees by affecting programmed cell death and cytoskeleton organization  ap. 1147-1163.  aOsmotin is a pathogenesis-related protein exhibiting cryoprotective functions. Our aim was to understand whether it is involved in the cold acclimation of the olive tree (Olea europaea L.), a frost-sensitive species lacking dormancy. We exposed olive trees expressing tobacco osmotin gene under the 35S promoter (35S:osm) [in the same manner as wild type (wt) plants] to cold shocks in the presence/absence of cold acclimation, and monitored changes in programmed cell death (PCD), cytoskeleton, and calcium ([Ca²⁺]c) signalling. In the wt, osmotin was immunolocalized only in cold-acclimated plants, and in the tissues showing PCD. In the 35S:osm clones, the protein was detected also in the non-acclimated plants, and always in the tissues exhibiting PCD. In the non-acclimated wt protoplasts exposed to cold shock, a transient decrease in phallotoxin signal suggests a temporary disassembly of F-actin, a transient increase occurred instead in 35S:osm protoplasts exposed to the same shock. Transient increases in [Ca²⁺]c were observed only in the wt protoplasts. However, when F-actin was depolymerized by cytochalasin or latrunculin, and microtubules by colchicine, increase in [Ca²⁺]c also occurred in the 35S:osm protoplasts. Successive cold shocks caused transient rises in [Ca²⁺]c and transient decreases in the phallotoxin signal in wt protoplasts. No change occurred in [Ca²⁺]c occurred in the 35S:osm protoplasts. The phallotoxin signal transiently increased at the first shock, but did not change after the subsequent shocks, and an overall signal reduction occurred with shock repetition. Following acclimation, no cold shock-induced change in [Ca²⁺]c levels and F-actin signal occurred either in wt or 35S:osm protoplasts. The results show that osmotin is positively involved in the acclimation-related PCD, in blocking the cold-induced calcium signalling, and in affecting cytoskeleton in response to cold stimuli.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOlea europaea 3aacclimation 3aactin 3aapoptosis 3acalcium 3acalcium signaling 3aclones 3acolchicine 3acold 3acold stress 3adormancy 3agenes 3amicrotubules 3aolives 3apathogenesis-related proteins 3apromoter regions 3aprotoplasts 3atissues 3atobacco 3atrees 2aAcclimatization 2aApoptosis Regulatory Proteinsxphysiology 2aCalciumxmetabolism 2aCells, Cultured 2aCold Climate 2aCytoskeletonxultrastructure 2aMicrotubulesxultrastructure 2aOleaxcytologyxphysiology. 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aPlants, Genetically Modified1 aAltamura, M.

Horizontal gene transfer from unrelated organisms has occurred in the course of plant evolution, suggesting that some foreign genes may be useful to plants. The CtHSR1 gene, previously isolated from the halophytic yeast Candida tropicalis, encodes a heat-shock transcription factor-related protein. CtHSR1, with expression driven by its own promoter or by the Arabidopsis UBQ10 promoter, was introduced into the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation and the resulting transgenic plants were more tolerant to drought than controls. Fusions of the CtHSR1 promoter with β-glucuronidase reporter gene indicated that this fungal promoter drives expression to phloem tissues. A chimera of CtHSR1 and green fluorescence protein is localized at the cell nucleus. The physiological mechanism of drought tolerance in transgenic plants is based on reduced transpiration (which correlates with decreased opening of stomata and increased levels of jasmonic acid) and increased osmotic potential (which correlates with increased proline accumulation). Transcriptomic analysis indicates that the CtHSR1 transgenic plants overexpressed a hundred of genes, including many relevant to stress defense such as LOX4 (involved in jasmonic acid synthesis) and P5CS1 (involved in proline biosynthesis). The promoters of the induced genes were enriched in upstream activating sequences for water stress induction. These results demonstrate that genes from unrelated organisms can have functional expression in plants from its own promoter and expand the possibilities of useful transgenes for plant biotechnology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgrobacterium 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aCandida tropicalis 3abeta-glucuronidase 3abiosynthesis 3abiotechnology 3acell nucleus 3adrought tolerance 3aevolution 3agene overexpression 3agreen fluorescent protein 3ahalophytes 3ahorizontal gene transfer 3ajasmonic acid 3aosmotic pressure 3aphloem 3aproline 3areporter genes 3astomata 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptomics 3atransgenes 3atransgenic plants 3atranspiration 3awater stress 3ayeasts1 aArif, Anjuman1 aNebauer, Sergio G.1 aBueso, Eduardo1 aAli, Rashid1 aMontesinos, Consuelo1 aBrunaud, Veronique1 aMuñoz-Bertomeu, Jesús1 aSerrano, Ramón0 tPlanta.g2015 July, v. 242, no. 1 p.39-52dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0032-09357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-015-2285-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01406naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245012800156300002000284520030500304592002800609650002300637650002300660650001300683650001300696650003500709700001600744700001600760700001200776700001800788700001800806700001400824773013500838856007400973852000901047655001201056IND60660947620221119115421.0190827e20150604xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066094762DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cc02039e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Xiaoli10aDetection of microRNA SNPs with ultrahigh specificity by using reduced graphene oxide-assisted rolling circle amplification  ap. 10002-10005.  aHere we report a reduced graphene oxide-assisted rolling circle amplification for the detection of miRNA SNPs.

A commercially available digital egg monitor (Buddy, Vetronic Services, Devon, UK) uses noninvasive methodology to monitor the heart rate of an embryo by measuring the amount of infrared light absorbed by embryonic blood. Thirty specific pathogen-free (SPF) chicken eggs (29 fertile) were incubated at 37.8 ±± 0.1°°C and the heart rate of each embryo was measured. Heart rates were first detectable in 13 eggs at day 6 of incubation. At day 7, an average heart rate of 170 ±± 20 beats/min was detected in all 29 fertile eggs, which is comparable to reported values. Ten additional SPF chicken eggs were evaluated at day 13 of incubation to test the effects of ambient temperature changes on embryonic heart rate. Embryonic heart rates dropped from 262 to 106 beats/min in eggs kept at room temperature (25°°C) for 90 minutes and to <60 beats/min after 70 minutes at 5°°C. Heart rates increased to 215 beats/min after 75 minutes at the original incubator temperature. Thirty (26 fertile) incubated turkey eggs were also evaluated with the digital egg monitor. Heart rates in 10 embryos were first detected at day 9 of incubation. At day 12, embryos had an average heart rate of 234 ±± 10 beats/min. The digital egg monitor was also used to measure the heart rate of peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) and Northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) embryos.  aPublisher supplied data 0aembryo 0aheart rate 0adigital egg monitor 0aartificial incubation 0aavian 0achicken 0aturkey 0abirds of prey 0aperegrine falcon 0aFalco peregrinus 0aNorthern goshawk 0aAccipiter gentilis1 aGooss, Olivia1 aHafez, Hafez M.0 tJournal of avian medicine and surgery.g2006 Sept., v. 20, no. 3 p.141-146dAssociation of Avian Veterinariansx1082-67427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1647%2F2005-017R.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02533naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001400155245013100169300001600300520132800316592002801644650001301672650003301685650001101718650001601729650001201745650001301757650002101770650001501791653001201806653001101818653002901829653002101858700001401879700001701893700001801910700002001928773007701948856008902025852000902114655001202123IND60545393520221119170244.0160901e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054539352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2014.08.0592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Ziyin10aSustainable operation of submerged Anammox membrane bioreactor with recycling biogas sparging for alleviating membrane fouling  ap. 106-113.  aA submerged anaerobic ammonium oxidizing (Anammox) membrane bioreactor with recycling biogas sparging for alleviating membrane fouling has been successfully operated for 100d. Based on the batch tests, a recycling biogas sparging rate at 0.2m3h−1 was fixed as an ultimate value for the sustainable operation. The mixed liquor volatile suspended solid (VSS) of the inoculum for the long operation was around 3000mgL−1. With recycling biogas sparging rate increasing stepwise from 0 to 0.2m3h−1, the reactor reached an influent total nitrogen (TN) up to 1.7gL−1, a stable TN removal efficiency of 83% and a maximum specific Anammox activity (SAA) of 0.56kg TNkg−1 VSSd−1. With recycling biogas sparging rate at 0.2 m3 h−1 (corresponding to an aeration intensity of 118m3m−2h−1), the membrane operation circle could prolong by around 20 times compared to that without gas sparging. Furthermore, mechanism of membrane fouling was proposed. And with recycling biogas sparging, the VSS and EPS content increasing rate in cake layer were far less than the ones without biogas sparging. The TN removal performance and sustainable membrane operation of this system showed the appealing potential of the submerged Anammox MBR with recycling biogas sparging in treating high-strength nitrogen-containing wastewaters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaeration 3aanaerobic ammonium oxidation 3abiogas 3abioreactors 3afouling 3ainoculum 3anitrogen content 3awastewater 0aAnammox 0aSAnMBR 0aRecycling biogas sparing 0aMembrane fouling1 aXu, Xindi1 aXu, Xiaochen1 aYang, FengLin1 aZhang, Shushen,0 tChemosphere.g2015 Dec., v. 140 p.106-113dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2014.08.0593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01624naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245010800161300002000269520041700289592002800706650001100734650002300745650002200768650001100790650004400801650001400845650002000859650001800879700001700897700001500914700002000929700002400949700002300973700002300996773013601019856007401155852000901229655001201238IND60661051120221118162315.0190827e20150728xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066105112DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cc05048k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarkar, Rajarshi10aMulticomponent reassembly of terpyridine-based materials: quantitative metallomacrocyclic rearrangement  ap. 12851-12854.  aMixing of metallocyclic trimers and tetramers in an exact 1 : 1.5 stoichiometry provided new supramolecular triangles in quantitative yields.

The few currently available drug treatments are dated and face problems with toxicity and resistance. For these reasons, there is an urgent need for the development of new chemotherapies for the treatment of sleeping sickness. In this study, we investigated the trypanocidal activity of bitter melon extract. Recently, it has been shown that bitter melon extracts display cytotoxic activity towards different cancer cell lines. However, agents exhibiting anti-tumour activity are usually also inhibiting the growth of T. brucei. Treatment of bloodstream forms of T. brucei with extracts prepared from Chinese and Indian bitter melon varieties resulted in a decrease in cell proliferation. In contrast, human myeloid leukaemia HL-60 cells were 3–6 times less sensitive to the extracts than trypanosomes. Initial fractionation of bitter melon extracts indicated that the trypanocidal activity of the extract is associated with at least two different classes of substances: one class of larger molecular weight compounds (>3kDa) causing rapid lysis of trypanosomes and one class of smaller molecular weight compounds (<3kDa) inducing accumulation of the parasites in the G₂-M phase of the cell cycle. Together, the results suggest that bitter melon is a promising source for trypanocidal agents which could be used as lead compounds for the development of novel anti-sleeping sickness drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMomordica charantia 3aTrypanosoma brucei 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3abloodstream forms 3acell cycle 3acell proliferation 3acytotoxicity 3adrugs 3afractionation 3ahumans 3aleukemia 3amolecular weight 3aparasites 3aparasitology 3atrypanosomiasis 3aSub-Saharan Africa1 aSexton, Darren W.1 aSteverding, Dietmar0 tExperimental parasitology.g2013 Mar., v. 133, no. 3 p.353-356dElsevier Inc.x0014-48947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2012.12.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02549naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100007000150245011000220300001400330520128200344592002801626650002001654650001601674650001101690650002001701650002201721650001501743650001701758650002001775651001001795653002101805653001701826653003301843653002901876653001601905653001001921700001901931773009501950856008502045852000902130655001202139IND60584221220221120173716.0181015e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058422122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2017.09.0692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKariuki, Boniface Wainaina1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5759-195410aInterannual and spatial variability of solar radiation energy potential in Kenya using Meteosat satellite  ap. 88-96.  aKenya is faced with a rising demand in electricity resulting from a rapidly growing economy and an increasing population. Being a tropical country, lying astride the equator, solar energy is one of the readily available renewable energy resource options to meet this need. Unfortunately, there is still very low adoption of solar systems in the country which could be majorly attributed to lack of adequate solar resource assessment. Besides, past studies on this area in Kenya only focused on the available amount of solar resource leaving out the issue of variability. To bridge this gap, the temporal and spatial variability of global horizontal irradiance (GHI) and direct normal Irradiance (DNI) is analyzed using 19-year long (1995–2013) Meteosat satellite dataset. GHI interannual variability is low in most parts of the country but DNI has a clearly higher variability except a few locations in the East and Northern desert. Low spatial variability for GHI was recorded for locations within 1225 km² while DNI variability was double that of GHI. The results offer readers a quick reference of variability of solar resource at different locations in Kenya which is useful in guiding measurement requirements and consequently in promoting deployment of solar systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3alight intensity 3apopulation growth 3asatellites 3asolar energy 3asolar radiation 3aKenya 0aRenewable energy 0aSolar energy 0aGlobal horizontal irradiance 0aDirect normal irradiance 0aVariability 0aKenya1 aSato, Tomonori0 tRenewable energy.g2018 Feb., v. 116 p.88-96dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2017.09.0693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02064naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100005700138245004800195300001600243500002000259520112400279592002801403650001501431650001101446650001101457650001901468651001401487651001701501700001801518773013301536856007201669852000901741655001201750IND60647173520221118060838.0190617e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064717352DNAL7 a10.1002/rra.34482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThoms, Martin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8074-047610aLarge rivers as complex adaptive ecosystems  ap. 451-458.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aLarge rivers dominate the world's terrestrial surface, yet we are still learning of their structure, how they function, and whether they are different not only from each other, but also from smaller rivers. There is a benefit in framing large rivers as complex adaptive systems, as they contain essential features of these entities, the emergent properties of which are nonlinear and often display unpredictable behaviour in space and time, contagion, and modularity. Large rivers are also social–ecological systems with a high degree of coupling between natural and human components. The manuscripts in this special issue highlight these fundamental properties for large river ecosystems from different geographic regions of the world. This special issue is dedicated to three former editorial board members of River Research and Applications. The loss of Professors Bryan Davies (University of Cape Town, South Africa), Jay O'Keefe (Rhodes University, South Africa), and Keith Walker (University of Adelaide, Australia) leaves a great gap and a rich memory bank in river science—especially large river ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystems 3ahumans 3arivers 3aspace and time 3aAustralia 3aSouth Africa1 aSheldon, Fran0 tRiver research and applications.g2019 June, v. 35, no. 5 p.451-458dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938474x1535-14597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.34483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03070naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245011100172300001600283520175100299592002802050650002302078650001402101650001902115650001102134650001402145650001302159650001802172650002002190650001202210651001202222653002302234653001202257653002302269653002402292700001902316700002002335700001802355700001402373700002002387700002302407773008902430856008402519852000902603655001202612IND60734119920221117084120.0211030e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073411992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymeth.2021.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarrison, Glenn W.10aEliciting Beliefs about COVID-19 Prevalence and Mortality: Epidemiological Models Compared with The Street  ap. 103-112.  aSubjective belief elicitation about uncertain events has a long lineage in the economics and statistics literatures. Recent developments in the experimental elicitation and statistical estimation of subjective belief distributions allow inferences about whether these beliefs are biased relative to expert opinion, and the confidence with which they are held. Beliefs about COVID-19 prevalence and mortality interact with risk management efforts, so it is important to understand relationships between these beliefs and publicly disseminated statistics, particularly those based on evolving epidemiological models. The pandemic provides a unique setting over which to bracket the range of possible COVID-19 prevalence and mortality outcomes given the proliferation of estimates from epidemiological models. We rely on the epidemiological model produced by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation together with the set of epidemiological models summarised by FiveThirtyEight to bound prevalence and mortality outcomes for one-month, and December 1, 2020 time horizons. We develop a new method to partition these bounds into intervals, and ask subjects to place bets on these intervals, thereby revealing their beliefs. The intervals are constructed such that if beliefs are consistent with epidemiological models, subjects are best off betting the same amount on every interval. We use an incentivised experiment to elicit beliefs about COVID-19 prevalence and mortality from 598 students at Georgia State University, using six temporally-spaced waves between May and November 2020. We find that beliefs differ markedly from epidemiological models, which has implications for public health communication about the risks posed by the virus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aeconomics 3aexpert opinion 3amodels 3amortality 3apandemic 3apublic health 3arisk management 3aviruses 3aGeorgia 0aSubjective beliefs 0aBeliefs 0aCOVID-19 mortality 0aCOVID-19 prevalence1 aHofmeyr, Andre1 aKincaid, Harold1 aMonroe, Brian1 aRoss, Don1 aSchneider, Mark1 aSwarthout, J.

In this study, we compare the greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation value over a 30-year time frame for a range of forest recovery and biofuel production scenarios on abandoned agricultural land. Carbon sequestration in recovering forests is estimated based on a statistical analysis of tropical and temperate studies on marginal land. GHGs offset by biofuel production are analyzed for five different production pathways. We find that forest recovery is superior to low-yielding biofuel production scenarios such as oil palm and corn. Biofuel production scenarios with high yields, such as sugarcane or high-yielding energy grasses, can be comparable or superior to natural forest succession and to reforestation in some cases. This result stands in contrast to previous research suggesting that restoring degraded ecosystems to their native state is generally superior to agricultural production in terms of GHG mitigation. Further work is needed on carbon stock changes in forests, soil carbon dynamics, and bioenergy crop production on degraded/abandoned agricultural land. This finding also emphasizes the need to consider the full range of social, economic, and ecological consequences of land-use policies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElaeis guineensis 3aagricultural land 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3acarbon sinks 3aclimate change 3acorn 3acrop production 3aecosystems 3aenergy 3aenergy crops 3aenvironmental impact 3aforest succession 3aforests 3afuel production 3agrasses 3agreenhouse gases 3areforestation 3astatistical analysis 3asugarcane1 aRamage, Benjamin

For this synthesis, all of published pollen data were screened and 30 pollen sequences passed our data quality screening. This synthesis-displayed spatial patterns of regionally-averaged standardized moisture indices (RA-SMI) and the comparisons of the patterns with the relevant data from the neighboring areas show that Holocene RA-SMI variations in the areas (i.e., western TP and southern TP) that have been dictated by the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) in the Arabian Sea were characterized by a wet early Holocene and a dry late Holocene. And, the Holocene SST in the Arabian Sea was controlled by the position of Intertropical Convergence Zone. The Holocene RA-SMI variations in the areas (i.e., southeastern TP and northeastern TP) that have been dictated by the SST in the Western Pacific warm pool were featured as a “bow-shaped” pattern. That is, the early Holocene and the late Holocene were dry with the mid-Holocene being the wettest. The “bow-shaped” pattern is in parallel with the SST in the Western Pacific warm pool. It implies that water-vapor availability associated with the SST has been of a great significance in providing precipitable water vapors to the Tibetan Plateau and the neighboring monsoon-dominated areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolocene epoch 3aclimate 3adata quality 3apaleobotany 3apalynology 3apollen 3asurface water temperature 3awater vapor 3aArabian Sea 3aChina 0aHolocene 0aMoisture variations 0aPollen record 0aTibetan Plateau1 aFeng, Zhaodong0 tReview of palaeobotany and palynology.g2022 Feb., v. 297 p.104581-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11736x0034-66677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.revpalbo.2021.1045813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01248naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245012900157300002000286500001900306520025300325592002800578650001600606650001500622650001700637700001500654700001300669700001300682700002000695773013600715856007400851852000900925655001200934IND60708586620221122065856.0200828e20200827xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070858662DNAL7 a10.1039/d0cc03745a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yingxu12aA self-powered aptasensor using the capacitor-amplified signal of a photofuel cell and a portable digital multimeter readout  ap. 10034-10037.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA self-powered aptasensor for streptomycin detection was constructed with a photofuel cell combined with a capacitor and a digital multimeter.

Interestingly, ciliary conditional mutant mice have a hypoplastic cerebellum in which the proliferation of cerebellar granule cell progenitors (GCPs) in response to Sonic hedgehog (SHH) is severely reduced. This suggests that Shh signaling defects could contribute to the vermis hypoplasia observed in the human syndromes. As existing JS/MKS mutant mouse models suggest apparently contradictory hypotheses on JS/MKS etiology, we investigated Shh signaling directly on human fetal samples. First, in an examination of human cerebellar development, we linked the rates of GCP proliferation to the different levels and localizations of active Shh signaling and showed that the GCP possessed a primary cilium with CEP290 at its base. Second, we found that the proliferation of GCPs and their response to SHH were severely impaired in the cerebellum of subjects with JS/MKS and Jeune syndrome. Finally, we showed that the defect in GCP proliferation was similar in the cerebellar vermis and hemispheres in all patients with ciliopathy analyzed, suggesting that the specific cause of vermal hypo-/aplasia precedes this defect. Our results, obtained from the analysis of human samples, show that the hemispheres and the vermis are affected in JS/MKS and provide evidence of a defective cellular mechanism in these pathologic processes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabnormal development 3aanimal models 3acerebellum 3aetiology 3ahumans 3amice 3amutants 3apathogenesis 3apatients 0acilia 0agranular neuron 0ahindbrain 0adevelopmental pathology1 aMeunier, Alice1 aStrehl, Laetitia1 aMartinovic, Jelena1 aBonniere, Maryse1 aAttie-Bitach, Tania1 aEncha-Razavi, Féréchté1 aSpassky, Nathalie0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 Oct. 16, v. 109, no. 42 p.16951-16956dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12014081093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03087naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002100180245015800201300001800359506007600377520154000453592002801993506003702021650002002058650002302078650001202101650001302113650002902126650001402155650001402169650001902183650001202202651001502214700002202229700002502251700002502276700002102301700002202322700001702344700002102361700001502382773012402397856007502521852000902596655001202605IND60536260220221207095854.0160806e20150203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053626022DNAL7 a10.1021/es505156q2doi7 aPMC43196852pmcid7 a255265192pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShaul, Nellie
J.10aNontargeted Biomonitoring of Halogenated Organic Compounds in Two Ecotypes of Bottlenose Dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) from the Southern California Bight  ap. 1328-1338.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTargeted environmental monitoring reveals contamination by known chemicals, but may exclude potentially pervasive but unknown compounds. Marine mammals are sentinels of persistent and bioaccumulative contaminants due to their longevity and high trophic position. Using nontargeted analysis, we constructed a mass spectral library of 327 persistent and bioaccumulative compounds identified in blubber from two ecotypes of common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) sampled in the Southern California Bight. This library of halogenated organic compounds (HOCs) consisted of 180 anthropogenic contaminants, 41 natural products, 4 with mixed sources, 8 with unknown sources, and 94 with partial structural characterization and unknown sources. The abundance of compounds whose structures could not be fully elucidated highlights the prevalence of undiscovered HOCs accumulating in marine food webs. Eighty-six percent of the identified compounds are not currently monitored, including 133 known anthropogenic chemicals. Compounds related to dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) were the most abundant. Natural products were, in some cases, detected at abundances similar to anthropogenic compounds. The profile of naturally occurring HOCs differed between ecotypes, suggesting more abundant offshore sources of these compounds. This nontargeted analytical framework provided a comprehensive list of HOCs that may be characteristic of the region, and its application within monitoring surveys may suggest new chemicals for evaluation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDDT (pesticide) 3aTursiops truncatus 3ablubber 3aecotypes 3aenvironmental monitoring 3afood webs 3alongevity 3amarine mammals 3asurveys 3aCalifornia1 aDodder, Nathan G.1 aAluwihare, Lihini I.1 aMackintosh, Susan

As for that, a particle wear model is proposed in this work, which connects the shear impact energy with the surface's removed volume. Experiments and simulation results in a laboratory-scale planetary ball mill verify that the particle wear model can predict the increasing trend of particle wear rate with mill speed, and has good accuracy at high mill speed. In the experiments, the grinding bowl is filled with liquid water to isolate the air and cool the grinding balls, and related modification is added to the contact model. Then, the influence of friction coefficient, fluid, and the mill speed on wear rate is explored. The results revealed the influence of friction coefficient on particle wear rate, and it is found that drag force and torque from fluid would reduce the particle wear. Also, the influence of the mill speeds the planetary ball mill is related to the rotation-revolution radius. Finally, we conducted a preliminary study on the wear of the grinding media during the ore grinding process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aenergy 3afriction 3amodels 3aprediction 3atorque 0aParticle wear 0aDEM 0aPlanetary ball mill 0aSimulation 0aGrinding media1 aZhao, Yongzhi0 tPowder technology.g2022 Jan., v. 398 p.117057-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2021.1170573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01838naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245014400171300001600315520063300331592002800964650002600992650003001018650000801048650002601056650001101082650003301093650001801126650005201144700002001196700001801216700002101234700002301255773010801278856008101386852000901467655001201476IND60575012120221118062504.0170728e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057501212DNAL7 a10.1007/s10327-017-0719-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMochizuki, Tomofumi10aRapid and low-cost diagnosis of Japanese yam mosaic virus infection in Chinese yam (Dioscorea polystachya) leaves by a print-capture RT-PCR  ap. 189-196.  aA rapid diagnostic method for Japanese yam mosaic virus (JYMV) infection in Chinese yam (Dioscorea polystachya) by a print-capture RT-PCR was developed. The cut surface of a rolled leaf of a JYMV-infected Chinese yam was stamped onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The clipped membrane was boiled in eluting solution to elute the RNA for use as the template in RT-nested PCR. Although JYMV RNA was detectable in most infected plants in the first PCR of the print-capture RT-PCR, it was detected from all samples in the nested PCR.

In this context, several costs in the installation process have been defined: installation of the offshore wind generators, installation of the floating offshore wind substructures, installation of the anchoring and mooring, installation of the electric systems and the commissioning or start up of the floating offshore wind farm. Furthermore, several installation scenarios have been taken into consideration regarding the shipyard surface and draught, the number of lifts, the transport, the mooring strategy and the substation configuration. The method, tested for the region of Galicia and for three sorts of floating substructures: spar, semisubmersible and tensioned leg, allows to compare different alternatives of installing a floating offshore and the most important aspects of the costs proposed. It can be useful for investors who decide to use this type of offshore renewable energy in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3arenewable energy sources 3awind farms 3awind turbines 0aFloating offshore wind farm 0aInstallation cost 0aTransport 0aOcean renewable energy1 aFilgueira-Vizoso, Almudena1 aLamas-Galdo, Isabel1 aCarral-Couce, Luis0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 Jan. 01, v. 170 p.1124-1135dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.09.2193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02535naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245010500171300001600276520132400292592002801616650001201644650001201656650002501668650001001693650000901703650001601712650002501728650001201753650001401765650001701779650001401796650001801810650001601828651002201844700001901866700001401885700002101899773009901920856008502019852000902104655001202113IND60080870720221119125203.0140812e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008087072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.exppara.2012.11.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Rongchang10aEimeria tiliquae n. sp.

Sporulated oocysts (n=50) are spherical to subspherical, with colourless trilaminate oocyst wall, 0.7±0.1 (0.5–0.75) thick. Oocyst with 4 spheroidal to subspheroidal sporocysts. Oocyst length, 13.7±0.9 (12.0–16.3); oocyst width, 12.8±0.9 (11.5–15.0); oocyst length/width (L/W) ratio, 1.07±0.05 (1.0–1.2). Micropyle, oocyst residuum and polar granule absent. Sporocysts with globular sporocyst residuum and 2 sporozoites. Sporocyst length, 6.0±0.6 (5.0–7.5); sporocyst width, 5.4±0.6 (4.0–7.0); sporocyst L/W ratio, 1.11±0.11 (1.0–1.5). Stieda, parastieda and substieda bodies absent. Phylogenetic analysis of 18S rRNA sequences indicated that E. tiliquae n. sp. shared 96.4–96.5% genetic similarity to E. tropidura, its closest relative. Reptile-derived sequences were not available for the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase gene (COI) and phylogenetic analysis at this locus placed E. tiliquae n. sp. in a clade by itself but grouping closest (92% similarity) with a novel isolate from a King’s skink (Egernia kingii) from Western Australia. Based on morphological and molecular data, this isolate is a new species of coccidian parasite that to date has only been found in shingleback skinks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEimeria 3aTiliqua 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3agenes 3aloci 3anew species 3anucleotide sequences 3aoocysts 3aparasites 3aparasitology 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3asporozoites 3aWestern Australia1 aBrice, Belinda1 aRyan, Una1 aBennett, Mark D.0 tExperimental parasitology.g2013 Feb., v. 133, no. 2 p.144-149dElsevier Inc.x0014-48947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2012.11.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01713naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245010300152300001800255520054400273592002800817650001700845650001400862650002300876650002300899650001300922650002100935650002200956650002400978650002501002650001101027700001701038700001501055700002001070700002001090773013401110856007401244852000901318655001201327IND60660945120221119115439.0190827e20150416xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066094512DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cc01981h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTao, Li10aPlasma-engineered MoS₂ thin-film as an efficient electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction  ap. 7470-7473.  aHerein, for the first time, we reported a general approach of plasma engineering to tune the surface properties and edge reactive sites for greatly improving HER (hydrogen evolution) activity of MoS₂.

Mago nashi (Mago) and Y14 are core EJC proteins that operate as a functional unit in animal cells, and the Mago-Y14 heterodimer interacts with other EJC core and peripheral proteins. Little is known about the biochemical and cellular characteristics of the EJC and its orthologs in plants. Here, we demonstrate that Arabidopsis Mago and Y14 form a ternary complex with PYM, an RNA-binding protein that was previously shown to interact with the Mago-Y14 heterodimer in Drosophila. Fluorescence microscopy indicated that Arabidopsis Mago and Y14 are localized primarily in the nucleus, whereas PYM is mostly cytoplasmic. In vitro pull-down assays using recombinant proteins showed that the amino-terminal region of the Arabidopsis PYM interacts with the Mago-Y14 heterodimer, a similar observation to that previously reported for the animal versions of these proteins. However, we demonstrated also that Arabidopsis PYM has the ability to interact with monomeric Mago and monomeric Y14. Immunoprecipitation and tandem affinity purification from whole cell extracts detected a subtle interaction between the Arabidopsis Mago-Y14 heterodimer and PYM in flowers, indicating that the ternary complex is not abundant in plant cells. The regions of the polypeptide responsible for nuclear import and export were defined using protein truncations and site-directed mutagenesis. This study identifies unique characteristics of Arabidopsis Mago, Y14 and PYM compared to those observed in animal cells. These are predicted to have important functional implications associated with post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in plant cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aDrosophila 3aRNA-binding proteins 3aanimals 3aassays 3acells 3aexons 3aextracts 3aflowers 3afluorescence microscopy 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3aphysiological transport 3apolypeptides 3aprecipitin tests 3arecombinant proteins 3asite-directed mutagenesis 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCell Nucleusxmetabolism 2aCytosolxmetabolism 2aDimerization 2aDrosophila Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGlutathione Transferasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aImmunoblotting 2aImmunoprecipitation 2aMicroscopy, Fluorescence 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNuclear Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aProtein Binding 2aRNA-Binding Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Alignment1 aMuench, Douglas G.0 tPlanta.g2007 Feb., v. 225, no. 3 p.625-639dSpringer-Verlagx0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-006-0385-y3Available from publisher's site  a20070204b20070303c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02758naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245008300171300001800254500001900272520129600291592002801587650001901615650001201634650002601646650001401672650001701686650002301703650001401726650001901740650002001759650001101779650001001790650001101800650002801811650003001839650001501869650001401884650001101898700002601909700002401935700006301959773017302022856008402195852000902279655001202288IND60708583720210617000000.0200828e20200812xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070858372DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jnatprod.0c006132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchultz, Chad R.10aAllicin, a Potent New Ornithine Decarboxylase Inhibitor in Neuroblastoma Cells  ap. 2518-2527.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe natural product allicin is a reactive sulfur species (RSS) from garlic (Allium sativum L.). Neuroblastoma (NB) is an early childhood cancer arising from the developing peripheral nervous system. Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is a rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of polyamines, which are oncometabolites that contribute to cell proliferation in NB and other c-MYC/MYCN-driven cancers. Both c-MYC and MYCN directly transactivate the E-box gene ODC1, a validated anticancer drug target. We identified allicin as a potent ODC inhibitor in a specific radioactive in vitro assay using purified human ODC. Allicin was ∼23 000-fold more potent (IC₅₀ = 11 nM) than DFMO (IC₅₀ = 252 μM), under identical in vitro assay conditions. ODC is a homodimer with 12 cysteines per monomer, and allicin reversibly S-thioallylates cysteines. In actively proliferating human NB cells allicin inhibited ODC enzyme activity, reduced cellular polyamine levels, inhibited cell proliferation (IC₅₀ 9–19 μM), and induced apoptosis. The natural product allicin is a new ODC inhibitor and could be developed for use in conjunction with other anticancer treatments, the latter perhaps at a lower than usual dosage, to achieve drug synergism with good prognosis and reduced adverse effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllium sativum 3aallicin 3aantineoplastic agents 3aapoptosis 3abiosynthesis 3acell proliferation 3achildhood 3adrug synergism 3aenzyme activity 3agarlic 3agenes 3ahumans 3aornithine decarboxylase 3aperipheral nervous system 3apolyamines 3aprognosis 3asulfur1 aGruhlke, Martin C.

Because (i) almost all known fungal sensor kinases exhibit a domain architecture characteristic of bacterial TCS phosphorelays, (ii) all known fungal Hpts are stand-alone proteins suited to shuttle between cytoplasm and nucleus, and (iii) the best-characterized fungal TCS is a canonical phosphorelay, it is widely assumed that most or all fungal TCSs function via phosphorelays. However, fungi generally encode more sensor kinases than Hpts or response regulators, leading to a disparity between putative phosphorelay inputs and outputs. The simplest resolution of this paradox is to hypothesize that most fungal sensor kinases do not participate in phosphorelays. Reimagining how fungal TCSs might function leads to multiple testable predictions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acytoplasm 3afungi 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3asignal transduction 0afungi 0ahybrid histidine kinase 0ahistidine-containing phosphotransfer protein 0aphosphorelay 0aresponse regulator 0atwo-component regulatory systems1 aKennedy, Emily N.1 aFoster, Clay A.1 aSepúlveda, Victoria E.1 aGoldman, William E.0 tTrends in microbiology.g2021 Oct., v. 29, no. 10 p.883-893dElsevier LtdwJournal:6327x0966-842X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tim.2021.03.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02781naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245013200166300001600298520141700314592002801731650001501759650002201774650001501796650001601811650001301827650001501840650002201855650001601877650001601893653003801909653004001947653003001987653003202017653002502049653002702074700002202101700002302123773011702146856008702263852000902350655001202359IND60644931820221120220102.0190923e20190901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064493182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2019.05.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Kui10aDegradation prediction of proton exchange membrane fuel cell based on grey neural network model and particle swarm optimization  ap. 810-818.  aThe degradation prediction is an effective tool for the long-lasting operation of the proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC). In this paper, a novel grey neural network model (GNNM) method combined with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) and the moving window method is presented to forecast the degradation of PEMFC under different operating conditions. The proposed method considers the influence of load current, inlet temperature, inlet hydrogen pressure, and inlet relative humidity. The degradation prediction model of PEMFC is established by a grey neural network. The initial weight and threshold of established GNNM are optimized by the PSO. The optimized PSO-GNNM is iteratively trained based on the moving window method through several newly measured data. The influence of different moving window sizes on the degradation prediction of the PEMFC under the static load current is investigated. Then, a comparison between the proposed method and the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system method is discussed. Moreover, the influence of the load current on the degradation prediction of PEMFCs in postal fuel cell electric vehicle operating under real conditions is analyzed. Finally, the proposed method is validated using 3 PEMFC aging experiments under different conditions. The results show that the proposed method can precisely forecast the degradation for PEMFC on different applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aelectric vehicles 3afuel cells 3afuzzy logic 3ahydrogen 3aprediction 3arelative humidity 3astatic load 3atemperature 0aPostal fuel cell electric vehicle 0aProton exchange membrane fuel cells 0aGrey neural network model 0aParticle swarm optimization 0aMoving window method 0aDegradation prediction1 aLaghrouche, Salah1 aDjerdir, Abdesslem0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2019 Sept. 01, v. 195 p.810-818dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2019.05.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02816naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245012800169520144300297592002801740650001201768650001301780650003301793650002001826650002201846650001301868650001901881650001401900650001501914650002501929653001901954653001401973653002401987653003102011700002002042700002102062700001602083700001402099700001502113700002602128773011902154856008802273852000902361655001202370IND60750191320221120121218.0211123e20220120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075019132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1502122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXi, Haipeng10aHeterotrophic nitrification and aerobic denitrification process: Promising but a long way to go in the wastewater treatment  aThe traditional biological nitrogen removal (BNR) follows the conventional scheme of sequential nitrification and denitrification. In recent years, novel processes such as anaerobic ammonia oxidation (anammox), complete oxidation of ammonia to nitrate in one organism (comammox), heterotrophic nitrification and aerobic denitrification (HN-AD), and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) are gaining tremendous attention after the discovery of metabolically versatile bacteria. Among them, HN-AD offers several advantages because individual bacteria could achieve one-stage nitrogen removal under aerobic conditions in the presence of organic carbon. In this review, besides classical BNR processes, we summarized the existing literature on HN-AD bacteria which have been isolated from diverse habitats. A particular focus was given on the diversity and physiology of HN-AD bacteria, influences of physiological and biochemical factors on their growth, nitrogen removal performances, as well as limitations and strategies in unraveling HN-AD metabolic pathways. We also presented case studies of HN-AD application in wastewater treatment facilities, pointed out forthcoming challenges of HN-AD in these systems, and presented modulation strategies for HN-AD application in engineering. This review may help improve the existing design of wastewater treatment plants by harnessing HN-AD bacteria for effective nitrogen removal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3aammonium 3aanaerobic ammonium oxidation 3adenitrification 3anitrate reduction 3anitrogen 3aorganic carbon 3aoxidation 3aphysiology 3awastewater treatment 0aHN-AD bacteria 0aDiversity 0aInfluencing factors 0aNitrogen metabolic pathway1 aZhou, Xiangtong1 aArslan, Muhammad1 aLuo, Zhijun1 aWei, Jing1 aWu, Zhiren1 aGamal El-Din, Mohamed0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Jan. 20, v. 805 p.150212-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1502123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03044naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011700170300001800287520165800305592002801963650002201991650002602013650001602039650003602055650001702091650002302108650001202131650000902143653003602152653003302188653003602221653002102257653002202278653003002300700001802330700001702348700002102365700001402386773011502400856008602515852000902601655001202610IND60584218920221120212605.0200614e20180101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058421892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.09.2302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiao, Pin-Chao10aDoes corporate social performance pay back quickly? A longitudinal content analysis on international contractors  ap. 1328-1337.  aCorporations in all parts of the world have begun to develop an increasing awareness of the importance of corporate social responsibility (CSR). Most CSR research suggested that corporations which effectively address social responsibilities are more competitive. Despite this benefit, many corporations in the construction industry still neglect engaging in CSR practices. In addition, past empirical research on the association between corporate social performance (CSP) and corporate financial performance (CFP) produced inconsistent results. In response to these academic and practical gaps, this study seeks to clarify the short-term relationship between CSP and CFP, so as to address the popular concern as to whether CSR activities will yield immediate results. To elucidate the nature of this relationship, this study leverages a modified content analysis method to review CSR reports of corporations in the top international contractors list of Engineering News-Record. In particular, a semantic labeling program is applied in content analysis to measure CSP quantitatively. The semantic longitudinal data from 2009 to 2014 reveals a negative association between CSP and CFP within the six years in construction industry. This study provides practitioners with a new basis for evaluating their short-term business plans related to CSR and assists international contractors in determining whether investment in CSR-focused strategies is financially viable. Findings indicate that international contractors should prioritize the CSR issues which they intend to focus on, so as to minimize their financial risks and maximize future CSR performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness planning 3aconstruction industry 3acontractors 3acorporate social responsibility 3acorporations 3aempirical research 3afinance 3arisk 0aCorporate social responsibility 0aCorporate social performance 0aCorporate financial performance 0aContent analysis 0aSemantic labeling 0aInternational contractors1 aShih, Yu-Nien1 aWu, Chun-Lin1 aZhang, Xiao-Ling1 aWang, Yue0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 Jan. 01, v. 170 p.1328-1337dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.09.2303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02282naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002700140245007900167300001600246520130500262592002801567653001501595653001401610653001401624653001401638653001001652700002101662700001501683700001601698700002501714773013201739856007601871852000901947655001201956IND60125185420221118193338.0151102e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012518542DNAL7 a10.1647/2004-004.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTorregrossa, Ann-Marie10aCirculating Concentrations of Vitamins A and E in Captive Psittacine Birds  ap. 225-229.  aInformation about physiologic concentrations of vitamins A and E in captive psittacine birds would be useful in the diagnosis of potential vitamin deficiencies or toxicoses. To help provide this information, a retrospective study was done to assess circulating concentrations of vitamins A and E in captive Psittaciformes at 6 facilities representing 12 genera and 33 species. Plasma or serum samples collected from psittacine birds were analyzed for concentrations of αα-tocopherol (n == 115) and retinol (n == 167). Mean retinol concentration (±± standard deviation) in all birds was 0.471 ±± 0.209 μμg/ml, and mean αα-tocopherol concentration was 13.05 ±± 6.60 μμg/ml. When compared by subfamily and genera, concentrations of both retinol and αα-tocopherol differed significantly among groups. Post hoc testing demonstrated that differences in concentrations of retinol and, at the subfamily level, of αα-tocopherol were attributable to low concentrations in Pesquet parrots (Psittrichas fulgidus). Differences at the genus level were mainly caused by high αα-tocopherol concentrations in hyacinth macaws (Andorhynchus hyacinthinus). These results demonstrate that circulating concentrations of vitamins A and E in psittacine birds depend significantly on subfamily and genera.  aPublisher supplied data 0apsittacine 0anutrition 0avitamin A 0avitamin E 0aavian1 aPuschner, Birgit1 aTell, Lisa1 aOlsen, John1 aDierenfeld, Ellen S.0 tJournal of avian medicine and surgery.g2005 Sept., v. 19, no. 3 p.225-229dAssociation of Avian Veterinariansx1082-67427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1647%2F2004-004.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02670naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245011700166300001600283520142500299592002801724650002201752650001401774650001001788650002101798650001101819650001201830650001301842650002101855650000901876650003001885650001801915651001401933700002101947700001501968700001401983700002201997700001402019700001302033700002502046773009602071856004802167852000902215655001202224IND4487711420221116220258.0120313e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448771142DNAL7 a10.1007/s11119-011-9236-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRobertson, M. J.10aAdoption of variable rate fertiliser application in the Australian grains industry: status, issues and prospects  ap. 181-199.  aVariable rate application of fertiliser (VR) is a practice underpinning a profitable grains industry in Australia. We updated the extent of VR adoption through a national survey (nÂ =Â 1Â 130) covering all grain growing regions. Three smaller regional-based surveys (nÂ =Â 39â102) collected detailed information on the nature and reasoning behind the use of various forms of the technology. We analysed the constraints to the adoption of each step using adoption theory. Surveys showed that 20% of grain growers have adopted some form of VR (varied from 11â35%), up significantly from <5% found 6Â years earlier. Adopters are more than likely to have larger farms with a higher area in cropping. Many non-adopters were convinced of the agronomic and economic benefits of VR. A significant proportion of growers were managing within-field variability with manually-operated systems rather than more sophisticated VR technology, and have adopted some form of VR without yield maps, preferring to use soil tests, electro-magnetic induction or their own knowledge of soil and yield variation to define management. The rate of adoption is expected to continue to rise based on greater awareness of the benefits of the technology. The constraints to adoption were technical issues with equipment and software access to service provision and the incompatibility of equipment with existing farm operations.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3aequipment 3afarms 3afertilizer rates 3agrains 3agrowers 3aindustry 3anational surveys 3asoil 3avariable rate application 3ayield mapping 3aAustralia1 aLlewellyn, R.

This territory occupies the Lena–Amga Rivers interfluve. In borehole 18/1, five sediment Complexes (I–V) of successive environments were recognized: 1) alluvial in the base of the borehole—Complex I; 2) alluvial-lake—Complex II; 3) lake-complex—Complex III; 4) ice-complex (yedoma)—Complex IV; and finally 5) a Holocene cover—Complex V. Quartz sand-grain and silt-grain microtextural analysis was undertaken in a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and supplemented by mineralogical analyses to reconstruct the sedimentary-accumulation environment, discern the influence of periglacial conditions on the grains, and identify the sediment source(s) for each complex. Based on the results, a conclusion can be reached that the accumulation of Complex I took place as a result of multiple repetitive transportation events recycling the same material and introducing a limited supply of new material into the fluvial environment. Upward in the succession, fluvial-process activities decreased in favour of lake-deposit accumulation. Frozen syngenetic ice-rich silty deposits—yedoma or ice complex—of Complex IV are composed of grains with a precipitated surface, but differ from the underlying deposits in the degree of crusting and mineralogy. Most probably aeolian processes are responsible for their transport. They include a variety of sediments, including older-sourced sediments such as retransported loess and the detritus from mechanical weathering coeval with sediment accumulation. Traces of frost and chemical weathering have been identified on the grain surfaces, the former visible in the form of breakage blocks and conchoidal fracture microtextures and the latter – as surface crusting. However, the frequencies of these microtextures are low, which suggests a relatively high rate of sediment accumulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolocene epoch 3aSiberia 3adetritus 3afrost 3aloess 3amicrostructure 3aquartz 3atransportation 0aQuartz-grain microtexture 0aIce complex 0ayedoma recycling 0aCentral Yakutia1 aWoronko, B.1 aSpektor, V.V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7791-09721 aKlimova, I.V.0 tMicron.g2021 July, v. 146 p.103067-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12416x0968-43287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micron.2021.1030673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01558naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245014500162300001800307520038100325592002800706650000800734650002300742650002300765650001700788650001300805650001400818650001100832650004400843650002900887650002000916700002200936700002200958773013300980856007401113852000901187655001201196IND60660945720221119115451.0190827e20150512xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066094572DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cc01995h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSakamoto, Takashi10aFluorine-modified bisbenzimide derivative as a molecular probe for bimodal and simultaneous detection of DNAs by ¹⁹F NMR and fluorescence  ap. 8749-8752.  a3,5-Bis(trifluoromethyl)benzene modified bisbenzimide H 33258 was synthesized as a ¹⁹F magnetic resonance-based DNA detection probe.

Demand response strategies can reduce the time-of-use costs and overall electrical energy consumption. We present a method to reduce the electrical energy usage itself. Our novel heating schedule control minimises the electric water heater's energy usage without compromising user convenience. We achieve optimal control, while taking into account the natural temperature stratification of the water in the tank, using the A* search algorithm. Since previous research assumes a one-node thermal model, we also assess the effect of excluding stratification. We match three optimal control strategies to a baseline: the standard “always on” thermostat control. The first two strategies respectively match the temperature and the energy of the hot water supplied by the water heater. The third, a variation on the second, includes a method of preventing the growth of Legionella bacteria. We tested 77 water heaters over four weeks, a week for each season, and all three strategies saved energy. The median savings were 6.3% for temperature-matching, 21.9% for energy-matching and 16.2% for energy-matching with Legionella prevention. Taking stratification into account increased these savings by 1.2%, 5.4% and 5.5% respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLegionella 3aalgorithms 3aelectric power 3aenergy 3aheat 3amodels 3asustainable development 3atemperature profiles 0aDomestic energy saving 0aElectric water heater 0aEnergy usage prediction 0aLegionella 0aOptimal control 0aScheduled control 0aWater heater temperature control1 aRitchie, M.J.1 aBooysen, M.J.0 tEnergy for sustainable development.g2021 June, v. 62 p.67-81dElsevier Inc.aInternational Energy InitiativewJournal:12424x0973-08267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.esd.2021.03.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03242naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002400155245012900179300001400308520142300322592002801745650002301773650002301796650002401819650001301843650002701856650004401883650001501927650001201942650002301954650002601977650000702003650001402010650001902024650004302043650001102086653003402097653002102131653001102152653002402163653000902187653000902196653000702205653000902212653000902221653000802230653000802238653000802246653000802254653000902262653000902271653000802280653000702288653000802295653000702303653000802310700001402318700001902332700001502351700001702366773007502383856008902458852000902547655001202556IND60545391720221119170156.0160901e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054539172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2014.07.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaspolim, Yogananda10aComparison of single-stage and two-phase anaerobic sludge digestion systems – Performance and microbial community dynamics  ap. 54-62.  aThis study compared reactor performance and the respective microbial community dynamics in the conventional single-stage and 2-phase anaerobic digestion (AD) systems, treating municipal sludge to generate methane. The 2-phase system’s COD and VS reduction, and methane production could be maintained throughout the three HRTs tested (p=0.05), which was associated with an increase in organic loading (30d=1.5gCODL−1d−1, 20d=2.2gCODL−1d−1 and 10d=3.5gCODL−1d−1); but this was not so in the single-stage system where it deteriorated at HRT of 10d (p=0.05) due to impairment of particulate COD reduction. qPCR, DGGE and the subsequent phylogenetic analysis revealed that microbial adaptation occurred as the seed sludge formed a different community in each reactor at 30d HRT; however, no further significant microbial shift occurred at lower HRTs. The presence of specific hydrolytic and acidogenic Flavobacteriales and Clostriales in the acidogenic reactor may have allowed for enhanced hydrolysis and acidogenesis, leading to higher organic loading tolerance at 10d HRT. Methanogenic activity in the acidogenic reactor may have been performed by Methanobacteriales and Methanosarcinaceae. Operation of the acidogenic reactor at neutral pH may have to be considered to ensure the cultivation of propionate oxidising bacteria, which could in turn, prevent reactor “souring” during high load conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMethanobacteriales 3aMethanosarcinaceae 3aanaerobic digestion 3abacteria 3achemical oxygen demand 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3ahydrolysis 3amethane 3amethane production 3amicrobial communities 3apH 3aphylogeny 3apropionic acid 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asludge 0aTwo-phase anaerobic digestion 0aMunicipal sludge 0aBiogas 0aMicrobial community 0aDGGE 0aqPCR 0aAD 0aCSTR 0aDGGE 0aDNA 0aHRT 0aOLR 0aPCR 0aqPCR 0arRNA 0aSRT 0aTS 0aVFA 0aVS 0aVSS1 aZhou, Yan1 aGuo, Chenghong1 aXiao, Keke1 aNg, Wun Jern0 tChemosphere.g2015 Dec., v. 140 p.54-62dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2014.07.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02503naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245011500173300001600288520137000304592002801674650001201702650001901714650001801733650002301751650001701774650001801791650001201809650001201821650001901833650001301852650001901865650001501884700001901899700001801918773008601936856008602022852000902108655001202117IND60084830720221119140414.0141101e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008483072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2010.07.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGustavsson, Leif10aCosts and CO₂ benefits of recovering, refining and transporting logging residues for fossil fuel replacement  ap. 192-197.  aThere are many possible systems for recovering, refining, and transporting logging residues for use as fuel. Here we analyse costs, primary energy and CO₂ benefits of various systems for using logging residues locally, nationally or internationally. The recovery systems we consider are a bundle system and a traditional chip system in a Nordic context. We also consider various transport modes and distances, refining the residues into pellets, and replacing different fossil fuels. Compressing of bundles entails costs, but the cost of chipping is greatly reduced if chipping is done on a large scale, providing an overall cost-effective system. The bundle system entails greater primary energy use, but its lower dry-matter losses mean that more biomass per hectare can be extracted from the harvest site. Thus, the potential replacement of fossil fuels per hectare of harvest area is greater with the bundle system than with the chip system. The fuel-cycle reduction of CO₂ emissions per harvest area when logging residues replace fossil fuels depends more on the type of fossil fuel replaced, the logging residues recovery system used and the refining of the residues, than on whether the residues are transported to local, national or international end-users. The mode and distance of the transport system has a minor impact on the CO₂ emission balance.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acarbon dioxide 3acost analysis 3acost effectiveness 3afossil fuels 3agas emissions 3alogging 3apellets 3aprimary energy 3arefining 3atransportation 3awood chips1 aEriksson, Lisa1 aSathre, Roger0 tApplied energy.g2011 Jan., v. 88, no. 1 p.192-197dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2010.07.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02766naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001700166245010300183300001800286520140400304592002801708650001401736650002801750650001501778650001401793650002401807650001401831650001601845650001601861650001301877650003701890650003001927650003001957650004001987650002902027650002302056700002302079773008402102852000902186856008102195930003302276946001102309655001202320IND60438830220221121132010.0151023e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043883022DNAL7 a171066862pmid7 a10.1007/s00425-006-0424-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMine, Ichiro10aFine structure of cell wall surfaces in the giant-cellular xanthophycean alga Vaucheria terrestris  ap. 1135-1146.  aThe mechanical strength of cell walls in the tip-growing cells of Vaucheria terrestris is weakened by treatment with proteolytic enzymes. To clarify the morphological characteristics of the components maintaining cell wall strength, the fine structures of the cell walls, with and without protease treatment, were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Observations indicated that cellulose microfibrils were arranged in random directions and overlapped each other. Most of the microfibrils observed in the inner surface of the cell wall were embedded in amorphous materials, whereas in the outer surface of the cell wall, microfibrils were partially covered by amorphous materials. The matrix components embedding and covering microfibrils were almost completely removed by protease treatment, revealing layers of naked microfibrils deposited deeply in the cell wall. Topographic data taken from AFM observations provided some additional information that could not be obtained by TEM, including more detailed images of the granular surface textures of the matrix components and the detection of microfibrils in the interior of the cell wall. In addition, quantitative AFM data of local surface heights enabled us to draw three-dimensional renderings and to quantitatively estimate the extent of the exposure of microfibrils by the enzymatic treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVaucheria 3aatomic force microscopy 3acell walls 3acellulose 3aenzymatic treatment 3amaterials 3aproteinases 3aproteolysis 3asurfaces 3atransmission electron microscopy 2aCell Wallxultrastructure 2aEukaryotaxultrastructure 2aImage Processing, Computer-Assisted 2aMicroscopy, Atomic Force 2aPeptide Hydrolases1 aShukaku Sesshidō,0 tPlanta.g2007 Apr., v. 225, no. 5 p.1135-1146dSpringer-Verlagx0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-006-0424-83Available from publisher's site  a20070318b20070402c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02202naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245017600162300001600338520091200354592002801266653003201294653002301326653001701349653001001366653003301376653002001409653002901429653002401458700002501482700001901507700001701526700001801543700002201561700001701583773013101600856007601731852000901807655001201816IND60125186120221118193354.0151102e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012518612DNAL7 a10.1647/2004-024.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMonks, Deborah J.10aAngiostrongylus cantonensis as a Cause of Cerebrospinal Disease in a Yellow-tailed Black Cockatoo (Calyptorhynchus funereus) and Two Tawny Frogmouths (Podargus strigoides)  ap. 289-293.  aA captive yellow-tailed black cockatoo (Calyptorhynchus funereus) and 2 free-living tawny frogmouths (Podargus strigoides), both native Australian species, were presented with neurologic signs including depression and pelvic limb paresis and paralysis. Despite supportive treatment, all 3 birds died or were euthanatized. On histologic examination, sections of metastrongyloid nematode larvae were found in the central nervous system of all 3 birds, whereas intact larvae, identified as Angiostrongylus cantonensis, were recovered from the brain and spinal cord of 2 birds. Angiostrongylus cantonensis, the rat lungworm, has an obligatory migratory phase through the host's central nervous system, which can cause severe pathologic lesions. Natural infections in accidental hosts have been documented only in mammals, and to our knowledge, angiostrongyliasis in avian hosts has not been previously reported.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAngiostrongylus cantonensis 0aangiostrongyliasis 0arat lungworm 0aavian 0ayellow-tailed black cockatoo 0atawny frogmouth 0aCalyptorhynchus funereus 0aPodargus strigoides1 aCarlisle, Melissa S.1 aCarrigan, Mark1 aRose, Karrie1 aSpratt, David1 aGallagher, Adrian1 aProciv, Paul0 tJournal of avian medicine and surgery.g2005 Dec., v. 19, no. 4 p.289-293dAssociation of Avian Veterinariansx1082-67427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1647%2F2004-024.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02567naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245015300164300001800317520130700335592002801642650001501670650001701685650001601702650001001718650001301728650001101741650003101752650001501783650001801798650001701816650001001833651001801843651001001861651001201871651001101883700001701894700002201911773012901933856007402062852000902136655001202145IND60708584520221121062538.0200828e20200827xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070858452DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ay00901f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnyidoho, Elliot K.10aNondestructive authentication of the regional and geographical origin of cocoa beans by using a handheld NIR spectrometer and multivariate algorithm  ap. 4150-4158.  aTraceability in the cocoa bean trade is vital to ensuring quality. In this study, a handheld near-infrared (NIR) spectrometer was attempted for rapid and nondestructive regional and geographical classification of cocoa beans from different locations. Cocoa bean samples collected from seven cocoa-producing regions in Ghana (Eastern, Ashanti, Volta, Western South, Western North, Central, and Brong Ahafo) and four cocoa-producing countries in Africa (Uganda, Ivory Coast, Nigeria, and Ghana) were used. Among the preprocessing techniques employed, multiplicative scatter correction (MSC) performed better. The correct classification rate for the seven cocoa-producing regions in Ghana was 100% for LDA and SVM models in the training set and testing set. For classification of cocoa beans based on the country of origin, LDA and SVM also gave 100% classification rate both in the training set and testing set. The results give strong indications that hand-held spectroscopy coupled with chemometrics could be employed to provide the quick, accurate, and nondestructive classification of cocoa beans according to different locations. This technique could improve the work of quality control inspectors both from industry and regulatory perspectives for effective and quick detection of cocoa bean fraud.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3achemometrics 3acocoa beans 3afraud 3aindustry 3amodels 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3aprovenance 3aspectrometers 3atraceability 3atrade 3aCote d'Ivoire 3aGhana 3aNigeria 3aUganda1 aTeye, Ernest1 aAgbemafle, Robert0 tAnalytical methods.g2020 Aug. 27, v. 12, no. 33 p.4150-4158dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ay00901f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02893naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245009000168300001800258520148200276592002801758650002201786650001201808650001801820650001301838650001201851650001901863650001101882650000701893650001801900650001301918650003301931650001001964650001801974650001601992650001302008650001502021653001302036653001902049653001302068653001802081653002302099700001902122700001502141700002102156773011502177856008602292852000902378655001202387IND60584219520221120045735.0200614e20180101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058421952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.09.2552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiang, Junyi10aExtraction of vanadium from converter slag by two-step sulfuric acid leaching process  ap. 1089-1101.  aBecause of its potential to achieve a high recovery rate of vanadium, the mechanical activation pretreatment of vanadium-bearing converter slag followed by calcification roasting at low temperature and a two-step leaching process may be a viable alternative to the present roasting and one-step leaching process for vanadium extraction. The object of this study is to enhance the leaching efficiency of vanadium by mechanical activation and two-step leaching methods. The effects of solution acidity, liquid/solid ratio, particle size of the roasted slag, stirring speed, leaching temperature and time were investigated. The first stage leaching liquor was recycled in order to improve vanadium content in the leaching solution and reduce leaching solution consumption and wastewater discharge. Experimental results showed that approximately 81.8% vanadium was dissolved in the first stage of the leaching process with a solution pH of 2.5, and approximately 8.1% vanadium was dissolved in the second stage of the leaching process with a solution pH of 0. In the first stage, the vanadium leaching efficiency was significantly hindered by long recycle times, though this property also increased the content of vanadium in the leaching solution and greatly decreased the water consumption. In addition, mineralography and microstructures of the solid samples were studied by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to help understand the mechanism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacidity 3acalcification 3aleaching 3aliquids 3amicrostructure 3amixing 3apH 3aparticle size 3aroasting 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aslags 3asulfuric acid 3atemperature 3avanadium 3awastewater 0aVanadium 0aConverter slag 0aLeaching 0aReutilization 0aCleaner production1 aHuang, Qingyun1 aLv, Xuewei1 aBai, Chen-Guang,0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 Jan. 01, v. 170 p.1089-1101dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.09.2553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01595naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245017000153300001800323520023900341592002800580650001400608650001100622650001800633650001400651650001400665650002100679650001100700650001700711650002400728650001700752700002000769700002500789700001700814700001800831700001800849700001500867700001700882700002000899700001400919773013300933856007401066852000901140655001201149IND60660945920221119115404.0190827e20150512xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066094592DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cc01999k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Bing10aEggplant-derived microporous carbon sheets: towards mass production of efficient bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts at low cost for rechargeable Zn–air batteries  ap. 8841-8844.  aWe report 2D microporous carbon sheets with high surface area, derived from eggplant via simple carbonization and KOH activation, as low cost yet efficient bifunctional catalysts for high performance rechargeable zinc–air batteries.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3acarbon 3acarbonization 3acatalysts 3aeggplants 3aelectrochemistry 3aoxygen 3aporous media 3apotassium hydroxide 3asurface area1 aGeng, Dongsheng1 aLee, Xinjing Shannon1 aGe, Xiaoming1 aChai, Jianwei1 aWang, Zhijuan1 aZhang, Jie1 aLiu, Zhaolin1 aHor, T.

The potential energy and Lindemann index during heating were calculated and the evolution of local crystal structure, during heating was characterized. The results showed that the size of Ti and Ta nanoparticles had a great significant impact on the melting point of Ti–5Ta (wt%) alloys. To further verify the suitability of the EAM potential function in determining Ti–Ta alloys mechanical properties, the elastic modulus of Ti–5Ta (wt%) alloys was determined both experimentally and by molecular dynamics simulation. The experimental measurements and simulation calculations were in good agreement with each other, demonstrating the accuracy of the EAM potential function. This work provides ideas and guidance for further improving the potential applications of Ti–Ta alloys.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystal structure 3aheat 3amodulus of elasticity 3amolecular dynamics 3apotential energy 0aMolecular dynamics(MD) 0aTitanium alloy 0aSintering 0aElastic constants 0aTi-Ta alloys1 aZhu, Xijing1 aLi, Xiangmeng1 aShi, Qiangshengjie0 tPowder technology.g2022 Jan., v. 398 p.117069-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2021.1170693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02240naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245011000169300001400279520096600293592002801259650001401287650002301301650001101324650001501335650001401350650000901364650001101373650001101384650001901395650000801414700002001422700001701442700001901459700001901478700001401497700001801511700001801529700001701547773011201564856008601676990002301762852000901785655001201794IND60113169320221119100549.0141111e20110515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011316932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jelechem.2011.02.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Su Jung10aNon-platinum oxygen reduction electrocatalysts based on carbon-supported metal–polythiophene composites  ap. 39-44.  aA series of carbon-supported metal–polythiophene composite (M–PTh/C) electrocatalysts are synthesized based on seven different non-Pt metals (M=Ir, Ru, Pd, Co, Fe, Ni, Sn) using chemical polymerization method. The electrocatalytic activity toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is characterized in acidic condition using rotating disk electrode voltammetry. Ir-, Ru-, and Pd-PTh/C show far more positive (ca. 700mV) ORR onset potentials than Co-, Fe-, Ni-, and Sn-PTh/C. Further studies on the ORR kinetics are carried out for the three superior catalysts, Ir-, Ru-, Pd-PTh/C, using Koutecky–Levich and Tafel plots. The number of electrons (n) transferred in the ORR is ∼4 for these three catalysts, suggesting 4-electron transfer ORR is dominant. Considering all the obtained factors (such as the onset potential, n value, and exchange current density), Ir- and Ru-PTh/C catalysts are concluded to have relatively excellent ORR catalytic activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acobalt 3aelectrodes 3aelectrons 3airon 3anickel 3aoxygen 3apolymerization 3atin1 aJung, Hyun Jung1 aShim, Jun Ho1 aKim, Hyun-Chul1 aSung, Shi-Joon1 aYoo, Bong1 aLee, Dong-ha,1 aLee, Chongmok1 aLee, Youngmi0 tJournal of electroanalytical chemistry.g2011 May 15, v. 655, no. 1 p.39-44dElsevier B.V.x1572-66577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jelechem.2011.02.0123Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02417naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245010000168500002200268520103100290592002801321650001201349650001101361650001901372650001101391650002601402650002001428650001801448650001501466650001401481650002101495650001901516653002701535653001701562653002001579653002401599700001501623700001601638700005101654700001301705700005201718773009301770856008701863852000901950655001201959IND60656183120221120154005.0190830e20190731xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065618312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2019.1219472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Jingwei10aPhoto-bioreactor design for microalgae: A review from the aspect of CO2 transfer and conversion  aPre-press version  aPhotobioreactor (PBR) is the most critical equipment for microalgal photosynthetic fixation of CO2. It provides suitable environmental conditions, such as CO2, light and nutrients, for microalgal growth. As the major carbon source for microalgae, CO2 gas is pumped into PBR with the formation of bubbles and formed gas-liquid flow. The gas-liquid flow affects CO2 and nutrients transmission as well as microalgae cells distribution in PBR, thereby affecting the biochemical reaction of microalgae. While the migration and transport of biochemical reaction products affect the two-phase flow, phase distribution and flow resistance in the PBR in return, thus affecting the transport of light and nutrients. Therefore, microalgal photosynthetic rate is determined synthetically by two-phase flow and the transport of CO2, light and nutrients in PBR. Deep understanding of gas-liquid two-phase flow, energy and mass transfer coupling with microalgal growth in PBR is the cornerstone for the design of an efficient microalgae PBR.  aPublisher supplied data 3abubbles 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aenergy 3aenvironmental factors 3aflow resistance 3amass transfer 3amicroalgae 3anutrients 3aphotobioreactors 3aphotosynthesis 0aPhotobioreactor design 0aCO2 transfer 0aGas-liquid flow 0aSynergy enhancement1 aHuang, Yun1 aLiao, Qiang1 aXia, Ao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0428-287X1 aFu, Qian1 aZhu, Xun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3923-59770 tBioresource technology.g2019 July 31, dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2019.1219473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02349naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002700138245012200165300001600287520122400303592002801527653001501555653002101570653000901591653001001600653001201610653001701622653002201639653002101661653002101682700002401703700002401727700002201751773013101773856007401904852000901978655001201987IND60125186420221118193226.0151102e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012518642DNAL7 a10.1647/2004-0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan Wettere, Arnaud J.10aAdenovirus Infection in Taita Falcons (Falco fasciinucha) and Hybrid Falcons (Falco rusticolus ×× Falco peregrinus)  ap. 280-285.  aThree taita falcon (Falco fasciinucha) nestlings and 3 cohoused hybrid falcon (F rusticolus ×× F peregrinus) nestlings died after showing lethargy and anorexia for 4––5 days. Major lesions in the falcons were necrotizing hepatitis, splenitis, and lymphoplasmacytic nephritis. One hybrid falcon also had a heterophilic nephritis. Intranuclear inclusion bodies were present in the hepatocytes of the taita falcons and in the renal tubular epithelial cells of 1 hybrid falcon. Adenoviral particles were found in the cloacal content of 2 taita falcons. DNA in situ hybridization revealed aviadenoviral nucleic acid within the nuclei of hepatocytes of a taita falcon and a hybrid falcon and in the tubular epithelial cells of a hybrid falcon. Aviadenoviral DNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction in the liver of taita falcons and hybrid falcons. The death of these birds was attributed to the aviadenovirus infection; however, the source of the virus was not determined. Predisposing factors for the outbreak of the viral infection in these falcons may have included transport stress, lack of quarantine measures, and cohousing of falcon species originating from isolated populations with other falcon species.  aPublisher supplied data 0aadenovirus 0ainclusion bodies 0abird 0aavian 0afalcons 0ataita falcon 0aFalco fasciinucha 0aFalco rusticolus 0aFalco peregrinus1 aWüünschmann, Arno1 aLatimer, Kenneth S.1 aRedig, Patrick T.0 tJournal of avian medicine and surgery.g2005 Dec., v. 19, no. 4 p.280-285dAssociation of Avian Veterinariansx1082-67427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1647%2F2004-0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03613naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011600166300001600282520191600298592002802214650001802242650003802260650003002298650001602328650001202344650001202356650001802368650000902386650002502395650002602420650002602446650001602472650002702488650001802515650000902533650001802542650001202560650003202572650001802604650002102622650002002643650002602663650002102689650001802710650001402728700001902742700001702761700001802778700002102796700001202817773011602829856008102945852000903026655001203035IND60575013320221118062618.0170728e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057501332DNAL7 a10.1007/s00343-017-6119-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Haifeng10aComparative study of the nutritional composition and toxic elements of farmed and wild Chanodichthys mongolicus  ap. 737-744.  aInformation of the difference in quality between farmed and wild fish is central to better ensuring fish products produced in aquaculture meet regulatory and consumer requirements. Proximate composition, amino acid and fatty acid profiles, and toxic elements contents of farmed and wild Chanodichthys mongolicus were established and compared. Significantly higher crude protein content while lower moisture content in farmed fish compared to wild fish were observed (P<0.05). The percentages of total amino acids (TAA), total essential amino acids (TEAA), total non-essential amino acids (TNEAA) and total delicious amino acids (TDAA) in farmed fish were all significantly higher than those in the wild equivalent (P<0.05). Compared to the FAO/WHO recommended reference values, the ratios of TEAA/TAA (39.84%–40.33%) were comparable to 40% and TEAA / TNEAA (66.22%–67.60%) were above 60%. Fatty acid profiles in both farmed and wild C. mongolicus were dominated by monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA), with farmed fish contained much more MUFA content compared to wild counterpart (P<0.05). Notably, wild fish exhibited significantly higher levels of total polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) than farmed fish (P<0.05). The EPA (C₂₀:₅ₙ₃) and linoleic acid (C₁₈:₂ₙ₆) were the predominant PUFA in wild and farmed C. mongolicus, respectively. Moreover, farmed fish displayed an overall lower toxic element levels (As, Cd, Pb and Hg) in comparison with wild fish, and both were far lower than the established limit standard. In conclusion, our results suggest that the nutritional quality of farmed C. mongolicus was inferior to their wild counterpart with respect to fatty acids nutrition, and therefore further studies should focus on the improving C. mongolicus diet in order to enhance the overall nutritional composition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChanodichthys 3aFood and Agriculture Organization 3aWorld Health Organization 3aaquaculture 3aarsenic 3acadmium 3acrude protein 3adiet 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3aessential amino acids 3afarmed fish 3afatty acid composition 3afish products 3alead 3alinoleic acid 3amercury 3amonounsaturated fatty acids 3anormal values 3anutrient content 3anutritive value 3aproximate composition 3atoxic substances 3awater content 3awild fish1 aCheng, Xiaofei1 aGeng, Longwu1 aTang, Shizhan1 aTong, Guangxiang1 aXu, Wei0 tChinese journal of oceanology and limnology.g2017 July, v. 35, no. 4 p.737-744dScience Pressx0254-40597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-017-6119-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02046naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245010600170300001600276520101900292592002801311650002401339650001201363650002201375650002601397650002001423650002101443650001701464650001701481651001101498700001801509773008601527856008601613852000901699655001201708IND60084831020221119140645.0141101e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008483102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2010.05.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Huifang13aAn estimation of the performance limits and improvement of dry cooling on trough solar thermal plants  ap. 216-223.  aA study is reported of the potential performance of dry cooling on power generation. This is done in the context of a generic trough solar thermal power plant. The commercial power plant analysis code GateCycle is applied for this purpose. This code is used to estimate typical performance of both wet and dry cooling options. Then it is configured to estimate the performance of ideal wet and dry cooling options. The latter are defined as the condenser temperature being at the ambient wet bulb temperature or dry bulb temperature, respectively. Yearly power production of a solar power plant located in Las Vegas is presented for each of the cooling options. To move further toward approaching the possible improvement in dry cooling, the impact of a high-performance heat exchanger surface is evaluated. It is found that higher efficiency generation compared to current dry cooling designs is definitely possible. In fact the performance of these types of systems can approach that of wet cooling system units.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acooling 3aenergy efficiency 3aequipment performance 3aheat exchangers 3apower generation 3apower plants 3asolar energy 3aNevada1 aBoehm, R.

However, experimental determination of hydrolysis encounters difficulties due to time and cost restraint. We employed the density functional theory and transition state theory to predict the hydrolysis pathways and kinetics of cephradine, a model of cephalosporin with two hydrolyzable groups, two ionization states, two isomers and two nucleophilic attack directions. Results showed that the hydrolysis of cephradine at pH = 8.0 proceeds via opening of the β-lactam ring followed by intramolecular amidation. The predicted rate constants at different pH conditions are of the same order of magnitude as the experimental values, and the predicted products are confirmed by experiment. This study identified a catalytic role of the carboxyl group in the hydrolysis, and implies that the carboxyl group also plays a catalytic role in the hydrolysis of other cephalosporin and penicillin antibiotics. This is a first attempt to quantum chemically predict hydrolysis of an antibiotic with complex pathways, and indicates that to predict hydrolysis products under the environmental pH conditions, the variation of the rate constants for different pathways with pH should be evaluated.  aPublisher supplied data 3acephalosporins 3ahydrolysis 3aionization 3aisomers 3amethodology 3amodels 3apH 3apenicillins 3aprediction1 aXie, Hongbin1 aChen, Jingwen1 aZhang, Shushen0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2015 Feb. 03, v. 49, no. 3 p.1552-1558dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes505383b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01524naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245008500168300001600253520053700269592002800806653001300834653001300847653001200860653001500872653001000887653001500897653002900912700002200941700001900963773013100982856007601113852000901189655001201198IND60125186620221118193251.0151102e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012518662DNAL7 a10.1647/2004-037.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavidson, Jacqueline R.10aPlate Fixation of a Coracoid Fracture in a Bald Eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus)  ap. 303-308.  aAn adult female bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) was presented with a history of being unable to fly.

Visual observation showed that at or above 40 ppm Cd, some light chlorotic symptoms, resembling iron (Fe) chlorosis, appeared after 2 to 3 weeks of germination. The extent of chlorosis followed the order Eruca sativa > Brassica napus > Brassica juncea , and for amendment treatments Unamended > SS-amended > FYM-amended soils. Both the amendments resulted in an increased biomass production in comparison to the Unamended soil, with the effect being more pronounced for FYM. The dry-matter yield of different plant parts followed the order FYM-amended > SS-amended > Unamended soils. For plant species, it followed the order Brassica juncea > Brassica napus > Eruca sativa . The Cd concentration in different plant parts followed the order leaf > stem > seed in all the three species. Amongst the species, the concentration followed the order Brassica napus > Brassica juncea > Eruca sativa , and for amendment treatments SS-amended > Unamended > FYM-amended soils. The mean Cd uptake by different plant species followed the order Brassica juncea > Brassica napus > Eruca sativa , and for amendment treatments SS-amended soil > Unamended soil > FYM-amended soil. The amounts of exchangeable, carbonate bound, Fe-Mn oxide bound, and organic-matter-bound fractions of Cd in the postharvest soil samples increased with the addition of Cd in soil. However, the residual fraction did not change much. At comparable levels of Cd additions, application of sewage sludge as well as FYM resulted in decreases in the exchangeable and Fe-Mn oxide–bound fractions and an increase in the organic-matter-bound fraction. The beneficial effect of sewage sludge and FYM on biomass production was attributed to (i) improvement in the physicochemical and biological environment of the growth medium, (ii) additional supply of essential nutrients, and (iii) possible decrease in toxic effect of added Cd through organo-metallic complexation reactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica juncea 3aBrassica napus 3aEruca vesicaria subsp. sativa 3aanimal manures 3abiomass production 3acadmium 3achlorosis 3acrops 3aculture media 3agermination 3airon 3aleaves 3anutrients 3aoilseed crops 3aoilseeds 3asewage 3asewage sludge 3asoil 3asoil sampling 3atoxicity 0aBrassica 0acadmium 0afarmyard manure 0aphytoextraction 0asewage sludge1 aPoonia, S.

Sixteen agro-morphological characters were evaluated to assess patterns of variation among landraces and their relationship with geographical regions. There were high levels of diversity within the germplasm. Differences in germplasm were predominantly due to genotype. Biologically significant correlation coefficients were observed among characters, indicating the stability of these relationships in garlic. Results indicated that the ability to produce scapes and plant weight should be considered in future garlic germplasm evaluation. Based on cluster analysis, there was a relationship between genetic divergence and geographical origins; genotypes from the same or nearby locations were in the same cluster. Genotypes GI-14 and GI-15 from Isfahan and Markazi provinces, respectively, had the ability to flower and were bolting types. Variation observed could help garlic breeders to select specific genotypes for future breeding.  aPublisher supplied data 3agermplasm 3acorrelation 3agermplasm evaluation 3alandraces 3aasexual reproduction 3aAllium sativum 3acluster analysis 3abolting 3aagronomic traits 3agarlic 3amutation 3agenotype 3aprovenance 3agenetic variation 3avegetables 0aIran 0abreeding 0aLandraces 0aAgro-morphological characters1 aKhodadadi, Mohsen1 aKarami, Ezzat1 aShaaf, Salar0 tInternational journal of vegetable science.g2014 July 3, v. 20, no. 3 p.202-215dTaylor & Francisx1931-52797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19315260.2013.7885943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03507naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245012400158300001600282520219800298592002802496650001902524650002402543650001902567650001502586650001402601650001502615650002502630650002202655650000702677650001202684650001502696650005002711650001402761650002002775651001802795700001702813700001502830700001602845773012902861856007402990852000903064655001203073IND60639946720221120095438.0190503e20170719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063994672DNAL7 a10.1039/c7em00158d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArp, H.

Herein a screening procedure to rank neutral, ionizable and ionic organic compounds for being persistent and mobile organic compounds (PMOCs) is presented and applied to the list of industrial substances registered under the EU REACH legislation as of December 2014. This comprised 5155 identifiable, unique organic structures. The minimum cut-off criteria considered for PMOC classification herein are a freshwater half-life >40 days, which is consistent with the REACH definition of freshwater persistency, and a log Dₒc < 4.5 between pH 4–10 (where Dₒc is the organic carbon–water distribution coefficient). Experimental data were given the highest priority, followed by data from an array of available quantitative structure–activity relationships (QSARs), and as a third resort, an original Iterative Fragment Selection (IFS) QSAR. In total, 52% of the unique REACH structures made the minimum criteria to be considered a PMOC, and 21% achieved the highest PMOC ranking (half-life > 40 days, log Dₒc < 1.0 between pH 4–10). Only 9% of neutral substances received the highest PMOC ranking, compared to 30% of ionizable compounds and 44% of ionic compounds. Predicted hydrolysis products for all REACH parents (contributing 5043 additional structures) were found to have higher PMOC rankings than their parents, due to increased mobility but not persistence. The fewest experimental data available were for ionic compounds; therefore, their ranking is more uncertain than neutral and ionizable compounds. The most sensitive parameter for the PMOC ranking was freshwater persistency, which was also the parameter that QSARs performed the most poorly at predicting. Several prioritized drinking water contaminants in the EU and USA, and other contaminants of concern, were identified as PMOCs. This identification and ranking procedure for PMOCs can be part of a strategy to better identify contaminants that pose a threat to drinking water sources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aaquatic environment 3adrinking water 3afreshwater 3ahalf life 3ahydrolysis 3alaws and regulations 3aorganic compounds 3apH 3aparents 3aprediction 3aquantitative structure-activity relationships 3ascreening 3awater pollution 3aUnited States1 aBrown, T.

In this work, an effective dual-emission fluorescent metal–organic framework nanocomposite probe (denoted as RB-PCN) has been constructed for sensitive and broad-range detection of pH. RB-PCN was prepared by encapsulating the DBI-PEG-NH₂-functionalized Fe₃O₄ into Zr-MOFs and then further reacting it with rhodamine B isothiocyanates (RBITC). In RB-PCN, RBITC is capable of sensing changes in pH in acidic solutions. Zr-MOFs not only enrich the target analyte but also exhibit a fluorescence response to pH changes in alkaline solutions. Based on the above structural and compositional features, RB-PCN could detect a wide range of pH changes. Importantly, such a nanoprobe could “see” the intracellular pH changes by fluorescence confocal imaging as well as “measure” the wider range of pH in actual samples by fluorescence spectroscopy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a MOF-based dual-emitting fluorescent nanoprobe has been used for a wide range of pH detection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3acoordination polymers 3aencapsulation 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3afluorescent dyes 3aimage analysis 3airon oxides 3aisothiocyanates 3ananocomposites 3aneoplasms 3apH 3apathogenesis 3arhodamines 3asensors (equipment) 3astroke1 aWang, Jing1 aShan, Duoliang1 aChen, Jing1 aZhang, Shouting1 aLu, Xiaoquan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2375-668X0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2018 May 04, v. 90, no. 11 p.7056-7063dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b014553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02798naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245006700155300001800222520165700240592002801897650002101925650001701946650001501963650001301978650000901991650001302000650002302013650001102036650001702047650001302064650001502077700002002092700001802112700002102130700002502151773014102176856007402317852000902391655001202400IND60631267720221122174739.0190220e20190219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063126772DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ta10941a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHong, Yang10aWater desalination through rim functionalized carbon nanotubes  ap. 3583-3591.  aCarbon nanotubes (CNTs) are promising media for seawater desalination due to their high water flow rate. Currently, narrow CNT membranes cannot be mass-produced for salt rejection purposes. Hence, introducing chemical functional groups at the rims of comparatively wider CNTs is an alternative strategy to enhance the ion exclusion performance. Although the dipole moment between the CNT rim and locally anchored functional groups is expected to have an important impact on desalination performance, its specific effects have not been systematically investigated. Herein, we present a comprehensive study of the water permeability and salt rejection of CNTs with various dipole moments anchored at their rims using classic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Compared to their bare CNT counterparts, CNTs with a low dipole moment at the rim can slightly increase the water flow and salt rejection rate, and CNTs with a high dipole moment can significantly improve the salt rejection efficiency, although water passage is slowed. In general, introducing functional groups with a high dipole moment on wider CNT rims can filter more than 95% of salt ions while maintaining a high water permeability of 10.2 L cm⁻² day⁻¹ MPa⁻¹. The calculated potential of mean force for water molecule and salt ion passage through the CNTs, oxygen and hydrogen density maps, radial distribution functions, and snapshots of water molecules and salt ions in the CNTs offer in-depth insights into the mechanism of seawater desalination by CNTs. Our study offers guidelines for an alternative design of CNTs to achieve both high salt rejection and fast water flow.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanotubes 3adesalination 3aguidelines 3ahydrogen 3aions 3amoieties 3amolecular dynamics 3aoxygen 3apermeability 3aseawater 3awater flow1 aZhang, Jingchao1 aZhu, Chongqin1 aZeng, Xiao Cheng1 aFrancisco, Joseph S.0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2019 Feb. 19, v. 7, no. 8 p.3583-3591dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ta10941a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02551naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245012900162300001600291500001900307520141500326592002801741650001901769650001101788650001801799650000901817650002001826650001501846650000901861653001201870653002101882653001301903653002801916700001601944700001701960773010101977856007802078852000902156655001202165IND60696750320221123014529.0200529e20200523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069675032DNAL7 a10.2478/helm-2020-00172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPapini, R.

The study involved a total of 14 adult Amiata breed donkeys, 7 – 13 years of age, and naturally infected with small strongyles. A group of 10 donkeys was treated with IVM oral paste at a dose rate of 200 mcg/kg BW. Another group of 4 donkeys was kept as untreated control group. Faecal samples were collected and examined for strongyle eggs on day 0 before treatment. IVM efficacy was based on the faecal egg count reduction test (FECRT) on day 14 post-treatment. Then individual faecal samples were collected and examined by FECRT at weekly intervals. A FECRT of 100 % was found after treatment with IVM and its ERP, defined as the week when the mean FECRT decreased until to become lower than 90 %efficacy, was estimated to be 11 weeks without signs of developing anthelmintic resistance. No adverse reactions were observed during the study period. Our findings may be useful to veterinary practitioners and breeders as they show that IVM, at the recommended dose rate, can be still considered a highly effective and safe pharmacological tool for the treatment of small strongyles in donkeys. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that all possible strategies are undertaken to avoid the risk of emergence of anthelmintic resistance to IVM in donkeys.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyathostominae 3aadults 3aanthelmintics 3aeggs 3afecal egg count 3aivermectin 3arisk 0adonkeys 0asmall strongyles 0aefficacy 0aegg reappearance period1 aOrsetti, C.1 aSgorbini, M.0 tHelminthologia.g2020 May 23, v. 57, no. 2 p.163-170dSciendowJournal:jnl24740x1336-90837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/helm-2020-00173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02773naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245012800160300002000288520132500308592002801633650004401661650002201705650001601727650002701743650001701770650002001787650001101807650001701818650003901835650001501874650001901889650001701908650002501925650003701950653002301987653002402010653002402034653001502058653001002073700001702083773012602100856008002226852000902306655001202315IND60559014220221122065854.0161123e20161123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055901422DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b101632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xiaowan10aFluorescence Probe Based on an Amino-Functionalized Fluorescent Magnetic Nanocomposite for Detection of Folic Acid in Serum  ap. 31832-31840.  aA new fluorescence probe constructed with a multifunctional nanocomposite, Fe₃O₄–ZnS:Mn²⁺/SiO₂–NH₂, was successfully synthesized and then used to detect folic acid in real serum samples. The nanocomposite was characterized by fluorescence spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, and physical property measurement system. With the addition of analyte, the Fe₃O₄–ZnS:Mn²⁺/SiO₂–NH₂ composite and folic acid formed a new complex because cross-linking of the amino and carboxyl groups participated in the condensation reaction. Then, the energy of quantum dots was transferred to the complex and led to quenching of the fluorescence. Moreover, the fluorescence intensity decreased significantly as the concentration of folic acid increased, and the fluorescence quenching ratio F₀/F was related to the folic acid concentration in the range from 0.1 to 5 μg mL–¹. This method was used for detecting folic acid in real serum samples and gave recoveries in the range of 89.0%–96.0%, with relative standard deviations of 1.2%–3.9%. The detection limit was 9.6 ng mL–¹ (S/N = 3). These satisfactory and simple results showed the great potential of this fluorescence probe in the field of pharmaceutical analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3ablood serum 3acondensation reactions 3acrosslinking 3adetection limit 3aenergy 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3afolic acid 3ananocomposites 3aquantum dots 3astatistical analysis 3atransmission electron microscopy 0afluorescence probe 0amagnetic separation 0aquenching mechanism 0afolic acid 0aserum1 aChen, Ligang0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2016 Nov. 23, v. 8, no. 46 p.31832-31840dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b101633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02620naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245012300172300001600295520131400311592002801625650001401653650001201667650001001679650001601689650000901705650001301714650001401727650001801741650001501759650001801774650002001792650001701812650000901829650001101838650001301849651001101862700002201873700002601895700002201921773010501943856008202048990002302130852000902153655001202162IND60097692820221120184819.0141104e20121110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009769282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecss.2012.07.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMantzouki, Evanthia10aAccuracy of pitfall traps for monitoring populations of the amphipod Orchestia gammarella (Pallas 1766) in saltmarshes  ap. 314-316.  aThe intertidal amphipod Orchestia gammarella displays a key role in the functioning of sand and salt marsh habitats, mainly due to its role in decomposition processes and as a main prey item for fish and birds. This study evaluates the accuracy of two sampling methods for estimating population size, biomass and cohort composition. Pitfall trapping, a passive and easily displayed method, was compared with the depletion of quadrats, an active and time-consuming method, considered here as the reference method. Sampling took place in North-West European saltmarshes (Mont Saint-Michel Bay, France) during the summer, 2003 (64 replicates per method). Linear regression revealed that activity-densities (number of individuals per trap) were strongly and positively correlated with densities (number of individuals per quadrat). Dry biomasses obtained from the two sampling methods were also significantly and positively correlated, but with a low coefficient of correlation. Cohort composition differed between the methods, with proportionally less juveniles and more intermediates in pitfall traps. We conclude that pitfall traps can be used for easily monitoring changes in the size, and to a lesser extent for measuring the biomass, of an amphipod population, but not for estimating its cohort composition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmphipoda 3abiomass 3abirds 3acorrelation 3afish 3ahabitats 3ajuveniles 3alinear models 3amonitoring 3apitfall traps 3apopulation size 3asalt marshes 3asand 3asummer 3atrapping 3aFrance1 aYsnel, Frédéric1 aCarpentier, Alexandre1 aPétillon, Julien0 tEstuarine, coastal and shelf science.g2012 Nov. 10, v. 113 p.314-316dElsevier Ltdx0272-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2012.07.0223Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02306naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245007400167300001800241520105200259592002801311650002701339650001901366650003001385650001601415650001401431650000901445650001501454650001701469650001101486653001301497653001601510653002501526653001301551653003001564700002301594700002501617700001801642773013101660856008401791852000901875655001201884IND60121792420221119211218.0150325e20131216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012179242DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2013.8474542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanwar, Anju10aEnhancement of Lead Uptake by Fenugreek Using EDTA and Glomus mosseae  ap. 3431-3443.  aThe influence of Glomus mosseae supplemented with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) on lead (Pb) uptake by Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum) was studied under pot conditions in a 2 × 2 × 5 factorial design with two AM treatments (G. mosseae inoculated and uninoculated), two EDTA concentrations (without and with 2.5 mmol EDTA kg ⁻¹), and five lead concentrations (0, 50, 100, 400, and 800 mg kg ⁻¹). A negative interaction was found between increasing lead concentration and G. mosseae . The plant dry matter and chlorophyll content was enhanced by G. mosseae whereas G. mosseae with EDTA showed the greatest root and shoot phosphorus (P) content. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid significantly enhanced lead concentration in the plant; however, at the same time it resulted in a slight decrease in the dry matter. However, when EDTA was applied along with G. mosseae , the deleterious effect of EDTA was overcome by the G. mosseae by promoting mineral uptake and plant growth, and hence metal accumulation also increased.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aGlomus mosseae 3aTrigonella foenum-graecum 3achlorophyll 3afenugreek 3alead 3aphosphorus 3aplant growth 3ashoots 0aAM fungi 0aheavy metal 0alead phytoextraction 0aP uptake 0aTrigonella foenum-graecum1 aAgravāla, Aśoka,1 aCharaya, Mayank Uday1 aKumar, Pradip0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2013 Dec. 16, v. 44, no. 22 p.3431-3443dTaylor & Francisx1532-24167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2013.8474543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02365naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245010800158300002000266520084000286592002801126650002801154650001701182650001001199650001001209650000901219650001901228650001801247650001301265650001401278650002101292650002201313650001701335650001701352653003401369653001801403653001701421653002601438653002501464700001601489700001301505700001701518700001701535700001701552700001601569700001901585700001601604773012601620856008001746852000901826655001201835IND60559014320221122042802.0161123e20161123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055901432DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b101662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Jie10aGold-Nanorods-Based Gene Carriers with the Capability of Photoacoustic Imaging and Photothermal Therapy  ap. 31558-31566.  aMultifunctional nanoparticles with high gene transfection activity, low cytotoxicity, photoacoustic imaging ability, and photothermal therapeutic properties were prepared by conjugating low-molecular-weight polyethylenimine onto the surfaces of gold nanorods through the formation of stable S–Au bonded conjugates.

These proteins act as ligand mimics of plant CLE peptides and are required for successful nematode infection. Previously, we showed that the CLV2/CORYNE (CRN) heterodimer receptor complex is required for nematode CLE signaling. However, there was only a partial reduction in nematode infection when this signaling was disrupted, indicating that there might be additional nematode CLE receptors. In this study, we demonstrate that CLV1 and RECEPTOR-LIKE PROTEIN KINASE 2/TOADSTOOL2 (RPK2), two additional receptors that can transmit the CLV3 signal independent of CLV2/CRN for shoot apical meristem maintenance, also play a role in nematode CLE perception. Localization studies showed that both receptors are expressed in nematode-induced syncytia. Infection assays with clv1 and rpk2 single mutants revealed a decrease in both nematode infection and syncytium size. Significantly, further reduction in nematode infection was observed when rpk2 was combined with clv1 and clv2 mutants. Taken together, our results indicate that parallel signaling pathways involving CLV1, CLV2, and RPK2 are important for nematode parasitism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aNematoda 3aapical meristems 3acyst nematodes 3agiant cells 3aligands 3amutants 3anematode infections 3aparasitism 3apeptides 3areceptors 3asignal transduction 3asynergism1 aWang, Jianying1 aPaolillo, Vitoria1 aSmeda, John1 aKinoshita, Atsuko1 aDurbak, Amanda1 aTax, Frans E.1 aWang, Xiaohong1 aSawa, Shinichiro1 aMitchum, Melissa G.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2013 Jan., v. 26, no. 1 p.87-96dThe American Phytopathological Societyx0894-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094%2FMPMI-05-12-0118-FI3Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02344naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006200147245011600209300001400325500001900339520140700358592002801765650001201793650003501805650002001840773012801860856008101988852000902069655001202078IND60731248820221120152926.0210319e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073124882DNAL7 a10.1017/S03768929200004422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGardner, Charlie J1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2750-369010aNot teaching what we practice: undergraduate conservation training at UK universities lacks interdisciplinarity  ap. 65-70.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe practice and science of conservation have become increasingly interdisciplinary, and it is widely acknowledged that conservation training in higher education institutions should embrace interdisciplinarity in order to prepare students to address real-world conservation problems. However, there is little information on the extent to which conservation education at the undergraduate level meets this objective. I carried out a systematic search of undergraduate conservation degree programmes in the UK and conducted a simple text analysis of module descriptions to quantify the extent to which they provide social science training. I found 47 programmes, of which 29 provided module descriptions. Modules containing social science content ranged from 3.8% to 52.2% of modules across programmes, but only 55.2% of programmes offered a social-focused conservation module, and only one programme offered a module in social science research methods. On average, almost half of the modules offered (46.2%) comprised biology and ecology modules with no conservation focus, and 17.9% comprised skills-based modules (research and vocational skills). Conservation-focused modules comprised a mean of only 22.5% of modules. These results show that undergraduate conservation teaching in the UK is still largely biocentric and is failing to deliver the interdisciplinary education that is widely called for.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecology 3anatural resources conservation 3asocial sciences0 tEnvironmental conservation.g2021 Mar., v. 48, no. 1 p.65-70dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl25024x1469-43877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S03768929200004423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02833naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005900151245009300210300001800303520146000321592002801781650002001809650002001829650001601849650002001865650002001885650004401905650001301949650001001962650001301972650002901985650001602014653003002030653001302060653001902073653001002092653002002102700006002122773013502182856008502317852000902402655001202411IND60675060720221118102818.0191104e20190930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067506072DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jproteome.9b005162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFisher, Mark F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6971-428510aSequencing Orbitides by Acid-Mediated Ring Cleavage Followed by Tandem Mass Spectrometry  ap. 4065-4071.  aHomodetic cyclic peptides have aroused interest because of their pharmacological potential. Sequencing cyclic peptides is difficult—Edman degradation is not possible as there is no N-terminus, NMR requires quantities that are hard to gather from native samples, and tandem mass spectrometry data are difficult to interpret due to the peptide ring opening at multiple points. Sequencing can be simplified by cleaving the peptide ring at a specific peptide bond. Partial acid hydrolysis is a possible solution, but to date sequencing by this method has only been demonstrated for linear peptides and cyclotides, which are larger cyclic peptides (∼30 amino acids) with three disulfide bonds. This study tests whether partial acid hydrolysis could be used to aid sequencing of Cys-less cyclic peptides with fewer than ten amino acid residues. We show that, with the right combination of temperature and acid, ring cleavage occurs and offers relatively simple MS/MS spectra amenable to sequencing. We describe how this method was used in our recent study in which we sequenced annomuricatin D (cyclo-GHSIFPPIP) from seeds of the soursop, Annona muricata. We found that orbitides can be linearized for MS/MS sequencing by incubation with 1.2 M HCl at 90 °C for 15–20 min. This fast, economical sequencing method will be useful to those studying small cyclic peptides lacking disulfide bonds, which are commonly found in many organisms, especially plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnnona muricata 3aacid hydrolysis 3aamino acids 3acyclic peptides 3adisulfide bonds 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aproteome 3aseeds 3asoursops 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atemperature 0acyclic peptide sequencing 0aorbitide 0acyclic peptide 0aMS/MS 0aannomuricatin D1 aMylne, Joshua S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4957-63880 tJournal of proteome research.g2019 Sept. 30, v. 18, no. 11 p.4065-4071dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23605x1535-39077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.9b005163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01986naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245011200162300001600274500001900290520080200309592002801111650001501139650001401154650002201168650000901190650001401199650001401213650001001227650001801237651001301255653002601268653001801294653001801312700001901330700001901349700002001368773010101388856007801489852000901567655001201576IND60696750620221122225814.0200529e20200523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069675062DNAL7 a10.2478/helm-2020-00212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKomorová, P.10aFirst documented cases of Pearsonema plica (syn.

However, most studies have used a rating curve based on a single hydraulic variable or the Manning equation (multiplicative method). In this study, we developed a mathematically different approach to estimating Q by applying the ensemble learning regression method (here termed ELQ), which is one of the machine learning techniques that linearly combine several functions to reduce errors, over the Congo mainstem as a test-bed. Using the training dataset (November 2002 – November 2006) of water levels (H) derived from different Envisat altimetry observations, the ELQ-estimated Q at the Brazzaville in-situ station showed reduced root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 823 m³ s⁻¹ (relative RMSE (RMSE normalized by the average in-situ Q, RRMSE) of 2.08%) compared to the Q obtained using a single rating curve. ELQ also showed improved performance for the validation dataset (December 2006 – September 2010). Based on the error analysis, we found the correlation coefficients between input variables affect the performance of ELQ. Thus, we introduced an index, termed the Degree of compensation (IDₒC), which describes how ELQ performs compared to the classic hydraulic relation (e.g., H-Q rating curve). The performance of ELQ improves when IDₒC increases because the additional information could be added in the ELQ process. Since ELQ can combine several variables obtained over different locations, it would be advantageous, particularly if there exist few virtual stations along a river reach. It is expected that ELQ can be also applied to the products of the Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission, which will provide direct measurements of surface water slope (S), effective river width (Wₑ), and H, to be launched in 2021.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial intelligence 3adata collection 3aequations 3aregression analysis 3aremote sensing 3ariver flow 3arivers 3asatellite altimetry 3asurface water 3atopography 0aCongo River 0aEnsemble learning regression (ELQ) 0aRiver discharge 0aEnvisat altimetry 0aSWOT 0aAmbiguity decomposition1 aYu, Hanwen1 aLee, Hyongki1 aBeighley, Edward1 aDurand, Michael1 aAlsdorf, Douglas,1 aHwang, Euiho0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2019 Feb., v. 221 p.741-755dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11735x0034-42577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2018.12.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02648naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245013500172520138900307592002801696650001301724650002001737650001901757650002401776650001801800650001301818650001601831650001501847650000901862650000901871650001301880650001401893650001601907653001401923653001701937653002301954700002301977700001802000773011302018856008602131852000902217655001202226IND60745235520221119092835.0210911e20211001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074523552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1283652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Ramandeep10aDevelopment and characterization of unitary and hybrid Al2O3 and ZrO dispersed Jatropha oil-based nanofluid for cleaner production  aCutting fluids play an important role in machining processes to provide lubrication and cooling action. However, conventional cutting fluids put a risk to the environment and operator health. This paper attempts to develop and characterize a novel sustainable and eco-friendly cutting fluid for machining applications. Jatropha oil-based Al₂O₃ and ZrO nanoparticles dispersed nanofluids with varying concentrations were developed and characterized for their rheological, thermal, and wettability properties. The viscosity studies were carried out at a temperature ranging from 303 K to 393 K, whereas thermal properties were investigated at room temperature. The wettability studies were carried out by measuring the angle of contact between the droplet of fluid and the tungsten carbide (WC) substrate interface. The experimental results showed that nanofluid's thermophysical properties (i,e viscosity, wettability, and thermal properties) were better than the base oil. The viscosity studies showed the best results with Al₂O₃ (1% weight) dispersed nanofluids, whereas thermal properties showed ZrO (0.5% weight) dispersed nanofluids to be most efficient. The wettability studies showed the best results with hybrid nanofluid (0.5% weight). LCA study has shown that Jatropha-based nanofluids have a less adverse effect on the environment than conventional cutting fluids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJatropha 3aadverse effects 3aaluminum oxide 3aambient temperature 3acontact angle 3adroplets 3alubrication 3ananofluids 3aoils 3arisk 3atungsten 3aviscosity 3awettability 0aNanofluid 0aJatropha oil 0aThermal properties1 aSah, Neetesh Kumar1 aSharma, Varun0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Oct. 01, v. 317 p.128365-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1283653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03327naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100002500157245010000182300001600282520198700298592002802285650001502313650001202328650001602340650001602356650001102372650002202383650001802405650001502423650001302438650001402451650000702465650002002472650002602492650003102518700001702549700002402566700002102590700001902611700001902630773009702649856009102746990002302837852000902860655001202869IND60098805120221122233334.0141105e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009880512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2013.07.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBanach-Latapy, Agata10aRedox-sensitive YFP sensors for monitoring dynamic compartment-specific glutathione redox state  ap. 436-445.  aIntracellular redox homeostasis is crucial for many cellular functions but accurate measurements of cellular compartment-specific redox states remain technically challenging. Genetically encoded biosensors including the glutathione-specific redox-sensitive yellow fluorescent protein (rxYFP) may provide an alternative way to overcome the limitations of conventional glutathione/glutathione disulfide (GSH/GSSG) redox measurements. This study describes the use of rxYFP sensors for investigating compartment-specific steady redox state and their dynamics in response to stress in human cells. RxYFP expressed in the cytosol, nucleus, or mitochondrial matrix of HeLa cells was responsive to the intracellular redox state changes induced by reducing as well as oxidizing agents. Compartment-targeted rxYFP sensors were able to detect different steady-state redox conditions among the cytosol, nucleus, and mitochondrial matrix. These sensors expressed in human epidermal keratinocytes HEK001 responded to stress induced by ultraviolet A radiation in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, rxYFP sensors were able to sense dynamic and compartment-specific redox changes caused by 100μM hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂). Mitochondrial matrix-targeted rxYFP displayed a greater dynamics of oxidation in response to a H₂O₂ challenge than the cytosol- and nucleus-targeted sensors, largely due to a more alkaline local pH environment. These observations support the view that mitochondrial glutathione redox state is maintained and regulated independently from that of the cytosol and nucleus. Taken together, our data show the robustness of the rxYFP sensors to measure compartmental redox changes in human cells. Complementary to existing redox sensors and conventional redox measurements, compartment-targeted rxYFP sensors provide a novel tool for examining mammalian cell redox homeostasis, permitting high-resolution readout of steady glutathione state and dynamics of redox changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3acytosol 3aglutathione 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3ahydrogen peroxide 3akeratinocytes 3amonitoring 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3apH 3astress response 3aultraviolet radiation 3ayellow fluorescent protein1 aHe, Tiantian1 aDardalhon, Michèle1 aVernis, Laurence1 aChanet, Roland1 aHuang, Meng-Er0 tFree radical biology & medicine.g2013 Dec., v. 65 p.436-445dElsevier Inc.x0891-58497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2013.07.0333Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03461naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011200165300001600277520214800293592002802441650001502469650001502484650001102499650001902510650002502529650002302554650001002577650001902587650000802606650001002614650001202624650001102636650000702647650001402654650001602668650001202684651002102696651001502717700001802732700001502750700001902765700001402784700001702798773009502815856004802910852000902958655001202967IND50063303120221120171314.0130324e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006330312DNAL7 a10.1007/s10498-012-9184-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarion, G. M.10aCarbon Sequestration and Release from Antarctic Lakes: Lake Vida and West Lake Bonney (McMurdo Dry Valleys)  ap. 135-145.  aPerennial ice covers on many Antarctic lakes have resulted in high lake inorganic carbon contents. The objective of this paper was to evaluate and compare the brine and CO₂ chemistries of Lake Vida (Victoria Valley) and West Lake Bonney (Taylor Valley), two lakes of the McMurdo Dry Valleys (East Antarctica), and their potential consequences during global warming. An existing geochemical model (FREZCHEM-15) was used to convert measured molarity into molality needed for the FREZCHEM model, and this model added a new algorithm that converts measured DIC into carbonate alkalinity needed for the FREZCHEM model. While quite extensive geochemical information exists for ice-covered Taylor Valley lakes, such as West Lake Bonney, only limited information exists for the recently sampled brine of >25 m ice-thick Lake Vida. Lake Vida brine had a model-calculated pCO₂ = 0.60 bars at the field pH (6.20); West Lake Bonney had a model-calculated pCO₂ = 5.23 bars at the field pH (5.46). Despite the high degree of atmospheric CO₂ supersaturation in West Lake Bonney, it remains significantly undersaturated with the gas hydrate, CO₂·6H₂O, unless these gas hydrates are deep in the sediment layer or are metastable having formed under colder temperatures or greater pressures. Because of lower temperatures, Lake Vida could start forming CO₂·6H₂O at lower pCO₂ values than West Lake Bonney; but both lakes are significantly undersaturated with the gas hydrate, CO₂·6H₂O. For both lakes, simulation of global warming from current subzero temperatures (−13.4 °C in Lake Vida and −4.7 °C in West Lake Bonney) to 10 °C has shown that a major loss of solution-phase carbon as CO₂ gases and carbonate minerals occurred when the temperatures rose above 0 °C and perennial ice covers would disappear. How important these Antarctic CO₂ sources will be for future global warming remains to be seen. But a recent paper has shown that methane increased in atmospheric concentration due to deglaciation about 10,000 years ago. So, CO₂ release from ice lakes might contribute to atmospheric gases in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aalkalinity 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3acarbonate minerals 3agases 3aglobal warming 3aice 3alakes 3amethane 3amodels 3apH 3asediments 3atemperature 3avalleys 3aAntarctic region 3aAntarctica1 aMurray, A.

The catalyst was found to be highly effective and stable for the degradation and mineralization of aromatic pollutants, as demonstrated with bisphenol A, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, ibuprofen, diphenhydramine, and phenytoin in the presence of H₂O₂ under neutral pH conditions. In addition, the high utilization efficiency of H₂O₂ was maintained at approximately 90% prior to the disappearance of the initial aromatic pollutants. On the basis of all of the characterization results, the pollutant degradation processes predominantly occurred on the surface of the catalyst due to the formation of σ-Cu–ligand complexes between the phenolic OH group and the surface Cu. In the reaction system, in addition to the unselective oxidation by •OH, H₂O₂ directly attacked the σ-Cu²⁺-complexes aromatic ring with the phenolic OH group, which resulted in the formation of •OH and HO-adduct radicals that were oxidized to hydroxylation products by reduction of Cu²⁺ in the σ-Cu²⁺-complexes to Cu⁺. The process prevented Cu²⁺ from oxidizing H₂O₂ to form HO₂•/O₂•– or O₂, and enhanced the Cu⁺/Cu²⁺ cycle, the formation of •OH, and the utilization efficiency of H₂O₂. Therefore, an extraordinarily high degradation and mineralization of the aromatic pollutants was observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4-D 3aaluminum oxide 3abisphenol A 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical bonding 3acopper 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydroxylation 3aibuprofen 3amineralization 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3apH 3aphenytoin 3apollutants 3aporous media 3asuperoxide anion1 aZhang, Lili1 aWang, Qiyuan1 aNie, Yulun1 aHu, Jun,0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2015 July 21, v. 49, no. 14 p.8639-8647dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.est.5b004453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02948naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245008600166300001300252500001900265520147500284592002801759650001201787650001801799650002801817650002601845650001701871650001001888650001801898650001701916650001801933650001101951650001101962650002201973650001601995650001102011650001202022650001102034650001002045650001102055653001002066653002502076653001602101653002602117700002302143700002302166700002102189773011602210856008302326852000902409655001202418IND60719795120221117202452.0210212e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071979512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tifs.2020.11.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRiesute, Reda10aEffect of yeasts on food quality and safety and possibilities of their inhibition  ap. 1-10.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aYeasts are widely spread in nature. Yeasts have a positive role in the fermentation of some products such as wine or beer, although they are also responsible for food spoilage alongside fungi. In addition, some species of yeasts, such as Candida spp., can enter the human body through food and beverages and may cause various types of infections. Therefore, it is necessary to find natural means for inhibition yeast growth in foods where they are undesirable microorganisms.This work describes the prevalence of yeasts in food products, the impact of pathogenic yeasts on the human organism, and the possibility to suppress their growth by use of lactic acid bacteria and preservatives of plant origin. It may be applicable in food industries where yeasts are undesirable microorganisms which requires inhibition of their growth.Yeasts have a positive role in food fermentation, but can also cause infections in people, therefore their presence in food should be controlled. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are good inhibitors of fungal activity due to the presence of inhibitory compounds, such as lactic, acetic, and ascorbic acids, hydrogen peroxide, bacteriocins, and others. Out of LAB, Lactobacillus plantarum shows the strongest inhibitory effects. Furthermore, plant extracts, such as black walnut, clove, garlic, oregano leaf extracts, as well as anolyte – a natural disinfectant - also display an antifungal effect and could be used for yeast and fungal control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida 3aJuglans nigra 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aantifungal properties 3abacteriocins 3abeers 3adisinfectants 3afermentation 3afood spoilage 3agarlic 3ahumans 3ahydrogen peroxide 3alactic acid 3aleaves 3aoregano 3apeople 3awines 3ayeasts 0aYeast 0aLactic acid bacteria 0aBacteriocin 0aNatural antimicrobial1 aSalomskiene, Joana1 aMoreno, David Saez1 aGustiene, Sonata0 tTrends in food science & technology.g2021 Feb., v. 108 p.1-10dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45707x0924-22447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tifs.2020.11.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02680naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005700140245009300197300001800290500002000308520151000328592002801838596004101866650002301907650001201930650001301942650001501955650001101970650001401981650002001995650002102015700002102036700002502057700002102082773011902103856007502222852000902297655001202306IND60786329920221122104058.0220803e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078632992DNAL7 a10.1002/agj2.204122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDube, Nothabo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8855-500510aCotton boll distribution and yield estimation using three‐dimensional point cloud data  ap. 4976-4989.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNode‐by‐node boll mapping has been used to determine the effects of several environmental and management strategies, including irrigation rate and cultivar, on cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) boll distribution. The advent of consumer 3D digital imaging may make rapid node‐by‐node mapping of greater acreage possible in the future. Effects of irrigation rate and cultivar on boll distribution were determined from line plots of node‐specific boll distribution and boll accumulation estimate data and from vertical box and whisker plots of boll fraction using data collected by a 3D sensor system to rapidly detect open bolls before harvest over three seasons. Differences were observed between the dryland (2018 only), low irrigation, and high irrigation rates in terms of boll fraction and boll accumulation for each cultivar. The low irrigation tended to produce bolls more toward the bottom of the plant, while the high irrigation produced bolls towards the top of the plant. Yield correlation between sensor obtained and manually counted measurements was strong, with r² values as high as 0.87. Results obtained indicated that differences among irrigation rate and cultivar were identifiable using the sensor system during the 3 yr research study. Similar systems may allow rapid, broad‐scale identification of boll distribution and yield in breeding and physiology research in the future, leading to improved identification of elite cultivars and improved management practices in cotton.  aPublisher supplied data  aProject RevolutioncBASF Corporation 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aacreage 3aagronomy 3aarid lands 3acotton 3acultivars 3adata collection 3airrigation rates1 aBryant, Benjamin1 aSari‐Sarraf, Hamed1 aRitchie, Glen L.0 tAgronomy journal.g2020 Nov., v. 112, no. 6 p.4976-4989dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/agj2.204123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03040naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245012200163300001600285500001900301520139400320592002801714650002701742650002301769650002601792650001801818650001201836650002901848650001301877650001501890650001701905650000901922650001001931650002001941650001501961650001501976650001201991650001902003650001402022650001702036650002302053650001402076650001902090653003902109653002102148653002702169653002802196700001602224700001402240700001702254773011202271856008202383852000902465655001202474IND60684253020221116152211.0200320e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068425302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2020.02.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Zhenguo10aIdentification and characterization of a novel short-type peptidoglycan recognition protein in Apostichopus japonicus  ap. 257-266.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPeptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) are pattern recognition molecules of the innate immune system via specific recognizing peptidoglycan, a unique component of bacterial cell wall. In the present study, a homologous gene encoding PGRP-S was identified and characterized from Apostichopus japonicus and designated as AjPGRP-S. The open reading frame of AjPGRP-S is 756 bp encoding a polypeptide of 251 amino acids (aa) with a signal peptide (1–24 aa) and a typical PGRP domain (37–178 aa). Phylogenetic analysis and sequence alignment revealed that AjPGRP-S is a member of the PGRP-S family. In healthy sea cucumbers, AjPGRP-S was expressed in all examined tissues with the highest distribution in body wall, muscle, and intestine. In Vibrio splendidus-infected sea cucumbers, AjPGRP-S was remarkably induced in coelomocytes. The recombinant AjPGRP-S (rAjPGRP-S) was shown to possess the highly amidase activity in the presence of Zn²⁺. Moreover, rAjPGRP-S exhibited agglutination abilities and strong bacteriostatic activities against V. splendidus, V. harveyi, V. parahaemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Micrococcus luteus. Furthermore, the agglutination ability can be enhanced in the presence of Zn²⁺. In conclusion, our results suggested that AjPGRP-S serves as a pattern recognition molecule involved in the immune response towards various pathogenic infections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApostichopus japonicus 3aMicrococcus luteus 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aagglutination 3aamidase 3aantibacterial properties 3abacteria 3acell walls 3acoelomocytes 3afish 3agenes 3ainnate immunity 3aintegument 3aintestines 3amuscles 3apeptidoglycans 3aphylogeny 3apolypeptides 3asequence alignment 3ashellfish 3asignal peptide 0aPeptidoglycan recognition proteins 0aAmidase activity 0aAntibacterial activity 0aBacterial agglutination1 aCao, Xuebin1 aGuo, Ming1 aLi, Chenghua0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2020 Apr., v. 99 p.257-266dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2020.02.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01988naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003200147245009100179300001800270520097900288592002801267650001501295650001201310650001701322650002301339650001501362650002101377650001101398650001301409650002101422700001901443700002101462773009801483856004801581852000901629655001201638IND50069430020221122005149.0130926e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006943002DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-013-0439-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGlen, A.

Invasive Species Management (ISM) helps conserve localized populations and ecosystems, but rarely have its potential benefits been explored at the landscape scale. We explore how ISM can enhance landscape connectivity, and how its incorporation into conservation planning algorithms could help design optimal reserve networks. Conversely, conservation planning and connectivity modelling can optimize targeting of ISM, achieving benefits for a wider range of taxa and ecological processes, without the need for additional resources. Empirical research must investigate the spatial pattern of benefits from ISM, and when to target priority conservation sites or the areas (matrix) between them. By bolstering populations within—and increasing connectivity between—focal patches, ISM should move beyond conserving individual sites to creating functionally connected networks of conservation areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aanimals 3abiodiversity 3aconservation areas 3aecosystems 3ainvasive species 3amodels 3aplanning 3areserve networks1 aPech, Roger P.1 aByrom, Andrea E.0 tBiological invasions.g2013 Oct., v. 15, no. 10 p.2127-2138dSpringer-Verlagx1387-35477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-013-0439-6  aDNAL 7aarticle03602naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245010300163506011700266506007600383520150400459592002801963506003701991650001202028650001302040650001802053650001602071650001802087650002102105650001402126653000802140653000802148653000802156653000802164653000802172653001302180653001002193653000902203653000802212653000902220653000902229653000802238653000802246653000802254653000802262653000802270653000802278653001002286653000802296653000802304653000702312653000902319653000802328653000802336653000702344653000702351653003202358653002102390653003702411653001302448653001702461653003002478653002702508653004402535700001902579700001802598700002302616773010202639856008202741852000902823655001202832IND60766143920221207130328.0220328e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076614392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cpb.2022.1002352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhosh, Soma10aCalcium signaling and transport machinery: Potential for development of stress tolerance in plants  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCalcium (Ca²⁺) is an essential macronutrient as well as a second messenger in diverse biological processes in plants. Plants perceive various stimuli which leads to transient increase in cytosolic calcium [Ca²⁺]cyₜ levels, resulting in generation of Ca²⁺ signatures. These Ca²⁺ signatures are specific to various stress stimuli and developmental processes and are perceived by Ca²⁺ sensors. Ca²⁺ sensors and relay proteins participate in downstream signaling events to decode the Ca²⁺ signatures. Ca²⁺ homeostasis involves the synergistic action of transporting elements that regulate Ca²⁺ influx and efflux. The influx elements help elevate the [Ca²⁺]cyₜ levels during signaling events and efflux elements help in restoring the resting [Ca²⁺]cyₜ levels. These Ca²⁺ transporters include Cyclic nucleotide gated channels (CNGCs), Glutamate receptor-like (GLRs) channels/Glutamate-like receptor channels, Two pore channels (TPCs), Annexins, Mechanosensitive channels (MSLs), Ca²⁺-ATPases, Ca²⁺/H⁺ exchangers (CAXs), Ca²⁺/cation exchangers (CCXs). The involvement of these Ca²⁺ signaling and transporting elements in developmental and physiological processes as well as responses to diverse stress factors accounts for their significance. In this review, we highlight the progress of genomic approaches in dissecting the role of Ca²⁺ signaling components in mediating stress tolerance in plants, in the context of changing climatic conditions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acalcium 3agenomics 3aglutamic acid 3ahomeostasis 3aplant biology 3astress tolerance 3asynergism 0aCaM 0aCML 0aCAD 0aCLD 0aCBL 0aCPK/CDPK 0aCcaMK 0aCNGC 0aGLR 0aCAXs 0aTPCs 0aMSL 0aMCA 0aTPK 0aGAF 0aCNB 0aSOS 0aSnRK2 0aSer 0aThr 0aPK 0aECAs 0aACA 0aABA 0aSA 0aJA 0aCytosolic calcium [Ca2+]cyt 0aCa2+ homeostasis 0aCyclic nucleotide-gated channels 0aAnnexins 0aCa2+-ATPases 0aCa2+/H+ exchangers (CAXs) 0aCa2+ influx and efflux 0aGlutamate receptor-like (GLRs) channels1 aBheri, Malathi1 aBisht, Diksha1 aPandey, Girdhar K.0 tCurrent plant biology.g2022 Jan., v. 29 p.100235-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23302x2214-66287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cpb.2022.1002353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01915naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245010300176300001500279500002000294520068900314592002801003596002201031650002601053650002101079650002301100650002301123650002401146650002001170650002701190650002001217650002501237650001801262700002101280773014201301852000901443856008901452655001201541IND4414711520221118235056.0200107e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441471152DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1467-8276.2008.01179.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalagtas, Joseph V.14aThe Commodity Terms of Trade, Unit Roots, and Nonlinear Alternatives: A Smooth Transition Approach  ap. 87-105.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis article extends the recent literature on the Prebisch‐Singer hypothesis of a long‐run decline in the relative prices of primary commodities. Our main innovation is testing for and estimating nonlinear alternatives to a secular deterioration. Specifically, we use bootstrap procedures to test the linear unit root model against models belonging to the family of smooth transition autoregressions (STARs) for twenty‐four commodities, 1900–2003. In nineteen cases we reject the linear null at usual significance levels. In sixteen cases we are able to successfully fit STAR‐type models. Simulation results show there is little support for the Prebisch‐Singer hypothesis.  aPublisher supplied data  cPurdue University 3aagricultural products 3acommodity prices 3atemporal variation 3aeconometric models 3aregression analysis 3aeconomic theory 3aagricultural economics 3aeconomic policy 3aeconomic development 3adata analysis1 aHolt, Matthew T.0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g2009 Feb., v. 91, no. 1 p.87-105dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44932x0002-90927nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8276.2008.01179.x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle04093naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245015900160300001600319520189400335592002802229650002402257650003002281650002102311650002502332650002502357650001602382650001302398650001202411650001802423650000902441650002302450650002002473650002602493650002002519650002002539650003102559650002702590650002302617650002602640650001402666650001902680650001502699650002002714650001302734650002002747650001802767650002902785650001402814650002802828650002502856650002502881650001602906653002302922653002402945653002102969700001602990700001503006700001803021700002003039700001903059700001203078700001903090700001903109700001603128773011203144856008203256852000903338655001203347IND60684253120221116152217.0200320e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068425312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2020.02.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Fei10aEffects of hesperidin on the growth performance, antioxidant capacity, immune responses and disease resistance of red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii)  ap. 154-166.  aWe evaluated the effects of hesperidin on the nonspecific immunity, antioxidant capacity and growth performance of red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii). A total of 900 healthy crayfish were randomly divided into six groups: the control group (fed the basal diet) and the HES25, HES50, HES75, HES100 and HES150 groups, which were fed the basal diet supplemented with 25, 50, 75, 100 and 150 mg kg⁻¹ hesperidin, respectively. The feeding experiment lasted 8 weeks. The results indicated that compared with the control group, the crayfish groups supplemented with 50–150 mg kg⁻¹ hesperidin had a decreased feed conversion ratio (FCR) and increased final body weight (FBW), specific growth rate (SGR) and weight gain (WG) (P < 0.05). The protein carbonyl content (PCC), reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and malondialdehyde (MDA) level in the hepatopancreas and hemocytes were significantly lower, while the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were significantly higher in the crayfish groups supplemented with 50–150 mg kg⁻¹ hesperidin than in the control group. Supplementation with 50–150 mg kg⁻¹ hesperidin significantly increased the activities of acid phosphatase (ACP), alkaline phosphatase (AKP), lysozyme (LZM), and phenoloxidase (PO) compared with the control group (P < 0.05); upregulated the mRNA expression of cyclophilin A (CypA), extracellular copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (ecCuZnSOD), GPxs, crustin, astacidin, Toll3 and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) (P < 0.05); and decreased crayfish mortality following white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) infection. These findings indicate that dietary hesperidin supplementation at an optimum dose of 50–150 mg kg⁻¹ may effectively improve nonspecific immunity, antioxidant capacity and growth performance in crayfish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProcambarus clarkii 3aWhite spot syndrome virus 3aacid phosphatase 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aantioxidant activity 3abody weight 3acrayfish 3acrustin 3acyclophilin A 3adiet 3adisease resistance 3aenzyme activity 3aextracellular enzymes 3afeed conversion 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3aglutathione peroxidase 3agrowth performance 3aheat-shock protein 70 3ahemocytes 3ahepatopancreas 3ahesperidin 3aimmune response 3alysozyme 3amalondialdehyde 3amessenger RNA 3amonophenol monooxygenase 3amortality 3areactive oxygen species 3aspecific growth rate 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aweight gain 0aRed swamp crayfish 0aProcambarus clarkia 0aImmune responses1 aQu, Yun-Kun1 aGeng, Chao1 aWang, Ai-Ming1 aZhang, Jia-Hong1 aChen, Kai-Jian1 aLiu, Bo1 aTian, Hong-Yan1 aYang, Wen-Ping1 aYu, Ye-Bing0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2020 Apr., v. 99 p.154-166dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2020.02.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02383naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001300145245016800158300001800326520115700344592002801501650001601529650001501545650001901560650001301579650002601592650003101618650001601649650001401665650002701679700001601706700001401722700001901736700001401755700001301769773012501782856008101907852000901988655001201997IND60535840320221117204243.0160805e20150721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053584032DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.5b008022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Kai10aUnderstanding the Adsorption of PFOA on MIL-101(Cr)-Based Anionic-Exchange Metal–Organic Frameworks: Comparing DFT Calculations with Aqueous Sorption Experiments  ap. 8657-8665.  aTo examine the effects of different functionalization methods on adsorption behavior, anionic-exchange MIL-101(Cr) metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) were synthesized using preassembled modification (PAM) and postsynthetic modification (PSM) methods. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) adsorption results indicated that the maximum PFOA adsorption capacity was 1.19 and 1.89 mmol g–¹ for anionic-exchange MIL-101(Cr) prepared by PAM and PSM, respectively. The sorption equilibrium was rapidly reached within 60 min. Our results indicated that PSM is a better modification technique for introducing functional groups onto MOFs for adsorptive removal because PAM places functional groups onto the aperture of the nanopore, which hinders the entrance of organic contaminants. Our experimental results and the results of complementary density functional theory calculations revealed that in addition to the anion-exchange mechanism, the major PFOA adsorption mechanism is a combination of Lewis acid/base complexation between PFOA and Cr(III) and electrostatic interaction between PFOA and the protonated carboxyl groups of the bdc (terephthalic acid) linker.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3aadsorption 3aanion exchange 3achromium 3acoordination polymers 3aelectrostatic interactions 3amethodology 3ananopores 3aperfluorooctanoic acid1 aZhang, Siyu1 aHu, Xiyue1 aZhang, Kunyang1 aRoy, Ajay1 aYu, Gang0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2015 July 21, v. 49, no. 14 p.8657-8665dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.est.5b008023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02013naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245012100173300001400294520084600308592002801154650001901182650001101201650001401212650002301226650002001249650001301269650001401282650001101296650001401307650001001321650001601331700002301347700001901370700001601389700002001405773009701425856008401522852000901606655001201615IND60098805720221122233413.0141105e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009880572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2010.08.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSugisawa, Masanori10aEffects of La addition to Ni/Al₂O₃ catalysts on rates and carbon deposition during steam reforming of n-dodecane  ap. 21-25.  aSteam reforming of n-dodecane on La–Ni/γ-Al₂O₃ catalysts was investigated at a relatively low temperature (773K) to elucidate the catalytic behavior at the inlet of a practical reformer. The addition of lanthanum to the Ni/γ-Al₂O₃ formulation completely suppressed carbon deposition, which otherwise occurs to a significant extent on unmodified Ni/γ-Al₂O₃. Modification with La also enhanced the initial turnover rates of hydrogen formation. The La–Ni/γ-Al₂O₃ catalysts, however, deactivated with increased time-on-stream at a high steam-to-carbon ratio of 3.5, because of oxidation of the active Ni metal. Reduction at 873K almost fully regenerated the catalytic activity, indicating that the deactivation was not primarily a result of sintering or carbon deposition, but was due to the oxidation of active Ni metal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3afuel production 3ahydrogen 3alanthanum 3anickel 3aoxidation 3asteam 3atemperature1 aTakanabe, Kazuhiro1 aHarada, Makoto1 aKubota, Jun1 aDomen, Kazunari0 tFuel processing technology.g2011 Jan., v. 92, no. 1 p.21-25dElsevier B.V.x0378-38207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2010.08.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02338naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245011500161300001600276520135900292592002801651650001201679650002001691650002601711650002001737650001201757650001901769650001001788700001501798773012001813856008201933852000902015655001202024IND60618869620221117224010.0181030e198111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061886962DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517581051011092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRyan, A.10aApplication of Sonic Wave Theory to the Measurement of the Dynamic Elastic Moduli of Woven and Knitted Fabrics  ap. 732-740.  aThe dynamic elastic modulus is one of the fundamental properties of textile materials and also one of the most difficult to quantify. The development of sonic methods to measure this property results in a test that is simple and nondestructive as well as being independent of sample cross-sectional characteristics. A brief survey of the literature based on this technique reveals both the limited application of theory and also the limited range of test samples and conditions that have been treated, especially in the fabric area. The fundamental theory of dynamic modulus measurement and the theory of sonic wave propagation is developed in this paper and is applied to series of laboratory- produced and commercially-produced fabrics. Three separate series of experiments are undertaken to quantify the effects of fabric parameters (i.e. yarn crimp, degree of set, and fiber diameter) and yarn on the principal dynamic elastic moduli and the dynamic shear modulus for both woven and knitted fabrics. These experimental results show that the method predicts the configuration of fibers in fabrics and yarns. The indications are that this work can be expanded by the use of microprocessors and computers to predict fabric specifications from fiber and yarn properties. The application of this technique to quality and process control is also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3afabrics 3amicroprocessors 3amodulus of elasticity 3aprocess control 3asurveys 3atextile fibers 3ayarns1 aPostle, R.0 tTextile research journal.g1981 Nov., v. 51, no. 11 p.732-740dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0040517581051011093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02407naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245007400170300001400244520134500258592002801603650002201631650001401653650002601667650001901693650001301712650001101725650002101736650001801757650001601775650002401791700001701815700002301832773009701855856008401952852000902036655001202045IND60098805920221122233315.0141105e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009880592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2010.08.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJain, Siddharth10aAcid base catalyzed transesterification kinetics of waste cooking oil  ap. 32-38.  aThe present study reports the results of kinetics study of acid base catalyzed two step transesterification process of waste cooking oil, carried out at pre-determined optimum temperature of 65°C and 50°C for esterification and transesterification process respectively under the optimum condition of methanol to oil ratio of 3:7 (v/v), catalyst concentration 1%(w/w) for H₂SO₄ and NaOH and 400rpm of stirring. The optimum temperature was determined based on the yield of ME at different temperature. Simply, the optimum concentration of H₂SO₄ and NaOH was determined with respect to ME Yield. The results indicated that both esterification and transesterification reaction are of first order rate reaction with reaction rate constant of 0.0031min⁻¹ and 0.0078min⁻¹ respectively showing that the former is a slower process than the later. The maximum yield of 21.50% of ME during esterification and 90.6% from transesterification of pretreated WCO has been obtained. This is the first study of its kind which deals with simplified kinetics of two step acid–base catalyzed transesterification process carried under the above optimum conditions and took about 6h for complete conversion of TG to ME with least amount of activation energy. Also various parameters related to experiments are optimized with respect to ME yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3acatalysts 3acooking fats and oils 3aesterification 3amethanol 3amixing 3asodium hydroxide 3asulfuric acid 3atemperature 3atransesterification1 aSharma, M.P.1 aRajvanshi, Shalini0 tFuel processing technology.g2011 Jan., v. 92, no. 1 p.32-38dElsevier B.V.x0378-38207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2010.08.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03563naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094024004000137040001800177100001600195245009800211300001600309506007600325506003100401520176800432592002802200596008302228596002902311506003702340650002502377650001502402650001302417650001302430650002302443650001802466650001202484650001102496650002502507653000902532653001202541653003102553653001102584653001302595653002302608653001602631700001702647700001702664700001702681700001802698700002002716773011102736856008702847856004502934961000902979852000902988655001202997IND60636400720221215142542.0200717e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063640072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodqual.2018.04.0042chorus7 a10.1016/j.foodqual.2018.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrist, C.A.10aAutomated facial expression analysis for emotional responsivity using an aqueous bitter model  ap. 349-359.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aThe food industry is seeking ways to understand consumer emotions, using implicit measurements, to differentiate acceptability of products in the marketplace. Automated facial expression analysis (AFEA) is a prospective analysis for product acceptability. This study used aqueous bitter solutions to determine and validate AFEA as an analysis supplement to product liking. Participants (n = 46) evaluated a control (distilled water) and three bitter (caffeine) solutions: low (0.05% w/v); medium (0.08% w/v); and high (0.15% w/v). Individual participant sessions were video-recorded and analyzed (5 s; α = 0.20) for each sample in the default and continuous analysis setting. Participants rated liking and bitter intensity on a 9-point scale. An inverse relationship existed between liking and bitter intensity (rₛ = −0.90; p < 0.0001). In continuous setting for AFEA analysis of mean emotion intensity, analyzed by ANOVA, only the medium bitter treatment elicited a higher disgust response control (p < 0.20) and no differences were found between treatments in disgust (p > 0.20) evaluations using program default settings. For time series analysis with both the continuous and default settings, disgust was a predominant emotion in the medium and high bitter solutions as well as happy in the high (p < 0.025). Using time series analysis, continuous and default results had similar patterns over 5 s, but continuous data was more intermittent. Time series analysis is a promising tool for interpreting emotional results of a population and is more sensitive to emotional changes than mean comparisons. Future studies should continue to improve the characterization and sensitivity of emotions to food acceptability using AFEA.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cConAgra Foods Foundation0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanalysis of variance 3aautomation 3acaffeine 3aemotions 3afood acceptability 3afood industry 3amarkets 3amodels 3atime series analysis 0aAFEA 0aEmotion 0aFacial expression analysis 0aBitter 0aCaffeine 0aSensory evaluation 0aTime series1 aDuncan, S.E.1 aArnade, E.A.1 aLeitch, K.A.1 aO'Keefe, S.F.1 aGallagher, D.L.0 tFood quality and preference.g2018 Sept., v. 68 p.349-359dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46499x0950-32937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodqual.2018.04.0043Available from publisher's site40uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/6364007  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02893naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006500150245010900215300001600324520151300340592002801853650001901881650002201900650001801922650001801940650002201958650001001980650002801990650001102018650001502029650001102044650001302055650001802068650001602086650001302102653002602115653003902141653002102180700002702201700003202228773009302260856008502353852000902438655001202447IND60766144320221121153646.0220214s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076614432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxrep.2022.01.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTapia-Salazar, Mireya1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1048-978110aToxicological effect and enzymatic disorder of non-studied emerging contaminants in Artemia salina model  ap. 210-218.  aEmerging contaminants such as sunscreens, hair dyes and flame retardants have been found at important concentrations in surface water (river, lake, ocean), but their negative impact on different aquatic species is not fully known. This study evaluated the effect of benzophenone (BZ), 2,5-diaminotoluene sulfate (PTD), p-phenylenediamine (PPD) and tetrabromobisphenol A (TBPA) on survival (LC50) and the impact of sublethal concentrations (LC25) on the activity of enzymes linked to stress oxidative process in brine shrimp under two temperature conditions (22 °C and 28 °C) for 24 h and 48 h of exposure time. LC50 values obtained for each chemical substance and the activity of GST, AChE and LDH were significantly affected by the temperature conditions and exposure time. In contrast, GPx was only altered by the tested compound. TBBPA (LC50 from 17.05 up to 28.55 μg/L) and BZ (LC50 from 14.86 up to 24.49 mg/L) resulted in the most toxic substances for A. salina. The impact of dyes, such as PTD and PPD, on aquatic organisms is limited. These are the first results that show that not only dyes, but their respective by-products induce harmful effects in brine shrimp (LC50 for PTD and PPD were 23.6–396.3 and 52.0–164.9 mg/L respectively). Although this study model was very useful to evaluate the ecotoxicity of the different ECs, additional research is needed to increase available information related to the effects of dyes and other non-studied micropollutants on aquatic systems in general.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemia salina 3aaquatic organisms 3abenzophenones 3aecotoxicology 3aexposure duration 3alakes 3alethal concentration 50 3amodels 3apollutants 3arivers 3asulfates 3asurface water 3atemperature 3atoxicity 0aEmerging contaminants 0aMedian lethal concentration (LC50) 0aOxidative stress1 aDiaz-Sosa, Veronica R.1 aCárdenas-Chávez, Diana L.0 tToxicology reports.g2022, v. 9 p.210-218dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23254x2214-75007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxrep.2022.01.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02624naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245013700169300001600306520126100322592002801583650002101611650002201632650001701654650001601671650001301687650002801700650001901728650001301747650001701760650001501777653002301792653002901815653002401844700001701868700001701885700001601902700001701918700001301935700001401948700001701962773009301979856008502072852000902157655001202166IND60766144420221121153641.0220207s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076614442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxrep.2022.01.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiong, Yongjia10aCharacteristics of a novel photoinitiator aceanthrenequinone-initiated polymerization and cytocompatibility of its triggered polymer  ap. 191-203.  aA number of photoinitiators are available in chemical industry, but less of them in biomedicine or clinical therapy due to the limitation of their cytotoxicity and biocompatibility. Thus, it is urgently necessary to find non-toxic or low-toxic photoinitiators to meet clinical demands. Aceanthrenequinone (AATQ) is a novel photosensitizer with high-photoinitiating ability, but no reports contribute, to date, to its cytotoxicity and biocompatibility. Here, primary cells and various cell lines were exposed to different concentrations of AATQ with or without irradiation. AATQ had the similar photoinitiating conversion efficiency to the extensively used bis(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)-phenylphosphine oxide (BAPO) and higher one than 9,10-phenanthrenequinone (PANQ) with the similar extent of polymerization in depth within a certain range, but displayed much lower cytotoxicity than BAPO under non-irradiation or irradiation. The biocompatibility of BisGMA/TEGDMA polymer prepared by AATQ was superior to that of PANQ, but inferior to that of camphorquinone (CQ) although the far lower dose of AATQ is enough to initiate polymerization of monomer than that of CQ. Hence, AATQ offers a valuable alternative in applications of industrial or biomedical areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatibility 3achemical industry 3acytotoxicity 3airradiation 3amedicine 3aphotosensitizing agents 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3atherapeutics 3atoxicology 0aAceanthrenequinone 0a9,10-phenanthrenequinone 0aPhotopolymerization1 aZou, Hailing1 aWang, Shuhui1 aGuo, Jiawen1 aZeng, Boning1 aXiao, Pu1 aLiu, Jing1 aXing, Feiyue0 tToxicology reports.g2022, v. 9 p.191-203dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23254x2214-75007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxrep.2022.01.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03311naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092024002200124024001900146040001800165100002100183245017500204300001800379506007600397520176000473592002802233506003702261650001902298650003502317650002602352650002702378650001402405650002502419650001302444650001402457650002402471650001702495650002002512650002902532650001802561650002202579650001202601700002802613700001902641773012702660856004502787852000902832655001202841IND4524940020221207070819.0160105e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND452494002DNAL7 a10.1099/vir.0.041186-02doi7 aPMC37555192pmcid7 a224220682pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDahiya, Satinder10aDeployment of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protein arsenal: combating the host to enhance viral transcription and providing targets for therapeutic development  ap. 1151-1172.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDespite the success of highly active antiretroviral therapy in combating human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, the virus still persists in viral reservoirs, often in a state of transcriptional silence. This review focuses on the HIV-1 protein and regulatory machinery and how expanding knowledge of the function of individual HIV-1-coded proteins has provided valuable insights into understanding HIV transcriptional regulation in selected susceptible cell types. Historically, Tat has been the most studied primary transactivator protein, but emerging knowledge of HIV-1 transcriptional regulation in cells of the monocyteâmacrophage lineage has more recently established that a number of the HIV-1 accessory proteins like Vpr may directly or indirectly regulate the transcriptional process. The viral proteins Nef and matrix play important roles in modulating the cellular activation pathways to facilitate viral replication. These observations highlight the cross talk between the HIV-1 transcriptional machinery and cellular activation pathways. The review also discusses the proposed transcriptional regulation mechanisms that intersect with the pathways regulated by microRNAs and how development of the knowledge of chromatin biology has enhanced our understanding of key proteinâprotein and proteinâDNA interactions that form the HIV-1 transcriptome. Finally, we discuss the potential pharmacological approaches to target viral persistence and enhance effective transcription to purge the virus in cellular reservoirs, especially within the central nervous system, and the novel therapeutics that are currently in various stages of development to achieve a much superior prognosis for the HIV-1-infected population.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHIV infections 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3aantiretroviral agents 3acentral nervous system 3achromatin 3adevelopmental stages 3amicroRNA 3aprognosis 3aregulatory proteins 3atherapeutics 3atransactivators 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptome 3avirus replication 3aviruses1 aNonnemacher, Michael R.1 aWigdahl, Brian0 tJournal of general virology.g2012 June, v. 93, no.

(Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is an invasive pest in North America and its geographical range is currently expanding across the Canadian prairies. Adults and larvae of S. lineatus feed upon the foliage and root nodules, respectively, of field pea, Pisum sativum L. (Fabales: Fabaceae), and may contribute to economic losses when population densities are high. Integrated pest management (IPM) programs that incorporate economic thresholds should be used to manage S. lineatus populations in a sustainable manner. The impact of nitrogen fertilizer on field pea yield and the relationships between adult weevil density and above- and below-ground damage and yield were investigated in southern Alberta, Canada using exclusion cages on field pea plots. In each cage, 32 field pea plants were exposed to weevil densities ranging from zero to one adult weevil per plant. Nitrogen-fertilized plants yielded 16% more than unfertilized plants. Nitrogen-fertilized plants had fewer root nodules than unfertilized plants, but fertilizer had no effect on foliar feeding by S. lineatus. Adult density affected foliar feeding damage, with increases in above-ground damage associated with increases in S. lineatus density. Adult density did not affect root nodule damage, larval density, foliar biomass or seed weight. Overall, these results indicate that terminal leaf damage may be used to estimate adult weevil density but cannot be used to predict larval density or yield loss. Further research is required to better understand the impact of larval damage on yield and determine if economic thresholds can be developed using data from large-scale production systems. 3aPisum sativum 3aSitona lineatus 3aadults 3abiomass 3acages 3acrop yield 3aeconomic threshold 3aintegrated pest management 3alarvae 3aleaves 3anitrogen fertilizers 3apeas 3apests 3apopulation density 3aprairies 3aproduction technology 3aroot nodules 2aAnimals 2aCrops, Agriculturalxeconomics 2aFemale 2aFertilizers 2aHerbivory 2aLarvaxphysiology 2aMale 2aNitrogenxpharmacology 2aPeasxeconomicsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aPlant Leavesxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aPlant Rootsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aPopulation Density 2aWeevilsxphysiology 3aAlberta 0aAlberta1 aCarcamo, H.A.1 aDosdall, L.M.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2011 Oct., v. 104, no. 5 p.1550-1560dEntomological Society of Americax0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/EC103923Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02309naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002600145245012800171300001600299500001900315520106800334592002801402650001701430650001501447650001201462650002001474650001101494650001001505650002201515650001701537650001501554650001301569650001801582653002201600653002001622653002201642773015901664856007901823852000901902655001201911IND60716779220221122233801.0201107e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071677922DNAL7 a10.18805/ajdfr.

Pre-puffing conditioning (salt infusion) makes brown rice more hygroscopic; therefore, long storage of preconditioned brown rice reduces the puffing quality. This study was conducted to estimate the shelf life of prepacked conditioned brown rice in a wrapped paper envelope with low-density polythene for its microwave puffing. Preconditioning of brown rice was carried out at optimized conditions, i.e., parboiling pressure (303 kPa) and time (14 min), preconditioning temperature (76.7°C), salt content (3.5% (w/w)), and pre-puffing moisture content (11.6% (wb)). These packets were stored at 38±2°C temperature and 90% relative humidity. Moisture sorption characteristics can be well described by Henderson's model. The shelf life of preconditioned brown rice was estimated 36 days by its puffing quality characteristic and found that moisture content of preconditioned brown rice reaches 15.27% (wb).  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3abrown rice 3ahygiene 3amilk production 3amodels 3apaper 3arelative humidity 3asalt content 3ashelf life 3asorption 3awater content 0aMicrowave puffing 0aPreconditioning 0aPuffed brown rice0 tJournal of dairying, foods & home sciences.g2019 Sept., v. 38, no. 3 p.231-236dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:2084x0976-05637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.18805/ajdfr.

Dust particles contain toxic metals, such as mercury (Hg), which can have harmful effects on the human health. In this study, to investigate the contamination level of Hg in the street dust in Ahvaz, 95 dust samples were collected from the pavements in the main streets. The concentration of Hg in the collected samples was determined by the atomic absorption method (ASS). The contamination level was estimated based on indicators such as contamination factor (Cf), enrichment factor (EF), geo-accumulation index (Igeo) and ecological risk index (Er). The concentration value of mercury ranged from 0.02 to 8.75 mg/kg with an average of 2.53 mg/kg. The results of pollution indicators showed that the level of Hg contamination in the street dust of Ahvaz was a high level of contamination. In addition, the results of ecological risk assessment indicated that the ecological risk of Hg in the study area was very high. Spatial distribution pattern of Hg concentration showed that in areas with high population density, high traffic volume and industrial activities, there was a high pollution level of Hg.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabsorption 3adust 3aenvironmental assessment 3ahuman health 3amercury 3apollution 3apopulation density 3arisk 3atoxicity 3atraffic 0amercury 0astreet dust 0acontamination factor 0aenrichment factor 0aecological risk1 aGHanavati, N.1 aNazarpour, A.0 t̒Ulūm-i āb va khāk.g2018 Nov., v. 22, no. 3 p.249-259dIsfahan University of TechnologywJournal:27871x2476-55547nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02135naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003000152245008600182300001400268520077600282592002801058650002001086650002401106650002301130650001001153650001001163650002001173650002301193653002201216653001301238653002501251653002501276653000801301653002701309653001501336653002301351700001901374700005601393700002001449700001701469773010801486856008601594852000901680655001201689IND60636401020221118044345.0190408e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063640102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodqual.2018.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEdenbrandt, Anna Kristina10aConsumer acceptance of cisgenic food and the impact of information and status quo  ap. 44-52.  aGenetically Modified (GM) foods have been a debated topic for decades, and consumer concerns are widespread. Scientific proposals to increase consumer acceptance include the use of cisgenics, where GM technology is used but the inserted gene(s) originates from closely related organisms. Results from a choice experiment display greater willingness to pay (WTP) for cisgenics than transgenics, although traditional methods are preferred, and more accessible information about the technologies increases acceptance. The disutility from cisgenics and transgenics is offset by the utility from product quality improvement related to eating experience, indicating potential demand for cisgenic food, provided it improves the product in aspects of importance to the consumers.  aPublisher supplied data 3acisgenic plants 3aconsumer acceptance 3aconsumer attitudes 3afoods 3agenes 3aproduct quality 3awillingness to pay 0aChoice experiment 0aCisgenic 0aConsumer preferences 0aGenetically modified 0aGMO 0aRandom parameter logit 0aTransgenic 0aWillingness to pay1 aHouse, Lisa A.1 aGao, Zhifeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2984-82781 aOlmstead, Mercy1 aGray, Dennis0 tFood quality and preference.g2018 Oct., v. 69 p.44-52dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46499x0950-32937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodqual.2018.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03043naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006000140245005300200300001800253500002000271520162100291592002801912596006901940650002802009650001302037650001502050650001202065650001102077650002502088650001202113650001102125650001902136650001802155650001702173650001502190650001402205650001502219650001602234700002202250700002002272700002402292700002202316700002002338773011902358856007502477852000902552655001202561IND60786330720221116221922.0220803e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078633072DNAL7 a10.1002/agj2.204152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdams, Curtis B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5562-345410aGrowth stages and developmental patterns of guar  ap. 4990-5001.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aGuar [Cyamopsis tetragonoloba (L.) Taub.], also known as clusterbean, is a crop plant grown in semi‐arid regions worldwide for the galactomannan gum of its seed, and as a forage, vegetable, and green manure. Despite the importance of guar and its products, uniform growth stage descriptions have not been established for the crop. Such descriptions allow for improved documentation and communication of the growth and phenological development of crops by researchers, producers, and others. Following models of other warm‐season, indeterminant‐growth legumes, such a system was developed for guar based on visually observable and sequential vegetative (V) and reproductive (R) plant events. The system was evaluated in two locations in dryland and irrigated conditions, using three morphologically contrasting guar varieties. The V stages begin with emergence (VE) and then are determined by counting the nodes on the main stem of the plant, with the cotyledonary node as zero [V0 to V(N)]. The R stages include R1 (First Flower), R2 (First Pod), R3 (First Seed or Full Pod), R4 (Full Seed), R5 (First Maturity), R6 (50% Maturity), and R7 (Harvest Maturity). The V and R stages may be reported alone or concurrently and applied at plant or crop scales. The stage descriptions apply to all growth morphologies of guar (i.e., branched and non‐branched) and accommodate the indeterminant growth habit of the plant. Season‐long data is reported from field studies on crop V and R stage progression, as well as data on crop growth, including biomass component partitioning, productivity, and canopy development.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018‐67019‐27873cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture 3aCyamopsis tetragonoloba 3aagronomy 3aarid lands 3abiomass 3acanopy 3adevelopmental stages 3aflowers 3aforage 3agalactomannans 3agreen manures 3agrowth habit 3airrigation 3aphenology 3avegetables 3awarm season1 aBoote, Kenneth J.1 aShrestha, Rajan1 aMacMillan, Jennifer1 aHinson, Philip O.1 aTrostle, Calvin0 tAgronomy journal.g2020 Nov., v. 112, no. 6 p.4990-5001dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/agj2.204153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03856naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003900135040001800174100002000192245020700212300001800419506007600437520221100513592002802724506003702752650001702789650002002806650001202826650001702838650001502855650001502870650003402885650001302919651001202932651001002944651001402954651001202968651001202980651001102992653001603003653001903019653003603038653001103074700001703085700001603102700002503118773010003143856008603243852000903329655001203338IND60610247820221207104716.0200717e20180905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061024782DNAL7 aPMC61434772pmcid7 a300761032pmid7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.07.0632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoward, Natasha14aThe role of National Immunisation Technical Advisory Groups (NITAGs) in strengthening national vaccine decision-making: A comparative case study of Armenia, Ghana, Indonesia, Nigeria, Senegal and Uganda  ap. 5536-5543.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aImproving evidence informed decision-making in immunisation is a global health priority and many low and middle-income countries have established National Immunisation Technical Advisory Groups (NITAGs) as independent technical advisory bodies for this purpose. NITAG development and strengthening has received financial and technical support over the past decade, but relatively little evaluation. This study examined NITAGs in six low and middle-income countries (i.e. Armenia, Ghana, Indonesia, Nigeria, Senegal, Uganda), to examine functionality, quality of recommendation development, and integration with national decision-making bodies and processes.A mixed-method case-series design, used semi-structured interviews, NITAG meeting observations, and document review. Data were analysed thematically.Five NITAGs had been legally established with terms of reference and appeared well functioning, with Ghana’s in development. All NITAGs had standard operating procedures and nomination procedures to ensure a range of expertise, generally comprising 10–15 core, 1–5 secretariat, and several ex-officio members. Aside from economics, NITAGs reported a wide range of member expertise. Newer NITAGs had particular concerns about funding. Four used formal conflict of interest procedures, although some commented that implications were not always understood. NITAGs valued local data, and limited evidence suggested NITAG presence might reinforce data production through surveillance and local research studies. All observed meetings demonstrated due process and evidence-based decision-making processes were generally followed, with a critical role played by working-group data syntheses and assessments. NITAGs were seen as well integrated with ministry of health (MoH) decision-making and MoH interviewees were positive about NITAG contributions, indicating NITAGs had an important role. Collaboration with other bodies was more limited, but mitigated by NITAG members’ cross-membership in other bodies.NITAGs have an important and valued role within national immunisation decision-making. However, their position remains insecure, with the need for sustainable technical and financial support.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acase studies 3adecision making 3afunding 3aimmunization 3ainterviews 3amonitoring 3astandard operating procedures 3avaccines 3aArmenia 3aGhana 3aIndonesia 3aNigeria 3aSenegal 3aUganda 0aVaccination 0aVaccine policy 0aLow and middle-income countries 0aNITAGs1 aWalls, Helen1 aBell, Sadie1 aMounier-Jack, Sandra0 tVaccine.g2018 Sept. 05, v. 36, no. 37 p.5536-5543dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.07.0633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02480naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245010500172520121700277592002801494650002201522650001501544650001401559650001201573650002401585650001601609650002701625650001701652650002301669650001401692650002101706650001501727650001301742653001401755653001701769653002201786653002101808700002101829773011301850856008601963852000902049655001202058IND60745236720221119090743.0210911e20211001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074523672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1283782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Arashdeep10aConceptualization and techno-economic evaluation of microgrid based on PV/Biomass in Indian scenario  aIn many countries, the farmers find open burning is the cheapest and easiest way for removing large loads of the produced rice straw causing environmental pollution. So, finding a sustainable rice straw management system is need of the hour. In modern hybrid electricity generation systems, the use of rice straw on priority is not evaluated yet. To satisfy this need, this article proposes conceptualization and techno-economic evaluation of a small-scale rice straw based microgrid that processes the surplus rice straw of a village having 250 houses and 900 acres of cultivated land for power generation. The system is capable to process the 1128 tonne/year of ¹surplus rice straw and meet the electrical load demand of the same village. The gasification technique is used to process the rice straw, which is further integrated with solar, battery and the utility grid. The optimum size of the microgrid is found using artificial bee colony algorithm. The economic evaluation of the proposed microgrid is organized on the basis of net present cost, annualized system cost and levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). The LCOE of the proposed system is found to be acceptable which is 6.70 INR/kWh (0.089 $/kWh).  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aalgorithms 3abatteries 3abiomass 3aeconomic evaluation 3aelectricity 3aelectricity generation 3agasification 3amanagement systems 3apollution 3apower generation 3arice straw 3avillages 0aMicrogrid 0aOptimization 0aEconomic analysis 0aRenewable energy1 aBasak, Prasenjit0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Oct. 01, v. 317 p.128378-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1283783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04254naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006800150245020000218300001600418520217700434592002802611650001802639650001802657650001802675650001102693650002002704650002902724650001302753650002902766650001002795650001302805650001402818650001902832650001502851650001002866650001402876650001402890650002402904650000902928650001802937650001002955650001502965650002502980651001203005653000903017653000803026653001203034653001203046653000803058653000903066653000803075653002503083653002403108653001703132653002103149700002403170700002903194700002703223700003003250700006203280700002803342773009303370856008403463852000903547655001203556IND60766144820221121153639.0220207s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076614482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxrep.2022.01.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkeagu, Okechukwu Martin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2050-393810aBioaccumulation of organochlorine pesticides in the parasite Cosmocerca sp.

The use of agrochemicals such as organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) among the several health and ecological challenges it causes, the sharp amphibian population decline is most pressing. Toad specimens Amietophrynus regularis were sampled from three (3) selected areas; each comprising of natural habitat and dumpsites within Lagos metropolis. The congeners of organochlorine pesticides were tested in the liver, intestine, and parasite (Cosmocerca sp.) of the toads and soil samples from the respective locations using gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC–MS). Histopathological analyses were conducted on the intestines and liver of the toads using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain and then examined under the binocular dissecting microscope. The concentration of aldrin in the intestine of A. regularis sampled at the dumpsites was higher than the concentrations in the intestines of A. regularis in the natural habitat. The concentrations of dieldrin in the uninfected A. regularis at both dumpsite and natural habitat were higher than the concentrations in the infected A. regularis at both environments. This indicated that the parasite Cosmocerca sp. may have played a depurative role in sequestering the concentration of dieldrin in the toads irrespective of the location. The parasites exhibited marked sequestration capacity characterized by the notably high total bioaccumulation rate both in the liver and the intestine at the dumpsite. The stunted villi being the common histological alteration in the infected and uninfected toads at the dumpsite but missing in the uninfected counterparts at the natural habitat may be attributed to the differences in the background concentration of the OCP congeners. The parasite- Cosmocerca sp. has been shown to be a potential tool in the biomonitoring of these OCP congeners which persists in the environment. Continuous research on these congeners is a searchlight to checkmate the environment to see how compliant industries and the consumers are in terms of regulation of these chemicals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmietophrynus 3aCosmocercidae 3aagrochemicals 3aaldrin 3abioaccumulation 3achlorinated hydrocarbons 3adieldrin 3aenvironmental monitoring 3aeosin 3ahabitats 3ahistology 3ahistopathology 3aintestines 3aliver 3aparasites 3apollution 3apopulation dynamics 3asoil 3aspectrometers 3atoads 3atoxicology 3awaste disposal sites 3aNigeria 0aOCPs 0aEPA 0ap,p-DDE 0ao,p-DDD 0aDPX 0aMSDS 0aSRM 0aDepurative potential 0aEnvironmental media 0aInsecticides 0aLagos metropolis1 aAkinsanya, Bamidele1 aIsibor, Patrick Omoregie1 aDaniel-Rugu, Josephine1 aOnadeko, Abiodun Benedict1 aYalwaji, Babangida1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2050-39381 aAdekoya, Khalid Olajide0 tToxicology reports.g2022, v. 9 p.136-146dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23254x2214-75007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxrep.2022.01.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01949naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245006600165520050100231592002800732650002100760650002200781650002300803650002100826650002800847650001700875653002100892653001700913653001600930653001300946700002700959700001800986700002101004700002901025700002101054700002601075700002201101700001901123700002301142700001801165700001701183700001701200700002101217700002101238773010201259856008501361852000901446655001201455IND60768753120221119020238.0220328e20220316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076875312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2022.1536962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMann, Greg10aBiocatalytic assembly of chemically modified oligonucleotides  aWith renewed interest in therapeutic oligonucleotides, and at the same time the pharmaceutical industry set itself ambitious sustainability goals, there is a strong interest to investigate next-generation synthesis methods for these highly modified oligonucleotides.

To deal with this issue, a sustainable ECC was designed using rice husk ash to partially replace cement up to 40%. Experimental results presented that the compressive strength of the newly designed ECC at 28 days increased from 80 MPa to 111 MPa in spite of diminished cement content. Furthermore, the tensile strain capacity of ECCs increased significantly by forming more micro-cracks as the cement replacement ratios increased. As a side effect, it also reduced the tensile strength of ECCs, which is nevertheless greater than that of conventional C90/105 concrete. At micro-scale, incorporating RHA into ECCs lowered the matrix toughness, yet just reduced the matrix/fiber interfacial bond slightly, as a result, increased PSH index, which well agrees the enhancement of strain capacity of ECCs at composite level. The current results are expected to guide the design of high strength ECC with efficient cement use, and make ECC more sustainable.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3acarbon dioxide 3acement 3acompression strength 3aconcrete 3ahusk ash 3atensile strength 0aEngineered cementitious composites 0aRice husk ash 0aMechanical properties 0aInterface1 aLiu, Siyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4700-37731 aYang, Fan1 aWeng, Yiwei1 aQian, Shunzhi0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Oct. 01, v. 317 p.128379-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1283793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02714naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001500149245013900164300001800303500001500321520115600336592002801492650001301520650001701533650002501550650001201575650002001587650002201607650001601629650001401645650001701659650001401676650001501690650001101705650002101716650002001737650002401757650001601781650001801797650001101815650001001826650001301836650001801849650001701867653001901884700001501903700001801918700001301936700001601949773010101965856008502066852000902151655001202160IND4459905220221120220733.0141111e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445990522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2011.04.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Qiuhui10aEffect of nanocomposite-based packaging on postharvest quality of ethylene-treated kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa) during cold storage  ap. 1589-1596.  a2019-12-06  aA novel nanocomposite-based packaging (NCP) was prepared by blending polyethylene (PE) with nano-Ag, nano-TiOâ and montmorillonite. The effects of NCP on the quality parameters of ethylene-treated mature kiwifruit were investigated during the 42d of storage at 4Â°C. The results showed that adding nanoparticles to the PE significantly decreased the oxygen, water vapor permeability and longitudinal strength, and inhibited spore germination. The weight loss, softening, color variation and soluble solid content of kiwifruit were significantly inhibited by 22.67%, 124.84%, 23.46% and 14.42% respectively, which indicated that NCP could delay the ripening of kiwifruit. However, ascorbic acid and total phenols contents in NCP-treated fruit were increased compared with the controls. Additionally, kiwifruit in NCP exhibited 57.44% lower headspace ethylene concentration, 29.44% for malondialdehyde (MDA), lower polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity and higher peroxidase (POD) activity than the controls. These results suggest that NCP may be a useful technique to reduce fruit decay and maintain quality in kiwifruits during postharvest storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aethylene 3acold storage 3atotal soluble solids 3aphenols 3amontmorillonite 3aspore germination 3awater vapor 3apackaging 3apolyethylene 3akiwifruit 3aperoxidase 3aoxygen 3acatechol oxidase 3astorage quality 3aActinidia deliciosa 3aweight loss 3aascorbic acid 3afruits 3acolor 3aripening 3ananoparticles 3apermeability 0asoluble solids1 aFang, Yong1 aYang, Yanting1 aMa, Ning1 aZhao, Liyan0 tFood research international.g2011 July, v. 44, no. 6 p.1589-1596dElsevier Ltdx0963-99697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2011.04.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03225naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245017200170520162500342592002801967650002601995650002602021650001802047650001002065650001002075650001402085650001802099650003702117650001502154650001702169650002902186650001402215650001902229650001602248650002202264650001502286651001102301653002602312653001702338653001102355653002302366653001802389653002502407700001502432700001902447700001602466700002902482773008802511856008702599852000902686655001202695IND60684253920221116152312.0200427e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068425392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anaerobe.2020.1021672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLachowicz, D.10aSurveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities reveals high proportions of multidrug resistance in toxigenic Clostridium difficile strains in different areas of Poland  aTwo hundred and fifty-three non-duplicate toxigenic Clostridium difficile isolates, collected from February 2012 to December 2014, were evaluated for phenotypic resistance to ten antimicrobial drugs with the E-test gradient diffusion method. All strains of C. difficile were susceptible to metronidazole, vancomycin, and tigecycline. The metronidazole MIC values of the hyperepidemic PCR-ribotypes RT027 and RT176 were higher than those of non-epidemic PCR-ribotypes (p < 0.05, as evidenced by Mann-Whitney U test). In contrast, vancomycin susceptibility did not differ between hyperepidemic and non-epidemic strains, although the difference was almost significant (p = 0.065). Clostridium difficile RT027 and RT176 isolates could be assessed to five and four different susceptibility patterns, respectively, representing various combinations of resistance to different antimicrobial classes. A single point mutation (Thr82Ile) in the gyrA gene was detected in 11 (78.6%) of 14 isolates with high level of resistance to ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin and four different types of single point mutations (Arg447Lys, Ser416Ala, Asp426Val, Asp426Asn) in the gyrB gene were detected in 4 strains, also with high level of resistance to ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin. Four different point mutations were detected in the rpoB gene in 21 rifampicin-resistant strains of which one has not been reported previously, Gln489Leu. This study demonstrates the presence of multidrug-resistant C. difficile strains in Polish hospitals over the study period, irrespective of geographical location or reference level of the hospital.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium difficile 3aantibiotic resistance 3aciprofloxacin 3adrugs 3agenes 3ahospitals 3ametronidazole 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3amonitoring 3amoxifloxacin 3amultiple drug resistance 3aphenotype 3apoint mutation 3atigecycline 3atoxigenic strains 3avancomycin 3aPoland 0aClostridium difficile 0aEpidemiology 0aPoland 0aMulti-center study 0aPCR-Ribotypes 0aMultidrug resistance1 aPituch, H.1 aWultańska, D.1 aKuijper, E.1 aObuch-Woszczatyński, P.0 tAnaerobe.g2020 Apr., v. 62 p.102167-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12008x1075-99647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anaerobe.2020.1021673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03546naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245008300178300001800261520198900279592002802268650002702296650001402323650001302337650001402350650001402364650002602378650002302404650001202427650001902439650003102458650001802489650001402507651001002521653002202531653003202553653001702585653001302602653001402615653001602629653000802645653000802653653000902661653000802670653000802678653000802686700001902694700002702713700001902740700002602759773010002785856008602885852000902971655001202980IND60610248020221120124003.0200717e20180905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061024802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.07.0662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYeung, Karene Hoi Ting10aIncreasing influenza vaccine uptake in children: A randomised controlled trial  ap. 5524-5535.  aInfluenza vaccine is not included in the Hong Kong Government’s universal Childhood Immunisation Programme but eligible children can receive subsidised vaccine through the private sector using the Vaccination Subsidy Scheme (VSS). This study examined whether a simple intervention package can increase influenza vaccine uptake in Hong Kong children.Two study samples were enrolled: families of children who had participated in a previous knowledge, attitudes and practices study; and mother-infant pairs recruited from postnatal wards. Control groups received publicly available leaflets about VSS. Intervention groups additionally received: (1) a concise information sheet about influenza and its vaccine; (2) semi-completed forms to utilise the subsidy; (3) contacts of VSS clinics that did not charge above the subsidy; and (4) text message reminders for vaccination. Enrolled mothers were contacted when children were approximately 1 and 2 years old to determine influenza vaccination status of the families and their plan to vaccinate their children. Mothers’ attitudes towards influenza vaccine were assessed at enrolment and at the end of the study.A total of 833 eligible mother-infant pairs were enrolled from the two samples. The intervention package improved influenza vaccine uptake by 22% at one year and 25% at two years of age. Maternal influenza vaccine uptake in intervention group was higher during this two-year period in those who had never been previously vaccinated. Mothers’ self-efficacy regarding the use of influenza vaccine in her child i.e. belief and confidence in her own ability to make a good decision, was also improved with the intervention.A four-component intervention package could improve influenza vaccine uptake in Hong Kong children and their mothers during the first two years of life and depending on vaccine effectiveness could potentially reduce influenza-associated hospital admissions in children below 2 years old by 13–24%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3achildhood 3achildren 3ahospitals 3ainfluenza 3ainfluenza vaccination 3ainfluenza vaccines 3amothers 3aprivate sector 3arandomized clinical trials 3aself-efficacy 3asubsidies 3aChina 0aInfluenza vaccine 0aRandomised controlled trial 0aIntervention 0aReminder 0aHong Kong 0aPaediatrics 0aCHP 0aCIP 0aMCHC 0aRCT 0aUCN 0aVSS1 aTarrant, Marie1 aChan, Kate Ching Ching1 aTam, Wing Hung1 aNelson, E.

In this study, we investigated the effect of melatonin on the regulation of pesticide degradation and antioxidant nutrient accumulation in jujube fruit after storage. The results showed that melatonin treatment markedly promoted the degradation of three different types of pesticide (chlorothalonil, malathion, and glyphosate) in postharvest jujube fruit. However, this melatonin-enhanced pesticide degradation was greatly reduced by p-chlorophenylalanine (a specific inhibitor of melatonin synthesis) and l-buthionine-sulfoximine (a specific inhibitor of glutathione). Furthermore, pesticide-induced glutathione and melatonin accumulation, coupled with increased glutathione reductase and glutathione S-transferase activities, was further enhanced by melatonin in jujube fruit after storage. Pesticide-delayed fruit senescence (evaluated by weight loss, decay incidence, and firmness) was also further enhanced by melatonin. Interestingly, pesticide-impaired ascorbic acid contents, total phenolics accumulation, and total antioxidant capacities (as evaluated by Fe³⁺ reducing power) recovered with melatonin treatment in postharvest jujube fruit. This study provides a new biodegradable method for pesticide removal and improves postharvest fruit quality in agronomic production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZiziphus 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3abiodegradability 3achlorothalonil 3afirmness 3afruit quality 3afruits 3aglutathione 3aglutathione transferase 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3aglyphosate 3amalathion 3amelatonin 3apesticide degradation 3apesticide residues 3aphenolic compounds 3atechnology 3aweight loss 0aAntioxidant nutrient 0aPesticide removal 0aPostharvest fruit1 aXia, Chunbo1 aTian, Shan1 aShi, Haojie0 tPostharvest biology and technology.g2021 Mar., v. 173 p.111419-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl47454x0925-52147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.postharvbio.2020.1114193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03242naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001800189245013000207300001400337506007600351520140300427592002801830506003701858650004001895650002401935650001401959650001301973650001501986650002202001650001402023650001402037650001202051650001402063650002602077650001702103650003302120650001902153650001902172653006202191653001602253653002502269653000902294700001502303700001302318700001402331700001402345700001402359700001802373700001502391700001502406700001502421773011202436856008302548852000902631655001202640IND60626429420221207103650.0190322e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062642942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2018.12.0052doi7 aPMC71118472pmcid7 a305832312pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Zhenhui10aEIF4A2 interacts with the membrane protein of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus and plays a role in virus replication  ap. 39-46.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTransmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) is enteropathogenic coronavirus that causes diarrhea in pigs, and is associated with high morbidity and mortality in sucking piglets. The TGEV membrane (M) protein is a decisive protein for the proliferation of viral proteins, and is associated with virus assembly and budding. To identify the cellular proteins that interact with the TGEV M protein, yeast two-hybrid screening was employed, and seven cellular proteins were identified M-binding partners. Using the GST pull-down approach and a CO-IP assay, the M protein was found to interact with porcine intestinal cells via eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4-alpha (EIF4A2), an essential component of the cellular translational machinery. Additionally, confocal microscopy revealed that EIF4A2 and M were colocalized in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, the function of EIF4A2 in intestinal cells during TGEV infection was examined. A knockdown of EIF4A2 by siRNA markedly decreased M protein proliferation and TGEV replication in target cells. Thus demonstrating that EIF4A2 plays a significant role in TGEV replication. The present study provides mechanistic insight into the interaction between the TGEV M protein and intestinal cells which contributes to the understanding of coronavirus replication and may be useful for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for TGEV infection.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aTransmissible gastroenteritis virus 3aconfocal microscopy 3acytoplasm 3adiarrhea 3aintestines 3amembrane proteins 3amorbidity 3amortality 3apiglets 3ascreening 3asmall interfering RNA 3atherapeutics 3atwo hybrid system techniques 3aviral proteins 3avirus assembly 0aEukaryotic translation initiation factor 4-alpha (EIF4A2) 0aInteraction 0aMembrane (M) protein 0aTGEV1 aYang, Yang1 aWang, Li1 aWang, Kai1 aRan, Ling1 aXie, Yilu1 aHuang, LeiShi1 aYang, Zhou1 aYuan, Peng1 aYu, Qiuhan0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2019 Apr., v. 123 p.39-46dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45491x0034-52887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2018.12.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01867naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245004100163300001600204500001900220520078600239592002801025650001201053650001201065650002001077650001001097650001301107650001301120650001701133653002101150653002401171653001401195653002101209700001601230773015901246856007901405852000901484655001201493IND60716779820221122223553.0201107e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071677982DNAL7 a10.18805/ajdfr.

Herein, we demonstrate both energy harvesting and storage devices such as piezoelectric nanogenerator (PNG) and piezo-supercapacitor (PSC) by enforcing coconut husk (CH) as a filler into the polymer separator. To begin with, the CH powder was immobilized into the polyvinyl difluoride (PVDF) matrix to improve its piezoelectric performance. Remarkably, the poled PNG with a 7 wt% of CH powder/ PVDF composition delivers an output of voltage of 14 V, a current of 50 nA, and a power density of 0.35 μW/cm² at 100 MΩ. This output performance is significant enough not only to charge commercial capacitors but also to power electronic devices. Further, the PVDF/CH piezoelectric separator was sandwiched between graphene electrodes to develop a supercapacitor. The device achieved a maximum power density of 1.316 mW/cm² and an energy density of 76.33 mJ/cm², which is significantly higher than other graphene/PVDF-based devices. The practical feasibility of PNG is demonstrated as a breathing pattern monitor, which is an effective way to tackle the SARS-CoV-2 virus health conditions. Thus, the presented investigation paves the way towards a circular economy and sustainability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3acircular economy 3acoir 3acost effectiveness 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3aenergy density 3agraphene 3agreenhouses 3apolymers 3atoxicity 3aviruses 0aPiezoelectric 0aNanogenerator 0aSupercapacitor 0aBio-waste 0aFlexible1 aHajra, Sugato1 aJadhav, Sagar1 aPanigrahi, Basanta Kumar1 aDubal, Deepak1 aKim, Hoe Joon0 tSustainable materials and technologies.g2022 July, v. 32 p.e00396-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23531x2214-99377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.susmat.2022.e003963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02897naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245008800164300001800252500002000270520153900290592002801829596005201857596004501909650002101954650001901975650001301994650002102007650002302028650001602051650002802067650001602095650002502111650001302136650000802149650001202157650001902169650000902188700006302197773011902260856007502379852000902454655001202463IND60786331120221116222110.0220803e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078633112DNAL7 a10.1002/agj2.204402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGreub, Kelsey L.

This study was established to assess the effect of cover crop species and N rate on the accumulation and partitioning of biomass and ¹⁵N fertilizer by cover crops produced under controlled environmental conditions. Cereal rye (Secale cereale) and tillage radish (Raphanus sativus) cover crops were grown in monoculture and in a blend under greenhouse conditions in two soils. Urea enriched with ¹⁵N (3.0 atom %) was applied to cover crops at rates of 0, 34, and 67 kg N ha⁻¹. Shoot dry matter production and N accumulation exceeded that of roots for both cover crops. Fertilizer‐N uptake increased as application rate increased, and the greatest overall recovery by the cover crops was 38% of the applied fertilizer‐N. Tillage radish shoot biomass nearly doubled that of cereal rye (1,585 kg ha⁻¹) when grown in monoculture in the Captina soil but cover crops stored similar quantities of total N in the shoots. Cover crops grown in monoculture in the Roxanna soil accumulated similar amounts of biomass and TN in the shoots; however, cereal rye root biomass was twice that of tillage radish (568 kg ha⁻¹) when 67 kg N ha⁻¹ was applied. Results from this study reflect the capacity for N sequestration by cover crops, which is largely determined by biomass production and N availability, and most of the captured N is translocated and stored in the shoots.  aPublisher supplied data  cArkansas Corn and Grain Sorghum Promotion Board  cArkansas Agricultural Experiment Station 3aRaphanus sativus 3aSecale cereale 3aagronomy 3aapplication rate 3abiomass production 3acover crops 3adry matter accumulation 3agreenhouses 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aradishes 3arye 3atillage 3atotal nitrogen 3aurea1 aRoberts, Trenton L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5558-72570 tAgronomy journal.g2020 Nov., v. 112, no. 6 p.5300-5311dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/agj2.204403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02855naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006000151245014000211520151900351592002801870650001801898650001101916650001301927650002001940650001901960650001001979650002601989650001402015653003002029653001702059653002602076653000802102653002302110700006802133700005902201773011402260856008602374852000902460655001202469IND60745237220221119090726.0210904e20210920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074523722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1283832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBianco, Isabella1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6608-308610aAnalysis of the environmental impacts of alkali-activated concrete produced with waste glass-derived silicate activator – A LCA study  aConcrete is responsible for a significant share of global GHG emissions, which can be mainly ascribed to the production of clinker. Alkali-activated concretes have been investigated in literature as a possible alternative, but the sustainability still appears reduced by the high embodied energy of chemicals typically used for the activation step. This paper investigates concrete belonging to strength classes 35, 50 and 70 MPa and produced with a silicate activator derived from waste glass (AABR). Through a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), the investigation aims to compare the AABR to Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) concrete and alkali-activated concrete produced with commercially available chemicals (AABC). The effects produced by the variations of some key parameters (impact allocation of precursors, energy mix, amount of activator in the concrete, distance of procurement of raw materials) over the total impact of the AABR are also investigated. Results show that the adoption of alkali-activated concretes instead of OPC concrete allows a significant reduction in environmental categories of global warming (averagely 64% reduction for AABC and 70% for AABR), acidification potential (averagely 23% for AABC and 35% for AABR), and terrestrial eutrophication (averagely 53% for AABC and 60% for AABR). In addition, the study evidenced that the use of waste glass-based activator allows a significant reduction in every environmental category when compared to the use of commercially available chemicals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3acement 3aconcrete 3aembodied energy 3aeutrophication 3aglass 3alife cycle assessment 3asilicates 0aAlkali-activated concrete 0aOPC concrete 0aWaste glass activator 0aLCA 0aImpacts comparison1 aAp Dafydd Tomos, Branwen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0734-37491 aVinai, Raffaele1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9506-15910 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Sept. 20, v. 316 p.128383-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1283833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02848naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245013100167520120900298592002801507650002101535650002701556650002901583650002601612650002501638650002201663650001001685650001601695650001201711650001901723650000901742650001301751650001801764650001101782650001301793650001601806653001601822653002801838653001701866653003301883653001601916700002001932700001801952700002401970700001601994700001802010700001702028700001902045700001702064773011902081856008502200852000902285655001202294IND60766145220221120152137.0220621e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076614522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.susmat.2022.e003972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEzati, Parya10aPreparation and characterization of B, S, and N-doped glucose carbon dots: Antibacterial, antifungal, and antioxidant activity  aCarbon dots are prepared using glucose as a carbon source (GCD) and doped with heteroatoms such as boron, sulfur, and nitrogen to enhance their functionality. FTIR and XPS results confirm doping of GCDs with heteroatoms, and their particle size is ~10 nm, as shown by TEM images. GCDs are very hydrophilic and stable in an aqueous solution, and nitrogen-doped GCD (NGCD) exhibits the highest polydispersity index of 0.274. The GCDs show excellent tunability of the PL emission with the variation in excitation wavelength. All the GCDs display excellent antioxidant function with the highest activity in the NGCD. The boron-doped GCD (BGCD) and sulfur-doped GCD (SGCD) exhibit more potent antibacterial activity against E. coli and Listeria monocytogenes. The NGCD is effective against both bacterial strains, showing the highest antibacterial activity. The NGCD exhibits potent antifungal activity against Ammophilus fumigatus, P. citrinum, C. albicans, and R. rubra, while the SGCD has a higher inhibitory effect on the growth of F. solani.

However, conventional nitrogen fertilizer has efficiency limitation from runoff, volatilization, and leaching. In this study, a novel nitrogen fertilizer, biochar based urea fertilizer (BUF), was prepared by the infiltration process of biochar and molten urea. The BUF was characterized in terms of ultimate analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results showed that the maximum N content reached 29.19% in the BUF. Molten urea was evenly distributed in BUF by infiltrating into the pores of biochar and forming small uniform size particles on the biochar surface. The addition reaction between C=O and molten urea switched to the deamination reaction of molten urea and −OH / −COOH on biochar surface when the infiltration temperature exceeded 150 °C, which resulted in the formation of different kinds of amides. Therefore the thermal decomposition temperature of BUF was lower than that of pure urea.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abiochar 3acrops 3adeamination 3aleaching 3anitrogen content 3arunoff 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3athermal degradation 3athermogravimetry 3aurea 3aurea fertilizers 3avolatilization 0aRH-Biochar 0aMolten urea 0aInfiltration mechanism 0aFertilizer1 aQi, Riying1 aWong, William M.

Macrophages from control horses were activated either with eIFNγ + lipolysaccharide (LPS) or eIL-4 to characterize M1- or M2-polarized AM gene expression, respectively and determine the response of polarized cells to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPS): LPS, zymosan, peptidoglycan and hay dust. Subsequently, gene expression was explored in AM of control horses and horses with SEA at pasture and after NC.M1 polarization increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL-8, IL-12p40), IL-10, and CD80. M2 polarization increased CD206 and down-regulated arginase-II and IL-10. Expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and CD80 in response to PAMPS was further increased by M1 pre-polarization whereas M2 pre-polarization down-regulated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and IL-10 but increased CD206. In horses with SEA, AMs had elevated expression of IL-10 both at pasture and after NC, but only after NC in control horses. CD206 expression increased in both groups during NC. At pasture, stimulation by PAMPS augmented expression of IL-8 and IL-10 in horses with SEA compared to control horses. NC eliminated this difference by selectively increasing expression of IL-10 in control horses. A fundamental shift in the macrophage phenotype in SEA is supported by consistently elevated production of IL-10. A similar non-canonical phenotype develops temporarily in control horses upon NC suggesting that AMs in horses with SEA have lost the ability to respond dynamically to environmental cues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasthma 3adust 3agene expression 3ahay 3ahorses 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-12 3ainterleukin-8 3amacrophages 3apastures 3apathogen-associated molecular patterns 3apeptidoglycans 3aphenotype 3astraw 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3azymosan 0aHorse 0aImmunology 0aPulmonary inflammation 0aSEA1 aMcCandless, E.E.1 aOlszewski, M.A.1 aRobinson, N.Edward0 tveterinary journal.g2020 Feb., v. 256 p.105436-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl55231x1090-02337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2020.1054363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03232naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245018600174300001600360520187600376592002802252653002702280653001302307653003202320653001902352653002502371653002102396653002402417653001102441700002202452700002402474700002102498700001902519700002402538700002002562700001802582700001902600773010702619856008702726852000902813655001202822IND60610248220221120123902.0180827e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061024822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2016.10.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrombez, Vincent10aBasin scale distribution of organic matter in marine fine-grained sedimentary rocks: Insight from sequence stratigraphy and multi-proxies analysis in the Montney and Doig Formations  ap. 382-401.  aThe occurrence of hydrocarbons in self-sourced reservoirs strongly depends on the concentration and maturity of organic matter in sediments. Therefore, understanding the distribution of organic heterogeneity at the time of deposition is key to reduce the risk in exploration and development of unconventional resources. This study focuses on the Lower and Middle Triassic Montney and Doig Formations (Alberta and British Columbia). Samples from outcrops, cores and cuttings were analyzed for organic content with a Rock-Eval VI and for major and trace element concentration using ICP-MS and ICP-AES techniques. The interpretation of the analysis results in relation with the stratigraphic architecture provides a mean to better understand the distribution of the organic heterogeneities and the variations of primary productivity, sedimentation rates and anoxia that control the development of source rocks.The key findings of this analysis are:- The basin-scale distribution of the organic matter suggests that the two major source-rock intervals of the Lower and Middle Triassic correspond to the sequence 3 (Spathian Montney unit) and to the transgressive systems tract of sequence 4 (Doig phosphate zone).- The dominant controls on organic matter accumulations vary through time. The Montney source-rock interval is interpreted to be associated with a major basin restriction triggering anoxia during a second-order falling stage of relative sea level. The organic accumulation of the Doig phosphate zone is interpreted as being controlled by a sharp decrease of the sedimentation rate, combined with an increase of the primary productivity.- The spatial and temporal variations of anoxia, primary productivity and dilution reflect the geodynamic evolution of the basin that ultimately controls the basin physiography as well as the sources of nutrient and sediments.  aPublisher supplied data 0aPetroleum source rocks 0aTriassic 0aMontney and Doig formations 0aOrganic matter 0aPrimary productivity 0aRedox conditions 0aSedimentation rates 0aCanada1 aBaudin, François1 aRohais, Sébastien,1 aRiquier, Laurent1 aEuzen, Tristan1 aPauthier, Stanislas1 aDucros, Mathieu1 aCaron, Benoit1 aVaisblat, Noga0 tMarine and petroleum geology.g2017 May, v. 83 p.382-401dElsevier LtdwJournal:26796x0264-81727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2016.10.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03622naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001900154245010500173300001600278520208800294592002802382650002202410650001102432650002002443650002502463650002502488650002902513650001202542650001602554650001002570650001102580650001302591650001102604650001902615650001602634650001402650650001802664650001602682650002502698651000902723653002502732653001602757653002102773653002202794653002202816653002902838700003202867773009502899856008902994852000903083655001203092IND60589643120221120162616.0201125e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058964312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.12.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoradi, Sohrab10aMulti-objective game theory model and fuzzy programing approach for sustainable watershed management  ap. 363-371.  aThis study was carried out with the aim of feasibility evaluation of the application of multi-objective game theory and fuzzy programing approaches for settling balance between economic development and environmental impact as well as to facilitate the respective decision-makings in Zemkan basin, west of Iran. The bi-objectives of multi-objective game theory and fuzzy programing approaches are minimizing the destructive effects on the environment (less erosion and sediments) and maximizing the economical incomes resulted from different land uses (more net present value). Satellite images were used for recognition of different land uses and the areas of these land use. In this study, the environmentalists and Zemkan basin users were selected as environmental and economical players, respectively. The results reveal that Nash bargaining solution, which is the result of the multi-objective game theory model, differs from Pareto optimalities, obtained through the classical multi-objective model. Nash bargaining solution offered more satisfactory solutions based on decision-makers’ priorities. In addition, the overall results showed that the results of fuzzy programming approach were very close to the results of the multi-objective game theory model. Therefore, in both methods, the decision variables of semi-closed forest, open forest, non-irrigated agricultural lands and barren rocky lands were eliminated and the ones of rural areas, urban areas, and water body remained unchanged. The innovation of multi-objective game theory and fuzzy programing approaches, which can be understood and interpreted well by decision makers, is setting a kind of balance between economic and environmental concerns in watershed management. The results also show that multi-objective game theory and fuzzy programing approaches can be applied to many other issues concerning the environmental management. The upcoming researches can concentrate on developing a third objective like social concerns and accordingly tri-objective games would be applied instead of bi-objective ones.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3abasins 3adecision making 3aeconomic development 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental management 3aforests 3agame theory 3agames 3aincome 3aland use 3amodels 3aremote sensing 3arural areas 3asediments 3asurface water 3aurban areas 3awatershed management 3aIran 0aWatershed management 0aGame theory 0aFuzzy programing 0aConflict analysis 0aPareto optimality 0aNash bargaining solution1 aMohammadi Limaei, Soleiman,0 tLand use policy.g2018 Feb., v. 71 p.363-371dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.12.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02910naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245009300163300002000256520152600276592002801802650001301830650001201843650001301855650001101868650001401879650001301893650001101906650002501917653002901942653001201971653001901983653003202002653003702034700002002071700001602091700001702107700001502124700001802139700001402157700005202171773014202223856007802365852000902443655001202452IND60707061420221119033109.0200812e20200717xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070706142DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c093552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Mingjing10aReducing Effective Mass for Advancing Thermoelectrics in Sb/Bi-Doped AgCrSe₂ Compounds  ap. 36347-36354.  aLiquid-like materials have attracted increasing attention, owing to their phonon–liquid electron–crystal feature. As a typical representative, the superionic conductor AgCrSe₂ is regarded as a promising thermoelectric for its intrinsic ultralow lattice thermal conductivity. The primary challenge for achieving high thermoelectric performance is to enhance the inferior electronic performance in AgCrSe₂ compounds. Thus, it is very significant to manipulate band effective mass to achieve a higher power factor. In this work, the Sb/Bi elements are doped at Cr sites in Ag₀.₉₇CrSe₂, i.e., Ag₀.₉₇Cr₁–ₓ(Sb/Bi)ₓSe₂, aiming at producing a better overlap of electron orbits between different atoms for sharpening the valence band and decreasing the effective mass. In comparison to pristine AgCrSe₂, a considerable improvement (>50%) in the power factor (∼387 μW m–¹ K–² at 750 K) is realized upon 3% Sb doping. The single parabolic band model clarifies that the decreased effective mass and optimized carrier concentration contribute to the enhanced electronic property. Furthermore, an ultralow lattice thermal conductivity (∼0.2 W m–¹ K–¹) is well-maintained for the sample with 3% Sb doping as a result of the nearly unchanged superionic conduction. Eventually, a high peak figure of merit zT (∼0.7 at 750 K) is obtained in Ag₀.₉₇Cr₀.₉₇Sb₀.₀₃Se₂. The current finding provides an excellent avenue for advancing thermoelectrics in AgCrSe₂ materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantimony 3abismuth 3achromium 3amodels 3aselenides 3aselenium 3asilver 3athermal conductivity 0athermoelectric materials 0aAgCrSe2 0aeffective mass 0asingle parabolic band model 0alow lattice thermal conductivity1 aChen, Bangxian,1 aGuo, Xuming1 aZhang, Fujie1 aZhong, Yan1 aLiu, Hangtian1 aKang, Bin1 aAng, Ran1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7229-96680 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 July 17, v. 12, no. 32 p.36347-36354dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c093553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03084naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245013300161300001600294520166400310592002801974650001302002650000802015650002202023650002302045650001602068650001002084650001502094650001002109650001802119650001702137650001102154650001302165650001302178650001002191650003102201700002202232700001902254700002802273700002002301700002702321700002202348700002102370773012802391856007402519852000902593655001202602IND60639944120221117164650.0190503e20170524xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063994412DNAL7 a10.1039/c7em00044h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKohlmeier, Vesta10aMulti-channel silicone rubber traps as denuders for gas–particle partitioning of aerosols from semi-volatile organic compounds  ap. 676-686.  aDuring many measurements it is important to account for possible changes in the gas–particle distribution of aerosols containing semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs). If denuders are combined with currently used personal air samplers, a simultaneous differential sampling of the gas and particle phase is possible. Here we analysed the transmission efficiency of denuders based on multi-channel silicone rubber traps (setup: 9 cm long glass liner (ID 4 mm), containing 22 parallel silicone rubber tubes (55 mm long, ID 0.3 mm, OD 0.5 mm)) with polystyrene latex (PSL) particles for different scenarios. n-Hexadecane, dimethyl phthalate and diethylene glycol gases were used to measure the time-dependent gas phase collection efficiency of a denuder. Additionally, the evaporation of n-hexadecane aerosol particles passing through the denuders was investigated. Our results showed high transmission efficiencies from 91 to 100% (variation coefficients 3.69–9.65%) for the denuders operated vertically at a flow rate of 0.5 l min⁻¹. With regard to the gas phase collection efficiency, nonpolar n-hexadecane gas was trapped with higher efficiency (87% after 22 h) than dimethyl phthalate gas (27% after 22 h), while for highly polar diethylene glycol the gas phase collection efficiency was 50% after 2 h. Regarding the evaporation of aerosol particles, smaller particles and lower flow rates led to higher particle volume reduction inside the denuders. In conclusion, the tested denuders are suitable for determining the gas–particle partitioning of SVOC aerosols of nonpolar substances and show above 90% transmission for all tested particle sizes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aair 3adiethylene glycol 3adimethyl phthalate 3aevaporation 3aglass 3ahexadecane 3alatex 3aparticle size 3apolystyrenes 3arubber 3asamplers 3asilicone 3atraps 3avolatile organic compounds1 aDragan, George C.1 aKarg, Erwin W.1 aSchnelle-Kreis, Jürgen1 aBreuer, Dietmar1 aForbes, Patricia B.

With different ways of land use, the organic carbon content of soil profiles and organic carbon density show the tendency of decreasing firstly and then increasing from top to bottom. With the increase of depth, the vertical difference becomes smaller first and then starts increasing. Land reclamation reduces the soil organic carbon content and density, changing its distribution structure in topsoil. The average content of organic carbon in Caohai wetlands are as follows: lake bed silt > marsh wetland > farmland > woodland, the average organic carbon content of lake bed silt, marsh wetland, farmland and woodland are 16.40, 2.94, 1.81 and 1.08 %, respectively. Land reclamation reduces the organic carbon content of soil, therefore the conversion of cultivated lands to wetlands and the increase of forest coverage will help to fix the organic carbon in soil and increase its reserves.  aPublisher supplied data 3amarshes 3aplateaus 3asoil profiles 3asoil organic carbon 3alakes 3aagricultural land 3atopsoil 3awoodlands 3aecosystems 3aland use 3asilt 3aforests 3aChina 0acarbon1 aWang, Fengyou1 aZhu, Sixi0 tJournal of forestry research.g2016 June, v. 27, no. 3 p.551-556dNortheast Forestry Universityx1007-662X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11676-015-0086-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02191naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245015300165300001600318520114000334592002801474650001801502650002201520651001101542651001601553653001301569653001601582653001201598653001001610653001301620700001801633773010801651856008501759852000901844655001201853IND60607431520221123025717.0180904e20161122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060743152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2015.11.1352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavid, E.,10aFirst insights into the identification of bone and antler tools used in the indirect percussion and pressure techniques during the early postglacial  ap. 123-142.  aWith the interest for the technological options that were taken by the prehistoric groups to subsist, there is a field of research left empty in terms of archaeological records dated to the 8th and 7th millennia cal BC. It concerns the tool kit made from bone and antler used in Europe by stone knappers to work the lithic raw material by pressure and indirect percussion. Based on morpho-technological aspects, this paper presents a first list of recognized archaeological osseous artefacts employed in indirect and pressure lithic reduction. These are punches, pectoral and shoulder sticks, as well as bone elements involved in the lever systems. This investigation is made in the frame of a larger research project aiming at discussing both origin and agent responsible for the introduction of the “inset technology”—conical core pressure blade concept together with the slotted bone tools—appearing in the southern Scandinavia at ca. 7300 cal BC. Results are promising and experiments enabling characterization of the bone and antler tools used in the debitage by pressure and indirect percussion will be soon undertaken.  aPublisher supplied data 3araw materials 3aresearch projects 3aEurope 3aScandinavia 0aKnapping 0aPostglacial 0aCrusher 0aPunch 0aUse wear1 aSørensen, M.0 tQuaternary international.g2016 Nov. 22, v. 423 p.123-142dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2015.11.1353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04075naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245014500168300001600313520228800329592002802617650001302645650001402658650002702672650002302699650001102722650001402733650001102747650001502758650001602773650001802789650000902807650002102816650002102837650001602858650001302874650001102887650001602898650001302914650001702927650001802944650001502962650001302977650001302990650001103003650001103014650001203025650002203037650001103059651001303070700001503083700001403098700001503112700001503127700001403142700002003156700001803176773010503194856008203299990002303381852000903404655001203413IND60097689520221119222036.0141104e20121020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009768952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecss.2012.07.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChícharo, M.A.10aAre tidal lagoons ecologically relevant to larval recruitment of small pelagic fish? An approach using nutritional condition and growth rate  ap. 265-279.  aThere are numerous studies dealing with larvae of Small Pelagic Fish (SPF), but only a few have actually addressed advanced larval phases. Temperate coastal lagoons are particularly understudied, due to the absence of standard method to capture advanced larval fish in these near shore shallow habitats. Accordingly, this study aims to describe abundances, nutritional condition and in situ growth of post-flexion (SPF) from the Ria Formosa, a tidal coastal lagoon in southern Portugal. The nutritional condition and in situ growth were determined through cohort analysis and standardized RNA:DNA ratio (sRD), complemented with feeding incidence (gut content) and fatty acids (FAs, trophic biomarkers) of postflexion larvae sampled sequentially with light traps, from spring 2005 to summer 2006. Simultaneously, environmental parameters such as water temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll a were measured. Post-larvae of SPF were captured through the year in important numbers. The dominant species were Sardina pilchardus (50.7%), Engraulis encrasicolus and Atherina presbyter (11.4%). These results are distinct from those based on adult/juvenile surveys or early planktonic phases in the Ria Formosa where clupeiformes were occasionally reported. Sardines were captured mainly in winter, spring and early summer and anchovies mainly during summer and autumn. Sand smelt, a resident species, was present throughout the year. In the early summer, the three species were present and during this period some diet overlapping occurred, the feeding incidence of the clupeiformes was very low, but atherinids always exhibited full guts reflecting the different gut morphology or indicating different life-cycle strategies. The bulk of the diet was mollusks, crustaceans and appendicularians, for sand smelts, sardines and anchovies, respectively. The results of FA analyses showed some contribution of phytoplankton to SPF in the area. All SPF exhibited higher condition (sRD) and growth rates in summer, which are explained by the adequate temperature and higher planktonic productivity. This is especially relevant because the successful development of postflexion larvae in these nursery areas largely determines the successful recruitment to adult fish populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAtherina 3aCrustacea 3aEngraulis encrasicolus 3aSardina pilchardus 3aadults 3aanchovies 3aautumn 3abiomarkers 3achlorophyll 3acoastal water 3adiet 3adigestive system 3adissolved oxygen 3afatty acids 3ahabitats 3alarvae 3alight traps 3amolluscs 3apelagic fish 3aphytoplankton 3apostlarvae 3asalinity 3asardines 3aspring 3asummer 3asurveys 3awater temperature 3awinter 3aPortugal1 aAmaral, A.1 aFaria, A.1 aMorais, P.1 aMendes, C.1 aPiló, D.1 aBen-Hamadou, R.1 aChícharo, L.0 tEstuarine, coastal and shelf science.g2012 Oct. 20, v. 112 p.265-279dElsevier Ltdx0272-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2012.07.0333Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03571naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001800112245009000130300001600220520213500236592002802371650004402399650001602443650001502459650001202474650002502486650001502511650001802526650001602544650002102560650001002581650001002591650001202601650002202613650003502635650001902670650002302689650001502712650000902727650002302736650001302759653002502772653001702797653002302814653001802837700002602855700001802881700002302899773012202922852000903044655001203053IND60559011720221122232252.0161122e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055901172DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLimb, Ryan F.10aSynthesis Paper: Assessment of Research on Rangeland Fire as a Management Practice☆  ap. 415-422.  aRangelands are fire-dependent ecosystems severely altered through direct fire suppression and fuels management. The removal of fire is a dominant cause of ecological sites moving across thresholds with the majority of North American rangelands currently showingmoderate or high departure from reference conditions. Recognizing the need to restore fire on rangelands and incorporate prescribed fire into management plans, the Natural Resource Conservation Service initiated the Conservation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP) to evaluate the validity current practices through peer-reviewed scientific literature. We updated the CEAP review and broadened the discussion of prescribed fire as a global management practice. We reviewed and summarized prescribed fire literature available through Web of Science using search terms in the title. The majority of literature (40%) evaluated plant responses to fire with fire behavior and management (29%), wildlife and arthropods (12%), soils (11%), and air quality (4%) evaluated less frequently. Generally, fire effects on plants are neutral to positive and the majority of negative responses lasted less than 2 years. Similarly, soil responses were recovered within 2 yr after burning. However, most studies did not report how long treatments were in place (62%) or the size of experimental units (52%). The experimental literature supporting prescribed burning is in need of greater managerial relevance that can be obtained by directly addressing spatial scale, temporal scale, and interaction with other disturbances, including drought and grazing. Reliance on information from single fires applied on small plots tracked for a relatively short time interval greatly constrains inferences and application to ecosystem management and information should be applied with caution. Therefore, conservation purposes need to incorporate temporal dynamics to the extent that this information is available. The complex interaction of scientific knowledge, social concerns, and variable policies across regions are major limitations to the successful and critical restoration of fire regimes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aConservation Effects Assessment Project 3aair quality 3aarthropods 3adrought 3aecosystem management 3aecosystems 3afire behavior 3afire regime 3afire suppression 3afires 3afuels 3agrazing 3aissues and policy 3anatural resources conservation 3aplant response 3aprescribed burning 3arangelands 3asoil 3atemporal variation 3awildlife 0aecosystem management 0afire effects 0aprescribed burning 0awildland fire1 aFuhlendorf, Samuel D.1 aEngle, D.

However, the breadth of practical applications of SERS has been severely limited because it is still a great challenge to achieve simultaneously a high sensitivity and a high reproducibility. Herein, we report a highly controllable method to fabricate periodic bowtie SERS substrates with a narrow nanogap, high SERS enhancement, and good uniformity over a large area. The periodic bowtie template is first fabricated over a gold film by holographic lithography (HL), followed by Au deposition to obtain a conductive plasmonic bowtie array. The gap size is then narrowed down by pulsed electrodeposition of Ag simultaneously monitored in situ by electrochemical dark field spectroscopy. Thus, we are able to observe the most sensitive change in the scattering spectra when the gap is just about to merge and obtain uniform SERS substrates with a gap size down to around 5 nm. The average enhancement factor of 5 × 10⁷ to 1 × 10⁸ is obtained, which is 50 times larger than that from Au nanoparticle-assembled substrates and 140 times larger than that from commercial Klarite chips. This substrate offers a promising opportunity for SERS practical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectroplating 3agold 3ananogold 3asilver 0ananogap 0aSERS substrate 0abowtie array 0aelectrodeposition 0adark field scattering spectroscopy1 aJiang, Shan1 aLuo, Songsong1 aLiu, Bo-Wen1 aHuang, Teng-Xiang1 aHu, Shu1 aZhu, Jinfeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3666-67631 aWang, Xiang1 aRen, Bin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9821-58640 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 July 20, v. 12, no. 32 p.36505-36512dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c093573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02945naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100004000154245003800194300001600232520172200248592002801970650001701998650001602015650002002031650003502051650002502086650001802111650002302129650001502152650001802167650001902185650002802204651001102232653001102243653001302254653002402267653001602291653002302307773009502330856008902425852000902514655001202523IND60589643420221121052049.0201125e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058964342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.12.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCandiotto, Luciano Zanetti Pessôa,10aOrganic products policy in Brazil  ap. 422-430.  aConsidering the environmental and social importance of organic food production and increased supply and demand for organic products in the world and in Brazil, the Brazilian Federal Government began a process of regulation of organic agriculture from 1999. In this sense, this article recovers the history of institutionalization of federal regulations pertaining to organic systems of agricultural production in the country, indicating relevant aspects and some changes during 17 years of evolution of this regulatory process. The methodology used was based on the analysis of 30 regulations regarding the organic production in Brazil, highlighting the four most relevant statutes (Normative Instruction 07 of 1999; Law 10,831 of 2003; Decree 6323 of 2007 and Decree 7792 of 2012). Papers were also used to discuss the relevance and the fundamentals of organic agriculture and agroecology; the Brazilian contradictions concerning agribusiness and sustainable agriculture; conflicts in the governmental sphere – highlighting positions of Ministry of Agriculture (MAPA) and Ministry of Agrarian Development (MDA) and in the relationships established between different actors and institutions, focusing on Brazilian literature. The results indicate that these rules have contributed to the institutional strengthening of organic agriculture and agroecology in Brazil. Nevertheless, the budgetary resources destined to this type of public policy are pitiful compared to those destined for conventional agriculture. Its indicates that although some important advances on organic agriculture and agroecology public policies, the Brazilian government continues prioritizing agribusiness, featured pesticides and GMO uses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagribusiness 3aagroecology 3afood production 3agenetically modified organisms 3alaws and regulations 3aorganic foods 3aorganic production 3apesticides 3apublic policy 3asupply balance 3asustainable agriculture 3aBrazil 0aBrazil 0aStatutes 0aOrganic agriculture 0aAgroecology 0aFederal government0 tLand use policy.g2018 Feb., v. 71 p.422-430dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.12.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03443naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006100144245008900205300002000294520178500314592002802099650001502127650001302142650002302155650002202178650001202200650001902212650001202231650002402243650001002267650001402277650001402291650000702305650001302312650001202325650001202337650002102349650001402370650001502384653002202399653002502421653002902446653001802475653001102493700001902504700002202523700001702545700002102562700001602583700001702599700002002616773014202636856007802778852000902856655001202865IND60707061620221119033049.0200812e20200714xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070706162DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c093622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkhrimenko, D.

If glass dissolution products are accumulated in a media, they can change the surface properties by specific adsorption. We determined the −OH surface concentration, reactivity, adsorption, and dissolution properties of aluminosilicate glasses containing various modifiers and compared the results with the behavior of complex mineral wool fibers. Using proton consumption and element release from batch surface titration experiments, over the range 5 < pH < 10, surface −OH adsorption properties were modeled with the FITEQL program. During titration, network modifiers in the glass subsurface are preferentially replaced by protons, resulting in cation accumulation in the solution and formation of a leached layer enriched with Si on the solid. The behavior of Al was different. At 5 < pH < 9, only very small amounts of Al were found in the leachates, which can be explained by almost complete Al adsorption as stable surface complexes, i.e. >XOAl(OH)₂ (where X = Si or Al and > represents the surface). At pH > 9, divalent cations adsorbed specifically, as >XOMe⁺ complexes (Me = Ca or Mg). This deeper understanding of the surface behavior of glasses and fibers is important for the design of composite materials, for applications in biology and medicine and in materials production in general, as well as for understanding natural processes, such as global uptake estimates of CO₂ during rock weathering.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aaluminum 3aaluminum silicates 3aaqueous solutions 3acalcium 3acarbon dioxide 3acations 3acomposite materials 3aglass 3aleachates 3amagnesium 3apH 3apolymers 3aprotons 3asilicon 3asynthetic fibers 3atitration 3aweathering 0asurface titration 0asurface complexation 0aglass corrosion behavior 0aglass surface 0afibers1 aNielsen, C.

Owing to their thermally insulating nature and often favorable binding of guest species, controlled desorption of the adsorbed molecules from such frameworks can be challenging and energy intensive. To find an energy efficient means for release of these gas molecules, here, we have made use of the heating effect of magnetic nanoparticles to achieve desorption using the Magnetic Induction Swing Adsorption (MISA) process. Magnetic nanoparticles when exposed to a high-frequency magnetic field, heat up instantly; and when present within a MOF, this localized heating is enough to drive the release of adsorbed molecules. Here Co-MOF-74 based Magnetic Framework Composites (MFCs), containing varying concentrations of Fe₃O₄ nanoparticles, were trialed for triggered oxygen capture. The greatest oxygen adsorption achieved by the prepared cobalt based MFCs was 4.8 mmol g⁻¹ at 1.2 bar, with a Type I adsorption isotherm. For the effective desorption was then triggered by exposure to a magnetic field, with 100% desorption of oxygen accomplished by MFC4, the MOF composite with 12.18 wt% Fe₃O₄ nanoparticles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acobalt 3acoordination polymers 3adesorption 3aenergy efficiency 3aheat 3airon oxides 3amagnetic fields 3ananoparticles 3aoxygen 3asorption isotherms1 aSadiq, M.

Using the contingent valuation (CV) method, this paper evaluates how much public support there would be in preventing further decline to maintain the current number of bees by estimating the willingness to pay (WTP) for a theoretical bee protection policy in the UK. We apply the CV method as an estimation of public perception and preferences for pollination services. The mean WTP to support the bee protection policy was approximately £43 per household per year. Based on the 30.6 million taxpayers in the UK, this is equivalent to £842 million per year. This value can provide a means of illustrating the total value of public support for maintaining pollination services to policy makers and stakeholders.  aPublisher supplied data 3abees 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3acontingent valuation 3aecosystem services 3ainvasive species 3aissues and policy 3aland use change 3aparasites 3apathogens 3apesticides 3apollinating insects 3apollination 3apublic opinion 3astakeholders 3awillingness to pay 3aUnited Kingdom 0aValuation 0aEcosystem services 0aBees 0aPollination 0aWillingness to pay1 aMarris, Gay C.1 aBrown, Mike1 aMacleod, Alan,1 aJones, Glyn1 aBudge, Giles E.0 tLand use policy.g2018 Feb., v. 71 p.355-362dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.11.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02505naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245007300165300001600238520142900254592002801683650001501711650001101726650001101737651001801748651001001766651001401776651001001790651002101800651001601821651002001837651001101857700001501868700001901883700001901902700001701921773011201938856004802050852000902098655001202107IND50089087620221118203441.0140427e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008908762DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-013-0983-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Ki-Seon10aInfluence of the Arctic Oscillation on the TC activity around Taiwan  ap. 695-706.  aThis study discovered that strong positive correlations exist between the frequency of tropical cyclones (TC) during the summer around Taiwan and the Arctic Oscillation (AO) during the preceding March to May period. In positive AO years, during the preceding spring to summer period, anomalous cyclone and anomalous anticyclone were strongly developed at low and middle latitudes, respectively. Because of such a distribution of pressure system, in Taiwan, Korea, and Japan during the positive AO years, anomalous southeasterlies, which play the role of anomalous steering flows in transferring TCs to these regions, were strengthened. On the other hand, in southern China and the Indochina Peninsula during the positive AO years, anomalous northwesterlies, which prevent the transfer of TCs to these regions, were strengthened. Moreover, such a distribution of pressure system strengthening during the positive AO years led TCs to occur, move, and recurve more eastward in the western North Pacific in positive AO years as compared with the negative AO years. Contrarily, during the negative AO years, TCs showed the tendency to pass over the South China Sea from the Philippines and move west toward southern China and the Indochina Peninsula. Eventually, the intensity of TCs in these years was lower than that of TCs in positive AO years due to the topographic effects from a high TC passage frequency in mainland China.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahurricanes 3aspring 3asummer 3aArctic region 3aChina 3aIndochina 3aJapan 3aKorean Peninsula 3aPhilippines 3aSouth China Sea 3aTaiwan1 aCha, Yu-Mi1 aKang, Sung-Dae1 aKim, Hae-dong,1 aKim, Baek-Jo0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2014 May, v. 116, no. 3-4 p.695-706dSpringer-Verlagx0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-013-0983-0  aDNAL 7aarticle01920naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013300164300001600297520092200313592002801235650001301263650001301276650001101289650001501300651001001315700001401325700001901339700001301358700001601371773011701387856008101504852000901585655001201594IND60519527820221120153118.0160503e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051952782DNAL7 a10.1007/s11676-015-0181-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Runhui10aGenotype × environmental interaction by AMMI and GGE biplot analysis for the provenances of Michelia chapensis in South China  ap. 659-664.  aA provenance trial of Michelia chapensis Dandy in the south of China was carried out in three sites to assess yield and stability analyses.

Analysis of historic precipitation extremes record may help in formulating mitigation strategies at local level. Eleven indices of precipitation extremes were evaluated using RClimDex and daily time series data for analysis period of 1981–2010 from five representative cities across Punjab province of Pakistan. The indices include consecutive dry days, consecutive wet days, number of days above daily average precipitation, number of days with precipitation ≥10 mm, number of days with precipitation ≥20 mm, very wet days, extremely wet days, simple daily intensity index, maximum 1-day precipitation quantity, maximum 5 consecutive day precipitation quantity, and annual total wet-day precipitation. Mann-Kendall test and Sen’s slope extremes were used to detect trends in indices. Droughts and excessive precipitation were dictated by elevation from mean sea level with prolonged dry spells in southern Punjab and vice versa confirming spatial trends for precipitation extremes. However, no temporal trend was observed for any of the indices. Summer in the region is the wettest season depicting contribution of monsoons during June through August toward devastating floods in the region.  aPublisher supplied data 3afloods 3amonsoon season 3asea level 3atime series analysis 3aPakistan1 aAshfaq, Ahmad,1 aSafeeq, Mohammad1 aAli, Shafaqat1 aSaleem, Farhan1 aHammad, Hafiz Mohkum1 aFarhad, Wajid0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2014 May, v. 116, no. 3-4 p.671-680dSpringer-Verlagx0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-013-0988-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04200naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002600144245009600170300001200266500001400278520308800292592002803380650001303408650001103421650001603432650001703448650000903465650001503474650001503489650002003504650001403524650001503538650001303553650001303566650001603579773013203595856007803727852000903805655001203814IND60696747920221119023417.0200529s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069674792DNAL7 a10.1139/apnm-2020-00932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPearcey, Gregory E.P.10aExploiting evolutionarily conserved pathways to promote plasticity of human spinal circuits  ap. 686.  aNAL-light  aHumans evolved from species that walked on all 4 limbs, which means that experiments in quadrupeds can guide and support experiments in humans. This is particularly helpful for neural rehabilitation because the central nervous system is plastic in nature, meaning that activities promoting central nervous system activity can alter subsequent output properties. This is known as neuroplasticity and can be measured as changes in spinal cord excitability through reflexes as a proxy. By targeting evolutionarily conserved pathways that act on similar interneurons within the spinal cord to either increase or decrease excitability, it may be possible to preferentially modulate spinal cord excitability based on a desirable outcome. For example, rhythmic movement reduces spinal cord excitability whereas brief sensory input to cutaneous afferents increases spinal cord excitability. Alterations in spinal cord excitability have been shown to outlast the activity duration, suggesting that neuroplasticity is not transient. This evidence suggests that both rhythmic movement and sensory input can induce acute neuroplasticity of spinal cord excitability. The overall purpose of this dissertation was 2-fold: (i) to provide reviews of how evolutionarily conserved pathways are studied in humans and how they contribute to human rhythmic movement; and (ii) experimentally examine how these conserved pathways, which converge onto similar interneuron circuitry, can be exploited to cause bidirectional changes in spinal cord excitability. Reviews indicate that humans have retained characteristics of quadrupedal locomotion and, in particular, activity of the arms affects the excitability of the legs, and vice versa. Cutaneous input is integrated throughout the body during locomotion, such that cutaneous sensations elicit neuromechanical responses that are nerve-specific and modulated according to the phase of movement. In experiment 1, there was increased spinal cord excitability following patterned stimulation of cutaneous afferents innervating the bottom of the foot. In experiment 2, stimulation to cutaneous afferents innervating both the top and bottom of the foot amplified voluntary plantar- and dorsiflexion. In experiment 3, cervicolumbar connections were exploited to amplify plasticity in spinal cord excitability induced by rhythmic movement. Finally, in experiment 4, there were interactions of rhythmic movement and fatigue, which both reduce spinal cord excitability, with cutaneous stimulation, which increases spinal cord excitability, such that reductions in spinal cord excitability associated with fatigue were mitigated by cutaneous stimulation. Taken together, these experiments suggest that cutaneous stimulation can increase spinal cord excitability, whereas quadrupedal locomotor activity can decrease spinal cord excitability. These conserved pathways can be exploited to intentionally modify spinal cord excitability in a bidirectional fashion, which provides fruitful information for the exploration of rehabilitation and sport performance practices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aduration 3ahumans 3ainformation 3ainterneurons 3alegs 3alocomotion 3ametabolism 3aneuroplasticity 3anutrition 3aplasticity 3aplastics 3areflexes 3aspinal cord0 tApplied physiology, nutrition and metabolism.g2020, v. 45, no. 6 p.686-686dNRC Research PresswJournal:23115x1715-53207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/apnm-2020-00933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03353naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245009100170300001400261520185600275592002802131650001102159650002202170650001102192650001102203650000902214650001102223650001402234650001902248650001402267650001502281650001302296650001902309650002502328650001102353650001302364650001102377650002002388650002302408650001102431650002302442650001102465651001002476700001902486700001902505700001702524700002202541700001902563773010302582856008202685990002302767852000902790655001202799IND60097690320221123034709.0141104e20121020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009769032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecss.2011.11.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAntonio, Emily S.10aSpatial-temporal feeding dynamics of benthic communities in an estuary-marine gradient  ap. 86-97.  aWe investigated the fluctuations of carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios in benthic consumers and their potential food sources to determine the spatial and temporal variations in the utilization of available organic matter, indicating the origin and pathways of energy from Yura Estuary to Tango Sea, Japan. Field samplings were conducted from the upper estuary to offshore with sampling frequency of twice per season from April (spring) 2006 to February (winter) 2007. The δ¹³C signatures of the upper and lower estuary benthos showed depleted and in wide range (−28.9‰ to −13.5‰) compared to the enriched and within narrow range signatures of marine benthos (−20.6‰ to −14.0‰) in all seasons. On the contrary, the δ¹⁵N signatures of benthic communities showed decreasing trend seaward and summer values were different from the other seasons. Using the dual isotope and multisource mixing models, we estimated the relative contributions of potential food sources to the benthos diet. River POM played an important source of energy for the estuarine benthos, especially in winter when river discharge was high. Marine POM served as an important alternative food for the estuarine benthos from spring to autumn when seawater intruded the bottom estuary. Benthic microalgae were the major food source at the shallow coast throughout the year, while marine POM fueled the deep coast and offshore benthic food webs. Spatial and temporal feeding variations in estuarine benthic communities were driven by the hydrology of the estuary, whereas primary production and transport of food source dictated diet variations of marine benthic communities. The elucidation of the dynamic energy subsidy among aquatic systems highlights the importance of the land–sea transition zones that is crucial for benthic secondary productions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautumn 3abenthic organisms 3acarbon 3acoasts 3adiet 3aenergy 3aestuaries 3afood transport 3afood webs 3amicroalgae 3anitrogen 3aorganic matter 3aprimary productivity 3arivers 3aseawater 3aspring 3astable isotopes 3astatistical models 3asummer 3atemporal variation 3awinter 3aJapan1 aKasai, Akihide1 aUeno, Masahiro1 aIshihi, Yuka1 aYokoyama, Hisashi1 aYamashita, Yoh0 tEstuarine, coastal and shelf science.g2012 Oct. 20, v. 112 p.86-97dElsevier Ltdx0272-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2011.11.0173Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03228naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245009400170300001600264520198700280592002802267650001002295650001102305650001102316650002002327650000902347650001702356650001202373650001502385650001902400650001402419651001102433653001902444653001302463653001402476653001602490653001202506700002502518700001802543700001802561773010902579856008502688852000902773655001202782IND60607432320221120024024.0180904e20160901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060743232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2015.12.0792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuntz, Delphine14aThe exploitation of ungulates in the Magdalenian in the Entre-Deux-Mers (Gironde, France)  ap. 135-158.  aThis paper presents an overview of unpublished or recent data obtained from taphonomic and zooarchaeological studies carried out on several Magdalenian osseous assemblages in the Gironde, most of which were performed or updated as part of the Magdatis project. These assemblages have been attributed to techno-complexes from the Lower Magdalenian (Saint-Germain-la-Rivière lower complex), Middle Magdalenian (Roc de Marcamps 2, Moulin-Neuf layer 2, Saint-Germain-la-Rivière upper complex and Fongaban) and Upper Magdalenian (Morin and row 24 of Faustin). They document, from a diachronic and synchronic standpoint, the relationships between Magdalenian hunter gatherers and their prey, principally ungulates. Our study focuses on the butchery of carcasses, from their transport to their disposal, through an investigation of the transportation methods, resources obtained, intensity of butchery, and techniques used, as well as any recurrences in the chaînes opératoires. We also discuss the variations in the modes of consumption in relation to the size of the prey, the seasons of procurement, and the function of the sites.Irrespective of the size of the hunted games, the carcasses are incomplete. The post-cranial axial skeletons have been abandoned at the kill site. The limb and mandible bones are common, but differences are observed between the species exploited, reflecting either logistical constraints or nutritional contingencies. The resources used are diverse at the residential sites (skin, meat, marrow, tendons and hoofs). The marrow has been particularly intensely exploited regardless of the season; this advanced use does not however extend to the extraction of the fat. The results of this study indicate that, despite palaeoenvironmental and cultural changes, there were no real differences during the whole Magdalenian period in Gironde and that human groups remained faithful to the same traditions regarding the acquisition and processing of carcasses.  aPublisher supplied data 3agames 3ahooves 3ahumans 3amandible (bone) 3ameat 3apaleoecology 3atendons 3atraditions 3atransportation 3aungulates 3aFrance 0aZooarchaeology 0aButchery 0aUngulates 0aMagdalenian 0aGironde1 aCostamagno, Sandrine1 aFeyfant, Léa1 aMartin, Flore0 tQuaternary international.g2016 Sept. 01, v. 414 p.135-158dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2015.12.0793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02721naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245008800156300001800244520173600262592002801998650001402026650001302040650001402053650003002067650001302097650000902110650001402119650002102133700001702154773014102171856007402312852000902386655001202395IND60631265720221122174736.0190220e20190219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063126572DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ta09939a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcColl, Kit10aMg²⁺ storage and mobility in anatase TiO₂: the role of frustrated coordination  ap. 3704-3713.  aAnatase TiO₂ is a candidate high-power electrode material in Li-ion and Na-ion batteries and has been explored as a Mg battery cathode material, although Mg capacity in undoped anatase is limited. Here we use hybrid-exchange density functional theory calculations to investigate the underlying factors affecting Mg intercalation and mobility in anatase. We find that at the dilute limit, Mg ions have 5-fold coordinated insertion sites, and activation barriers for migration are a surprisingly low 537 meV. As the concentration of Mg inserted into the structure is increased, a cooperative distortion of the lattice occurs, contracting the c lattice parameter. The distortion results in stable orderings of Mg ions in sites which are 6-fold coordinated, but also results in migration barriers that exceed 1500 meV in Mg₀.₅TiO₂ due to a collective relaxation of the host lattice. The total increase in barrier is predominantly a result of the stabilisation of the insertion sites, as opposed to a destabilisation of the activated sites along the migration pathway. The insertion sites in the dilute limit can be described as frustrated, and it is this unfavourable insertion geometry under dilute conditions that allows the Mg ions to migrate with low activation barriers. The limited performance for Mg²⁺ storage can therefore be attributed to the loss of frustrated coordination at high Mg concentration, which restricts Mg mobility and therefore capacity. Strategies to enhance the capacity of Mg in anatase should therefore aim to inhibit the c lattice parameter contraction or otherwise destabilise stable orderings of Mg in Mg₀.₅TiO₂ to retain the frustrated coordination of Mg ions at high Mg concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3acathodes 3achemistry 3adensity functional theory 3ageometry 3aions 3amagnesium 3atitanium dioxide1 aCorà, Furio0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2019 Feb. 19, v. 7, no. 8 p.3704-3713dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ta09939a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03067naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001500154245011300169300001600282520159400298592002801892650002501920650002401945650002501969650001201994650001502006650002202021650001502043650001202058650001502070650001302085650001402098650002802112650003702140650001202177650002502189650002302214650000902237651001002246653002802256653001902284653001302303653001402316700002302330700001502353773009502368856008902463852000902552655001202561IND60589644020221120184203.0201125e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058964402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.11.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Nana10aUnderstanding landowners’ interest and willingness to participate in forest certification program in China  ap. 271-280.  aForest certification is considered a viable market-based strategy for promoting sustainable forest management by providing landowners with financial incentives and social recognition for responsible forest practices. In China, it is an issue of international as well as domestic concern, especially considering the magnitude of country’s wood exports. To examine landowners’ perceived barriers to and interests in forest certification in China, we conducted a landowner survey in Shandong province in 2016 and analyzed whether and how landowners’ ownership motivations, management objectives, sociodemographics, and perceptions about benefits and drawbacks associated with certification schemes influenced their willingness to participate in certification programs. Results indicate that the majority of landowners in Shandong province are not currently familiar with forest certification programs but are willing to consider participating when provided with pertinent information. There may be a potential market for certification programs in China with appropriate outreach and extension. In addition, landowners’ willingness to participate in certification programs is significantly affected by the expected benefits and limitations associated with certification schemes, landownership motivation, management objectives, and characteristics of the forestland and households. Findings will be useful to institutions and policy makers interested in understanding and promoting the market for forest certification in China and other developing countries with similar circumstances.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeveloping countries 3aeconomic incentives 3aforest certification 3aforests 3ahouseholds 3aissues and policy 3alandowners 3amarkets 3amotivation 3aoutreach 3aownership 3asilvicultural practices 3asociodemographic characteristics 3asurveys 3asustainable forestry 3awillingness to pay 3awood 3aChina 0aMarket-based incentives 0aSustainability 0aBenefits 0aDrawbacks1 aPoudyal, Neelam C.1 aLu, Fadian0 tLand use policy.g2018 Feb., v. 71 p.271-280dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.11.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02028naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245009500174300001300269520097400282592002801256650001301284650001701297650001101314650002201325651001601347651001601363653000901379653001501388653001501403653001101418653001601429700002201445773010501467856008501572852000901657655001201666IND60607432520221120023924.0180904e20161122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060743252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2015.10.1212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCornelissen, Marcel10aFilling the gap: Recent Mesolithic discoveries in the central and south-eastern Swiss Alps  ap. 9-22.  aUntil 2007 only a handful of surface finds dating to between the end of the LGM and the Middle Neolithic were known in the alpine regions of central and south-eastern Switzerland. A number of recent rescue excavations, research projects and single finds have now shown the presence of people at high altitude in these parts of the Alps from the 9th millennium cal BC onwards. Both open-air sites and rock shelters are represented. Many sites lie above the valley floor, in the upper subalpine or alpine zones, and on routes to minor as well as major passes. Together with new palaeoenvironmental data, these archaeological finds allow us first insights into the nature of interaction of Mesolithic people in the south-eastern Swiss Alps with their social and natural environment, as well as their relationship with regions further afield. Furthermore, the finds allow us to start thinking about future research into the early prehistory of the south-eastern Swiss Alps.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3apaleoecology 3apeople 3aresearch projects 3aAlps region 3aSwitzerland 0aAlps 0aExcavation 0aMesolithic 0aSurvey 0aSwitzerland1 aReitmaier, Thomas0 tQuaternary international.g2016 Nov. 22, v. 423 p.9-22dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2015.10.1213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02377naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005400150245012700204300001800331520094900349592002801298650002301326650001501349650001901364650001101383650002101394650001001415650002001425650002201445650001601467650001501483650001901498650001301517650001901530650001601549700001601565700001201581700001701593700005701610700001601667700001501683773012801698856008401826852000901910655001201919IND60598664120221119124347.0180702e20180514xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059866412DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.8b013122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Shuai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9083-774910aHyperspectral Stimulated Raman Scattering Microscopy Unravels Aberrant Accumulation of Saturated Fat in Human Liver Cancer  ap. 6362-6366.  aLipid metabolism is dysregulated in human cancers. The analytical tools that could identify and quantitatively map metabolites in unprocessed human tissues with submicrometer resolution are highly desired. Here, we implemented analytical hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering microscopy to map the lipid metabolites in situ in normal and cancerous liver tissues from 24 patients. In contrast to the conventional wisdom that unsaturated lipid accumulation enhances tumor cell survival and proliferation, we unexpectedly visualized substantial amount of saturated fat accumulated in cancerous liver tissues, which was not seen in majority of their adjacent normal tissues. Further analysis by mass spectrometry confirmed significant high levels of glyceryl tripalmitate specifically in cancerous liver. These findings suggest that the aberrantly accumulated saturated fat may have great potential to be a metabolic biomarker for liver cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3abiomarkers 3acell viability 3ahumans 3alipid metabolism 3aliver 3aliver neoplasms 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3amicroscopy 3aneoplasm cells 3apatients 3asaturated fats 3atripalmitin1 aCui, Sishan1 aKe, Kun1 aZhao, Bixing1 aLiu, Xiaolong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3096-49811 aYue, Shuhua1 aWang, Ping0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2018 May 14, v. 90, no. 11 p.6362-6366dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b013123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02711naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010800165300001800273520136800291592002801659650002501687650001401712650001401726650001701740650001301757650001901770650002801789650003701817650001801854650001401872650002401886650001201910700002101922700002201943700002001965700001801985700002302003700002302026773013602049856008302185852000902268655001202277IND60548867520221118165045.0160905e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054886752DNAL7 a10.1094/MPMI-02-12-0036-R2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMase, Keisuke10aEthylene Signaling Pathway and MAPK Cascades Are Required for AAL Toxin–Induced Programmed Cell Death  ap. 1015-1025.  aProgrammed cell death (PCD), known as hypersensitive response cell death, has an important role in plant defense response. The signaling pathway of PCD remains unknown. We employed AAL toxin and Nicotiana umbratica to analysis plant PCD. AAL toxin is a pathogenicity factor of the necrotrophic pathogen Alternaria alternata f. sp. lycopersici. N. umbratica is sensitive to AAL toxin, susceptible to pathogens, and effective in Tobacco rattle virus–based virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS). VIGS analyses indicated that AAL toxin–triggered cell death (ACD) is dependent upon the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase MEK2, which is upstream of both salicylic acid–induced protein kinase (SIPK) and wound-induced protein kinase (WIPK) responsible for ethylene (ET) synthesis. ET treatment of MEK2-silenced N. umbratica re-established ACD. In SIPK- and WIPK-silenced N. umbratica, ACD was compromised and ET accumulation was not observed. However, in contrast to the case of MEK2-silenced plants, ET treatment did not induce cell death in SIPK- and WIPK-silenced plants. This work showed that ET-dependent pathway and MAP kinase cascades are required in ACD. Our results suggested that MEK2-SIPK/WIPK cascades have roles in ET biosynthesis; however, SIPK and WIPK have other roles in ET signaling or another pathway leading to cell death by AAL toxin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlternaria alternata 3aNicotiana 3aapoptosis 3abiosynthesis 3aethylene 3agene silencing 3ahypersensitive response 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3asignal transduction 3atobacco1 aMizuno, Takahito1 aIshihama, Nobuaki1 aFujii, Takayuki1 aMori, Hitoshi1 aKodama, Motoichiro1 aYoshioka, Hirofumi0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2012 Aug., v. 25, no. 8 p.1015-1025dThe American Phytopathological Societyx0894-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094%2FMPMI-02-12-0036-R3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01850naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001500154245010000169300001600269520081200285592002801097650001201125650001101137650001301148651001001161653001901171653001901190653002501209653002301234653002001257653001001277700002001287773009501307856008901402852000901491655001201500IND60589644120221120143454.0190807e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058964412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.02.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Xuejun10aSpatial and temporal effects of urban wetlands on housing prices: Evidence from Hangzhou, China  ap. 290-298.  aIdentifying urban wetland’s impact on housing prices and its amenity value has attracted much attentions.

In this study, we fabricated the loose NF membrane by using the electrospray interfacial polymerization (EIP) method. It is a novel and facile interfacial polymerization method, which controls the thickness of the poly(piperazine-amide) (PPA) layer in nanometers (1 nm/min) and changes cross-linking degree of PPA layer and pore size by varying the electrospray time; consequently, water permeance and dye/salt rejection ratio can be handled. The fabricated EIP membrane with an optimized fabrication condition (M30, electrospray time was 30 min) possessed excellent pure water permeance (20.2 LMH/bar), high dye rejection (e.g., 99.6% for congo red (CR)), and low salt rejection (e.g., 6.3% for NaCl). Moreover, the EIP membrane exhibited enhanced antifouling property than commercial NF membrane (NF90) with a high flux recovery rate (FRR) of 87.1% and low irreversible fouling (Rᵢᵣ) of 12.9% after fouled by bovine serum albumin (BSA) due to its great smooth surface (average roughness (Rₐ) is 12.2 nm), hydrophilicity property, enhanced zeta potential, and low protein adsorption. The results indicate that the EIP loose NF membrane had a high potential for dye wastewater treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aantifouling activities 3abovine serum albumin 3acrosslinking 3adyes 3afouling 3ahydrophilicity 3ananofiltration 3apermeability 3apolymerization 3aporosity 3aroughness 3asodium chloride 3awastewater treatment 3azeta potential 0aelectrospray interfacial polymerization 0aloose nanofiltration membrane 0adye removal 0acontrollable thickness 0across-linking degree 0aantifouling1 aJang, Jaewon1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8128-34141 aKim, Suhun1 aLim, Joohwan1 aLee, Yunho1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5923-48971 aKim, In S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6016-52670 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 July 22, v. 12, no. 32 p.36148-36158dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c095103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02605naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005600146245008400202300001800286500001900304520143200323592002801755650001801783650001401801650002301815650002001838650001301858650000901871650002301880650001201903650001401915650002401929700006501953773013602018856008002154852000902234655001202243IND60731246720221120122548.0210318e20210308xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073124672DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c001652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKraus, Peter1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4359-500310aIt’s a Gas: Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane over Boron Nitride Catalysts  ap. 5623-5634.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBoron nitride and related boron-containing materials have recently been suggested as very promising catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The high selectivity toward propylene at comparably high conversion significantly exceeds the performance of established vanadium-based catalysts. In the current work we show that the high selectivity toward propylene and ethylene is fully consistent with a gas-phase conversion mechanism and that it can be modeled reasonably well by the recent detailed microkinetic reaction mechanism of Hashemi and co-workers [Proc. Combust. Inst.2019, 37, 461]. Our analysis, using six heterogeneous catalytic reaction pathways, each representing a hypothetical limit case, shows that the boron nitride catalyst is responsible for initiating the gas-phase chemistry. The increased conversion of propane in cases with water cofeed, as well as the trends in the selectivities of minor species upon dilution of the catalytic bed and upon varying the C₃H₈/O₂ inlet ratio, as observed by Venegas and Hermans [Org. Process Res. Dev.2018, 22, 1644], are here explained as gas-phase phenomena. Hence, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over boron nitride catalysts is an example of a coupled gas and catalytic chemistry system. The current work also highlights the importance of modeling of the complete heated zone, including the rear heat shields and reactor padding if present.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboron nitride 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adehydrogenation 3aethylene 3aheat 3aphysical chemistry 3apropane 3apropylene 3areaction mechanisms1 aLindstedt, Rune Peter1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6176-27330 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Mar. 08, v. 125, no. 10 p.5623-5634dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c001653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02803naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245008900163300001600252520148100268592002801749650001801777650000901795650001301804650001501817650002201832700002201854700001801876700001601894700002001910700001501930700002401945700001901969700002101988700001602009700001902025700001502044700002402059700002402083700001902107773010502126856008202231990002302313852000902336655001202345IND60097690620221116213151.0141104e20121020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009769062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecss.2011.08.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFranco, A.10aAssessment of fish assemblages in coastal lagoon habitats: Effect of sampling method  ap. 115-125.  aThe structure of fish assemblages accounted for by different sampling methods (namely fyke net, seine nets, visual census) applied to vegetated and unvegetated lagoon habitats was investigated in terms of species composition, functional groups (ecological and trophic guilds), and fish size distribution. Significant differences were detected among methods, even among similar ones (seine nets). Visual census and fyke net detected more easily pelagic species, allowing the sampling of larger fish, whereas seine nets targeted more efficiently benthic-demersal species, with a dominance of 2–10 cm size classes in the fish catches. Differences were detected also among habitats, reflecting the different fish assemblages associated to vegetated and unvegetated habitats in coastal lagoons and transitional waters. However a different ability of discriminating between habitat-associated fish assemblages was recorded for the sampling methods. The different selectivity and functioning of the tested sampling methods confirm the importance of considering the targeted scale at which the research is being carried out, as well as the method that will be used to assess the ecological status of lagoon fish assemblages when choosing the most appropriate sampling method. A cross-validation of fish sampling methodologies in transitional waters is necessary to cope with the mandatory of the Water Framework Directive of standardization and comparability of monitoring methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoastal water 3afish 3ahabitats 3amonitoring 3aspecies diversity1 aPérez-Ruzafa, A.1 aDrouineau, H.1 aFranzoi, P.1 aKoutrakis, E.T.1 aLepage, M.1 aVerdiell-Cubedo, D.1 aBouchoucha, M.1 aLópez-Capel, A.1 aRiccato, F.1 aSapounidis, A.1 aMarcos, C.1 aOliva-Paterna, F.J.1 aTorralva-Forero, M.1 aTorricelli, P.0 tEstuarine, coastal and shelf science.g2012 Oct. 20, v. 112 p.115-125dElsevier Ltdx0272-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2011.08.0153Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02626naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245013500166300001600301520149300317592002801810650002501838650001701863650002201880650002101902650001801923650001201941650001301953650001201966650002501978650002502003651001002028700001902038773011702057856008102174852000902255655001202264IND60519528320221120163509.0160503e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051952832DNAL7 a10.1007/s11676-015-0087-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Jin-shan10aDeveloping a quantitative index system for assessing sustainable forestry management in Heilongjiang Province, China: a case study  ap. 611-619.  aIn this study, we developed a comprehensive index system for forestry sustainability of Heilongjiang Province, which includes forest resources sustainability, sustainable economic development, sustainable social development and sustainable advancement in science and technology. Based on this system and the regional forest development, we further evaluated the sustainability of Heilongjiang Province for year 2008–2013. The results show that even though the regional forestry has been preliminarily on the track of sustainable development, it is fragile. Four indicators, e.g. soil and water retention rate, forest stand growth (per unit area), the proportion of national investment and the annual carbon sequestration have important impact on the sustainability, with a weight of 39.0 % in all the indicators. We also analyzed the factors hindering the sustainable development. It turns out that soil and water retention rate, forest stand growth (per unit area), the proportion of science and technology funds, per capita GDP and the proportion of the tertiary industry production are the main factors hindering regional sustainable development, which accounts for 50.94 % of the total obstacle degrees in the system. At last, we discussed how to promote the regional sustainable development from the perspectives of forest resources sustainability, economic development sustainability, society development sustainability and the sustainable advancement of science and technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon sequestration 3acase studies 3aforest management 3aforest resources 3aforest stands 3aforests 3aindustry 3asociety 3asoil water retention 3asustainable forestry 3aChina1 aWang, Feng-you0 tJournal of forestry research.g2016 June, v. 27, no. 3 p.611-619dNortheast Forestry Universityx1007-662X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11676-015-0087-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02616naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245011400165300002000279520118900299592002801488650002601516650001601542650001501558650002501573650001401598650001601612650001101628653002601639653001401665653001201679653002301691653002801714653001801742653001101760653002201771700001701793700002201810700005301832700005601885773014201941856007802083852000902161655001202170IND60707062420221119032852.0200812e20200717xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070706242DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c095412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSomvanshi, Divya10aImproved Current Density and Contact Resistance in Bilayer MoSe₂ Field Effect Transistors by AlOₓ Capping  ap. 36355-36361.  aAtomically thin semiconductors are of interest for future electronics applications, and much attention has been given to monolayer (1L) sulfides, such as MoS₂, grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). However, reports on the electrical properties of CVD-grown selenides, and MoSe₂ in particular, are scarce. Here, we compare the electrical properties of 1L and bilayer (2L) MoSe₂ grown by CVD and capped by sub-stoichiometric AlOₓ. The 2L channels exhibit ∼20× lower contact resistance (RC) and ∼30× larger current density compared with 1L channels. RC is further reduced by >5× with AlOₓ capping, which enables improved transistor current density. Overall, 2L AlOₓ-capped MoSe₂ transistors (with ∼500 nm channel length) achieve improved current density (∼65 μA/μm at VDS = 4 V), a good Iₒₙ/Iₒff ratio of >10⁶, and an RC of ∼60 kΩ·μm. The weaker performance of 1L devices is due to their sensitivity to processing and ambient. Our results suggest that 2L (or few layers) is preferable to 1L for improved electronic properties in applications that do not require a direct band gap, which is a key finding for future two-dimensional electronics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrical properties 3aelectronics 3amolybdenum 3amolybdenum disulfide 3aselenides 3atransistors 3avapors 0amolybdenum diselenide 0amonolayer 0abilayer 0acontact resistance 0afield-effect transistor 0aoxide capping 0adoping 0a2D semiconductors1 aBer, Emanuel1 aBailey, Connor S.1 aPop, Eric1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0436-85341 aYalon, Eilam1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7965-459X0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 July 17, v. 12, no. 32 p.36355-36361dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c095413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01514naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245007900174300001600253520065100269592002800920653003300948653002700981653004901008773010901057856008501166852000901251655001201260IND60688907220221118063938.0200417e20180403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068890722DNAL7 a10.1080/09614524.2018.14338162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMakuwira, Jonathan10aPower and development in practice: NGOs and the development agenda setting  ap. 422-431.  aThere is a firm belief and evidence to suggest that local communities benefit when they are actively engaged in development processes.

In this work, we developed a fluorescent assay for detecting nucleic acids in complex samples based on magnetic microbead (MMB)-assisted catalyzed hairpin assembly (CHA) and a donor donor–acceptor fluorescence resonance energy transfer (“DD–A” FRET) signaling mechanism. Three types of DNA hairpin probes were employed in this system, including Capture, H1 (double FAM-labeled probe as FRET donor), and H2 (TAMRA-labeled probe as FRET acceptor). First, the Captures immobilized on MMBs bound to targets in complex samples, and the sequences in Captures that could trigger catalyzed hairpin assembly (CHA) were exposed. Then, target-enriched MMB complexes were separated and resuspended in the reaction buffer containing H1 and H2. As a result, numerous H1–H2 duplexes were formed during the CHA process, inducing an obvious FRET signal. In contrast, CHA could not be triggered, and the FRET signal was weak, while target was absent. With the aid of magnetic separation and “DD–A” FRET, errors from background interference were effectively eliminated. Importantly, this strategy realized amplified detection in buffer, with detection limits of microRNA as low as 34 pM. Furthermore, this method was successfully applied to detect microRNA-21 in serum and cell culture media. The results showed that our method has the potential for biomedical research and clinical application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abiomarkers 3abiomedical research 3ablood serum 3acatalytic activity 3acell culture 3aculture media 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence 3amagnetic separation 3amagnetism 3amicroRNA 3amicrobeads1 aXie, Nuli1 aOu, Min1 aHuang, Jin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2890-682X1 aLi, Wenshan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2572-42271 aWang, Qing1 aLiu, Jianbo1 aYang, Xiaohai1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8122-71401 aWang, Kemin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9390-49380 tAnalytical chemistry.g2018 May 21, v. 90, no. 12 p.7164-7170dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b013303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03029naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245012900174520160200303592002801905650001101933650002201944650002001966650001701986650001802003650003102021650001402052650000902066650002002075650000902095650001302104650001502117651001602132653002102148653002502169653002502194653002602219653001202245700001802257700005702275700002102332700001602353773009102369856009002460852000902550655001202559IND60743645220221117161607.0211003e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074364522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1314002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Hae Jong10aAssessing heavy metals in surface sediments of the Seomjin River Basin, South Korea, by statistical and geochemical analysis  aWe investigated particle size distribution and heavy metal concentrations in surface sediments of streams and lakes in the Seomjin River Basin by comparison with Sediment Quality Guidelines (SQGs). Origins were identified using statistical and geochemical approaches. Sand was prevalent in mean particle size of surface sediments (except lakes). Mean concentrations of Pb, Zn, Cd, and Hg were similar for the Seomjin and Boseong rivers, while those of Cu, As, Cr, and Ni were approximately 1.5–2.0 times higher in the Boseong. SQGs revealed no serious pollution in the basin's site concentrations, although As and Ni levels in the Boseong had some potential for benthos toxicity. Correlation and principal component/factor analysis showed that concentrations of Cu, As, Cr, and Ni were dominant from geological origins rather than anthropogenic. The reducible fraction bound to Fe and Mn-oxides was prevalent in Pb, while the water- and acid-soluble fractions were easily exchangeable or bound to high Cd carbonates. The fraction bound to the highest lattice in residual prevailed in Zn, Cu, Cr, and Ni, accounting for 64%, 65%, 87%, and 86%, respectively. Similarly, results indicated geological origins. Risk assessment to benthos based on labile fractions (F1 + F2 + F3) were Cd (72%) < Pb (66%) < Zn (36%) ≈ Cu (35%) < Ni (14%) ≈ Cr (13%). While Cd and Pb showed the highest risk, their concentrations were relatively lower. However, Cr and Ni showed the highest concentrations but low risk levels, suggesting their pollution is unlikely to have adverse effects on benthos.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3abenthic organisms 3afactor analysis 3aheavy metals 3aparticle size 3aparticle size distribution 3apollution 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3asand 3atoxicity 3awatersheds 3aSouth Korea 0aSurface sediment 0aStatistical analysis 0aGeochemical fraction 0aSequential extraction 0aGeology1 aBong, Ki Moon1 aKang, Tae-Woo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5021-23301 aHwang, Soon Hong1 aNa, Eun Hye0 tChemosphere.g2021 Dec., v. 284 p.131400-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1314003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03196naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245016000163300002000323520129200343592002801635650004401663650003701707650002501744650001701769650002801786650002101814650002801835650002101863650002301884650002201907650001801929650002001947650001601967650001301983650002401996650002002020650002002040653002702060653001602087653000802103653002702111653001102138653001502149700002202164700002702186700001802213700002002231700001902251700001902270700001802289700001702307700002202324700002102346773012602367856008002493852000902573655001202582IND60559012820170706000000.0161123e20161123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055901282DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b090692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStoleru, Elena10aLactoferrin-Immobilized Surfaces onto Functionalized PLA Assisted by the Gamma-Rays and Nitrogen Plasma to Create Materials with Multifunctional Properties  ap. 31902-31915.  aBoth cold nitrogen radiofrequency plasma and gamma irradiation have been applied to activate and functionalize the polylactic acid (PLA) surface and the subsequent lactoferrin immobilization. Modified films were comparatively characterized with respect to the procedure of activation and also with unmodified sample by water contact angle measurements, mass loss, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and chemiluminescence measurements. All modified samples exhibit enhanced surface properties mainly those concerning biocompatibility, antimicrobial, and antioxidant properties, and furthermore, they are biodegradable and environmentally friendly. Lactoferrin deposited layer by covalent coupling using carbodiimide chemistry showed a good stability. It was found that the lactoferrin-modified PLA materials present significantly increased oxidative stability. Gamma-irradiated samples and lactoferrin-functionalized samples show higher antioxidant, antimicrobial, and cell proliferation activity than plasma-activated and lactoferrin-functionalized ones. The multifunctional materials thus obtained could find application as biomaterials or as bioactive packaging films.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aatomic force microscopy 3abiocompatibility 3abiocompatible materials 3abiodegradability 3acell proliferation 3achemiluminescence 3acontact angle 3agamma radiation 3alactoferrin 3anitrogen 3aoxidative stability 3apackaging films 3apolylactic acid 0afunctionalized surface 0alactoferrin 0aPLA 0acarbodiimide chemistry 0aplasma 0agamma-rays1 aZaharescu, Traian1 aHitruc, Elena Gabriela1 aVesel, Alenka1 aIoanid, Emil G.1 aCoroaba, Adina1 aSafrany, Agnes1 aPricope, Gina1 aLungu, Maria1 aSchick, Christoph1 aVasile, Cornelia0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2016 Nov. 23, v. 8, no. 46 p.31902-31915dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b090693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02473naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245011100167300001600278520143200294592002801726650001401754650001801768650001901786650002401805650001301829650001501842650002201857651001701879700002001896773010501916856008202021990002302103852000902126655001202135IND60097691120221116213048.0141104e20121020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009769112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecss.2012.07.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarnes, R.S.K.10aSpatial variation in the macrobenthic assemblages of intertidal seagrass along the long axis of an estuary  ap. 173-182.  aInvertebrate macrofaunal biodiversity within intertidal seagrass meadows was investigated over a salinity gradient of <5–35 in the Knysna estuarine system (Garden Route National Park, South Africa). Rather than the classic gradual decline in species richness with distance from the mouth there were zones of considerable faunal stability separated by relatively sharp discontinuities. At the point upstream at which salinity regularly falls below 30, the rich, diverse and highly spatially variable downstream faunal assemblage changed to a less rich, less diverse and more uniform one that dominated the upstream stretch without any further upstream reduction in richness. Nevertheless, without loss of overall richness, assemblage composition changed, again rapidly, in the upper region of the upstream stretch to a zone dominated by the microgastropod Hydrobia, which otherwise occurs in the Knysna system only in highly sheltered regions of the downstream stretch where it is also dominant. The upstream faunal assemblage was a subset of that in the marine-influenced downstream region not a different replacing one. Position along the estuarine gradient accounted for 29% of total assemblage variation. Overall faunal abundance declined with distance upstream until the Hydrobia zone where it rose sharply, but there was no evidence of increase in density of those species remaining on putative release from competition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aestuaries 3ainvertebrates 3anational parks 3apopulation dynamics 3asalinity 3aseagrasses 3aspecies diversity 3aSouth Africa1 aEllwood, M.D.F.0 tEstuarine, coastal and shelf science.g2012 Oct. 20, v. 112 p.173-182dElsevier Ltdx0272-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2012.07.0133Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02652naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100007100155245010800226520153000334592002801864650002001892650001001912650001201922650001201934650002201946650001301968650000901981651001701990651002202007653001002029653001102039700006202050773009102112856009002203852000902293655001202302IND60743645420221117172323.0211003e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074364542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1314022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKljaković-Gašpić, Zorana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0439-213110aMercury and selenium levels in archive samples of wild Atlantic bluefin tuna from the Mediterranean Sea  aThis study examined total mercury (THg) and selenium (Se) levels in archive samples (white and red muscles, liver, gills) of the wild Atlantic bluefin tuna (ABFT) (Thunnus thynnus) (n = 18) captured in the central Adriatic Sea. The influence of fish size, age, and tissue type on element distribution was examined. There were significant differences in THg and Se levels, and Se:THg molar ratios among tissues. THg levels were highest in liver and lowest in gills (liver > red muscle > white muscle > gills), while Se levels were also highest in liver but lowest in white muscle (liver > red muscle > gills > white muscle). Se:THg molar ratios were highest in gills (22–82), intermediate in liver (11–29) and red muscle (7–36), and lowest in white muscle (1.7–7.6). Concentrations of THg in all tissues and Se in liver and caudal muscle were positively correlated with tuna age and size, while the Se:THg molar ratio in gills and all white muscles was negatively correlated with tuna age and size, indicating that the protective role of Se against THg is reduced in older specimens. The selenium health benefit values (HBVSₑ) were above zero in all tissues, indicating a small excess of Se after Hg sequestration. However, since the obtained HBVSₑ for edible tissues were near zero (0.01–0.04), and more than 70% of white muscle samples and all red muscle samples exceeded the EU regulatory limit for THg in fish muscle, it would be advisable to limit their intake in adults to one meal per month.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThunnus thynnus 3aliver 3amercury 3amuscles 3aprotective effect 3aselenium 3atuna 3aAdriatic Sea 3aMediterranean Sea 0aGills 0aMuscle1 aTičina, Vjekoslav1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3686-95630 tChemosphere.g2021 Dec., v. 284 p.131402-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1314023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03647naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245011700160300001600277520235800293592002802651650002002679650002002699650002102719650001702740650001002757650002602767650001102793650001302804650002202817650000702839650005002846650002102896650002102917650001602938700002002954700001802974700002102992773012903013856007403142852000903216655001203225IND60639945520221122220939.0190503e20170719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063994552DNAL7 a10.1039/c7em00099e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaumer, Andreas10aBaseline toxicity and ion-trapping models to describe the pH-dependence of bacterial toxicity of pharmaceuticals  ap. 901-916.  aIn numerous studies on the toxicity of ionisable organic chemicals, it has been shown that the toxicity was typically higher, when larger fractions of the neutral species were present. This observation was explained in some cases by slower uptake of charged species. In other cases it was suggested that the neutral species has intrinsically higher toxicity than the charged species or is alone responsible for the toxicity. However, even permanently charged and organic chemicals with multiple acid and base functional groups and zwitterions are toxic. We set out to reconcile the divergent views and to compare the various existing models for describing the pH-dependence of toxicity with the goal to derive one model that is valid independent of the type and number of charges on the molecule. To achieve this goal we measured the cytotoxicity of 18 acidic, 15 basic and 9 multiprotic/zwitterionic pharmaceuticals at pH 5.5 to pH 9 with the bioluminescence inhibition test using Aliivibrio fischeri (Microtox assay). This assay is useful for an evaluation of various models to describe pH-dependent toxicity because the majority of chemicals act as baseline toxicants in this 30 min cytotoxicity assay. Therefore baseline toxicity with constant membrane concentrations of the sum of all chemical species of approximately 200 mmol kgₗᵢₚ⁻¹ served for the validation of the suitability of the various tested models. We confirmed that most tested pharmaceuticals acted as baseline toxicants in this assay at all examined pH values, when toxicity was modeled with a mixture model of concentration addition between the neutral species and all charged species. An ion trapping model, that assumes that the membrane permeability of charged species is kinetically limited, improved model predictions for some pharmaceuticals and pH values. However, neither unhindered uptake nor no uptake of the charged species were ideal models; the reality lies presumably between the two limiting cases with a slower uptake of the charged species than the neutral species. For practical applications a previously developed QSAR model with the ionisation-corrected liposome–water distribution ratio as the sole physicochemical descriptor proved to be generally applicable for all ionisable organic chemicals including those with multiple charges and zwitterions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVibrio fischeri 3abioluminescence 3achemical species 3acytotoxicity 3adrugs 3amembrane permeability 3amodels 3amoieties 3aorganic compounds 3apH 3aquantitative structure-activity relationships 3atoxic substances 3atoxicity testing 3azwitterions1 aBittermann, Kai1 aKlüver, Nils1 aEscher, Beate I.0 tEnvironmental science.g2017 July 19, v. 19, no. 7 p.901-916dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26908x2050-78957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7em00099e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02035naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013200170300001400302520067900316592002800995650002401023650001201047650001301059650001501072650001101087650001301098650001101111650001901122650000901141651001101150653003101161653002001192653001101212653001601223653001001239653001201249653001201261653000901273700002101282700002701303700001901330773012301349856008401472852000901556655001201565IND60123561420221118034438.0150325e20150102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012356142DNAL7 a10.1080/08974438.2013.8335692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeslani, Cheryl10aSeafood Purchasing Preferences of Hawaii Chefs: Comparing Actual Purchase to Stated Preferences From Conjoint Choice Experiment  ap. 50-63.  aThis study investigated if Hawaii chefs use wild seafood products over farm-raised and local over imports.

The aim of this greenhouse study is to evaluate the effects of Me and P in combination with biochar made from date (Phoenix dactylifera L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) residues on vegetative growth and biochemical impact of maize (Zea mays L.) varieties Azam and Mallika under drought stress. Date residue and wheat straw biochars combined with melatonin (D+W+Me) reduced oxidative stress caused by excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) the most. Generations of ROS species (malondialdehyde [MDA], H₂O₂, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances [TBARS], O₂⁻, lipoxygenase [LOX], and electolyte leakage [EL]) was 118 and 700% higher in Azam variety compared to Mallika. The application of D+W+Me maintained osmolyte accumulation, α‐amylase activity, and antioxidant enzyme activities at higher levels in Mallika (2−7, 29, 9−55%, respectively) than in Azam and the rest of the treatments. The D+W+Me treatment also enhanced leaf gas exchange traits in Mallika (3−20%) under drought stress, helping to main better photosynthesis machinery. The D+W+P and D+Me treatments application alleviated a portion of the drought stress. Overall, Me application with date residue and wheat straw biochars enhanced the efficiency of biochar, by better assuaging the adverse drought stress influences.  aPublisher supplied data  aG. 269‐130‐1439cDeanship of Scientific Research (DSR) 3aPhoenix dactylifera 3aTriticum aestivum 3aZea mays 3aagronomy 3aalpha-amylase 3aantioxidant enzymes 3abiochar 3acorn 3adrought tolerance 3agas exchange 3agreenhouse experimentation 3aleaves 3alipoxygenases 3amalondialdehyde 3amelatonin 3aoxidative stress 3aphotosynthesis 3avegetative growth 3awater stress 3awheat 3awheat straw1 aShah, Fahad,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7525-02960 tAgronomy journal.g2020 July, v. 112, no. 4 p.2826-2847dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/agj2.202633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03414naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024005700111024002000168040001800188072000900206072000900215072000900224100001800233245011200251300001600363500002400379500001500403520116100418650002501579650002201604650001301626650001901639650001901658650001801677650002101695650001201716650001401728650001901742650000901761650001701770650002201787650001201809650001701821650004301838650003401881650001101915650005001926650004701976650002202023650004102045650002602086650003702112653001802149653001502167653001002182653001102192700001502203700001602218700001502234773012802249852000902377856011102386856011102497930003302608945002502641946001302666961001302679655001202692IND4376304820221121063156.0051128e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437630482DNAL7 a161195542pmid7 a10.1603/0022-2585(2005)042[0643:FDEOCO]2.0.CO;22doi7 a10113/30452hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL821 0aS200 0aX3801 aChauhan, K.R.10aFeeding deterrent effects of catnip oil components compared with two synthetic amides against Aedes aegypti  ap. 643-646.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aRecently, catnip, Nepeta cataria L. (Lamiaceae), essential oil has been formulated and marketed as an alternative repellent for protection against biting arthropods by several vendors. We isolated the major active components of catnip oil, E,Z- and Z,E-nepetalactone, and quantitatively measured their antibiting efficacy compared with the repellents N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (deet) and chiral (1S,2'S)-2-methylpiperidinyl-3-cyclohexene-1-carboxamide (SS220) against the yellowfever mosquito, Aedes aegypti (L.), by using an in vitro assay and human volunteers at 24 nmol compound/cm2 (cloth or skin). Of all compounds tested in an in vitro assay, SS220 ranked as the most effective, whereas catnip oil and the nepetalactone compounds did not differ significantly from each other or from deet. However, in human volunteer bioassays, neither E,Z and Z,E-nepetalactone nor racemic nepetalactone deterred mosquito biting as effectively as SS220 or deet. All compounds differed significantly from the control. We conclude that catnip oil and nepetalactone isomers are significantly less effective than deet or SS220 in deterring the biting of Ae. aegypti. 3aantifeeding activity 3ainsect repellents 3alactones 3amosquito bites 3aessential oils 3aAedes aegypti 3amosquito control 3aisomers 3abioassays 3aNepeta cataria 3adeet 3abiting rates 2aAedesxphysiology 2aAnimals 2aCyclohexenes 2aCyclopentanesxadministration & dosage 2aDEETxadministration & dosage 2aHumans 2aInsect Bites and Stingsxprevention & control 2aInsect Repellentsxadministration & dosage 2aNepetaxchemistry 2aPiperidinesxadministration & dosage 2aPlant Oilsxchemistry 2aPyronesxadministration & dosage 0anepetalactone 0arepellency 0aSS220 0aamides1 aKlun, J.A.1 aDebboun, M.1 aKramer, M.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2005 July, v.  42, no.  4 p.643-646dEntomology Dept., B.P.

The method uses cholesterol as marker of the egg content, prescribes an extraction with ethyl-acetate, derivatization with bis-trimethylsilyl-trifl uoroacetamid (BSTFA), GC separation, and FID detection. A tight correlation between egg and cholesterol contents was found, 94 mg cholesterol in 1 kg pasta per egg. The RSD of the measurements was 5%, limit of detection was found to be 0.1 mg l<sup>−1</sup> cholesterol, and limit of quantification was 0.47 mg l<sup>−1</sup>. For the determination of egg content a reference chart was created with the use of control materials containing exactly 1, 4 and 8 eggs in 1 kg of dried pasta, respectively. The reference chart was verified with a control sample of 4.4 eggs, proving the table to be fit for purpose. The method was also tested on commercially available unknown pasta samples and it was found that not all samples contained the declared amount of eggs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acholesterol 3aderivatization 3adetection limit 3aeggs 3aethyl acetate 3apasta 0adried pasta 0aegg content 0acholesterol 0agas chromatography 0aderivatization 0aBSTFA1 aJókai, Zs.0 tActa alimentaria.g2011 Jan. 1, v. 40, no. 0 p.23-32dAkadémiai Kiadóx0139-30067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FAAlim.40.2011.Suppl.33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02224naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245005700129300001800186520105900204592002801263650000801291650003001299650002801329650001601357650001001373650001701383650001601400650002501416650003001441650001401471650001801485650002201503650000901525650001601534700001801550700001901568700002001587700001901607773017901626852000901805655001201814IND4501253620221120222512.0150420e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND450125362DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, De-Chao10aPseudomonas bauzanensis sp. nov., isolated from soil  ap. 2333-2337.  aA Gram-negative, aerobic, motile rod, designated BZ93T, was isolated from soil from an industrial site. The strain grew at 5â30 Â°C. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain BZ93T was related to members of the genus Pseudomonas and was related most closely to Pseudomonas xiamenensis C10-2T (97.8 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity) and Pseudomonas pertucinogena IFO 14163T (97.4 %). The predominant cellular fatty acids of strain BZ93T were C18 : 1Ï7c (54.8 %), summed feature 3 (C16 : 1Ï7c and/or iso-C15 : 0 2-OH; 10.3 %), C16 : 0 (9.9 %) and C17 : 0 cyclo (7.4 %). The major quinone was ubiquinone 9. The major phospholipids were phosphatidylethanolamine, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and an unknown phospholipid. The genomic DNA G+C content was 61.8 mol%. On the basis of phenotypic characteristics, phylogenetic analysis and DNAâDNA relatedness, a novel species, Pseudomonas bauzanensis sp. nov., is proposed.

Recently it has been widely used in India to control vegetable pests. The present study has been carried out to observe the persistence pattern of fipronil and its metabolites—fipronil sulfone, fipronil sulfide, fipronil desulfinyl in cauliflower and soil so as to know the potential risk if any to consumers and environment. Fipronil was applied @ 56 g a.i. ha⁻¹. Samples of cauliflower and soil were collected periodically; processed using QuEChERS method and analyzed by GCMS/MS. In cauliflower, residues of fipronil and its metabolites reached below detectable level before 30 days of application whereas in soil about 95 % of total fipronil residues got degraded within same time period. Washing and washing followed by cooking or boiling was found effective in reducing residues. A safe waiting period of 15 days is therefore suggested before consuming cauliflower.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboiling 3acauliflower 3acooking 3afipronil 3ainsecticides 3ametabolites 3apests 3arisk 3asoil 3atandem mass spectrometry 3awashing 3aIndia1 aBeena Kumari,1 aDuhan, Saroj0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2015 Feb., v. 94, no. 2 p.260-266dSpringer USx0007-48617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-014-1447-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02617naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245010800164300001800272520120500290592002801495650002201523650002901545650002101574650002201595650001801617650001101635650001201646650001001658650001301668650001201681650001901693650002201712650001401734650002101748650001101769650001301780650001601793650003001809650001601839650002201855650001001877650001101887700002301898773011201921856008102033852000902114655001202123IND60440355620221119034102.0151024e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044035562DNAL7 a10.1007/s12010-015-1650-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJoshi, Swati10aCharacteristics and Applicability of Phytase of the Yeast Pichia anomala in Synthesizing Haloperoxidase  ap. 1351-1369.  aThe phytase of the yeast Pichia anomala is a histidine acid phosphatase based on signature sequences and catalytic amino acids identified by site-directed mutagenesis. Among modulators, N-bromosuccinimide and butanedione inhibit phytase, while Ca²⁺ and Ni²⁺ stimulate slightly. Vanadate exhibits competitive inhibition of phytase, making it bifunctional to act as haloperoxidase. Molecular docking supports vanadate to share its binding site with phytate. The T ₁/₂, activation energy (E ₐ), temperature quotient (Q ₁₀), activation energy of thermal inactivation (Ed), and enthalpy (ΔH d ⁰) of the enzyme are 4.0 min (80 °C), 27.72 kJ mol⁻¹, 2.1, 410.62 kJ mol⁻¹, and ∼407.8 kJ mol⁻¹ (65–80 °C), respectively. The free energy of the process (ΔG d ᵒ) increases from 49.56 to 71.58 kJ mol⁻¹ with rise in temperature, while entropy of inactivation (ΔS d ⁰) remains constant at ∼1.36 kJ mol⁻¹ K⁻¹. The supplementation of whole wheat dough with rPPHY resulted in 72.5 % reduction in phytic acid content of bread. These characteristics confirm that the phytase has adequate thermostability for its applicability as a food and feed additive.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aWickerhamomyces anomalus 3aacid phosphatase 3aactivation energy 3abinding sites 3abreads 3acalcium 3adough 3aenthalpy 3aentropy 3afeed additives 3aheat inactivation 3ahistidine 3amolecular models 3anickel 3aphytases 3aphytic acid 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3awheat 3ayeasts1 aSatyanarayana, T.,0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2015 July, v. 176, no. 5 p.1351-1369dSpringer USx0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-015-1650-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02781naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245008300171300001600254520137300270592002801643596006401671596009501735650001201830650002801842650002301870650002801893650001201921650001301933650001601946650001501962650001201977650001601989650001602005650001202021650001202033650001702045651001202062700005302074773012902127856008202256852000902338655001202347IND60662781020221121223728.0190906e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066278102DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-019-04185-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchneider, Florian10aRoot-restricting layers in German agricultural soils. Part I: extent and cause  ap. 433-451.  aAIMS: Root-restricting layers pose a barrier to vertical root elongation. The German Agricultural Soil Inventory was used to assess the extent, cause and effect of root-restricting layers in German agricultural soils. METHODS: The following causes for root restriction were considered: bedrock, rock fragments, cementation, compactness, sandy subsoil, anoxia and acidity. Threshold values for restricted root growth were extracted from the literature and validated using root counts of winter wheat and permanent grassland. The effect of management-induced compaction in cropland was quantified using machine learning. RESULTS: In 71% of all agricultural soils, potential rooting was restricted to less than 100 cm depth. Compactness was the most common cause of root restriction, affecting 51% of cropland and 32% of grasslands. It was estimated that agricultural management explained 27% of all compacted cropland, while the remaining 73% has always been compacted as a result of pedogenic causes. Root-restricting soil layers decreased the yield of winter wheat significantly. CONCLUSIONS: In view of potential rooting being restricted on more than half of Germany’s agricultural land and this study’s results suggesting that root-restricting soil layers have a direct impact on crop yield, there is considerable potential in the melioration of affected sites.  aPublisher supplied data  aBONARES Soil3cBundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung  aBodenzustandserhebung LandwirtschaftcBundesministerium für Ernährung und Landwirtschaft 3aacidity 3aagricultural management 3aagricultural soils 3aartificial intelligence 3abedrock 3acropland 3agrain yield 3agrasslands 3ahypoxia 3ainventories 3aroot growth 3arooting 3asubsoil 3awinter wheat 3aGermany1 aDon, Axel1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7046-33320 tPlant and soil.g2019 Sept., v. 442, no. 1-2 p.433-451dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl49373x0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-019-04185-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02094naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245016300169300001600332520088100348592002801229650002401257650001301281650001101294650001201305650002101317650001001338650001601348650003501364650002001399650002001419700002301439700002201462700002101484773012501505856008101630852000901711655001201720IND60120014720221122033143.0151123e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012001472DNAL7 a10.1007/s00128-014-1393-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCurrier, Heidi A.10aEffects of the Bioaccumulative Polybrominated Diphenyl Ether Flame Retardant Congener BDE-47 on Growth, Development, and Reproductive Success in Zebra Finches  ap. 140-145.  aThis study investigated the effects of the polybrominated diphenyl ether congener, 2,2′,4,4′-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47) on the growth and development, and subsequent breeding success of exposed zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). Using oral dosing procedures and treatments adjusted by weight, we treated newly hatched chicks daily for the first 20-days-post-hatch (dph) with varying treatments of BDE-47 (0, 5, 50, and 500 ng/g bw/day). Weight and tarsal measurements were monitored from hatch to 90 dph, but no differences were observed between treatment groups at any age. Treated females that reached sexual maturity were mated with untreated males; however, again no treatment effects were observed on breeding success. Analysis of tissue samples at 21 dph did indicate that debromination of BDE-47 had occurred resulting in BDE-28 and BDE-17 metabolites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTaeniopygia guttata 3abreeding 3achicks 3afemales 3aflame retardants 3amales 3ametabolites 3apolybrominated diphenyl ethers 3asexual maturity 3atissue analysis1 aLetcher, Robert J.1 aWilliams, Tony D.1 aElliott, John E.0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2015 Feb., v. 94, no. 2 p.140-145dSpringer USx0007-48617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-014-1393-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02883naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245009100165520140000256592002801656650002401684650001001708650002301718650002001741650002301761650001701784650003001801650001301831650001501844650003201859650002701891650001101918650000901929650003001938650001301968650001601981650001401997650002702011650001202038650001402050650001602064700002302080700002302103700002302126700002302149773011902172856007702291852000902368655001202377IND60703749120221122051512.0200721e20200622xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070374912DNAL7 a10.3390/plants90607812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPossamai, Tyrone 10aRpv Mediated Defense Responses in Grapevine Offspring Resistant to Plasmopara viticola  aDowny mildew, caused by the biotrophic oomycete Plasmopara viticola, is one of the most serious grapevine diseases. The development of new varieties, showing partial resistance to downy mildew, through traditional breeding provides a sustainable and effective solution for disease management. Marker-assisted-selection (MAS) provide fast and cost-effective genotyping methods, but phenotyping remains necessary to characterize the host–pathogen interaction and assess the effective resistance level of new varieties as well as to validate MAS selection. In this study, the Rpv mediated defense responses were investigated in 31 genotypes, encompassing susceptible and resistant varieties and 26 seedlings, following inoculation of leaf discs with P. viticola. The offspring differed in Rpv loci inherited (none, one or two): Rpv3-3 and Rpv10 from Solaris and Rpv3-1 and Rpv12 from Kozma 20-3. To improve the assessment of different resistance responses, pathogen reaction (sporulation) and host reaction (necrosis) were scored separately as independent features. They were differently expressed depending on Rpv locus: offspring carrying Rpv3-1 and Rpv12 loci showed the strongest resistance response (scarce sporulation and necrosis), those carrying Rpv3-3 locus showed the highest levels of necrosis while Rpv10 carrying genotypes showed intermediate levels of both sporulation and necrosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlasmopara viticola 3aVitis 3acost effectiveness 3adisease control 3adisease resistance 3adowny mildew 3afungal diseases of plants 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3ainheritance (genetics) 3aleaves 3aloci 3amarker-assisted selection 3anecrosis 3anew variety 3aphenotype 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aprogeny 3aseedlings 3asporulation1 aMigliaro, Daniele 1 aGardiman, Massimo 1 aVelasco, Riccardo 1 aDe Nardi, Barbara 0 tPlants.g2020 June 22, v. 9, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants90607813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02438naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245007700164300001600241520105400257592002801311650001501339650001901354650001101373650002801384650002301412650001101435650001101446650001801457650001901475650003001494650001701524650001501541653001901556653001901575653001901594653002301613700001501636700001901651700002501670700001701695700005301712773011201765856008201877852000901959655001201968IND60629759620221118092729.0190401e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062975962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2018.01.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiao, Yuxiao10aDeoxynivalenol, gut microbiota and immunotoxicity: A potential approach?  ap. 342-354.  aDeoxynivalenol (DON, vomitoxin) is the most frequent mycotoxin in grains and grain products. DON contamination in fodder and food is a serious threat for health, since it impairs the immune and gastrointestinal systems of both human and animals. Gut microbiota seems to play a more and more important part in human and animals' health according to related researches. Previous studies implied some associations among gut microbiota, DON and immune system. For example, DON affects immune system as well as the composition and abundance of gut microbiota, and the latter influences immune system as well. In the present short review, we not only provide the available information about the toxic consequences of DON-induced immunotoxicity on different animals and cell lines and discuss its main possible molecule mechanisms, but also summarize research results concerning the role of gut microbiota in DON-induced immunotoxicity and gender differences, with the aim to find some potential therapeutic strategies to tackle DON-induced immunotoxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell lines 3adeoxynivalenol 3aforage 3agastrointestinal system 3agender differences 3agrains 3ahumans 3aimmune system 3aimmunotoxicity 3aintestinal microorganisms 3atherapeutics 3atoxicology 0aDeoxynivalenol 0aImmunotoxicity 0aGut microbiota 0aGender differences1 aPeng, Zhao1 aChen, Liangkai1 aNüssler, Andreas K.1 aLiu, Liegang1 aYang, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1973-55790 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2018 Feb., v. 112 p.342-354dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2018.01.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02427naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100002100139245007500160300001600235500001500251520118000266592002801446650002801474650001701502650002301519650002201542650001501564650002001579650002601599650002001625650002301645650002101668653002401689653001701713653002301730653001601753700002501769700002201794773010301816856007701919852000901996655001202005IND4398370620221123042441.0151127e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439837062DNAL7 a10.1614/WS-06-084.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLubbers, Mark D.10aFluroxypyr Efficacy is Affected by Relative Humidity and Soil Moisture  ap. 260-263.  a2019-12-06  aAn experiment was conducted in controlled environments to evaluate the effects of relative humidity (RH) and soil moisture (SM) on fluroxypyr efficacy on kochia and Palmer amaranth. Plants were grown in growth chambers with constant RH of 35 or 90 ±± 5%% and 28/23 C day/night temperature. Within each growth chamber, plants were grown in SM regimes of either −−20 or −−40 kPa. When plants were 8 to 10 cm tall, fluroxypyr was applied at 26, 52, 78, or 104 g ae ha⁻⁻¹; a nontreated control was included. At 21 days after treatment, control of both species increased with increasing fluroxypyr rate. Kochia control was not affected by RH, but control was greater when plants were grown in moist soil (−−20 kPa) than in dry soil (−−40 kPa). Conversely, Palmer amaranth control was greater when plants were grown at 90%% RH than at 35%% RH, but control did not differ between moist and dry soils. This study showed that the influence of environmental factors on fluroxypyr efficacy on kochia and Palmer amaranth is species dependent.Nomenclature: Fluroxypyr; kochia, Kochia scoparia (L.) Schrad.

Singer extracts on colorectal cancer cell lines  ap. 383-392.  aPleurotus sajor-caju (PSC) is an edible mushroom used in food supplements, presenting antitumor properties through induction of cell death pathways. The PSC potential against colorectal cancer was analyzed by exposing HCT116wt cells to different PSC extracts. The PSC n-hexane extract (PSC-hex) showed the highest cytotoxicity effect (IC50 value 0.05 mg/mL). The observed cytotoxicity was then associated to apoptosis-promoting and cell cycle-arrest pathways. PSC-hex was able to induce apoptosis related to breakdown of mitochondrial membrane potential and ROS generation. The absence of cytotoxicity in HTC116-p53 and HTC116-Bax cells, alongside with an increase in p53, Bax and Caspase-3 expression, and decrease in Bcl-2 expression, supports that the pro-apoptotic effect is probably induced through a p53 associated pathway. PSC-hex induced cell cycle arrest at G2/M in HCT116wt without cytotoxicity in HTC116-p21 cells. These findings suggest that a p21/p53 cell cycle regulation pathway is probably disrupted by compounds present on PSC-hex. Identification of the major components was then performed with ergosta-5,7,22-trien-3β-ol representing 30.6% of total weight. In silico docking studies of ergosta-5,7,22-trien-3β against Bcl-2 were performed and results show a credible interaction with the Bcl-2 hydrophobic cleft. The results show that PSC-hex can be used as supplementary food for adjuvant therapy in colorectal carcinoma.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPleurotus sajor-caju 3aadjuvants 3aantineoplastic activity 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-3 3acell cycle checkpoints 3acell lines 3acolorectal neoplasms 3acomputer simulation 3acytotoxicity 3adietary supplements 3ahexane 3ahydrophobicity 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amembrane potential 3amitochondrial membrane 3amushrooms 3aneoplasm cells 3atherapeutics 0aPleurotus sajor-caju 0aSterols 0aCytotoxicity 0aApoptosis1 aAbreu, Rui M.V.1 aBonetto, Natalia1 aScariot, Fernando J.1 aDillon, Aldo J.P.1 aEcheverrigaray, Sergio1 aBarros, Lillian1 aFerreira, Isabel C.F.R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4910-48821 aHenriques, João A.P.1 aRoesch-Ely, Mariana0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2018 Feb., v. 112 p.383-392dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2018.01.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01964naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245013400167300001800301520087000319592002801189650001601217650001501233650001601248650001801264650001301282650001401295650001201309650001701321650001201338650001101350700001901361700002001380773011201400856008101512852000901593655001201602IND60440355920221119034011.0151024e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044035592DNAL7 a10.1007/s12010-015-1656-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Dong Young10aAcetic acid-assisted hydrothermal fractionation of empty fruit bunches for high hemicellulosic sugar recovery with low byproducts  ap. 1445-1458.  aXylose, mannose, and galactose (xmg) recovery from empty fruit bunches using acetic acid-assisted hydrothermal (AAH) fractionation method was investigated. Acetic acid has been demonstrated to be effective in xmg recovery in comparison with the liquid hot-water (LHW) fractionation. The maximum xmg recovery yield (50.7 %) from the empty fruit bunch (EFB) was obtained using AAH fractionation at optimum conditions (6.9 wt.% acetic acid at 170 °C and for 18 min); whereas, only 16.2 % of xmg recovery was obtained from the LHW fractionation at the same reaction conditions (170 °C and 18 min). Releasing out the glucose from EFB was kept at low level (<1.0 %) through all tested conditions and consequently negligible 5-HMF and formic acid were analyzed in the hydrolyzate.

Specifically, adult rats implanted within intracortical microelectrodes were systemically administered the anti-oxidant, resveratrol, both the day before and the day of surgery. Animals were sacrificed at two or four weeks post-implantation for histological analysis of the neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative responses to the microelectrode. At two weeks post-implantation, we found animals treated with resveratrol demonstrated suppression of reactive oxygen species accumulation and blood–brain barrier instability, accompanied with increased density of neurons at the intracortical microelectrode-tissue interface. Four weeks post-implantation, animals treated with resveratrol exhibited indistinguishable levels of markers for reactive oxygen species and neuronal nuclei density in comparison to untreated control animals. However, of the neurons that remained, resveratrol treated animals were seen to display reductions in the density of degenerative neurons compared to control animals at both two and four weeks post-implantation. Initial mechanistic evaluation suggested the roles of both anti-oxidative enzymes and toll-like receptor 4 expression in facilitating microglia activation and the propagation of neurodegenerative inflammatory pathways. Collectively, our data suggests that short-term attenuation of reactive oxygen species accumulation and blood–brain barrier instability can result in prolonged improvements in neuronal viability around implanted intracortical microelectrodes, while also identifying potential therapeutic targets to reduce chronic intracortical microelectrode-mediated neurodegeneration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aToll-like receptor 4 3aviability 3aneuroglia 3aneurons 3aenzymes 3areactive oxygen species 3aresveratrol 3ablood-brain barrier 3asurgery 3arats 3aadults 0aantioxidants1 aBuck, Amy C.1 aSelf, Wade K.1 aCallanan, Megan E.1 aSunil, Smrithi1 aCapadona, Jeffrey R.0 tBiomaterials.g2013 Sept., v. 34, no. 29 p.7001-7015dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.05.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02945naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245014800162520168500310592002801995650004402023650001602067650002302083650001502106650001002121650002402131650002102155650001402176650001402190650002002204650001702224650001002241650001902251700002302270700002302293700002502316773011902341856007802460852000902538655001202547IND60763428920221122144051.0220120e20220112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076342892DNAL7 a10.3390/foods110202022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGulzar, Saqib 10aWhole Wheat Crackers Fortified with Mixed Shrimp Oil and Tea Seed Oil Microcapsules Prepared from Mung Bean Protein Isolate and Sodium Alginate  aShrimp oil (SO) rich in n-3 fatty acids and astaxanthin, mixed with antioxidant-rich tea seed oil (TSO), was microencapsulated using mung bean protein isolate and sodium alginate and fortified into whole wheat crackers. SO and TSO mixed in equal proportions were emulsified in a solution containing mung bean protein isolate (MBPI) and sodium alginate (SA) at varied ratios. The emulsions were spray-dried to entrap SO-TSO in MBPI-SA microcapsules. MBPI-SA microcapsules loaded with SO-TSO showed low to moderately high encapsulation efficiencies (EE) of 32.26–72.09% and had a fair flowability index. Two selected microcapsules with high EE possessed the particle sizes of 1.592 and 1.796 µm with moderate PDI of 0.372 and 0.403, respectively. Zeta potential values were −54.81 mV and −53.41 mV. Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images indicated that microcapsules were spherical in shape with some shrinkage on the surface and aggregation took place to some extent. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses of samples empirically validated the presence of SO-TSO in the microcapsules. Encapsulated SO-TSO showed superior oxidative stability and retention of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) to unencapsulated counterparts during storage of 6 weeks. When SO-TSO microcapsules were fortified in whole wheat crackers at varying levels (0–10%), the crackers showed sensorial acceptability with no perceivable fishy odor. Thus, microencapsulation of SO-TSO using MBPI-SA as wall materials could be used as an alternative carrier system, in which microcapsules loaded with PUFAs could be fortified in a wide range of foods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aastaxanthin 3amicroencapsulation 3amung beans 3aodors 3aoxidative stability 3aprotein isolates 3aseed oils 3ashrinkage 3asodium alginate 3aspray drying 3awheat 3azeta potential1 aNilsuwan, Krisana 1 aRaju, Navaneethan 1 aBenjakul, Soottawat 0 tFoods.g2022 Jan. 12, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods110202023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02485naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245010100173520154700274592002801821653002101849653002401870653001501894653001701909700001901926700001901945700002101964773011801985856008302103852000902186655001202195IND60679330020221117213721.0200330e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067933002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jspr.2019.1015552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAstuti, Ludji Pantja10aPhysical and chemical properties of flour products affect the development of Tribolium castaneum  aThe rust-red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, is a polyphagous pest of cereal grains and many other stored products. The presence of this pest causes contamination and economic losses by reducing the quality and quantity of commodities in storage. This research was aimed to study the development of T. castaneum on different flour products and investigate the factors affecting the survivorship and development time of T. castaneum. We used 16 flour products differentiated by production process (commercial vs. non-commercial) and commodity types. We conducted experiments on the development of T. castaneum in the laboratory by placing 15 mating pairs of T. castaneum into a treatment jar and allowing them to feed on different flour products. The results showed that T. castaneum adults laid eggs in all flour products. The larvae could live and survive, although the population density was found to be significantly lower in the commercial products. The pupae and adult (F₁ progeny) were only found in all non-commercial products and three commercial products. In addition, the total development time of T. castaneum was shown to be significantly faster in commercial products and did not differ among commodity types. We found that particle size variation and protein content of flour products affected the survivorship and development time of T. castaneum. In conclusion, understanding the particle size and chemical composition of flour products is a pivotal step in developing a pest management strategy for T. castaneum.  aPublisher supplied data 0aDevelopment time 0aFlour particle size 0aRiboflavin 0aSurvivorship1 aRizali, Akhmad1 aFirnanda, Radi1 aWidjayanti, Tita0 tJournal of stored products research.g2020 Mar., v. 86 p.101555-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45775x0022-474X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jspr.2019.1015553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04423naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150100002300168245015400191300001600345520262200361592002802983650001603011650001203027650001103039650001403050650001303064650001003077650000903087650001603096650001403112650002403126650001103150650000703161650002703168650001703195650002003212650001603232650001303248650003303261650004903294650003103343650001303374650002403387650002503411650002103436650002603457650004903483650004303532650002703575650002103602700002103623773009503644856008503739852000903824655001203833IND4446545420221118075052.0141110e20110117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444654542DNAL7 a210841222pmid7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2010.10.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeuwoehner, Judith14aThe pH-dependent toxicity of basic pharmaceuticals in the green algae Scenedesmus vacuolatus can be explained with a toxicokinetic ion-trapping model  ap. 266-275.  aSeveral previous studies revealed that pharmaceuticals with aliphatic amine function exhibit a higher toxicity toward algae than toward other aquatic organisms. Here we investigated the pH-dependent toxicity of the five basic pharmaceuticals fluoxetine, its metabolite norfluoxetine, propranolol, lidocaine, and trimipramine. For all of them, the toxicity increased with increasing pH when aqueous effect concentrations were considered. Since these pharmaceuticals contain a basic amine group that is protonated and thus positively charged at physiological pH and because algae are capable of biological homeostasis, i.e., pH inside the algal cell remains virtually independent of variable external pH, the speciation of aliphatic amines can be different inside the algal cell compared to the external medium. Therefore, we hypothesized that the high toxicity of aliphatic amines in algae is a toxicokinetic effect caused by speciation and not a toxicodynamic effect caused by a specific mode of toxic action. This hypothesis also implies that internal effect concentrations are independent on external pH. On this basis we developed a simple toxicokinetic model, which assumes that only the neutral molecule is bioavailable and can pass the plasma membrane. This assumption is likely to be valid at pH values down to two units below the acidity constant (pKₐ). For lower pH values a more complex model would have to be evoked that includes, an, albeit smaller, permeability of the charged species. For pH>pKₐ−2, we can safely assume that the outer membrane serves as insulator and that the charged species is formed inside the cell according to the pH in the cytoplasm. Thus this toxicokinetic model is an ion-trapping model. The input parameters of this model are the measured aqueous effect concentrations determined as a function of pH and the membrane–water partitioning, which was modelled by the liposome–water partition coefficients of the neutral and cationic species. They were deduced from experimentally determined liposome–water distribution ratios at various pH values measured with an equilibrium dialysis method. The modelled internal effect concentrations were independent of the external pH and effective membrane burdens were in the same range as for other baseline toxicants found in the literature for algae, daphnids and fish. These results confirm that the higher algal toxicity of pharmaceuticals with an aliphatic amine group can be explained by a toxicokinetic effect and that these pharmaceuticals do not exhibit a specific mode of action in algae but act as baseline toxicants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScenedesmus 3aacidity 3aamines 3acytoplasm 3adialysis 3adrugs 3afish 3ahomeostasis 3alidocaine 3amechanism of action 3amodels 3apH 3apartition coefficients 3apermeability 3aplasma membrane 3apropranolol 3atoxicity 2aAminesxchemistryxtoxicity. 2aFluoxetinexanalogs & derivativesxtoxicity. 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aKinetics 2aLidocainextoxicity 2aLiposomesxchemistry 2aModels, Chemical 2aPropranololxtoxicity 2aQuantitative Structure-Activity Relationship 2aScenedesmusxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aTrimipraminextoxicity 2aWaterxchemistry1 aEscher, Beate I.0 tAquatic toxicology.g2011 Jan. 17, v. 101, no. 1 p.266-275dElsevier B.V.x0166-445X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2010.10.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02072naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245009100162300001800253520097400271592002801245650001101273650001301284650001301297650001801310650001401328650001101342650001401353650002101367650001701388650001301405650003701418700002001455700001801475773012201493856007401615852000901689655001201698IND60634509620221118070037.0190323e20190319xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063450962DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra00436j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTamaoka, Takehiro10aOxidation and hydrogenation of Pd: suppression of oxidation by prolonged H₂ exposure  ap. 9113-9116.  aWe investigate the phase transition of a Pd surface in both oxidizing and reducing environments by environmental transmission electron microscopy (ETEM). ETEM allows us to study sequential exposure of Pd to O₂ and H₂ in the same TEM conditions. First, under ETEM observation, oxidation occurs at step edges but it can also occur at terraces. Second, as the most important result, we observed a novel process where previous exposure to H₂ suppresses new oxidation of the Pd surface. Third, we show by electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) that this process, suppression of oxidation by previous exposure to H₂, is not due to the formation of bulk β-phase Pd hydride. We also demonstrate that this process is not present in Pt. Finally, we discuss the hypothesis to explain this phenomenon: formation of surface–Pd–hydride suppresses the new oxidation. This observation, suppression of oxidation by H₂ exposure, may eventually lead to new breakthroughs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3ahydrides 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogenation 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3apalladium 3aphase transition 3aspectroscopy 3aterraces 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aYoshida, Hideto1 aTakeda, Seiji0 tRSC advances.g2019 Mar. 19, v. 9, no. 16 p.9113-9116dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra00436j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01993naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245009600162300001800258500001400276500002000290520084900310592002801159596005501187650001301242650001501255650002001270650001201290650001101302650001401313650000901327700002101336700002501357700002301382773012601405856007901531852000901610655001201619IND60722307620221116185336.0210101e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072230762DNAL7 a10.1111/1755-0998.120122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArrigo, Nils10aQuantitative visualization of biological data in Google Earth using R2G2, an R CRAN package  ap. 1177-1179.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe briefly introduce R2G2, an R CRAN package to visualize spatially explicit biological data within the Google Earth interface.

However, adaptations which allow plants to thrive in nebkhas in extremely arid regions are still unclear. The objectives of this study were to test the role of adventitious roots (AR) in the growth and development of Nitraria sphaerocarpa-vegetated nebkhas. METHODS: We determined biomass distribution patterns and nutrient levels in small, medium, and large nebkhas representing different stages of nebkha development from young to mature, respectively. RESULTS: Our results showed that biomass allocation patterns and nutrient levels were very different among the different nebkha sizes. The proportions of leaves and stems increased with the increase in nebkha size, while those of AR and initial roots (IR) decreased. This indicated that, with an increase in nebkha size, N. sphaerocarpa allocated a higher proportion of biomass to leaves and stems mainly at the expense of roots, and that allowed plants to withstand increased burial depth. The proportion of AR, especially fine AR, varied among nebkha sizes. The proportion of AR in large nebkhas was significantly higher than in small nebkhas. For small and medium nebkhas, the proportion of fine AR was smaller than that of fine IR; for large nebkhas, the proportion of fine AR was higher. This indicated that AR, produced higher on the buried stems in the late stages of nebkha development, may provide increased access to water and nutrients to ensure nebkha survival. Nutrient levels were different in AR and IR of different nebkha growth stages. N and P contents of coarse AR and IR increased with nebkha size. For small nebkhas, N and K levels in fine AR were significantly lower than those in IR; however, for large nebkhas, N and K levels in AR were significantly higher than those in IR. This indicated that AR in the late stages of nebkha development may have stronger absorptive capacity for resources than IR. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that AR are key factor which ensured both the survival and development of N. sphaerocarpa nebkha in extremely arid environment.  aPublisher supplied data  a41701600cNational Natural Science Foundation of China subsidization project 3aNitraria 3aadventitious roots 3aarid zones 3abiomass 3adevelopmental stages 3adry environmental conditions 3adry matter partitioning 3aecosystems 3alandscapes 3aleaves 3anutrient content 3anutrients 3asand 3astems1 aZhao, Wenzhi0 tPlant and soil.g2019 Sept., v. 442, no. 1-2 p.471-482dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl49373x0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-019-04209-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03034naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001600156245008600172300001800258520157900276592002801855650004401883650002201927650001001949650002401959650002301983650002002006650001802026650001902044650000902063650001002072650001702082650001502099650001802114650001502132650001102147650003802158650003702196650002102233700001502254700001302269700001702282700001402299700001402313700001402327773008802341856009002429852000902519655001202528IND60090536520221120032359.0141102e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009053652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.05.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Tianye10aBiodistribution of sub-10 nm PEG-modified radioactive/upconversion nanoparticles  ap. 7127-7134.  aThe biodistribution of lanthanide-based upconversion nanophosphors (UCNPs) has attracted increasing attention, and all of the reported UCNPs display metabolism in the liver and spleen mainly. Herein, ∼8 nm poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-coated NaYF₄ nanoparticles codoped with Yb³⁺, Er³⁺, and (or) radioactive ¹⁵³Sm³⁺ ions were synthesized, through a hydrothermal synthetic system assisted by binary cooperative ligands with oleic acid and PEG dicarboxylic acids. The as-prepared PEG-coating NaYF₄:Yb,Er and NaYF₄:Yb,Er,¹⁵³Sm are denoted as PEG-UCNPs and PEG-UCNPs(¹⁵³Sm), respectively. PEG-UCNPs were characterized by transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The PEG-UCNPs showed excellent water solubility with a hydrodynamic diameter of ∼10 nm and displayed upconversion luminescence (UCL) under continuous-wave excitation at 980 nm. At the same time, the ¹⁵³Sm-doped nanoparticles PEG-UCNPs(¹⁵³Sm) displayed radioactivity, and time-dependent biodistribution of PEG-UCNPs(¹⁵³Sm) was investigated, through single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging and γ-counter analysis. Interestingly, PEG-UCNPs(¹⁵³Sm) had a long blood retention time and were partly eliminated through urinary pathways in vivo. Therefore, the concept of fabricating PEG-coated, small nanosize (sub-10 nm) nanoparticles with radioactive property is a useful strategy for providing a potential method to monitor lanthanide nanoparticles renal clearable.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3ablood 3acomputed tomography 3adicarboxylic acids 3aethylene glycol 3ahydrodynamics 3aimage analysis 3aions 3aliver 3aluminescence 3ametabolism 3ananoparticles 3aoleic acid 3aspleen 3atransmission electron microscopes 3atransmission electron microscopy 3awater solubility1 aYang, Yang1 aSun, Yun1 aWu, Yongquan1 aGao, Yuan1 aFeng, Wei1 aLi, Fuyou0 tBiomaterials.g2013 Sept., v. 34, no. 29 p.7127-7134dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.05.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02466naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245013600170520142200306592002801728653001401756653001601770653002601786653001601812700001901828700001701847700001701864700001801881700001801899773011801917856008302035961001302118852000902131655001202140IND60679330320221117213728.0200330e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067933032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jspr.2019.1015562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAthanassiou, C.G.10aEfficacy of phosphine fumigation for different life stages of Trogoderma inclusum and Dermestes maculatus (Coleoptera: Dermestidae)  aDespite the importance of dermestid beetles as targets for stored product protection, including the protection of museum artifacts and animal-based products, there are only a few published reports regarding their susceptibility to phosphine fumigation, in contrast with other major stored product insect species. In the current study, we evaluated phosphine against all life stages of Trogoderma inclusum LeConte, the larger cabinet beetle, and Dermestes maculatus (DeGeer), the hide beetle. There were two series of laboratory bioassays; in the first series the concentrations were 0 (control), 50, 100, 200 and 600 ppm, and in the second series the concentrations were 0 (control), 50, 150, 300, 400, 500 and 600 ppm. Both series were carried out on a 5-day insect exposure protocol. The results for both species clearly indicated that eggs were by far the least susceptible life stage, followed by pupae, while most adults and larvae were killed at the 50-ppm concentration. Concentrations between 300 and 400 ppm could be utilized to provide 100% mortality for both species and all life stages. To our knowledge, our results are the first that have provided data regarding efficacy of phosphine for the control of T. inclusum and D. maculatus. Resource managers can utilize our results to more efficiently target these dermestids with specific concentrations of phosphine, depending on the target life stage.  aPublisher supplied data 0aPhosphine 0aDermestidae 0aLarger cabinet beetle 0aHide beetle1 aPhillips, T.W.1 aArthur, F.H.1 aAikins, M.J.1 aAgrafioti, P.1 aHartzer, K.L.0 tJournal of stored products research.g2020 Mar., v. 86 p.101556-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45775x0022-474X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jspr.2019.1015563Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02954naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013200164300001800296520162200314592002801936650001201964650001901976650002201995650001102017650001602028650001702044650002402061650001002085650001202095650001302107650001902120650001202139650001802151650001202169650001102181650001102192700001502203700001502218700001502233700001802248700001602266773011202282856008102394852000902475655001202484IND60440356220221119034006.0151024e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044035622DNAL7 a10.1007/s12010-015-1661-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Cheng10aProduction of Xylitol from D-Xylose by Overexpression of Xylose Reductase in Osmotolerant Yeast Candida glycerinogenes WL2002-5  ap. 1511-1527.  aEfficient bioconversion of D-xylose into various biochemicals is critical for the developing lignocelluloses application. In this study, we compared D-xylose utilization in Candida glycerinogenes WL2002-5 transformants expressing xylose reductase (XYL1) in D-xylose metabolism. C. glycerinogenes WL2002-5 expressing XYL1 from Schefferomyces stipitis can produce xylitol. Xylitol production by the recombinant strains was evaluated using a xylitol fermentation medium with glucose as a co-substrate. As glucose was found to be an insufficient co-substrate, various carbon sources were screened for efficient cofactor regeneration, and glycerol was found to be the best co-substrate. The effects of glycerol on the xylitol production rate by a xylose reductase gene (XYL1)-overexpressed mutant of C. glycerinogenes WL2002-5 were investigated. The XYL1-overexpressed mutant produced xylitol from D-xylose using glycerol as a co-substrate for cell growth and NAD (P) H regeneration: 100 g/L D-xylose was completely converted into xylitol when at least 20 g/L glycerol was used as a co-substrate. XYL1 overexpressed mutant grown on glycerol as co-substrate accumulated 2.1-fold increased xylitol concentration over those cells grown on glucose as co-substrate. XYL1 overexpressed mutant produced xylitol with a volumetric productivity of 0.83 g/L/h, and a xylitol yield of 98 % xylose. Recombinant yeast strains obtained in this study are promising candidates for xylitol production. This is the first report of XYL1 gene overexpression of C. glycerinogenes WL2002-5 for enhancing the efficiency of xylitol production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3abiotransformation 3acarbon 3acell growth 3afermentation 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3aglucose 3aglycerol 3alignocellulose 3amutants 3aosmotolerance 3axylitol 3axylose 3ayeasts1 aZong, Hong1 aZhuge, Bin1 aLu, Xinyao1 aFang, Huiying1 aZhuge, Jian0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2015 July, v. 176, no. 5 p.1511-1527dSpringer USx0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-015-1661-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03249naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245015000172520157400322592002801896650001201924650001201936650001901948650001101967650001401978650002301992650001102015650001502026650003102041650003002072650001402102650002602116650001402142650001302156650001602169650001102185650001802196653001202214653002202226653003302248653001502281653003002296653001902326700002002345700001902365700002002384700001802404700001602422700005902438773010402497856008502601852000902686655001202695IND60765912720221116225040.0220606e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076591272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2022.1127932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaur, Vivek Kumar10aCarbon-based catalyst for environmental bioremediation and sustainability: Updates and perspectives on techno-economics and life cycle assessment  aGlobal rise in the generation of waste has caused an enormous environmental concern and waste management problem. The untreated carbon rich waste serves as a breeding ground for pathogens and thus strategies for production of carbon rich biochar from waste by employing different thermochemical routes namely hydrothermal carbonization, hydrothermal liquefaction and pyrolysis has been of interest by researchers globally. Biochar has been globally produced due to its diverse applications from environmental bioremediation to energy storage. Also, several factors affect the production of biochar including feedstock/biomass type, moisture content, heating rate, and temperature. Recently the application of biochar has increased tremendously owing to the cost effectiveness and eco-friendly nature. Thus this communication summarized and highlights the preferred feedstock for optimized biochar yield along with the factor influencing the production. This review provides a close view on biochar activation approaches and synthesis techniques. The application of biochar in environmental remediation, composting, as a catalyst, and in energy storage has been reviewed. These informative findings were supported with an overview of lifecycle and techno-economical assessments in the production of these carbon based catalysts. Integrated closed loop approaches towards biochar generation with lesser/zero landfill waste for safeguarding the environment has also been discussed. Lastly the research gaps were identified and the future perspectives have been elucidated.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochar 3abiomass 3abioremediation 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acost effectiveness 3aenergy 3afeedstocks 3ahydrothermal carbonization 3ahydrothermal liquefaction 3alandfills 3alife cycle assessment 3apyrolysis 3aresearch 3atemperature 3awastes 3awater content 0aBiochar 0aPollution control 0aTechno-economical assessment 0aComposting 0aEnvironmental remediation 0aSustainability1 aGautam, Krishna1 aSharma, Poonam1 aGupta, Shivangi1 aPandey, Ashok1 aYou, Siming1 aVarjani, Sunita1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6966-77680 tEnvironmental research.g2022 June, v. 209 p.112793-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2022.1127933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02575naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005500147245012800202520115400330592002801484650001901512650002401531650001301555650001801568650001101586650002601597650002001623650002701643650001601670650001401686650002001700650001701720650001801737650001601755650001201771653002601783653001801809700002101827700005401848700001501902773012201917856008102039852000902120655001202129IND60679330620221117213727.0200210e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067933062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2019.1089372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFauster, T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4385-558110aEffect of pulsed electric field pretreatment on shrinkage, rehydration capacity and texture of freeze-dried plant materials  aFor this study, strawberries and red bell peppers were pre-treated with pulsed electric fields (PEF) to reduce the negative effects on physical properties of the products after freeze-drying. PEF treatment was carried out at constant electric field strength of E = 1.0 kV/cm and specific energy input was varied between 0.3 and 6.0 kJ/kg (treatment time 2.0–28.6 ms). Additionally, the impact of different pre-freezing temperatures (−4 and −40 °C) on the final product quality was described. Investigations showed that due to PEF treatment a significant reduction of the shrinkage phenomena for both bell peppers and strawberries was detected compared to untreated samples with 30% and 50% lower volume losses, respectively. The rehydration capacity of PEF pre-treated freeze-dried samples increased for both matrices up to 50%. Furthermore, the mechanical properties of the final product were improved for both matrices with a significant firmness reduction up to 60%. The results of this study suggest that PEF can be an effective pretreatment with low energy requirements to improve the quality of freeze-dried fruits and vegetables.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric field 3aenergy requirements 3afirmness 3afreeze drying 3afruits 3amechanical properties 3aproduct quality 3apulsed electric fields 3arehydration 3ashrinkage 3aspecific energy 3astrawberries 3asweet peppers 3atemperature 3atexture 0aPulsed electric field 0aFreeze-drying1 aGiancaterino, M.1 aPittia, P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0020-90771 aJaeger, H.0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2020 Mar., v. 121 p.108937-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2019.1089373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02464naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011800166300001400284520121600298592002801514650002401542650001601566650001601582650001001598650001201608650001501620650001401635650001301649651001001662653001901672653002701691653002101718653002401739700002001763700002301783700002101806773013601827856008201963852000902045655001202054IND60543667420221121015816.0190411e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054366742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.myc.2014.02.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuzuki, Ryo O.10aLocal-and regional-scale spatial patterns of two fungal pathogens of Miscanthus sinensis in grassland communities  ap. 42-48.  aWe studied the spatio-temporal patterns in two fungal pathogens, Sporisorium kusanoi, along with Naemacyclus culmigenus, of the Japanese pampas grass (Miscanthus sinensis) in grassland communities on the Sugadaira plateau, Japan. Their disease symptoms emerged early in June, increased rapidly during the month and peaked early in July. We checked their presence at 11 sites (the regional-scale census) and recorded their presence in 6000 1 × 1-m subplots within a 60 × 100-m area at the specific site (the local-scale census). Sporisorium kusanoi and N. culmigenus were observed at eight and one sites in the regional-scale census, and in 987 and 2708 subplots in the local-scale census, respectively. The respective spatial distributions of S. kusanoi and N. culmigenus aggregated at the spatial scales of 13 m and 33 m. However, the spatial positions of the two fungi were slightly repulsive each other. Our results found that S. kusanoi was widely distributed within the region, whereas N. culmigenus was restricted within the specific site but had a higher frequency compared to S. kusanoi. The contrasting spatial patterns of the two pathogens may reflect differences in their dispersal processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMiscanthus sinensis 3aNaemacyclus 3aSporisorium 3afungi 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3apathogens 3aplateaus 3aJapan 0aMetapopulation 0aNaemacyclus culmigenus 0aSpatial analysis 0aSporisorium kusanoi1 aDegawa, Yousuke1 aSuzuki, Satoshi N.1 aHosoya, Tsuyoshi0 tMycoscience.g2015 Jan., v. 56, no. 1 p.42-48dElsevier B.V.aThe Mycological Society of JapanwJournal:jnl3870071x1340-35407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.myc.2014.02.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03421naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100003400145245014400179300001600323500001400339500002000353520173000373592002802103596004002131650001202171650001902183650000802202650002302210650002202233650004202255650000902297650001902306650001702325650001702342650002502359650001902384650002502403650001902428650001502447650001402462650001302476650003502489650001402524650001202538700001402550700002302564700002102587700002502608700002202633773012402655856007902779852000902858655001202867IND60722308120221116185202.0210101e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072230812DNAL7 a10.1111/1755-0998.120592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHancock‐Hanser, Brittany L.10aTargeted multiplex next‐generation sequencing: advances in techniques of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequencing for population genomics  ap. 254-268.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNext‐generation sequencing (NGS) is emerging as an efficient and cost‐effective tool in population genomic analyses of nonmodel organisms, allowing simultaneous resequencing of many regions of multi‐genomic DNA from multiplexed samples. Here, we detail our synthesis of protocols for targeted resequencing of mitochondrial and nuclear loci by generating indexed genomic libraries for multiplexing up to 100 individuals in a single sequencing pool, and then enriching the pooled library using custom DNA capture arrays. Our use of DNA sequence from one species to capture and enrich the sequencing libraries of another species (i.e. cross‐species DNA capture) indicates that efficient enrichment occurs when sequences are up to about 12% divergent, allowing us to take advantage of genomic information in one species to sequence orthologous regions in related species. In addition to a complete mitochondrial genome on each array, we have included between 43 and 118 nuclear loci for low‐coverage sequencing of between 18 kb and 87 kb of DNA sequence per individual for single nucleotide polymorphisms discovery from 50 to 100 individuals in a single sequencing lane. Using this method, we have generated a total of over 500 whole mitochondrial genomes from seven cetacean species and green sea turtles. The greater variation detected in mitogenomes relative to short mtDNA sequences is helping to resolve genetic structure ranging from geographic to species‐level differences. These NGS and analysis techniques have allowed for simultaneous population genomic studies of mtDNA and nDNA with greater genomic coverage and phylogeographic resolution than has previously been possible in marine mammals and turtles.  aPublisher supplied data  cNMFS Southwest Region and PRD/SWFSC 3aCetacea 3aChelonia mydas 3aDNA 3acost effectiveness 3agenomic libraries 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3aloci 3amarine mammals 3ametagenomics 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial genome 3anuclear genome 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeography 3apopulation 3aprotocols 3asampling 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3asynthesis 3aturtles1 aFrey, Amy1 aLeslie, Matthew S.1 aDutton, Peter H.1 aArcher, Frederick I.1 aMorin, Phillip A.0 tMolecular ecology resources.g2013 Mar., v. 13, no. 2 p.254-268dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:12383x1755-098X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.120593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02998naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245017500169500001900344520149900363592002801862650002101890650001601911650002601927650003101953650002101984650001502005650001902020650001002039650001402049650001302063650001402076650001302090653002902103653001902132653001602151653001902167653001902186700001402205700001702219700001502236700002002251700001502271700001602286773010602302856008702408852000902495655001202504IND60735746020221119064555.0210619e20210820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073574602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1266952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Yuying10aMetal-organic framework derived Co9S8/Ni3S2 composites on Ni foam with enhanced electrochemical performance by one-step sulfuration strategy for supercapacitors electrode  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aElectrode materials with excellent performance are urgently demanded for supercapacitors. Herein, heterogeneous nanostructure Co₉S₈/Ni₃S₂ supported on conductive Ni foam (Co₉S₈/Ni₃S₂/NF) is fabricated using zeolite imidazole frameworks (ZIFs) as the sacrificial template. The Co₉S₈/Ni₃S₂/NF electrode shows an outstanding specific capacitance of 1356 F g⁻¹ at a current density of 1 A g⁻¹ and still remained 1145 F g⁻¹ at 10 A g⁻¹. The enhanced electrochemical performance should be attributed to the superior structural characteristics, the abundant active sites, the rich redox reactions, the strongly synergistic effect in heterogeneous sulfide composition and the good conductivity resulted from the NF and the Co₉S₈/Ni₃S₂/NF. Meanwhile, to further evaluate the practical application value of the Co₉S₈/Ni₃S₂/NF electrode, a hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs) device is constructed using Co₉S₈/Ni₃S₂/NF as positive electrode and activated carbon (AC) as negative electrode, and it displays a high energy density of 48.2 Wh kg⁻¹ at a power density of 799.6 W kg⁻¹ and a superior long-term cycling stability with 82% of initial capacitance after 8000 cycles. In addition, two as-assembled capacitors in series can light 7 LED bulbs. This strategy of obtaining multi-metal sulfides from Co/Ni-ZIF precursor provides a new perspective to design and develop electrode materials for high-performance hybrid supercapacitors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3acapacitance 3acoordination polymers 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aenergy density 3afoams 3aimidazole 3asulfides 3asynergism 3azeolites 0aMetal-organic frameworks 0aSupercapacitor 0aSulfuration 0aCobalt sulfide 0aNickel sulfide1 aZhu, Hong1 aMeng, Haixia1 aMa, Weixia1 aWang, Chengjuan1 aMa, Fuquan1 aHu, Zhongai0 tColloids and surfaces.g2021 Aug. 20, v. 623 p.126695-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1266953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02747naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001700156245013400173300001800307520145500325592002801780650002101808650001101829650001901840650001701859650001701876650001001893650000901903650001501912650001301927650001801940650001301958650001301971650001701984650002302001650001702024700001602041700001702057700002002074700002002094773008802114856009002202852000902292655001202301IND60090536920221120032406.0141102e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009053692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.05.0722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Jinhwan10aTransfection and intracellular trafficking properties of carbon dot-gold nanoparticle molecular assembly conjugated with PEI-pDNA  ap. 7168-7180.  aThe work employs carbon dot (CD) which has been emerging as a fluorescent nanomaterial with excellent biocompatibility and perceived as a promising alternative to quantum dot (QD), to monitor the association/dissociation of polymeric carrier/plasmid DNA (pDNA) complex during transfection. To shed light on the underlying post-endosomal events and provide the insight to design rational and efficient gene delivery vector, the adopted strategy exploited the quenching of the fluorescence of CD by Au nanoparticles. The surface of CD and Au was modified with highly cationic polymer, polyethylenimine (PEI) and subsequent treatment with non-labeled pDNA gave rise to quenched delivery complex. High salt concentration triggered the dissociation of the complex with accompanied fluorescence recovery arising due to the increase in distance between CD and Au. The studies revealed the potential of the developed CD-PEI/Au-PEI/pDNA ternary nano-assembly as a highly efficient hybrid transfecting agent with high cell viability under the optimum condition. The changes occurred at the intracellular level during transfection especially post-endosomal step were monitored by fluorescence measurement using fluorescence microscope. This nano-assembly system was found to be very effective at monitoring the carrier/pDNA dissociation in a non-labeled manner, thus provides efficient strategy to study the mechanistic aspect of polymer-mediated pDNA delivery.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatibility 3acarbon 3acell viability 3adissociation 3afluorescence 3agenes 3agold 3amonitoring 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3aplasmids 3apolymers 3aquantum dots 3asalt concentration 3atransfection1 aPark, Juhee1 aKim, Hyunwoo1 aSingha, Kaushik1 aKim, Wŏn-jong,0 tBiomaterials.g2013 Sept., v. 34, no. 29 p.7168-7180dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.05.0723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02831naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245013500167500001900302520155000321592002801871650001501899650001701914650000901931650003001940650001301970650002301983650001802006650001102024650001102035653001802046653001402064653000802078653001802086700005702104700001702161700001202178700001702190773010602207856008702313852000902400655001202409IND60735746120221119064256.0210527e20210805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073574612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1266962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Lei10aMicro-mechanism of improving low-rank coal flotation by using carboxylic acid collector: A DFT calculation and MD simulation study  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe poor flotation behavior of low-rank coal is mainly caused by the high content of functional oxygen groups present on the coal surface. Polar collectors, especially oxygenated collectors, play a significant role in the flotation enhancement of low-rank coal. In this study, to improve the low-rank coal flotation performance, octanoic acid was selected as a polar collector and the corresponding promotion mechanism was investigated at the molecular scale theoretically. The flotation results showed that an increased low-rank coal flotation response can be obtained by using an octanoic acid collector compared to a nonpolar dodecane collector. To obtain a molecular-level explanation of this phenomenon, a method of density functional theory (DFT) combined with molecular dynamics simulation was employed to explore the involved micro-mechanism. DFT calculation results suggested that the octanoic acid collector can interact with benzoic acid and phenol (representatives of oxygen-containing groups on the low-rank coal surface) through hydrogen bonding and repel water molecules present on benzoic acid and phenol. Based on theoretical calculations, in the presence or absence of water molecules, hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions are responsible for the strong affinity of octanoic acid to carboxyl group and hydroxyl group on the low-rank coal surface. Therefore, it was favorable for octanoic acid to form a stable adsorption layer on the low-rank coal surface, thus contributing to low-rank coal flotation significantly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abenzoic acid 3acoal 3adensity functional theory 3ahydrogen 3amolecular dynamics 3aoctanoic acid 3aoxygen 3aphenol 0aLow-rank coal 0aFlotation 0aDFT 0aMD simulation1 aGuo, Jianying1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4625-341X1 aXie, Zhixuan1 aLi, Bao1 aLiu, Shengyu0 tColloids and surfaces.g2021 Aug. 05, v. 622 p.126696-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1266963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02640naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024003500113040001800148100001900166245016200185300001600347500001500363520120800378592002801586650002201614650003701636650001601673650001101689650001001700650001601710653001101726653002501737700002501762700001501787700001901802700001601821700002501837700002201862773010701884856011201991856008102103961001302184852000902197655001202206IND4409961620221120084039.0151024e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440996162DNAL7 a10113/202392hdl7 a10.1007/s00438-008-0364-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJakše, Jernej10aPilot sequencing of onion genomic DNA reveals fragments of transposable elements, low gene densities, and significant gene enrichment after methyl filtration  ap. 287-292.  a2019-12-04  aSequencing of the onion (Allium cepa) genome is challenging because it has one of the largest nuclear genomes among cultivated plants. We undertook pilot sequencing of onion genomic DNA to estimate gene densities and investigate the nature and distribution of repetitive DNAs. Complete sequences from two onion BACs were AT rich (64.8%) and revealed long tracts of degenerated retroviral elements and transposons, similar to other larger plant genomes. Random BACs were end sequenced and only 3 of 460 ends showed significant (e < −25) non-organellar hits to the protein databases. The BAC-end sequences were AT rich (63.4%), similar to the completely sequenced BACs. A total of 499,997 bp of onion genomic DNA yielded an estimated mean density of one gene per 168 kb, among the lowest reported to date. Methyl filtration was highly effective relative to random shotgun reads in reducing frequencies of anonymous sequences from 82 to 55% and increasing non-organellar protein hits from 4 to 42%. Our results revealed no evidence for gene-dense regions and indicated that sequencing of methyl-filtered genomic fragments should be an efficient approach to reveal genic sequences in the onion genome.  aPublisher supplied data 3asequence analysis 3abacterial artificial chromosomes 3aAllium cepa 3aonions 3agenes 3atransposons 0agenome 0anucleotide sequences1 aMeyer, Jenelle D.

However, whether root morphological traits (such as root diameter) are correlated with foraging precision of roots and mycorrhizal fungi in heterogeneous nutrient environments across tree species remains unclear. METHODS: We examined 13 coexisting arbuscular mycorrhizal subtropical tree species, measured functional traits of roots, leaves and mycorrhizal fungi and assessed foraging precision of roots and mycorrhizal fungi in response to different nutrient patches using an in situ root-bag approach. RESULTS: Thin-root species had greater specific root length and root growth rate than thick-root species, but they showed similar root and mycorrhizal hyphae foraging precisions. As root diameter increased, root foraging precision exhibited the U-shape patterns in the nitrogen and phosphorus patches, but hyphal foraging precision showed a slightly increasing trend only in the nitrogen patch. Foraging precisions of roots and hyphae were independent, and were not influenced by plant traits across species. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings challenge the notion that thin-root species with high root growth rate have greater foraging precision, suggesting that root morphological traits may not be correlated with the variation in foraging strategies of roots and mycorrhizal hyphae.  aPublisher supplied data  a31700382cNational Natural Science Foundation of China (CN)  a41571130041cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aforaging 3ahyphae 3aleaves 3amycorrhizal fungi 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3aroot growth 3aroots 3atrees 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae1 aLi, Liang1 aRengel, Zdenko,1 aTian, Jing1 aLi, Hongbo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5273-19891 aLu, Mingzhen0 tPlant and soil.g2019 Sept., v. 442, no. 1-2 p.97-112dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl49373x0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-019-04161-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02713naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245012500166300001600291520122800307592002801535650001501563650002601578650002101604650001201625650002301637650001701660650001501677650002001692650002101712650001901733650002401752650000701776650001901783650001601802653001901818653001901837653002101856653001501877653001801892653002201910653001901932653003001951653001801981700001601999773009502015856008802110852000902198655001202207IND60479785520221119091132.0160123e20110101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047978552DNAL7 a10.1556/AAlim.40.2011.Suppl.172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRadva, D.10aProduction of new immobilized β-glucosidase preparation for food industrial purposes by using kinetic desorption method  ap. 176-187.  aA new β-glucosidase enzyme preparation for food industrial use was produced. The enzyme was immobilized on an anion exchange resin Amberlite IRA-900 by adsorption followed by cross-linking of the enzyme molecules on the surface of the carrier with glutaraldehyde. To examine and develop the parameters of the steps of the immobilization process, a test method called kinetic desorption method was worked out that permitted the examination of interactions between the enzyme and the carrier. By using the efficiency of kinetic desorption method developed in our laboratory we determined the optimal conditions of procedure: the concentration (0.10 M) of the buffer (sodium acetate pH 5.50), the ratio of the carrier and the enzyme (10:1), the 24 h reaction time at 25 °C for the adsorption step, the pH of the buffer (pH 5.50), the time of treatment (30 min), and the concentration [0.25% (m/v)] of glutaraldehyde for the cross-linking process. The maximum yield of immobilized enzyme activity was 21.4%, the immobilization process changed the pH optimum of catalytic activity from 5.50 to 4.50 and the temperature optimum from 50 °C to 60 °C. The immobilized enzyme is to be tested in various food industrial processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aanion exchange resins 3abeta-glucosidase 3abuffers 3acatalytic activity 3acrosslinking 3adesorption 3aenzyme activity 3afood preparation 3aglutaraldehyde 3aimmobilized enzymes 3apH 3asodium acetate 3atemperature 0aβ-glucosidase 0aimmobilization 0acharacterization 0aadsorption 0across-linking 0aAmberlite IRA-900 0aglutaraldehyde 0akinetic desorption method 0afood industry1 aKosáry, J.0 tActa alimentaria.g2011 Jan. 1, v. 40, no. 0 p.176-187dAkadémiai Kiadóx0139-30067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FAAlim.40.2011.Suppl.173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01960naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245008500175300001600260520069900276592002800975650001601003650003301019650001501052650000901067650001301076650001201089650001201101650002001113650001701133650001201150650001701162650001101179650001501190651001101205700002301216700002401239700001801263700003001281773012501311856008101436852000901517655001201526IND60120015720221120182707.0151123e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012001572DNAL7 a10.1007/s00128-014-1430-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDelgado-Álvarez, C.

The results indicated that the steric effect from the group at the C3 position of the isoxazole had greater influence on the cross-coupling reaction than that from the group at the C5 position. In addition, the group at the C3 position of the isoxazole showed negligible electronic effects on the cross-coupling reaction. Furthermore, a gram-scale reaction of the Sonogashira coupling reaction was also investigated.

While some research to date examining farmers markets discusses the exclusionary aspects of farmers markets, little has expounded on this portrait of the typical shopper. As a result of this neglect, the potential of farmers markets to be an inclusive, sustainable development tool remains hindered. This study seeks to better understand this typical shopper by drawing upon anti-consumerism literature to examine the motivations of these shoppers. Findings from a survey of 390 shoppers in a predominately Hispanic community are discussed. Results from the survey indicate that even in a community in which white, non-Hispanics are the minority, the farmers market shopper is likely to be a white, non-Hispanic female who is more affluent and well educated than the average community member. Theoretical implications and suggestions for those working in community development are discussed. Suggestions for future research are also provided.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHispanics 3acommunity development 3afarmers 3afarmers' markets 3afemales 3amotivation 3asurveys 3asustainable development 3awomen0 tAgriculture and human values.g2015 Mar., v. 32, no. 1 p.21-29dSpringer-Verlagx0889-048X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10460-014-9513-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02428naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245012800168300001600296520120800312592002801520650001601548650001901564650001801583650001101601650001101612650003101623650002001654650001801674650001101692650001601703653002001719653001201739653001001751653001001761653001101771700001801782700001401800773009501814856008801909852000901997655001202006IND60479785720221119091106.0160123e20110101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047978572DNAL7 a10.1556/AAlim.40.2011.Suppl.212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzigedi, T.10aDetermination of protein, lipid and sugar contents of bakery products by using Fourier-transform near infrared spectroscopy  ap. 222-229.  aThe use of Fourier-transform near infrared spectroscopy (FT-NIR) to measure the content of protein, lipid and sugar contents of bakery products was investigated. The samples were dried, homogenized, sieved and measured in the wavelength range of 780–2500 nm. The calibration was based on partial least squares (PLS) regression with cross-validation. The performance of the final model was evaluated according to root mean square of cross-validation (RMSECV), root mean square error of estimation (RMSEE) and the determination coefficient (R<sup>2</sup>).The developed models use the ranges of 1100–1245 nm and 1590–2600 nm for protein determination, 1330–1840 nm and 2170–2350 nm for lipid, 1400–1630 nm, 2000–2170 nm and 2230–2570 nm for sugar determination, respectively. Protein, lipid and sugar could be determined directly with R<sup>2</sup> values of 98.93, 99.07 and 98.81, and RMSECV values of 0.16 m/m%, 0.79 m/m% and 0.28 m/m%, respectively. It can be concluded that FT-NIR spectroscopy can be used for the routine determination of protein, lipid and sugar content of bakery products and it can contribute to the estimation of calorie content in a fast and non-destructive way.  aPublisher supplied data 3abaked goods 3aenergy content 3aleast squares 3alipids 3amodels 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3aprotein content 3asugar content 3asugars 3awavelengths 0abakery products 0aprotein 0alipid 0asugar 0aFT-NIR1 aDernovics, M.1 aFodor, M.0 tActa alimentaria.g2011 Jan. 1, v. 40, no. 0 p.222-229dAkadémiai Kiadóx0139-30067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FAAlim.40.2011.Suppl.213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02751naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245016100165500001400326520123400340592002801574650001901602650000801621650001001629650002501639650001001664650001901674650001101693650001901704650001501723650001301738650002001751650003301771650001801804650002601822653001501848653001801863653003101881653002201912700002001934700001601954700001601970700001801986700005702004773010002061856008702161852000902248655001202257IND60714971620221120180434.0210415e20210416xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071497162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1283592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Yue10aAssessment of fresh star anise (Illicium verum Hook.f.) drying methods for influencing drying characteristics, color, flavor, volatile oil and shikimic acid  aNAL-light  aIn order to evaluate the effects of drying methods on the drying characteristics, quality (color, volatile oil (VO) content, shikimic acid (SA) content, trans-anethole content in the star anise volatile oil (TA-O)) and flavor components of star anise (Illicium verum Hook.f.), we tested five different methods (hot air drying (HAD), heat pump drying (HPD), far infrared radiation drying (FIRD), microwave drying (MD), and sun drying (SD)) with or without blanching to dry fresh star anise. Results showed MD had a shorter drying time than others, as well as the highest SA content (125.56 mg/g d.b.). HPD sample exhibited higher VO content (12.27% d.b.) and TA-O (113.30 mg/g d.b.) than those dried with other methods. HPD can improved the dominant flavor compounds of star anise, including trans-anethole (4165.46 mg/100 g d.b.), estragole (176.50 mg/100 g d.b.), linalool (280.69 mg/100 g d.b.), and (+)-limonene (471.18 mg/100 g d.b.). Samples treated with HPD-B had the highest comprehensive score (4.59) in the flavor principal component analysis. Therefore, HPD was more suitable for star anise drying as it maintaining quality. The better quality (higher flavor quality and better appearance) was found in HPD-B.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIllicium verum 3aair 3aanise 3aappearance (quality) 3acolor 3aessential oils 3aflavor 3afood chemistry 3aheat pumps 3alinalool 3amethyl chavicol 3aprincipal component analysis 3ashikimic acid 3aterrestrial radiation 0aStar anise 0aDrying method 0aPhysicochemical properties 0aFlavor components1 aChen, Guangjing1 aChen, Kewei1 aChen, Xuhui1 aHong, Qingyue1 aKan, Jianquan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4960-73080 tFood chemistry.g2021 Apr. 16, v. 342 p.128359-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1283593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02862naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245016800160300001600328520164300344592002801987650001302015650001202028650002002040650001402060650002202074650001302096650000902109650001202118650001602130651001602146700002102162700001902183700001802202700002202220773015202242856007302394852000902467655001202476IND60519954520221119015323.0160511e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051995452DNAL7 a10.1111/vec.124582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRobben, Joris H.10aEvaluation of a virtual pet visit system with live video streaming of patient images over the Internet in a companion animal intensive care unit in the Netherlands  ap. 384-392.  aOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of a virtual pet visit system (“TelePet” System, TPS) on owners and staff of a companion animal ICU. DESIGN: Longitudinal interventional study (2010–2013). SETTING: Companion animal ICU at a university veterinary medical teaching hospital. STUDY POPULATIONS: Pet owners, ICU technicians. INTERVENTIONS: The introduction of the TPS, with live video streaming of patient images over the Internet, in a companion animal ICU. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Pet owners experienced TPS as a valuable extra service. Most TPS users (72.4%) experienced less anxiety and felt less need (40.4% of TPS users) to visit their hospitalized pet in person. Most users (83.5%) shared TPS access with their family. The introduction of the TPS did not improve overall owner satisfaction, except for the score on “quality of medical treatment.” Seven of 26 indicators of owner satisfaction were awarded higher scores by TPS users than by TPS nonusers in the survey after the introduction of the system. However, the lack of randomization of owners might have influenced findings. The enthusiasm of the ICU technicians for the system was tempered by the negative feedback from a small number of owners. Nevertheless they recognized the value of the system for owners. The system was user friendly and ICU staff and TPS users experienced few technical problems. CONCLUSIONS: As veterinary healthcare is moving toward a more client‐centered approach, a virtual pet visit system, such as TPS, is a relatively simple application that may improve the well‐being of most owners during the hospitalization of their pet.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aanxiety 3ahealth services 3ahospitals 3amedical treatment 3apatients 3apets 3asurveys 3atechnicians 3aNetherlands1 aMelsen, Diede N.1 aAlmalik, Osama1 aRoomer, Wendy1 aEndenburg, Nienke0 tJournal of veterinary emergency and critical care.g2016 May, v. 26, no. 3 p.384-392dVeterinary Emergency & Critical Care Societyx1479-32617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vec.124583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02853naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100003800143245016800181520136500349592002801714650002201742650002501764650002501789650001901814650002201833650001701855650001001872650001601882650001301898650002601911650000701937650001701944650001401961650001901975700002001994700002602014700002602040700001902066700002302085700002202108700001702130700003002147773011902177856007802296852000902374655001202383IND60763429920221123031043.0220120e20220113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076342992DNAL7 a10.3390/foods110202102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMolina-Hernandez, Junior Bernardo10aInfluence of Atmospheric Cold Plasma Exposure on Naturally Present Fungal Spores and Physicochemical Characteristics of Sundried Tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum L.)  aThis research aimed to evaluate the impact of atmospheric cold plasma (ACP) treatment on the fungal spores naturally present in sundried tomatoes, as well as their influence on the physico-chemical properties and antioxidant activity. ACP was performed with a Surface Dielectric Barrier Discharge (SDBD), applying 6 kV at 23 kHz and exposure times up to 30 min. The results showed a significant reduction of mesophilic aerobic bacteria population and of filamentous fungi after the longer ACP exposure. In particular, the effect of the treatment was assessed on Aspergillus rugulovalvus (as sensible strain) and Aspergillus niger (as resistant strain). The germination of the spores was observed to be reliant on the species, with nearly 88% and 32% of non-germinated spores for A. rugulovalvus and A. niger, respectively. Fluorescence probes revealed that ACP affects spore viability promoting strong damage to the wall and cellular membrane. For the first time, the sporicidal effect of ACP against A. rugulovalvus is reported. Physicochemical parameters of sundried tomatoes such as pH and water activity (aw) were not affected by the ACP treatment; on the contrary, the antioxidant activity was not affected while the lycopene content was significantly increased with the increase in ACP exposure time (p ≤ 0.05) probably due to increased extractability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus niger 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aantioxidant activity 3acell membranes 3aexposure duration 3afluorescence 3afungi 3agermination 3alycopene 3anonthermal processing 3apH 3asolar drying 3aviability 3awater activity1 aLaika, Jessica 1 aPeralta-Ruiz, Yeimmy 1 aPalivala, Vinay Kumar1 aTappi, Silvia 1 aCappelli, Filippo 1 aRicci, Antonella 1 aNeri, Lilia 1 aChaves-López, Clemencia 0 tFoods.g2022 Jan. 13, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods110202103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02683naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245013700162300001800299520145000317592002801767650001701795650002101812650002501833650001901858650002601877650001101903650002201914650003301936700001401969700001901983700001502002700001502017700001602032700001802048700001702066773011202083856008102195852000902276655001202285IND60440356820221119033654.0151024e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044035682DNAL7 a10.1007/s12010-015-1657-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Jiajun10aInteractions Between Autotrophic and Heterotrophic Strains Improve CO2 Fixing Efficiency of Non-photosynthetic Microbial Communities  ap. 1459-1471.  aFive autotrophic strains isolated from non-photosynthetic microbial communities (NPMCs), which were screened from oceans with high CO₂ fixing capability, were identified as Ochrobactrum sp. WH-2, Stenotrophomonas sp. WH-11, Ochrobactrum sp. WH-13, Castellaniella sp. WH-14, and Sinomicrobium oceani WH-15. The CO₂ fixation pathways of all these strains were Calvin-Benson-Bassham pathway. These strains could metabolize multifarious organic compounds, which allowed switching them to autotrophic culture after enrichment in heterotrophic culture. The central composite response surface method indicated that these strains possessed many interactive effects, which increased the CO₂ fixing efficiency of a combined community composed of these strains by 56 %, when compared with that of the single strain. Furthermore, another combined community composed of these autotrophic strains and NPMC had richer interactive relationships, with CO₂ fixing efficiency being 894 % higher than that of the single strain and 148 % higher than the theoretical sum of the CO₂ fixing efficiency of each of its microbial components. The interaction between strictly heterotrophic bacteria in NPMC and isolated autotrophic strains played a crucial role in improving the CO₂ fixing efficiency, which not only eliminated self-restraint of organic compounds generated during the growth of autotrophic bacteria but also promoted its autotrophic pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOchrobactrum 3aStenotrophomonas 3aautotrophic bacteria 3acarbon dioxide 3amicrobial communities 3aoceans 3aorganic compounds 3aresponse surface methodology1 aWang, Lei1 aZhang, Shiping1 aXi, Xuefei1 aLe, Yiquan1 aFu, Xiaohua1 aTsang, Yiufai1 aGao, Mintian0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2015 July, v. 176, no. 5 p.1459-1471dSpringer USx0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-015-1657-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02725naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003200140245011300172520151500285592002801800650001301828650001101841650003501852650001601887650002501903650001501928650000901943650001601952650001701968650001501985650001102000651001102011700003702022700003302059700003702092773012702129856007402256852000902330655001202339IND60652967520221120113716.0190713e20190524xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065296752DNAL7 a10.3390/su111029552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Costa, Adriana  Monteiro10aGroundwater Recharge Potential for Sustainable Water Use in Urban Areas of the Jequitiba River Basin, Brazil  aThe zoning of groundwater recharge potential would be attractive for water managers, but is lacking in many regions around the planet, including in the Jequitiba River basin, Minas Gerais, Brazil. In this study, a physically based spatially distributed method to evaluate groundwater recharge potential at catchment scale was developed and tested in the aforementioned Jequitiba River basin. The data for the test was compiled from institutional sources and implemented in a Geographic Information System. It comprised meteorological, hydrometric, relief, land use, and soil data. The average results resembled the annual recharge calculated by a hydrograph method, which worked as validation method. The spatial variation of recharge highlighted the predominant contribution of flat areas, porous aquifers, and forested regions to groundwater recharge. They also exposed the negative effect of urbanization. In combination, these factors elected the following sectors of the Jequitiba River basin as regions of high recharge potential: the south-southeast part of the headwaters in Prudente de Morais; Sete Lagoas towards the central part of the basin; and the region between Funil&acirc;ndia and Jequitiba, near the Jequitiba river mouth. Some management practices were suggested to improve groundwater recharge. The map of groundwater recharge potential produced in this study is valuable and is therefore proposed as tool for planners in the sustainable use of groundwater and protection of recharge areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3abasins 3ageographic information systems 3agroundwater 3agroundwater recharge 3ahydrograph 3asoil 3aurban areas 3aurbanization 3awatersheds 3azoning 3aBrazil1 ade Salis, Hugo  Henrique Cardoso1 aViana, João  Hebert Moreira1 aLeal Pacheco, Fernando  António0 tSustainability.g2019 May 24, v. 11, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su111029553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02527naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245008000164300001600244520132000260592002801580650002001608650001401628650002301642650001601665650001801681650001701699650001101716650002501727650001701752650001301769650004001782653001401822653001701836653001901853653001701872700001601889773012101905856008202026852000902108655001202117IND60528694420221117035100.0160716e20160610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052869442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.05.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Renzeng10aFibulin-4 is a novel Wnt/β-Catenin pathway activator in human osteosarcoma  ap. 730-735.  aFibulin-4, an extracellular glycoprotein implicated in connective tissue development and elastic fiber formation, draws increasing focuses in cancer research. However, little is known about the underlying oncogenic roles of Fibulin-4 in human osteosarcoma (OS). In this study, by immunohistochemical analysis, upregulated expression of Fibulin-4 was found in the OS clinical specimens and cell lines compared to their normal counterparts. Fibulin-4 was positively correlated with the T stage of OS patients, and the proliferation index Ki67. Based on informatics analysis and functional verification, microRNA-137 was identified as a potential upstream regulator of Fibulin-4. Knockdown of Fibulin-4 or introduction of microRNA-137 inhibited cell proliferation and promoted cell apoptosis, and adverse effects were observed by overexpression of Fibulin-4. Furthermore, the tumor-suppressive functions of microRNA-137 were markedly abolished by restoration of Fibulin-4 expression in OS cells. Mechanistically, Fibulin-4 activated Wnt/β-Catenin pathway and promoted the expression of its downstream targets, including CCND2, c-Myc and VEGF. Taken together, Fibulin-4 plays critical neoplastic roles in tumor growth of human OS by activating Wnt/β-Catenin signaling and may represent a potential therapeutic target.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aapoptosis 3acell proliferation 3acorrelation 3aglycoproteins 3ahuman growth 3ahumans 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aosteosarcoma 3apatients 3avascular endothelial growth factors 0aFibulin-4 0aMicroRNA-137 0aWnt/β-Catenin 0aOsteosarcoma1 aWang, Limin0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2016 June 10, v. 474 p.730-735dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.05.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03254naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245013600167300001600303520174100319592002802060650002402088650001902112650001802131650001302149650002902162650002402191650002302215650001402238650001802252650001502270650002102285650001902306650001902325650002102344650001902365650001502384650001902399650001802418653002902436653001902465653001302484653002602497653001802523700001702541773009602558856008502654852000902739655001202748IND60589491320221122053331.0201125e20180515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058949132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2018.02.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Huacheng10aIntriguing changes in molecular size and composition of dissolved organic matter induced by microbial degradation and self-assembly  ap. 187-194.  aDissolved organic matter (DOM) is ubiquitous and plays an important role in regulating water quality, ecological function, and the fate and transport of trace elements and pollutants in aquatic environments. Both the colloidal precursors (i.e. <1 kDa) and bulk DOM collected from a freshwater estuary were incubated in the dark for 21 days to examine dynamic changes in molecular size and composition induced by microbial degradation and self-assembly. Results showed that the concentrations of total organic carbon, carbohydrates, and protein-like substances decreased by 11–30% during incubation, while those of humic- and fulvic-like substances remained relatively constant, indicating humic substances are more resistant to microbial utilization compared to carbohydrates and protein-like DOM. Despite the different extents in decline, these DOM components had a similar transformation pathway from the <1 kDa to colloids (1 kDa–0.45 μm) and further to microparticles (>0.45 μm). Overall, carbohydrates and protein-like substances, especially the high molecular weight components, were preferentially decomposed by microorganisms whereas humic- and fulvic-like DOM components significantly coagulated through abiotic self-assembly. The contrasting degradation/transformation pathways between the humic-like and protein-like substances along the size continuum, as also characterized by flow field-flow fractionation analysis, demonstrated that the dynamic transformation and degradation of DOM is regulated by both molecular size and organic composition. This finding provides new insights into the biogeochemical cycling pathways of heterogeneous DOM and its environmental fate and ecological role in aquatic systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic environment 3abiodegradation 3acarbohydrates 3acolloids 3adissolved organic matter 3aecological function 3aenvironmental fate 3aestuaries 3afractionation 3afreshwater 3ahumic substances 3amicroorganisms 3amicroparticles 3amolecular weight 3aorganic carbon 3apollutants 3atrace elements 3awater quality 0aDissolved organic matter 0aSize continuum 0aColloids 0aMicrobial degradation 0aSelf-assembly1 aGuo, Laodong0 tWater research.g2018 May 15, v. 135 p.187-194dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2018.02.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01427naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245007000172300001400242520051300256592002800769650001400797650001100811651001200822700002000834700002200854700002000876700001800896773008200914856008500996990002301081852000901104655001201113IND60096265420221119213449.0141104e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009626542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cretres.2011.11.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRyan, Michael J.10aNew leptoceratopsids from the Upper Cretaceous of Alberta, Canada  ap. 69-80.  aTwo new leptoceratopsid neoceratopsians are described based on partial dentaries collected from the Dinosaur Park (Campanian) and Milk River (Santonian) formations of Alberta.

Here, we report the development, analytical characterization and performance evaluation of a colorimetric assay as a comprehensive test for quantitative detection, screening and reactivity evaluation of nanoceria (cerium oxide, CeO2) particles in aqueous environments. We provide a critical discussion of the role of environmental conditions including pH, ionic composition, and presence of humic acid and particle type on the overall performance and sensitivity of this assay. The method is based on the strong oxidation ability of nanoceria for organic dyes such as 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) and 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethyl-benzidine dihydrochloride hydrate (TMB). Performance characteristics were established with a series of commercially available NPs of varying sizes dispersed in different environments. The results demonstrate that colorimetric assays can be used as a rapid and cost effective way to characterize nanoceria. The method enables identification and selective detection of nanoceria among other metal oxides including Fe2O3, TiO2, Sb2O3, ZnO, SiO2, and Al2O3. Applicability of the method for detection of nanoceria in environmental water samples is demonstrated. Recommendations are provided on the selection of the reaction conditions to ensure validity and reliability of measurements. The assay offers an effective and inexpensive alternative to advanced spectroscopic instrumentation, as a screening assay for nanoceria in environmental water. The method can be used as a general tool for the analytical characterization of redox active nanomaterials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3aceric oxide 3acolorimetry 3acost effectiveness 3adyes 3aenvironmental factors 3aferric oxide 3ahumic acids 3ainstrumentation 3ananoparticles 3aoxidation 3apH 3ascreening 3asilica 3aspectroscopy 3atitanium dioxide 3azinc oxide 0aNanoceria 0aNanoparticle detection 0aMetal oxide selectivity 0aColorimetric assay1 aBear, Kristen1 aAndreescu, Silvana0 tTalanta.g2017 Mar. 01, v. 164 p.668-676dElsevier B.V.x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2016.10.1043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02379naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245015600163300001400319520113700333592002801470650001701498650001501515650001101530650001401541650002301555650001301578650002101591650001801612650001101630650001201641653002201653653003701675653001601712700001601728700001801744700001501762773010001777856008301877852000901960655001201969IND60682191720221122120540.0200228e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068219172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2020.01.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Ping10aIn situ generation of perovskite oxides and carbon composites: A facile, effective and generalized route to prepare catalysts with improved performance  ap. 88-96.  aThe adsorption and delivery of reactants to active sites are the first two steps of catalytic reactions, however, which receive less attention compared with the design of highly active sites. Herein, we provide an improvement of the two crucial steps by designing perovskite oxides-carbon composites (LaFeO₃_N) for catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) of furfural to furfuryl alcohol. The principle is to ensure that the reactants can be timely supplied to the active sites for reaction. Indeed, the reaction rate over LaFeO₃_N increases tremendously to 5.17 mmol g⁻¹ h⁻¹ that is 6 times higher than that over LaFeO₃_A (0.81 mmol g⁻¹ h⁻¹) without carbon material. The results suggest that LaFeO₃_N can improve the migration of reactants from solution to LaFeO₃ active sites due to the presence of carbon, which has the ability to absorb and deliver the reactants. Effects of carbon content and carbon texture on the reaction are fully investigated. The current strategy of improving the catalytic performances of perovskite oxides can be easily applied to other catalytic systems with low surface area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3aadsorption 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3afurfural 3afurfuryl alcohol 3ahydrogenation 3aoxides 3atexture 0aLaFeO3 perovskite 0aCatalytic transfer hydrogenation 0aIsopropanol1 aXu, Xuelian1 aZhu, Junjiang1 aZhu, Yujun0 tJournal of catalysis.g2020 Mar., v. 383 p.88-96dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2020.01.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01731naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245010900170300001600279520051400295592002800809650002400837650001300861650001100874650001200885650001000897650002800907650002300935651001800958653001300976653001500989653001501004653002101019653001201040653001001052700002301062773015401085856008501239852000901324655001201333IND60131004620221120051631.0151127e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013100462DNAL7 a10.4289/0013-8797.115.4.3162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDennis, D.

Measurement of the ZAG levels was performed using a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.The ZAG levels were found to be significantly higher among AIDS patients compared to the healthy individuals (P=0.033). A total of 56 (70%) of the AIDS patients were found to have higher levels of ZAG and 16 (20%) AIDS patients were found to have high ZAG levels, which are significantly (P>0.031) associated with weight loss.ZAG levels are high among Omani AIDS patients on cART and this necessitates the measurement of ZAG on routine basis, as it is associated with weight loss.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantiretroviral agents 3ablood donors 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afemales 3ahospitals 3amales 3apatients 3atherapeutics 3aweight loss 3aOman 0aZinc-α-2-glycoprotein 0aAIDS 0aCombined antiretroviral therapy 0aLevels1 aAl-Balushi, Mohammed Saeed1 aYahmadi, Muzna Hamed Al1 aAl-Busaidi, Juma Zaid1 aSaid, Elias Antony1 aOthman, Mohammed Shafeeq1 aSallam, Talal Abdullah1 aIdris, Mohammed Ahmad1 aAl-Jabri, Ali Abdullah0 tAsian Pacific Journal of Tropical Biomedicine.g2014 Aug., v. 4 p.610-613dElsevier B.V.aHainan Medical Universityx2221-16917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.12980/APJTB.4.201414B1263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02574naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245010700163300002000270500001900290520099200309592002801301650002201329650001501351650001601366650002101382700005901403700001901462700006201481700002001543700005901563700002001622700005801642700005701700700002101757700002401778700002201802700002001824700006201844773014901906856007602055852000902131655001202140IND60704257320221116230209.0200722e20200622xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070425732DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.0c036432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOmoto, Kenichiro10aThermosalience in Macrocycle-Based Soft Crystals via Anisotropic Deformation of Disilanyl Architecture  ap. 12651-12657.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe describe here the preparation of soft crystals using disilanyl macrocycle C4 possessing four p-phenylenes circularly connected by four flexible disilane bonds. Single crystals of C4 exhibited a reversible thermal single-crystal-to-single-crystal (SCSC) phase transition behavior between two crystal phases accompanied by remarkable mechanical motion (thermosalient effect), as revealed by thermal analyses and X-ray diffraction measurements. Detailed structural analyses implied that flexibility of the parallelogram disilanyl architecture and molecular packing mode via weak intermolecular interactions facilitated a concerted structural transformation (parallel crank motion) of macrocycles in the crystal, thus resulting in the SCSC phase transition accompanied by anisotropic shrinking/elongation of the cells to induce the thermosalient effect. This work explores a new area of organosilicon chemistry and presents the potential utility of disilanyl macrocycles as soft crystals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aanisotropy 3adeformation 3aphase transition1 aNakae, Toyotaka1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3971-06111 aNishio, Masaki1 aYamanoi, Yoshinori1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6155-23571 aKasai, Hidetaka1 aNishibori, Eiji1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4192-65771 aMashimo, Takaki1 aSeki, Tomohiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4642-13241 aItō, Hajime,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3852-67211 aNakamura, Kazuki1 aKobayashi, Norihisa1 aNakayama, Naofumi1 aGotoh, Hitoshi,1 aNishihara, Hiroshi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6568-56400 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2020 June 22, v. 142, no. 29 p.12651-12657dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.0c036433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02119naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001600112245008900128300001400217520097700231592002801208650001401236650001101250650001901261650001201280650001001292650001201302650002701314650001301341650001001354650000701364650001501371650001401386650002001400650001201420650001801432651001001450653002001460653004701480700001701527773014401544852000901688655001201697IND60706311120221119144515.0200807e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070631112DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDubey, S.K.10aCharacterization of Rhizobium from various non-traditional arid legume crops in M.P.  ap. 90-93.  aAn attempt has been made to characterize the Rhizobia isolated from non traditionalarid legume crops viz., cowpea, moth and guarfrom various regions of Madhya Pradesh. All the isolates were characterized phenotypically and biochemically. Growth of pure Rhizobial isolates on yeast extract mannitol (YEM) medium having variable range of pH (4.0 to 10.0), different concentrations of PEG (30%, 45% and 60%) and NaCl (0.1 to 1M) have been studied to screen out stress tolerant isolates. Among the eight isolates, cowpea isolate R1 are able to produce auxin 42.37 μg/ml and EPS 689.97 μg/ml and R2 isolate of cowpea are also able to solubilize 230.26 μg/ml phosphates. Moth isolate R5 are able to tolerate 1000mM concentration of NaCl and guar isolate R7 are able to survive up to 60% drought. The stress tolerant traits of these Rhizobia are of potential value from the point of view of biofertilization of legume seedlings in arid and semi-arid tropics of Madhya Pradesh.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhizobium 3aauxins 3abiofertilizers 3acowpeas 3acrops 3adrought 3afertilizer application 3amannitol 3amoths 3apH 3aphosphates 3aseedlings 3asodium chloride 3atropics 3ayeast extract 3aIndia 0aroot nodulation 0aabiotic stress and plant growth regulators1 aGupta, Radha0 tJournal of food legumes.g2015 Jan., v. 28, no. 1 p.90-93dIndian Society of Pulses Research and DevelopmentwJournal:2075x0976-24347nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03221naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002000138245006600158300001600224520176600240592002802006650001702034650002002051650001602071650002302087650000902110650002402119650001202143650001302155650001102168650001902179650002202198650001002220650001302230650001202243653001802255653001002273653001502283653001002298653002302308653002102331653002402352700002402376700002302400700002002423700002602443773015302469856007202622852000902694655001202703IND60744174220221118091731.0210709e20210707xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074417422DNAL7 a10.1647/19-000242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBéland, Karine10aImpact of Dietary Fructose on the Lipid Profile in Six Macaws  ap. 196-203.  aAtherosclerosis is frequently diagnosed in captive parrots. Recent studies have highlighted the potential role of high fructose intake in the development of human cardiovascular disease. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of dietary fructose on the lipid profile in psittacine birds. Six macaws, composed of 3 green-winged macaws (Ara chloropterus, 2 females, 1 male), and 3 blue-and-gold macaws (Ara ararauna, 1 female, 2 males), ranging from 15 to 26 years of age, were used as subject animals for this dietary investigation. Initially, fruits were removed from the diet and replaced with vegetables lower in fructose for a month. Then, with a crossover study design, each bird was randomly selected to receive either 34 kcal of a fructose solution daily for 5 days then an equivalent volume of water for 5 days, or water in the first 5 days followed by the 34 kcal fructose solution. Lipid profiles were repeatedly performed over the course of the study at specific intervals. Serum cholesterol (3.01–5.55 mmol/L), triglycerides (0.27–2.70 mmol/L), high-density lipoprotein–cholesterol (1.43–4.79 mmol/L), low-density lipoprotein–cholesterol (0.02–0.85 mmol/L), and very low density lipoprotein–cholesterol (0.12–1.22 mmol/L) levels were not statistically significantly different over time and treatment. Although no significant effect could be demonstrated in this study, further studies are needed to investigate the effect of a high fructose intake in psittacine birds, because it could have a deleterious influence on their cardiovascular health if proven to be linked with dyslipidemia as reported in humans. Higher amounts of fructose and longer periods of administration should be considered for future studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAra ararauna 3aatherosclerosis 3ablood serum 3across-over studies 3adiet 3aexperimental design 3afemales 3afructose 3ahumans 3ahyperlipidemia 3alipid composition 3amales 3amedicine 3asurgery 0alipid profile 0aLDL-C 0apsittacine 0aavian 0agreen-winged macaw 0aAra chloropterus 0ablue-and-gold macaw1 aFerrell, Shannon T.1 aBeaufrère, Hugues1 aLair, Stéphane1 aDesmarchelier, Marion0 tJournal of avian medicine and surgery.g2021 July 7, v. 35, no. 2 p.196-203dAssociation of Avian VeterinarianswJournal:J000000099x1082-67427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1647/19-000243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01495naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245014300158300002000301520039200321592002800713650002300741650002300764650001000787650002000797700001700817700001800834700001600852700001800868700001400886700001200900700001400912773013600926856007401062852000901136655001201145IND60660998920221117000021.0190827e20150618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066099892DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cc03492b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Chenglong10aHigh performance full color OLEDs based on a class of molecules with dual carrier transport channels and small singlet–triplet splitting  ap. 10632-10635.  aTwo deep blue emitting materials PPI-PPITPA and PPI-PPIPCz with dual carrier transport properties and small singlet–triplet splitting features are designed and synthesized.

VLPs were determined after staining with SYBR Gold by conventional epifluorescence microscopy and compared to enumerations performed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). In order to assess the potential of CLSM for viral direct counts (VDCs), we processed samples from different freshwater and marine systems. Optical sectioning by CLSM and production of an overlay picture of multiple scans enables the often uneven whole investigated filter area to be brought to the plane of focus. This allows for subsequent image analysis of digitally created high-quality images. Another advantage using the CLSM was that the short spot excitation of the stain via laser beam minimized fading of the stain. The VDC results show that there is no significant difference between the two methods. Regarding the known difficulties of viral abundance estimates on particulate material, CLSM was further applied to enumerate VLPs on a small set of marine transparent exopolymeric particles sampled from the Atlantic Ocean. Our data suggest that CLSM is a useful tool to count viruses in water samples as well as attached to certain types of aquatic aggregates.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3afreshwater 3aimage analysis 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3alasers 3amonitoring 3avirus-like particles 3abacteriophages 3aaquatic environment 3afilters 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aFresh Waterxvirology 2aMicroscopy, Confocal 2aSeawaterxvirology 2aVirionxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 3aAtlantic Ocean 0aAtlantic Ocean 0aconfocal scanning laser microscopy1 aAgis, Martin1 aLuef, Birgit0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2013 July, v. 185, no. 7 p.5411-5418dSpringer-Verlagx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-012-2955-8  aDNAL 7aarticle02150naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245008200169300001600251520117100267592002801438650001201466650001901478650002301497650002201520650002501542650002801567650002501595773013701620856008201757852000901839655001201848IND60516412320221116153254.0190801e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051641232DNAL7 a10.1017/S1355770X140001992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBretschger, Lucas10aEnvironment and development: achievements and challenges in climate economics  ap. 292-294.  aThe economic analysis of the natural environment and of economic development encompasses most complex topics and issues. Accordingly, many contributions in the field are either cross-disciplinary or very detailed and broad in perspective. The core methodology of economics is different, however. Economic models are generally used to drastically reduce complexity and to look at a low number of analytical relationships. This allows for analysis of the basic mechanics of the problems in a concise manner and for the derivation of closed-form model solutions. There are of course seminal contributions using the procedure, e.g., Hotelling (1931) and Dasgupta and Heal (1974). But for the crucial issue of climate change the profession appears to be somewhat reluctant to push strongly for constructing a stringent analytical framework; the field is still dominated by relatively complex integrated assessment models. These yield many important insights but, in certain cases, provide contradicting results and sometimes lack intuition. Hence, climate economic models providing closed-form solutions on future growth and optimum climate policy appear to be warranted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aeconometric models 3aeconomic analysis 3aeconomic development 3aenvironmental economics 3aenvironmental policy0 tEnvironment and development economics.g2014 June, v. 19, no. 3 p.292-294dCambridge University PresswJournal:2151x1469-43957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1355770X140001993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02733naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100007600140245011000216300001800326500002000344520135900364592002801723650002001751650001501771650002101786650001101807650001501818650001401833650001301847650001501860650001501875650000901890650001101899650002301910650002301933650001801956700005801974700006202032773013302094856007502227852000902302655001202311IND60788208820221122230711.0220811e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078820882DNAL7 a10.1002/jeq2.201652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKristoffersen, Annbjørg Øverli1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1568-779510aPrediction of available phosphorus in soil: Combined use for crop production and water quality protection  ap. 1575-1584.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOptimizing phosphorus (P) application to agricultural soils is fundamental to crop production and water quality protection. We sought to relate soil P tests and P sorption characteristics to both crop yield response to P application and environmentally critical soil P status. Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) was grown in pot experiments with 45 soils of different P status. Half the pots were fertilized at 20 kg P ha⁻¹, and half received no P. Soils were extracted with ammonium lactate, sodium bicarbonate (Olsen P), dilute salt (0.0025 M CaCl₂), and diffusive gradient in thin films. Soil adsorption coefficients were determined using the Freundlich isotherm equation, and the degree of P saturation was determined from both oxalate and ammonium lactate extracted Fe, Al, and P. All soil P analyses showed a nonlinear and significant relationship with yield response to P application, and all analyses manifested a threshold value above which no P response was observed. For the commonly used ammonium lactate test, inclusion of Al and Fe improved prediction of plant‐available soil P. The threshold for yield response coincided with the environmentally critical values determined from the degree of P saturation. Results support the conclusion that soil P levels for which no P application is needed also have elevated risk of P loss to runoff.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHordeum vulgare 3aadsorption 3aammonium lactate 3abarley 3acrop yield 3aequations 3aoxalates 3aphosphorus 3aprediction 3arisk 3arunoff 3asodium bicarbonate 3asorption isotherms 3awater quality1 aKrogstad, Tore1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4728-63011 aØgaard, Anne Falk1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1600-946X0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2020 Nov., v. 49, no. 6 p.1575-1584dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jeq2.201653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02609naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001600156245009600172300001400268520138200282592002801664650001201692650002301704650002501727650000901752650002001761650001301781650001401794650001101808650002301819650001101842650001501853650001401868650001801882650001201900700002801912700001301940700001601953773011901969856009002088852000902178655001202187IND60439583520221119224718.0151024e200209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043958352DNAL7 a10.1023/B:FISH.0000021817.98363.472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRibeiro, L.10aDigestive enzymes profile of Solea senegalensis post larvae fed Artemia and a compound diet  ap. 61-69.  aThe objective of this experiment was to analyse the digestive enzyme profile of Solea senegalensis post larvae fed two diets, live Artemia sp. metanauplii and ICES diet. The experiment lasted 46 days and the ICES diet group was co-fed with a decreasing percentage of Artemia sp. for 39 days. Post larvae were fed twice a day and the amount of food supplied was determined based on the predicted maximum growth attainable. The Artemia treatment exhibited higher growth and survival rates than the ICES treatment. Trypsin, amylase, pepsin, alkaline phosphatase and leucine-alanine peptidase activities (specific activity: U mg protein⁻¹; segmental activity: U larva⁻¹) were measured in the post larvae digestive tract. Amylase secretion was significantly higher in the ICES treatment, while trypsin secretion was lower. Alkaline phosphatase was adversely and significantly affected by the ICES diet. Leucine-alanine peptidase specific activity was higher in the ICES treatment indicating a delay in the enterocyte maturation also evidenced by the enterocyte maturation index. Alkaline phosphatase and amylase segmental activity had a good correlation with larval growth rate, and may function as a nutritional indicator. This study suggests that compound diet can be included in the feeding sequences of sole larvae as early as 36 day post hatching (697 degree days).  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemia 3aSolea senegalensis 3aalkaline phosphatase 3adiet 3adigestive tract 3ahatching 3aheat sums 3alarvae 3alarval development 3apepsin 3apostlarvae 3asecretion 3asurvival rate 3atrypsin1 aZambonino-Infante, J.L.1 aCahu, C.1 aDinis, M.T.0 tFish physiology and biochemistry.g2002 Sept., v. 27, no. 1-2 p.61-69dKluwer Academic Publishersx0920-17427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:FISH.0000021817.98363.473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03790naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245016300160300002000323520190600343592002802249650001302277650001502290650002002305650001702325650001802342650001302360650001902373650001102392650001502403650002202418650002502440653002102465653001502486653005102501653002602552653002102578700005802599700001902657700001702676700001802693700001902711700005102730700001702781700001702798700001602815700001502831700001302846700001802859700005302877700005402930773014102984856007803125852000903203655001203212IND60645701620221119111905.0190529e20190506xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064570162DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b025912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Xiaowei10aStrategy of Constructing Light-Weight and Highly Compressible Graphene-Based Aerogels with an Ordered Unique Configuration for Wearable Piezoresistive Sensors  ap. 19350-19362.  aThree-dimensional (3D) graphene aerogels (GAs) have attracted huge attention from researchers due to their great potential in vast applications. The hydrothermal reaction combined with freeze-drying using graphene oxide (GO) as a precursor has proven to be an effective method for obtaining relatively well-structured pure GAs. However, insufficient mechanical strength and low compressibility of the materials still limit their practical applications. Here, we report the microstructure-induced strong mechanical anisotropy of these monolithic GAs in transverse direction (TD) and longitudinal direction (LD), which has never been considered to be related to structural vulnerability. To overcome this anisotropy and enhance the structure, we hereby introduce our self-made poly(vinyl alcohol)-co-polyethylene (PVA-co-PE) nanofibers and low-molecular weight PVA as structural enhancers into the original 3D network to form a novel nanofiber–graphene composite aerogel. Intriguingly, a unique configuration is formed in the GA, in which the highly aligned stacked reduced GO sheets serve as the framework (cellular walls) and the nanofibers act as cross-linking columns anchored between the walls to support the structure along the TD, whereas the micro/nanosized PVA lamellae serve as binders. The resulting aerogel (referred to as graphene–PVA-co-PE nanofibers–PVA aerogel (GNPA)) has excellent compressive resilience along the TD and exhibits an ultrahigh gauge factor (14387%) at a very subtle strain (0.23%) in piezoresistive properties. The GNPA-TD has also been assembled into a variety of wearable sensors and demonstrates great potential for wireless human pressure sensing. In short, this study offers an extremely simple and effective method for developing graphene aerogels with a strong mechanical structure and paves the way for the application of 3D graphene in wearable sensors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerogels 3aanisotropy 3acompressibility 3acrosslinking 3afreeze drying 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3ahumans 3ananofibers 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3astrength (mechanics) 0agraphene aerogel 0aanisotropy 0apoly(vinyl alcohol)-co-polyethylene nanofibers 0amechanical properties 0awearable sensors1 aLiu, Qiongzhen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3087-60811 aZhong, Weibing1 aChen, Jiahui1 aSun, Dengming1 aJiang, Haiqing1 aLiu, Ke1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5090-81861 aWang, Wenwen1 aWang, Yuedan1 aLu, Zhentan1 aLi, Mufang1 aLiu, Xue1 aWang, Xiaojun1 aSun, Gang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6608-99711 aWang, Dong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8139-85020 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 May 06, v. 11, no. 21 p.19350-19362dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b025913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03982naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002000138245014600158300001600304520196000320592002802280650001102308650001502319650002702334650001002361650002002371650001902391650001902410650001402429650001002443650002502453650002002478650001002498650001802508650001202526650001502538650001502553650001302568650001302581650001602594650001402610650001902624650002402643650001502667650001302682650001202695653002102707653001102728653002802739653002102767653002302788653001202811653001002823653003602833653003202869700001902901700003002920700003902950700004002989700003303029773015303062856007203215852000903287655001203296IND60744174420221118091727.0210709e20210707xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074417442DNAL7 a10.1647/20-000242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHurtado, Renata10aSuccessful Treatment of Capture Myopathy and Satellite Transmitter Injury in an Atlantic Yellow-nosed Albatross (Thalassarche chlororhynchos)  ap. 210-216.  aAn Atlantic yellow-nosed albatross (Thalassarche chlororhynchos) was found on shore 3 days after having been captured at sea by researchers. It presented very lethargic, moderately dehydrated, and in poor body condition. It was mildly hypothermic, with moderate pediculosis, and dark malodorous feces with yellow urates. The bird had a 48-g satellite transmitter attached with a backpack-style chest harness, which caused an ulcerative lesion on the interscapular area. The bird was severely anemic (packed cell volume, 18%), and plasma chemistry results were suggestive of a severe rhabdomyolysis (aspartate transaminase, 3620 U/L; creatine kinase, 100 400 U/L). We hypothesized that capture myopathy occurred because of a combination of capture stress and prolonged physical restraint by researchers, stress associated with repeated attempts by the bird to remove the satellite-transmitter harness, and a lengthy road transport to the rehabilitation center. A treatment protocol, which relied on a combination of aggressive fluid therapy, selenium, vitamins E and B₁₂, and multivitamin supplementation, was administered after the initial physical assessment of the albatross. Isoflurane inhalation anesthesia was used to minimize stress associated with the performed medical procedures (eg, physical examination, removal of the satellite transmitter harness, blood collection, and wound management). Measures were adopted while the bird was hospitalized to reduce stress (eg, quiet and comfortable environment with visual barriers and restricting handling of the patient to experienced staff). Clinical and hematological monitoring was used to assess the patient's condition as the bird gradually recovered while hospitalized. The albatross was successfully released 28 days after the initial presentation, suggesting that the medical protocol employed in this case may be useful for the treatment of capture myopathy in albatrosses and other birds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanemia 3aanesthesia 3aaspartate transaminase 3abirds 3ablood chemistry 3ablood sampling 3abody condition 3abreathing 3achest 3aclinical examination 3acreatine kinase 3afeces 3afluid therapy 3aharness 3ahematocrit 3aisoflurane 3amedicine 3apatients 3apediculosis 3aprotocols 3arhabdomyolysis 3aroad transportation 3asatellites 3aselenium 3asurgery 0acapture myopathy 0astress 0awildlife rehabilitation 0abackpack harness 0asatellite tracking 0aseabird 0aavian 0aAtlantic yellow-nosed albatross 0aThalassarche chlororhynchos1 aEgert, Leandro1 aSantos, Allan Poltronieri1 ado Nascimento Silva, Roberto Rossi1 aAragão do Amaral, Ingridh Nazareth1 aThijl Vanstreels, Ralph Eric0 tJournal of avian medicine and surgery.g2021 July 7, v. 35, no. 2 p.210-216dAssociation of Avian VeterinarianswJournal:J000000099x1082-67427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1647/20-000243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02701naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245014700172300001600319520117700335592002801512650002101540650001201561650002201573650002401595650002001619650002001639650001501659650001301674650001701687650001301704650001801717650001301735650001301748650001401761650001501775650001601790653002801806653001801834653001301852653001701865653004301882700002201925700007001947773009602017856008502113852000902198655001202207IND60589492020221123042026.0201125e20180515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058949202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2018.02.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFigdore, Bryce A.10aBioaugmentation of sidestream nitrifying-denitrifying phosphorus-accumulating granules in a low-SRT activated sludge system at low temperature  ap. 241-250.  aSidestream granular activated sludge grown on anaerobic digester dewatering centrate was bioaugmented and selectively retained to enable high nitrification performance of a 2.5-day aerobic SRT non-nitrifying flocculent activated sludge system at 12 °C. Sidestream-grown granules performed enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) and short-cut nitrogen removal via nitrite. After bioaugmentation, EBPR continued in the mainstream but ammonia oxidation was eventually to nitrate. Low effluent NH₃-N concentrations from 0.6 to 1.7 mg/L were achieved with nitrification solely by granules, thus enabling denitrification and nitrogen removal. Molecular microbial analyses of flocs and granules also suggested that nitrifying organisms persisted on granules with minimal nitrifier loss to flocs. Mainstream granule mass at the end of bioaugmentation testing was 1.7 times the amount of sidestream granules added, indicating mainstream granular growth. Nitrite and nitrate availability during the unaerated feeding period encouraged significant growth of ordinary heterotrophs in mainstream granules, but nevertheless mainstream nitrification capacity was sustained.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3aammonia 3aammonium nitrogen 3aanaerobic digesters 3abioaugmentation 3adenitrification 3adewatering 3agranules 3aheterotrophs 3anitrates 3anitrification 3anitrites 3anitrogen 3aoxidation 3aphosphorus 3atemperature 0aAerobic granular sludge 0aNitrification 0aCentrate 0aReject water 0aEnhanced biological phosphorus removal1 aDavid Stensel, H.1 aWinkler, Mari-Karoliina H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8366-32930 tWater research.g2018 May 15, v. 135 p.241-250dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2018.02.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03535naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100002000169245016700189300001800356520187500374592002802249650003302277650001802310650001002328650001602338650001102354650002202365650000902387650001002396650001602406650001502422650001002437650001802447650001702465650001602482650001702498650001202515650001402527650000902541650001102550650001002561650002402571650003202595650001402627650001902641650001702660650003002677700001902707700001502726700001802741773010302759856008602862852000902948655001202957IND4462236420221122030106.0141110e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446223642DNAL7 a218199912pmid7 a10.1016/j.jinsphys.2011.07.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCicero, Lizette10aEffect of larval host food substrate on egg load dynamics, egg size and adult female size in four species of braconid fruit fly (Diptera: Tephritidae) parasitoids  ap. 1471-1479.  aLife history theory predicts that individuals will allocate resources to different traits so as to maximize overall fitness. Because conditions experienced during early development can have strong downstream effects on adult phenotype and fitness, we investigated how four species of synovigenic, larval-pupal parasitoids that vary sharply in their degree of specialization (niche breadth) and life history (Diachasmimorpha longicaudata, Doryctobracon crawfordi, Opius hirtus and Utetes anastrephae), allocate resources acquired during the larval stage towards adult reproduction. Parasitoid larvae developed in a single host species reared on four different substrates that differed in quality. We measured parasitoid egg load at the moment of emergence and at 24h, egg numbers over time, egg size, and also adult size. We predicted that across species the most specialized would have a lower capacity to respond to changes in host substrate quality than wasps with a broad host range, and that within species, females that emerged from hosts that developed in better quality substrates would have the most resources to invest in reproduction. Consistent with our predictions, the more specialized parasitoids were less plastic in some responses to host diet than the more generalist. However, patterns of egg load and size were variable across species. In general, there was a remarkable degree of reproductive effort-allocation constancy within parasitoid species. This may reflect more “time-limited” rather than “egg-limited” foraging strategies where the most expensive component of reproductive success is to locate and handle patchily-distributed and fruit-sequestered hosts. If so, egg costs, independent of degree of specialization, are relatively trivial and sufficient resources are available in fly larvae stemming from all of the substrates tested.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDiachasmimorpha longicaudata 3aDoryctobracon 3aOpius 3aTephritidae 3aadults 3aearly development 3aeggs 3afoods 3afruit flies 3ahost range 3ahosts 3ainsect larvae 3alife history 3aparasitoids 3areproduction 2aAnimals 2aBody Size 2aDiet 2aFemale 2aFruit 2aLarvaxparasitology 2aMothsxgrowth & development 2aOviparity 2aOvumxcytology 2aReproduction 2aTephritidaexparasitology1 aSivinski, John1 aRull, Juan1 aAluja, Martin0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2011 Nov., v. 57, no. 11 p.1471-1479dElsevier Ltdx0022-19107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2011.07.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02405naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245021600172300001600388520115500404592002801559650001101587650001101598650001201609650003301621650001101654650000901665650002201674650001701696650001701713651001001730651002101740651001101761700001701772700001701789773008401806856008501890990002301975852000901998655001202007IND60096266220221119213257.0141104e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009626622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cretres.2011.12.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHong, Sung Kyung10aCarbon isotopic composition of terrestrial plant matter in the Upper Cretaceous Geoncheonri Formation, Gyeongsang Basin, Korea: Implications for Late Cretaceous palaeoclimate on the East Asian continental margin  ap. 169-177.  aThe Upper Cretaceous Geoncheonri Formation in the Gyeongsang Basin, southeast Korea, was deposited in a lacustrine environment in a continental part of the East Asian continental margin and contains abundant terrestrial plant matter (TPM). Most of δ¹³CTPM values for the formation corrected to the modern atmospheric δ¹³C value correspond to that of water-stressed C₃ woody plants, which suggests they grew in conditions of limited moisture. The relationship between δ¹³C value of leaf and mean annual rainfall (MAR) of Stewart et al. (1995) suggests that the climate of the Gyeongsang Basin ranged from semi-arid to sub-humid (MAR: ca. 400–700 mm) during the period of deposition represent by the Geoncheonri Formation. The average δ¹³CTPM value for the formation is higher than that of coeval strata in the forearc regions (Russian Far East and Hokkaido, Japan), indicating that conditions in the Gyeongsang Basin were more arid conditions than in the forearc regions. This aridity was probably because the basin was in a rain-shadow created by the topographic barrier of an uplifted accretionary complex and active arc volcanism.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3acarbon 3aclimate 3adry environmental conditions 3aleaves 3arain 3avolcanic activity 3awater stress 3awoody plants 3aJapan 3aKorean Peninsula 3aRussia1 aLee, Yong Il1 aYi, Sangheon0 tCretaceous research.g2012 June, v. 35 p.169-177dElsevier Ltdx0195-66717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cretres.2011.12.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02537naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245011500173300001600288520152000304592002801824650001701852650002501869650001601894650001401910650001601924650001501940650001101955650001101966650001301977773009601990856008102086990002302167852000902190655001202199IND60093421320221120072656.0141103e20120618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009342132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ces.2012.03.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStickland, Anthony D.12aA compressional rheology model of fluctuating feed concentration during filtration of compressible suspensions  ap. 209-219.  aFiltration is a common process used to perform solid–liquid separation. This work addresses a previously overlooked yet significant aspect of filtration when the feed solids concentration varies on the same timescale of the filtration process. This affects the filtration rate and therefore the throughput of the filter. Existing one-dimensional models of fixed-cavity and flexible-membrane plate-and-frame filtration based on compressible suspension theory, in which the cake concentration as a function of thickness and time is given by a hyperbolic second-order diffusion equation, are expanded here using a filtrate volume dependent feed concentration. The key material properties are the compressive strength and the solids diffusivity. Two limiting approximations for the suspension flow behaviour above the filter cake are considered; perfect mixing and plug flow. Three case studies are presented exploring different aspects of fluctuating feed. Modelling results indicate that fluctuations in feed concentration can have a large effect on solids throughput as a function of final cake solids concentration. A key result is that, when processing a fixed volume of suspension, dilute feed followed by concentrated feed leads to faster overall filtration than the reverse case. The two limiting approximations of suspension flow behaviour show no significant difference under the examined conditions since the filtration kinetics are dominated by the rate of fluid flow through the cake, not the suspension.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3achemical engineering 3adiffusivity 3aequations 3afilter cake 3afiltration 3amixing 3amodels 3arheology0 tChemical engineering science.g2012 June 18, v. 75 p.209-219dElsevier Ltdx0009-25097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ces.2012.03.0233Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03655naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006000145245009300205300001800298500002000316520212000336592002802456596004402484650001102528650002502539650001202564650001002576650001602586650001502602650001702617650001102634650001202645650000902657650002302666650001902689650001102708650001502719650002202734650001102756651001202767700002302779700002402802700002002826700001702846700002702863700003102890773012802921856007903049852000903128655001203137IND60675352820221116141215.0191106e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067535282DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2656.130702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScherer, Cédric1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0465-254310aSeasonal host life‐history processes fuel disease dynamics at different spatial scales  ap. 1812-1824.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aUnderstanding the drivers underlying disease dynamics is still a major challenge in disease ecology, especially in the case of long‐term disease persistence. Even though there is a strong consensus that density‐dependent factors play an important role for the spread of diseases, the main drivers are still discussed and, more importantly, might differ between invasion and persistence periods. Here, we analysed long‐term outbreak data of classical swine fever, an important disease in both wild boar and livestock, prevalent in the wild boar population from 1993 to 2000 in Mecklenburg‐Vorpommern, Germany. We report outbreak characteristics and results from generalized linear mixed models to reveal what factors affected infection risk on both the landscape and the individual level. Spatiotemporal outbreak dynamics showed an initial wave‐like spread with high incidence during the invasion period followed by a drop of incidence and an increase in seroprevalence during the persistence period. Velocity of spread increased with time during the first year of outbreak and decreased linearly afterwards, being on average 7.6 km per quarter. Landscape‐ and individual‐level analyses of infection risk indicate contrasting seasonal patterns. During the persistence period, infection risk on the landscape level was highest during autumn and winter seasons, probably related to spatial behaviour such as increased long‐distance movements and contacts induced by rutting and escaping movements. In contrast, individual‐level infection risk peaked in spring, probably related to the concurrent birth season leading to higher densities, and was significantly higher in piglets than in reproductive animals. Our findings highlight that it is important to investigate both individual‐ and landscape‐level patterns of infection risk to understand long‐term persistence of wildlife diseases and to guide respective management actions. Furthermore, we highlight that exploring different temporal aggregation of the data helps to reveal important seasonal patterns, which might be masked otherwise.  aPublisher supplied data  a2118/1cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft 3aautumn 3adisease transmission 3aecology 3afuels 3ahog cholera 3alandscapes 3alife history 3amodels 3apiglets 3arisk 3aseasonal variation 3aseroprevalence 3aspring 3awild boars 3awildlife diseases 3awinter 3aGermany1 aRadchuk, Viktoriia1 aStaubach, Christoph1 aMuller, Sophie,1 aBlaum, Niels1 aThulke, Hans‐Hermann1 aKramer‐Schadt, Stephanie0 tjournal of animal ecology.g2019 Nov., v. 88, no. 11 p.1812-1824dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl16424x0021-87907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.130703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02432naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245011300169500001400282520118100296592002801477650001301505650002401518650001301542650001101555650002901566650001101595650001901606650002001625650001601645650000901661653001501670653001601685653002901701653001901730653003401749700002101783700002101804773009401825856008201919852000902001655001202010IND60720519720221119012330.0210305e20210212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072051972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2020.1318532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFunakoshi, Daichi10aSelf-aggregation of zinc bacteriochlorophyll-d analog bearing B-ring reduced chlorin and 17-acrylate residue  aNAL-light  aAs a model of bacteriochlorophyll(BChl)-d specifically found in major light-harvesting antennae (chlorosomes) of photosynthetic green bacteria, zinc methyl 7,8-dihydro-17,18,17¹,17²-tetradehydro-bacteriopheophorbide-d was prepared from naturally occurring BChl-a through the double dehydration of the cis-17,18-diol. The synthetic B-ring reduced Zn-BChl-d analog bearing the 17-acrylate residue in tetrahydrofuran exhibited a more bathochromically shifted Soret band in the monomeric state than its counterpart with the 17-propionate residue, while the former's Qy band slightly moved to a longer wavelength and was somewhat broadened in comparison with the latter's. Compared with the monomeric bands, the acrylated pigment self-aggregated in 1% tetrahydrofuran and hexane to give more red-shifted and broadened Soret and Qy bands at blue-to-green and far-red regions, respectively, which were similar to the J-aggregates of BChl-d in chlorosomes. By contrast, the propionated pigment remained monomeric under the same conditions. These spectral differences were owing to the 17-substitution effect including the π-conjugating and electron-withdrawing 17-acrylate residue.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3abacteriochlorophyll 3achlorins 3ahexane 3alight harvesting complex 3amodels 3aphotosynthesis 3atetrahydrofuran 3awavelengths 3azinc 0aChlorosome 0aJ-aggregate 0aLight-harvesting antenna 0aπ-conjugation 0aPhotosynthetic green bacteria1 aMatsubara, Shogo1 aTamiaki, Hitoshi0 tTetrahedron.g2021 Feb. 12, v. 81 p.131853-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11744x0040-40207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2020.1318533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01935naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010700165300001600272520093400288592002801222650002201250650000901272650001201281650001301293650001101306650001301317650001601330700002601346700002101372700002201393773009201415856008101507852000901588655001201597IND60440573320221117110453.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044057332DNAL7 a10.1007/s12562-015-0901-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Yang-su,10aEffect of temperature and salinity on hatching and larval survival of yellowfin tuna Thunnus albacares  ap. 891-897.  aEffects of temperature and salinity on hatching rate and normal larval rate at hatching, and survival of fasting larvae after hatching (survival activity index; SAI) were investigated using spontaneously spawned eggs of captive yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares, YFT).

The horizon occurs in the middle part of the late Barremian Gerhardtia sartousiana Zone (Gerhardtia sartousiana Subzone). It is approximately 20 cm thick and restricted to the uppermost part of the Puez Limestone Member (marly limestones; Hauterivian–Barremian; Puez Formation). It is fixed to the top 20 cm of bed P1/204. The grey–whitish limestone bed of the G. sartousiana Zone is penetrated by Aptian red marls–siltstones of the Redbed Member. The horizon is documented for the first time from the Southern Alps, including the Dolomites, and can be correlated with other Mediterranean localities. The trace fossil assemblage of this marker bed with the co-occurrence of Halimedides, Spongeliomorpha and Zoophycos sheds light on the Lower Cretaceous sedimentological history and current system of the Puez area within the Dolomites. It also highlights the palaeoenvironmental evolution of basins and plateaus and provides insights into the late Barremian interval.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3afossils 3alimestone 3aplateaus 3aAlps region 3aItaly1 aUchman, Alfred1 aGaillard, Christian1 aOlivero, Davide0 tCretaceous research.g2012 June, v. 35 p.199-207dElsevier Ltdx0195-66717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cretres.2012.01.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01370naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012100159300002000280520037100300592002800671650002300699650001000722650001300732650001700745650001100762700001600773700002000789700002900809773013500838856007400973852000901047655001201056IND60660999420221117000438.0190827e20150707xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066099942DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cc03507d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerzog, Nicole10aSurface plasmon & visible light for polymer functionalization of mesopores and manipulation of ionic permselectivity  ap. 11697-11700.  aThe near-field of surface plasmons is locally confined to nanometer dimensions.

Understanding how wildlife provision ecosystem services may incentivize wildlife conservation in agricultural landscapes. Attracting Barn Owls (Tyto furcata) to nest on farms for pest management has been implemented worldwide but has not been evaluated in vineyard agroecosystems. Napa Valley, California, is a renowned winegrape growing region, and viticulturists encourage Barn Owl occupancy to help minimize damage from Botta's pocket gophers (Thomomys bottae) and voles (Microtus spp.). This study modeled the use of habitats in space and time by hunting Barn Owls, providing information about their potential to provide the critical ecosystem service of pest consumption. We used global positioning system tags to track hunting owls and used a resource selection function to compare used and available habitats. We constructed the intensity of use and home range-movement maps using a time local convex hull analysis from location data. We found that Barn Owls selected uncultivated habitats when hunting, some of which were relatively rare on the landscape. Approximately, one-third of Barn Owl hunting locations occurred in vineyards, but this use was out of proportion to the availability of vineyards, which comprised 50% of the area around nest boxes. The owls' use of vineyards increased with decreasing amount of selected uncultivated habitat in the landscape. However, as reported by a previous study, the occupancy of nest boxes in vineyards increases with uncultivated habitats nearby. Future research should model landscape composition to determine the amount of preferred habitat necessary to support occupancy as well as hunting in vineyards. A true test of pest management by Barn Owls awaits experimentation coupled with monitoring rodent populations. LAY SUMMARY Agricultural landscapes are composed of a variety of habitats, both cultivated and uncultivated, and it is vital to understand how wildlife use these areas, especially for predatory birds that may help control agricultural pests. We used Global Positioning System telemetry to examine the selection of habitats for hunting by Barn Owls breeding in nest boxes in winegrape vineyards. Barn Owls selected uncultivated habitats, such as oak savanna, riparian forest, and grasslands for hunting, some of which were relatively rare on the landscape. Nonetheless, approximately, one-third of Barn Owl hunting locations occurred in vineyards, suggesting their predation of rodent pests could be useful for farmers.  aPublisher supplied data 0aecosystem service 0ahabitat heterogeneity 0ahabitat selection 0ahabitat use 0apest management 0aTyto furcata 0avineyard1 aHuysman, Allison E.1 aJohnson, Matthew D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3662-28240 tOrnithological applications.g2021 Jan. 25, v. 123, no. 1 p.1-15dUniversity of California PresswJournal:27703x2732-46217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ornithapp/duaa0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02689naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245013300168520156000301592002801861650002001889650001001909650002601919650001101945650001501956650001301971653002301984653002302007653003102030653001902061653003202080700002002112773011302132856008502245852000902330655001202339IND60682192520221123002128.0200503e20200510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068219252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2020.4608972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiller, Larry10aIn-column dilution: Improving volume loadability in reverse phase gradient chromatography through the use of a silica pre-column  aVolume overload is a critical limitation in Reversed Phase (RP)-HPLC purification of pharmaceutical compounds. Limited solubility of these materials in most injection solvents leads to large injection volumes in order to maximize throughput. However, peak distortion due to volume overload limits injection amounts, and results in suboptimal use of chromatographic instruments. Volume loading for RP gradient separations was significantly increased by inserting a silica column ahead of the RP separation column. The sole purpose of this column is to dilute the plug of strong injection solvent so that the actual sample constituents are retained when the diluted injection plug arrives at the RP column. This is similar to the concept of a “retention gap” in GC, yet this has never been applied to liquid chromatographic separations. Injection volumes were increased by almost a factor of 3 when using appropriately sized silica columns. A discussion of critical parameters that determine the effectiveness of this approach is provided. The concept is easily applied and does not require any system modifications. It is therefore well suited for open access applications where more instrument intensive approaches, such as “At-Column Dilution”, would be less desirable. We will also show that the generic concept which we have titled “In-Column Dilution” can easily be applied to increase the detection sensitivity for analytical application as well by allowing injection of larger sample volumes without peak deterioration for purifications.  aPublisher supplied data 3adetection limit 3adrugs 3aliquid chromatography 3asilica 3asolubility 3asolvents 0aIn-column dilution 0aAt-column dilution 0aPreparative chromatography 0aPharmaceutical 0aSmall molecule purification1 aAyube, Shawn J.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2020 May 10, v. 1618 p.460897-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2020.4608973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02926naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245011600174300001800290520145700308592002801765650003301793650001601826650002101842650001001863650002901873650001001902650001601912650002601928650002901954650002301983650000702006650001902013650002702032650002202059650001002081653001802091653001902109653001202128653001202140653001002152700002502162700002202187700002302209773010602232856008502338852000902423655001202432IND60524302420221118002459.0160706e20160901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052430242DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2016.11447992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJaatinen, Sanna T.14aThe effect of urine storage on antiviral and antibiotic compounds in the liquid phase of source-separated urine  ap. 2189-2198.  aThe behaviour of pharmaceuticals related to the human immunodeficiency virus treatment was studied in the liquid phase of source-separated urine during six-month storage at 20°C. Six months is the recommended time for hygienization and use of urine as fertilizer. Compounds were spiked in urine as concentrations calculated to appear in urine. Assays were performed with separate compounds and as therapeutic groups of antivirals, antibiotics and anti-tuberculotics. In addition, urine was amended either with faeces or urease inhibitor. The pharmaceutical concentrations were monitored from filtered samples with solid phase extraction and liquid chromatography. The concentration reductions of the studied compounds as such or with amendments ranged from less than 1% to more than 99% after six-month storage. The reductions without amendments were 41.9–99% for anti-tuberculotics; <52% for antivirals (except with 3TC 75.6%) and <50% for antibiotics. In assays with amendments, the reductions were all <50%. Faeces amendment resulted in similar or lower reduction than without it even though bacterial activity should have increased. The urease inhibitor prevented ureolysis and pH rise but did not affect pharmaceutical removal. In conclusion, removal during storage might not be enough to reduce risks associated with the studied pharmaceuticals, in which case other feasible treatment practises or urine utilization means should be considered.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3aantibiotics 3aantiviral agents 3adrugs 3aenvironmental technology 3afeces 3afertilizers 3aliquid chromatography 3aliquid-liquid extraction 3amicrobial activity 3apH 3arisk reduction 3asolid phase extraction 3aurease inhibitors 3aurine 0aHIV-treatment 0apharmaceutical 0aremoval 0astorage 0aurine1 aPalmroth, Marja R.T.1 aRintala, Jukka A.1 aTuhkanen, Tuula A.0 tEnvironmental technology.g2016 Sept. 1, v. 37, no. 17 p.2189-2198dTaylor & Francisx1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2016.11447993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02509naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005400148245008600202300001600288520112100304592002801425650001501453650001101468650001201479650003101491650001901522650002101541650001201562650003001574653001901604653001101623653001201634653000901646653001201655700001701667700001501684700001701699700001301716700001801729700001601747700001701763700001801780700001701798773012101815856008201936852000902018655001202027IND60528695520221117034854.0160716e20160729xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052869552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.05.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Hao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3894-929210aHIF-1α activates hypoxia-induced PFKFB4 expression in human bladder cancer cells  ap. 146-152.  aPFKFB4 is reported to regulate glycolysis by synthesizing fructose-2, 6-bisphosphate (F2,6BP) and has proved to be associated with most malignancies. However, the underlying mechanism for increased PFKFB4 expression in bladder cancer remains unclear. The present study demonstrated that PFKFB4 was overexpressed in bladder cancer tissues. In addition, the expression of PFKFB4 elevated in bladder cancer cells in the hypoxic condition, while in nomoxic condition, the expression of PFKFB4 still very low. Furthermore, we identified the hypoxia-responsive elements (HRE)-D from five putative HREs in the promoter region of PFKFB4 and demonstrated that the HRE-D was transactivated by the HIF-1α in bladder cancer cells. By using the Double-immunofluorescence co-localization assay, we revealed that the HIF-1α expression was associated with PFKFB4 expression in human bladder cancer specimens. Altogether, our study for the first time identified the pivotal role of HIF-1α in the connection between PFKFB4 and hypoxia in bladder cancer, which may prove to be a potential target for the treatment of bladder cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aglycolysis 3ahumans 3ahypoxia 3ahypoxia-inducible factor 1 3aneoplasm cells 3apromoter regions 3atissues 3aurinary bladder neoplasms 0aBladder cancer 0aPFKFB4 0aHIF-1α 0aHREs 0aHypoxia1 aLu, Chengyin1 aFang, Meng1 aYan, Wangjun1 aChen, Mo1 aJi, Yingzheng1 aHe, Shaohui1 aLiu, Tielong1 aChen, Tianrui1 aXiao, Jianru0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2016 July 29, v. 476 p.146-152dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.05.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04739naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012600169300001300295520348600308592002803794650002103822650001603843650001603859650001103875650001403886650001003900650001403910650001103924650000903935650001603944650003003960650001303990651001004003700001804013700002504031700002004056700003104076773008104107856008504188990002304273852000904296655001204305IND60096266920221119213421.0141104e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009626692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cretres.2012.01.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimone, Lucia10aArid versus wet climatic evidence in the “middle Cretaceous” calcareous successions of the Southern Apennines (Italy)  ap. 6-23.  aAn upper Albian–lower Turonian shallow-water carbonate succession cropping out near the village of Monteforte Cilento (Campania Apennines, southern Italy) was analyzed in detail within the framework of studies showing contrasting climatic evidence from the “middle” Cretaceous peri-Mediterranean carbonate successions. The full succession covers a time span in which there was a major global transgression, superimposed by fluctuating sea levels, coupled with a significant increase in temperature. There is also evidence of repeated climatic shifts from humid to dry with seasonal contrasting conditions. Restricted peritidal facies dominate the section and demonstrate the general characteristics associated with restricted brackish/schizohaline up to hypersaline depositional settings in which mesotrophic to mildly eutrophic conditions largely prevail. However, an opening and/or deepening trend of the depositional areas is recorded upward in the succession by deeply bioturbated plankton-rich strata at the Cenomanian–Turonian transition. This trend stopped with the inception of new shallow-water depositional settings which radiolitid rudists repopulated or from which shallow-water skeletal remains were supplied. This transient drowning event was anticipated and then marked by the occurrence of sediments bearing low-oxygen tolerant planktonic assemblages adapted to mesotrophic conditions. This suggests ecological conditions that were unfavourable to the main carbonate-producing shallow-water assemblages at the Cenomanian/Turonian boundary. Conditions of stress in the reconstructed shallow-water settings correlate with the deterioration of the water mass that culminated in deep-water domains with the well-known OAE2 anoxic crisis. The uppermost Albian–lower Cenomanian interval is characterized by intertidal to supratidal, partially dolomitized limestone with abundant silica pseudomorphs after evaporites. The silicified evaporite nodules and layers are evidence of episodes of highly evaporitic conditions in very shallow subtidal to supratidal settings in which salty to hypersaline ponds and areas of sabkha occurred. The occurrence of xerophytic megafloral remains also suggests that an arid, evaporite-promoting climate obtained in the depositional areas of the Albian–Cenomanian succession studied. Within the framework of the climatic evolution of “middle” Cretaceous time, the evaporite cycles of the Monteforte Cilento section are of particular interest. The different peri-Mediterranean carbonate successions record widespread karst phenomena and bauxite, which are expressions of hot/humid climates. Accurate biostratigraphic analyses and published geochemical data constrain the evaporitic episodes recorded in the Monteforte Cilento section. The related arid/semiarid climatic conditions fall within a time interval in which different coeval Apennine successions show shallow-water deposits (from stromatolitic/loferitic peritidal cycles of restricted inner shelf areas to more open, subtidal deposits of an open shelf) sandwiched between two tectonically uplifted surfaces marked by humid climate-related mature soils (bauxite) and/or karst phenomena. This suggests that dry climatic episodes post-dated the hot/wet intervals in which the bauxite and karst systems developed but, in turn, predated more recent hot/wet climatic conditions that resulted in the karst systems which occur at the top of the upper Cenomanian limestone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimatic factors 3aclimatology 3ahumid zones 3akarsts 3alimestone 3aponds 3asediments 3asilica 3asoil 3atemperature 3atransgressive segregation 3avillages 3aItaly1 aBravi, Sergio1 aCarannante, Gabriele1 aMasucci, Ilaria1 aPomoni-Papaioannou, Fotini0 tCretaceous research.g2012 Aug., v. 36 p.6-23dElsevier Ltdx0195-66717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cretres.2012.01.0053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02723naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245007900163300001600242520149100258592002801749650001401777650000801791650002501799650001601824650002801840650002201868650001301890650001101903650000901914650002401923650001501947650001001962650001401972700001901986700001802005700001302023700001502036700001702051773009602068856008102164990002302245852000902268655001202277IND60093421820221120045326.0141103e20120618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009342182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ces.2012.03.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Dang10aExperimental study on gas–liquid–liquid macro-mixing in a stirred tank  ap. 256-266.  aIn this paper, experimental data on the mixing time of the continuous phase and power consumption of gas–liquid–liquid dispersions in a mechanically agitated baffled tank are presented. The electrical conductivity method is taken for the measurement of mixing time and the shaft-torque method for power consumption measurement. Tap water is used as the continuous phase, and kerosene and air as the dispersed ones. The effects of probe/tracer injection position, agitation speed, type of impeller, clearance of impeller off tank bottom, oil volume fraction, gas holdup and physical properties of the dispersed liquids on the macro-mixing of the gas–liquid–liquid system have been investigated. The phenomenon of gas–liquid–liquid macro-mixing in a stirred tank is largely similar to that of liquid–liquid and gas–liquid stirred tanks. Our experiments indicate that the gas–liquid–liquid macro-mixing can be enhanced at higher gas holdups while damped at low gas holdups. Contrary to gas effect, the dispersed oil phase at low holdups increases the macro-mixing intensity but at higher holdups decreases the macro-mixing intensity of the continuous phase. The experimental results show that axial impellers are more energy efficient for gas–liquid–liquid macro-mixing than radial impellers. A simple correlation is developed for predicting the mixing time in gas–liquid–liquid three-phase systems and satisfactory agreement with experimental data is observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagitation 3aair 3achemical engineering 3adispersions 3aelectrical conductivity 3aenergy efficiency 3akerosene 3amixing 3aoils 3aphysical properties 3aprediction 3atanks 3atap water1 aCheng, Jingcai1 aLi, Xiangyang1 aWang, Xi1 aYang, Chao1 aMao, Zai-Sha0 tChemical engineering science.g2012 June 18, v. 75 p.256-266dElsevier Ltdx0009-25097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ces.2012.03.0353Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03220naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005900139245010200198300001800300500002000318520133600338592002801674596002801702596015601730596003101886596002601917596003001943596003001973596003102003650002802034650002802062650001202090650003202102650001202134650002202146650001302168650001902181650000702200650001702207650002402224650001402248650001202262650003702274700005902311700006602370700006102436773012302497856007302620852000902693655001202702IND60746819320221118154059.0210806e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074681932DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.175272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHestrin, Rachel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1315-887010aPlants and mycorrhizal symbionts acquire substantial soil nitrogen from gaseous ammonia transport  ap. 1746-1757.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNitrogen (N) is an essential nutrient that limits plant growth in many ecosystems. Here we investigate an overlooked component of the terrestrial N cycle – subsurface ammonia (NH₃) gas transport and its contribution to plant and mycorrhizal N acquisition. We used controlled mesocosms, soil incubations, stable isotopes, and imaging to investigate edaphic drivers of NH₃ gas efflux, track lateral subsurface N transport originating from ¹⁵NH₃ gas or ¹⁵N‐enriched organic matter, and assess plant and mycorrhizal N assimilation from this gaseous transport pathway. NH₃ is released from soil organic matter, travels belowground, and contributes to root and fungal N content. Abiotic soil properties (pH and texture) influence the quantity of NH₃ available for subsurface transport. Mutualisms with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi can substantially increase plant NH₃‐N uptake. The grass Brachypodium distachyon acquired 6–9% of total plant N from organic matter‐N that traveled as a gas belowground. Colonization by the AM fungus Rhizophagus irregularis was associated with a two‐fold increase in total plant N acquisition from subsurface NH₃ gas. NH₃ gas transport and uptake pathways may be fundamentally different from those of more commonly studied soil N species and warrant further research.  aPublisher supplied data  aDGE‐1144153cNSF GRFP  aSCW1039cU.S. Department of Energy Office of Biological and Environmental Research (OBER), Genomic Science Program LLNL Bioenergy Scientific Focus Area  aIOS‐0965336cNSF‐BREAD  aOPP51589cNSF‐BREAD  a(DGE‐0903371cNSF IGERT  aDGE‐1069193)cNSF IGERT  aDE‐AC52‐07NA27344cDOE 3aBrachypodium distachyon 3aRhizophagus irregularis 3aammonia 3agas production (biological) 3agrasses 3amycorrhizal fungi 3anitrogen 3anitrogen cycle 3apH 3aplant growth 3asoil organic matter 3asymbionts 3atexture 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae1 aWeber, Peter K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6022-60501 aPett‐Ridge, Jennifer1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4439-23981 aLehmann, Johannes1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4701-29360 tThe new phytologist.g2021 Sept., v. 231, no. 5 p.1746-1757dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.175273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03908naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147242012800204245010600332300001300438520264400451592002803095653001903123653001903142653002803161653001203189653001603201653001503217653001103232700002003243700001903263700002203282700001903304773013303323856008103456852000903537655001203546IND60744175120221118092207.0210709e20210210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074417512DNAL7 a10.1093/ornithapp/duaa0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWarnock, Nils1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8042-318X10aDisminución de poblaciones de aves playeras invernantes en un estuario templado en California: Una perspectiva de 30 años10aDeclining wintering shorebird populations at a temperate estuary in California: A 30-year perspective  ap. 1-19.  aWorldwide, shorebird populations are declining. Our objectives were to examine abundance trends of shorebirds regularly wintering at Tomales Bay, Marin County, California, accounting for the local effects of rainfall, raptors, and the restoration of part of the bay to tidal wetlands. From November 1989 to February 2019, we conducted 177 comprehensive winter shorebird surveys of Tomales Bay; we averaged 5.7 ± 0.9 (mean ± SD) winter surveys per year. In 30 yr, we counted 1,215,821 shorebirds of 31 species. We used generalized linear models and multi-model inference to evaluate trends in shorebird abundance while accounting for local sources of variation. We conducted separate analyses for 14 species seen in at least 20 of the 30 yr of monitoring and for all shorebird species combined. During the study, the abundance of all species combined declined 66% (52% in the North Bay and 81% in the South Bay) with the most rapid decline in the first 10 yr of monitoring. Of 13 species for which year was in the top model, 10 species decreased in abundance and 3 species increased. Dunlin and Western Sandpiper accounted for the greatest losses in total numbers. The best-supported models to estimate trends in shorebirds included predictors for year and North Bay vs. South Bay. Of the local variables we considered, rainfall was included in 10 of the 15 best-supported models (including all species combined), negatively affecting the numbers of all species except Willets. The wetland restoration project was included in 5 top models, with a short-term positive impact. Raptor abundance was included in 3 top models with mixed results. Our results show that effective conservation and management of local shorebird populations must be linked with regional/global efforts if we are to reverse negative shorebird trends. LAY SUMMARY Given declining North American shorebird populations, we analyzed population trends of shorebirds wintering at Tomales Bay, Marin County, California, spanning 30 seasons from November 1989 to February 2019, and reasons for these trends. Survey teams counted over 1.2 million shorebirds of 31 species, of which we analyzed trends for 14 regularly occurring species. During this period, overall shorebird numbers declined by 66%; 10 species declined, 3 species increased, and 1 species did not change. Dunlin and Western Sandpiper suffered the greatest losses, while Least Sandpipers and yellowlegs (predominantly Greater Yellowlegs) increased the most. Effective conservation and management of local shorebird populations must be linked with regional/global efforts to reverse negative shorebird trends.  aPublisher supplied data 0aavian declines 0ahabitat change 0aPacific Americas Flyway 0araptors 0arestoration 0ashorebirds 0atrends1 aJennings, Scott1 aKelly, John P.1 aCondeso, T.

Here, sulfide‐induced nitrobenzene reduction was explored as a model reaction to compare the mediation efficiency of a variety of CMs, including rice straw−derived black carbon (R‐BC) and pine wood−derived black carbon (P‐BC), a commercial activated carbon (AC), multi‐walled carbon nanotube (MCNT), and graphite. Given the same load (250 mg L⁻¹), the observed pseudo‐first‐order rate constant (kₒbₛ) of nitrobenzene reduction was ordered as AC > R‐BC > MCNT > P‐BC > graphite. The surface area−normalized rate constant (kSN) was ordered as R‐BC > graphite > MCNT > AC > P‐BC. Neither the kₒbₛ nor the kSN followed the order of mediator's electron conductivity (graphite > MCNT > AC > P‐BC > R‐BC). For the low‐graphitized R‐BC and P‐BC, increasing surface oxygen content by HNO₃ oxidation enhanced nitrobenzene reduction, whereas decreasing the content by NaBH₄ reduction impeded the reaction. Opposite trends were observed with the high‐graphitized AC, MCNT, and graphite. The quinone moieties of low‐graphitized CMs were found to facilitate nitrobenzene reduction by serving as one‐electron acceptors to generate reactive reducing sulfur species (polysulfides and polysulfide free radicals) from sulfide. In contrast, the surface oxygen groups of high‐graphitized CMs suppressed the reaction by lowering the electron conductivity. These results demonstrate that the types of CMs and their surface chemistry properties are key determinants in mediating redox transformation of organic contaminants.  aPublisher supplied data  a21920102002cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41991331cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2019YFC1804200cNational Key Research and Development Program of China 3aactivated carbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3aelectron transfer 3aenvironmental quality 3agraphene 3anitrobenzenes 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aquinones 3arice 3asulfides 3asulfur1 aYin, Shujun1 aZhu, Dongqiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4442-25420 tJournal of environmental quality.g2020 Nov., v. 49, no. 6 p.1564-1574dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jeq2.201463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02425naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245010600164300001600270520133300286592002801619650002701647650001801674650001001692650001601702650001601718650001901734650001901753650001601772653002801788653001601816700002501832700001801857773009601875856008301971852000902054655001202063IND60479782020221119091329.0160123e20100901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047978202DNAL7 a10.1556/AAlim.39.2010.3.92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÁgoston, R.10aExposure to sub-lethal temperatures induces enhanced heat resistance in <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i>  ap. 327-336.  aThe food industry utilizes a variety of stressors such as heat treatment to inactivate or prevent the multiplication of <i>L. monocytogenes</i> in foods. The aim of this study was to identify the extent to which pre-exposure to sub-lethal temperatures would induce temperature tolerance to 60 °C and result in increased D values.The D value of an avirulent <i>L. monocytogenes</i> strain (4ab No 10) was initially determined in Tryptic Soy Broth at 55 °C, 60 °C and 65 °C. The cells were pre-exposed to sub-lethal heat stress of 46 °C (for 30 and 60 min), 48 °C (for 30 and 60 min) and 50 °C (for 30 and 60 min). Then they were exposed to 60 °C and the D <sub>60</sub> values were calculated. The pre-treatment at sub-lethal temperatures enhanced the D <sub>60</sub> value of the strain from 3.03 min to longer times. The D <sub>60</sub> values increased as a function of pre-treatment time at 46 °C: after 30 min exposure it was 5.24 min, and 16.18 min after exposure to 60 min. Similarly, the D <sub>60</sub> value after 30 min and 60 min exposure at 48 °C was 6.72 min and 14.83 min, respectively. The D <sub>60</sub> value after 30 min and 60 min exposure at 50 °C, was 13.88 min and 11.16 min, respectively.

In this study, emulsion-formulated surimi gels were prepared, and the effects of oil types and emulsification degrees on the thermal stability of surimi gel were investigated. The results showed the gel properties of surimi gels were modulated by oil types and emulsification degrees. In detail, the rising pre-emulsification ratio caused the increase of the emulsifying activity index (EAI) and decrease of emulsifying stability index (ESI) for both emulsions. The larger droplet sizes of perilla seed oil than soybean oil may be responsible for their emulsifying stability difference. The gel strength, water retention, dynamic modulus and texture properties of both kinds of surimi gels displayed a firstly increased and then decreased tendency with the rising pre-emulsification ratios. The peak values were obtained as perilla seed oil emulsion with emulsification ratio of 20% group (P1) and soybean oil emulsion with emulsification ratio of 40% group (S2), respectively. Anyway, all emulsion gels showed higher thermal stability than the control group regardless of oil types. Similar curves were also obtained for the changes of hydrogen bond, ionic bond and hydrophobic interactions. Overall, perilla seed oil emulsion with emulsification ratio of 20% (P1 group) contributed to the improved thermal stability of surimi gels.  aPublisher supplied data 3adroplets 3aemulsifying 3aemulsions 3agel strength 3agels 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrophobicity 3aready-to-eat foods 3asoybean oil 3asurimi 3atexture 3athermal stability1 aChen, Xiaocao 1 aZheng, Jiani 1 aFan, Wenlong 1 aDing, Yuting 1 aZhou, Xuxia 0 tFoods.g2022 Jan. 11, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods110201793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03750naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005700139245018000196300001600376500001900392500002000411520200300431592002802434596006502462596007602527596010102603650000802704650002502712650001902737650001402756650001302770650001502783650004302798650001502841650001302856650001002869651001402879700002302893700005902916700001802975700005602993700001703049773013203066856007303198852000903271655001203280IND60722305020221116185517.0210101e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072230502DNAL7 a10.1111/jam.147652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChiotta, M.L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2601-723310aFusarium graminearum species complex occurrence on soybean and F. graminearum sensu stricto inoculum maintenance on residues in soybean‐wheat rotation under field conditions  ap. 208-216.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIMS: The aims of this study were to determine the occurrence of Fusarium graminearum species complex (FGSC) on soybean pods, seeds and roots, including rhizoplane, during the period of soybean crop in rotation with wheat and to evaluate the FGSC dynamics on wheat and soybean residues during two soybean growing seasons in rotation with wheat, particularly F. graminearum sensu stricto (FGss). METHODS AND RESULTS: Soybean roots, pods and seeds were analysed during 2012/13 and 2013/14 seasons. The morphological identification of FGSC and mycotoxin analysis was done. Crop residues were taken in both soybean season in wheat rotation and FGss were quantificated by real‐time PCR. The results showed that Fusarium species, mainly FGSC, survive in a soybean crop in rotation with wheat. Isolation frequency of these species was higher on soybean pods than on seeds at R6 stage. Deoxynivalenol contamination on soybean seeds was higher in the 2013/14 season in comparison with the 2012/13 season. Low isolation levels of Fusarium species and species that did not belong to FGSC were observed in soybean root, whereas in rhizoplane a higher level was observed. Fusarium species inoculum on residues remained stable during crop succession and the FGSC were recovered from both wheat and soybean residues. Real time PCR data showed a higher DNA concentration of FGss in wheat residues in the first developmental stages of soybean plants, being the levels more significant during 2012/13 season. With regard to soybean residues collected during the wheat growing stages, an increase in DNA from anthesis until wheat harvest was observed. CONCLUSIONS: In a no‐till production system, the populations of FGSC can colonize wheat and soybean residues to become an inoculum source. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study provides new data on the occurrence of FGSC populations in soybean plant and FGss on residues in soybean–wheat rotation, a cultural practice commonly used in in Argentina.  aPublisher supplied data  cConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas  aPICT 2457/11cAgencia Nacional de Promoción Científica y Tecnológica  aSECyT‐UNRC 2014‐2016cSecretaría de Ciencia y Técnica, Universidad Nacional de Río Cuarto 3aDNA 3aFusarium graminearum 3adeoxynivalenol 3aflowering 3ainoculum 3ano-tillage 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arhizoplane 3asoybeans 3awheat 3aArgentina1 aAlaniz Zanon, M.S.1 aPalazzini, J.M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6812-27551 aAlberione, E.1 aBarros, G.G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7599-64291 aChulze, S.N.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2021 Jan., v. 130, no. 1 p.208-216dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54923x1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.147653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03247naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094024002200138024001900160040001800179100001600197245010000213300001800313506007600331520197000407592002802377506003702405650001002442650001602452650001102468650001902479650001902498650001702517650001902534650002502553650001602578650001602594700002002610700002002630773008802650856009002738852000902828655001202837IND60090534420221207125907.0141102e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009053442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.05.0532doi7 aPMC37623332pmcid7 a237871082pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarg, Sumit14aThe effect of lipid monolayer in-plane rigidity on in vivo microbubble circulation persistence  ap. 6862-6870.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe goal of this study was to increase in vivo microbubble circulation persistence for applications in medical imaging and targeted drug delivery. Our approach was to investigate the effect of lipid monolayer in-plane rigidity to reduce the rate of microbubble dissolution, while holding constant the microbubble size, concentration and surface architecture. We first estimated the impact of acyl chain length of the main diacyl phosphatidylcholine (PC) lipid and inter-lipid distance on the cohesive surface energy and, based on these results, we hypothesized that microbubble stability and in vivo ultrasound contrast persistence would increase monotonically with increasing acyl chain length. We therefore measured microbubble in vitro stability to dilution with and without ultrasound exposure, as well as in vivo ultrasound contrast persistence. All measurements showed a sharp rise in stability between DPPC (C16:0) and DSPC (C18:0), which correlates to the wrinkling transition, signaling the onset of significant surface shear and gas permeation resistance, observed in prior single-bubble dissolution studies. Further evidence for the effect of the wrinkling transition came from an in vitro and in vivo stability comparison of microbubbles coated with pure DPPC with those of lung surfactant extract. Microbubble stability against dilution without ultrasound and in vivo ultrasound contrast persistence showed a monotonic increase with acyl chain length from DSPC to DBPC (C22:0). However, we also observed that stability dropped precipitously for all measurements on further increasing lipid acyl chain length from DBPC to DLiPC (C24:0). This result suggests that hydrophobic mismatch between the main PC lipid and the lipopolymer emulsifier, DSPE-PEG5000, may drive a less stable surface microstructure. Overall, these results support our general hypothesis of the role of in-plane rigidity for increasing the lifetime of microbubble circulation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adrugs 3aemulsifiers 3aenergy 3ahydrophobicity 3aimage analysis 3amicrobubbles 3amicrostructure 3aphosphatidylcholines 3asurfactants 3aultrasonics1 aThomas, Alex A.1 aBorden, Mark A.0 tBiomaterials.g2013 Sept., v. 34, no. 28 p.6862-6870dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.05.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02425naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245010000173300001800273520123300291592002801524650000801552650002401560650001301584650001801597650001601615650002001631650001901651650001601670650001501686650001901701650005201720650002201772650001701794650001001811700002301821773011901844856005501963852000902018655001202027IND4510594820221120075306.0150730e20010315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451059482DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1432-1327.2001.02021.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCollet, Bertrand13aTherainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) Mx1 promoter: Structural and functional characterization  ap. 1577-1584.  aMx1 gene expression was studied in the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) gonad (RTG) (fibroblast) cell line. RTâPCR analyses showed that both poly I:C and interferon containing supernatants induced expression of Mx1 in RTG cells. Kinetic analyses suggest that poly I:C acts indirectly through the production of interferons (IFN), as shown in other studies. By gene walking with trout genomic DNA the regulatory sequence of the Mx1 gene was cloned and sequenced. Sequence analysis showed that the 5â² flanking region has a structure, which is typical for an interferonâinduced gene promoter. Relative to the transcription start, it has a TATA box at â29 to â25, a 13 nucleotide interferon response element (ISRE) between â101 to â89, and a Sp1 binding site at â382 to â374. This region, with a single ISRE, is enough to induce strong expression of a luciferase reporter gene after stimulation of RTG cells with poly I:C. A timeâcourse of induction of this reporter construct showed maximal expression (22âfold increase) after incubation with 100âÂµgâmLâ1 poly I:C for 48âh.

It is endemic in humid tropical regions that include Africa, Latin America and Southern Asia. Among the public health important soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) classified as neglected tropical diseases, S. stercoralis is the most neglected. A study of schistosomiasis and STHs mapping was conducted and S. stercoralis larvae were detected using the utilized diagnostic method; thus, this current study described the prevalence and risk factors of S. stercoralis infection in districts of Sabach Sanjal and Upper Badibou in The Gambia.The cross-sectional study enrolled 851 schoolchildren, ages 7 to 14 years old. The participants were enrolled from 17 schools in Sabach Sanjal and Upper Badibou Districts. The WHO random sampling technique n/50 (25 boys and 25 girls) was used. Stool samples were collected from each participant and Kato-Katz smear method was used to screen for S. stercoralis infection.Out of the total 851 pupils, 76 pupils (8.9%) were positive for S. stercoralis infection. The mean age of infected persons was 10.1 years (±2.2). The prevalence of infection was higher among females (9.2%) than males (8.7%). Rates of infection for age categories 7–10 years and 11–14 years were 12.4% and 4.2%, respectively. Rates of infection by districts were 12.3% for Sabach Sanjal and 7.1% for Upper Badibou. Schoolchildren from Sabach Sanjal were 1.6 times more likely to have strongyloidiasis compared to those from Upper Badibou (aOR = 1.64, p-value = 0.058). Schoolchildren aged 7–10 years were 3.2 times more likely to have strongyloidiasis infection compared to the 11–14-year-olds (aOR = 3.20, p-value <0.001). Schoolchildren who ‘sometimes’ have water or tissue after defaecation have more infection rate compared to those who ‘always’ have water or tissue after defaecation. However, this difference was not statistically significant (aOR = 1.36, p-value = 0.308).The study revealed the prevalence of strongyloidiasis in Sabach Sanjal and Upper Badibou districts of The Gambia. Kato-Katz technique might be inadequate for detecting S. stercoralis; thus, more studies are needed to determine the true prevalence of the disease in these two districts through the combined use of highly sensitive techniques such as Baermann, Koga Agar Culture and polymerase chain reaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStrongyloides stercoralis 3aagar 3across-sectional studies 3adefecation 3adiagnostic techniques 3ahelminths 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apublic health 3aschistosomiasis 3astrongyloidiasis 3aGambia 3aLatin America 3aSouth Asia 0aPrevalence 0aRisk factors 0aSchoolchildren 0aSabach Sanjal 0aUpper Badibou 0aThe Gambia 0aNTDs 0aWHO 0aWHA 0aMDA 0aSTHs 0aMRC 0aCLTS 0aLBS1 aJoof, Ebrima1 aSey, Alhagie Papa1 aSambou, Sana1 aMohamed, Zeehaida1 aSanneh, Bakary0 tParasite epidemiology and control.g2021 Nov., v. 15 p.e00228-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23217x2405-67317nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.parepi.2021.e002283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02003naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245008700164300001600251520073300267592002801000650001401028650001501042650002101057650001301078650001001091650001601101650001401117650001101131650001101142650001901153651001001172653001401182653002101196653002401217653001601241653001101257700001801268700002201286700002001308773013801328856008201466852000901548655001201557IND60543665120221120141906.0190411e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054366512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.myc.2014.01.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkane, Izumi10aLife cycle of Melampsora coleosporioides, a leaf rust of Salix babylonica in Japan  ap. 431-438.  aMelampsora coleosporioides produces uredinia and telia on the leaves of Salix babylonica. Since the life cycle of this fungus is largely unknown, inoculation experiments were conducted to find alternate host plants. Results showed that M. coleosporioides can use Corydalis incisa as a spermogonial and aecial host. The morphological characteristics of the spermogonial and aecial states of the fungus are first described. Furthermore, field observations and histological studies demonstrated that the fungus was able to overwinter in twigs of S. babylonica and produced urediniospores in early spring. Thus, the leaf rust occurs on S. babylonica every year and alternation with the spermogonial and aecial host is not necessary.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorydalis 3aMelampsora 3aSalix babylonica 3abranches 3afungi 3ahost plants 3aleaf rust 3aleaves 3aspring 3aurediniospores 3aJapan 0aCorydalis 0aHost alternation 0aPerennial infection 0aPucciniales 0aWillow1 aKoide, Yuriko1 aNakamura, Hitoshi1 aYamaoka, Yuichi0 tMycoscience.g2014 Nov., v. 55, no. 6 p.431-438dElsevier B.V.aThe Mycological Society of JapanwJournal:jnl3870071x1340-35407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.myc.2014.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04378naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245011300172500001900285520265300304592002802957650001502985650002103000650001103021650001203032650001503044650002303059650001403082650001203096650003503108650001903143650001803162650001303180650001303193650001403206650002603220650000903246650001903255650000903274650001503283650002103298650000903319650001903328650001003347650001003357651001403367653001803381653002803399653001703427653002403444653002603468700002603494700002403520700002503544773010303569856008303672852000903755655001203764IND60714969920221117034958.0201202e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071496992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agsy.2020.1029622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNordblom, Thomas L.10aPrecision variable rate nitrogen for dryland farming on waterlogging Riverine Plains of Southeast Australia?  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPrecision agriculture, using satellite navigation, has grown in popularity around the world. Because of its practical uses for land preparation, sowing, nutrient applications, pest (weed, pathogen, invertebrate) management, stress sensing and harvest recording, many major equipment manufacturers include precision variable rate capability as standard fittings. GIS (Geographic Information System) maps may include georeferenced soil chemistry information and detailed historical harvest yield data. We integrate such data to examine Precision Variable Rate Nitrogen (PVRN) applications with whole-farm management information and rainfall records in a district where waterlogging frequently reduces crop yields.Given wide variations in growing season rainfalls (GSR) and soils in the district, we test year-to-year stability of rainfed crop-yield rankings over time on 90x90m GIS grid-areas in large paddocks (over 100 ha). Variations in historical yield-quartile rankings of grid-areas across GSR levels over time are observed; some areas yield best at some GSR levels but not others, such that the best-yielding part of a paddock one year may be poorest in the next.We answer the question: “Why would a farmer in this district choose to apply a uniform moderate rate of N to a paddock at sowing even though in possession of precision variable rate-capable (PVR) equipment, georeferenced electromagnetic conductance (EM38) data and crop-yield map data for that paddock in many past seasons?” We show that soil conditions in the study district challenge the economic value of PVRN versus uniform rates in farming systems prone to waterlogging.If full-season GSR were reliably predictable early in the season, applications of N could be based on a rule calling for 40 kg/ha N/t of attainable yield at that GSR and grid-area EM38 level, minus sampled soil-N. Unfortunately, GSR is notoriously unpredictable.We simulate whole-farm financial risk profiles (CDFs of simulated decadal cash margins with varying prices and yields, minus all variable, fixed and capital costs) assuming moderate uniform N rates, as practiced in the study area, on two model farms; one with low and one with high-fixed-costs, given historical variations in GSR and prices. Assuming PVRN requires annual geo-referenced soil nutrient sampling of each hectare, these added costs could be covered by a 1% increase in yields across all wheat and canola crops or a 7% decrease in applied N. We cannot reject the null hypothesis that PVRN is no more profitable than uniform applications in this district. Near-real-time NDVI may lower the cost of PVRN for late applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarid lands 3aattainable yield 3acanola 3acapital 3acrop yield 3aeconomic valuation 3aequipment 3afarmers 3ageographic information systems 3ageoreferencing 3ainvertebrates 3anitrogen 3apastures 3apathogens 3aprecision agriculture 3arain 3ariparian areas 3arisk 3asatellites 3asite preparation 3asoil 3asoil nutrients 3aweeds 3awheat 3aAustralia 0aVariable rate 0aGrowing season rainfall 0aWaterlogging 0aFinancial modelling 0aDecadal risk profiles1 aHutchings, Timothy R.1 aGodfrey, Sosheel S.1 aSchefe, Cassandra R.0 tAgricultural systems.g2021 Jan., v. 186 p.102962-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl7186x0308-521X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2020.1029623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02909naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005500147245016700202300001600369520127500385592002801660650002301688650002301711650002001734650002001754650002001774650002301794650002101817650001201838650001001850650002701860650001801887650001801905650003301923650000901956650001501965653003301980653002302013653002602036653003402062653002202096653003202118700002002150700001202170700001802182773011202200856008202312852000902394655001202403IND60629758320221118092638.0190401e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062975832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2017.12.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEzendam, J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8677-198610aSkin sensitisation quantitative risk assessment (QRA) based on aggregate dermal exposure to methylisothiazolinone in personal care and household cleaning products  ap. 242-250.  aContact allergy to preservatives is an important public health problem. Ideally, new substances should be evaluated for the risk on skin sensitisation before market entry, for example by using a quantitative risk assessment (QRA) as developed for fragrances. As a proof-of-concept, this QRA was applied to the preservative methylisothiazolinone (MI), a common cause of contact allergy. MI is used in different consumer products, including personal care products (PCPs) and household cleaning products (HCPs). Aggregate exposure to MI in PCPs and HCPs was therefore assessed with the Probabilistic Aggregated Consumer Exposure Model (PACEM). Two exposure scenarios were evaluated: scenario 1 calculated aggregate exposure on actual MI product concentrations before the restricted use in PCPs and scenario 2 calculated aggregate exposure using the restrictions for MI in PCPs. The QRA for MI showed that in scenarios 1 and 2, the proportion of the population at risk for skin sensitisation is 0.7% and 0.5%, respectively. The restricted use of MI in PCPs does not seem very effective in lowering the risk on skin sensitization. To conclude, it is important to consider aggregate exposure from the most important consumer products into consideration in the risk assessment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaggregate exposure 3aat-risk population 3acleaning agents 3adermal exposure 3aexposure models 3ahousehold cleaning 3ahypersensitivity 3amarkets 3aodors 3apersonal care products 3apreservatives 3apublic health 3aquantitative risk assessment 3arisk 3askin tests 0aQuantitative risk assessment 0aSkin sensitization 0aMethylisothiazolinone 0aAggregate exposure assessment 0aCosmetic products 0aHousehold cleaning products1 aBokkers, B.G.H.1 aBil, W.1 aDelmaar, J.E.0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2018 Feb., v. 112 p.242-250dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2017.12.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02453naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245006800175520104400243592002801287650002201315650003401337650001301371650001101384650001301395650001201408650001501420650002501435650001601460650002201476650001001498650001301508650001001521650001501531650003101546651001101577653002201588653002301610653001401633653001701647700002001664700001801684700002501702700002401727773011201751856008701863852000901950655001201959IND60679328320221117212424.0200103e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067932832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jinsphys.2019.1039942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPiersanti, Silvana10aRole of chemical cues in cabbage stink bug host plant selection  aThe cabbage stink bugs of the genus Eurydema, encompassing several oligophagous species, such as Eurydema oleracea (L.), are known to be important pests of cabbage, broccoli, and other cole crops in Europe. Despite their economic importance, the knowledge regarding the role of chemical cues in host plant selection of these species is very limited. The present investigation on E. oleracea at the adult stage revealed the use of olfaction in host plant selection of this species and demonstrated with behavioural tests that E. oleracea preferred feeding on wild Eruca sativa, rather than on Brassica oleracea. Moreover, ultrastructural data revealed the antennal sensilla of E. oleracea, encompassing single walled and double walled olfactory sensilla, and electroantennographic recordings revealed their sensitivity to several host plant VOCs from E. sativa and B. oleracea. The data shown in the present research may be useful in the development of semiochemical-based strategies or trap crops for the control of this pest in the field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica oleracea 3aEruca vesicaria subsp. sativa 3aEurydema 3aadults 3abroccoli 3acabbage 3acole crops 3aelectroantennography 3ahost plants 3ainsect physiology 3apests 3asensilla 3asmell 3atrap crops 3avolatile organic compounds 3aEurope 0aEurydema oleracea 0aOlfactory sensilla 0aBehaviour 0aPentatomidae1 aRebora, Manuela1 aEderli, Luisa1 aPasqualini, Stefania1 aSalerno, Gianandrea0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2020 Jan., v. 120 p.103994-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45772x0022-19107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2019.1039943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04386naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003300133040001800166100001600184245006100200300001800261506007600279520162700355592002801982506003702010650001002047650001202057650001302069650001502082650002602097650003102123650001202154650007202166650002202238650001702260650005702277650001102334650004602345650006002391650006002451650004802511650005102559650000902610650000902619650002302628650001902651650002102670650001302691650004902704650004402753650004802797650004402845650005202889650002402941650001702965650004902982650005303031700001903084700002503103700001703128700001603145700002403161700001703185700001903202700001803221700003203239700002003271700001703291700002603308700001903334773017203353856004603525852000903571655001203580IND4487010820221207131243.0120510e20120508xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448701082DNAL7 a225293742pmid7 aPMC33588742pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.12036051092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHorn, Signe10aMind bomb 1 is required for pancreatic β-cell formation  ap. 7356-7361.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDuring early pancreatic development, Notch signaling represses differentiation of endocrine cells and promotes proliferation of Nkx6-1+Ptf1a+ multipotent progenitor cells (MPCs). Later, antagonistic interactions between Nkx6 transcription factors and Ptf1a function to segregate MPCs into distal Nkx6-1–Ptf1a+ acinar progenitors and proximal Nkx6-1+Ptf1a– duct and β-cell progenitors. Distal cells are initially multipotent, but evolve into unipotent, acinar cell progenitors. Conversely, proximal cells are bipotent and give rise to duct cells and late-born endocrine cells, including the insulin producing β-cells. However, signals that regulate proximodistal (P-D) patterning and thus formation of β-cell progenitors are unknown. Here we show that Mind bomb 1 (Mib1) is required for correct P-D patterning of the developing pancreas and β-cell formation. We found that endoderm-specific inactivation of Mib1 caused a loss of Nkx6-1+Ptf1a– and Hnf1β+ cells and a corresponding loss of Neurog3+ endocrine progenitors and β-cells. An accompanying increase in Nkx6-1–Ptf1a+ and amylase+ cells, occupying the proximal domain, suggests that proximal cells adopt a distal fate in the absence of Mib1 activity. Impeding Notch-mediated transcriptional activation by conditional expression of dominant negative Mastermind-like 1 (Maml1) resulted in a similarly distorted P-D patterning and suppressed β-cell formation, as did conditional inactivation of the Notch target gene Hes1. Our results reveal iterative use of Notch in pancreatic development to ensure correct P-D patterning and adequate β-cell formation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3agenes 3ainsulin 3apancreas 3astem cells 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptional activation 2aAnimals 2aBasic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBlotting, Western 2aCell Lineage 2aEmbryo, Mammalianxcytologyxembryologyxmetabolism. 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmental 2aHepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1-betaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aHepatocyte Nuclear Factor 3-betaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aHomeodomain Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aInsulin-Secreting Cellsxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aMice, Knockout 2aMice, Transgenic 2aMutation 2aNerve Tissue Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aNuclear Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPancreasxcytologyxembryologyxmetabolism. 2aReceptors, Notchxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSignal Transduction 2aTime Factors 2aTranscription Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aUbiquitin-Protein Ligasesxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aKobberup, Sune1 aJørgensen, Mette C.1 aKalisz, Mark1 aKlein, Tino1 aKageyama, Ryoichiro1 aGegg, Moritz1 aLickert, Heiko1 aLindner, Jill1 aMagnuson, M.

There are, however, relatively few studies that validate the feasibility of transitioning from marker development to experimental application across populations and species. North American coralsnakes of the Micrurus fulvius species complex occur in the United States and Mexico, and little is known about their population structure and phylogenetic relationships. This absence of information and population genetics markers is particularly concerning because they are highly venomous and have important implications on human health. To alleviate this problem in coralsnakes, we investigated the feasibility of using 454 shotgun sequences for microsatellite marker development. First, a genomic shotgun library from a single individual was sequenced (approximately 7.74 megabases; 26 831 reads) to identify potentially amplifiable microsatellite loci (PALs). We then hierarchically sampled 76 individuals from throughout the geographic distribution of the species complex and examined whether PALs were amplifiable and polymorphic. Approximately half of the loci tested were readily amplifiable from all individuals, and 80% of the loci tested for variation were variable and thus informative as population genetic markers. To evaluate the repetitive landscape characteristics across multiple snakes, we also compared microsatellite content between the coralsnake and two other previously sampled snakes, the venomous copperhead (Agkistrodon contortrix) and Burmese python (Python molurus).  aPublisher supplied data  aR01‐GM083127cNational Institutes of Health  aDEB‐0102383cNational Science Foundation  aDEB‐041600cNational Science Foundation  aDEB‐0416160cNational Science Foundation 3aAgkistrodon contortrix 3aMicrurus 3aPython bivittatus 3aPython molurus 3agenetic markers 3agenomics 3ageographical distribution 3ahuman health 3ainformation 3alandscapes 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aphylogeny 3apopulation 3apopulation genetics 3apopulation structure 3asnakes 3avariability 3aMexico 3aUnited States1 aStreicher, Jeffrey W.1 aMeik, Jesse M.1 aIngrasci, Matthew J.1 aPoole, Alexander W.1 ade Koning, A.

Results showed that Blue Whiting surimi has a yield, appearance and yield point value similar to that of typical cod or pollock surimi. Also, the paste should be frozen in the first 24 h after cutting, kneading and mixing to avoid an excessive decrease in elasticity. In addition, pH values higher than 7 could give derivates that are too deformable, values of about 6.7 being recommended for the paste. Likewise, the study of the gelling temperature showed values for the first temperature (“setting”) lower than the cod and pollock surimi setting temperature, and so it is recommended that the second heating temperature for Blue Whiting paste be lower.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMicromesistius poutassou 3acutting 3agelatinization temperature 3akneading 3amixing 3apH 3apollock 3arheological properties 3astorage temperature 3asurimi 3awater content 0aBlue Whiting 0asurimi 0arheological properties 0agelation 0apH 0amoisture1 aLaca, A.1 aParedes, B.1 aDíaz, M.,0 tActa alimentaria.g2010 Dec. 1, v. 39, no. 4 p.445-456dAkadémiai Kiadóx0139-30067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FAAlim.39.2010.4.63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03098naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245011100169500001900280520172800299592002802027650001502055650001502070650001102085650002502096650001302121650000702134650001802141650002302159653002202182653003302204653002502237653001002262700001302272700001502285700001502300700001702315700001502332700001602347700005702363700001802420773010602438856008702544852000902631655001202640IND60735743620221119064652.0210527e20210805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073574362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1266392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Zhiyuan10aFeOOH imprinted nanorods based on boronate affinity surface imprinting for the separation of shikimic acid  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aUp to now, extraction of shikimic acid (SA), precursor of antiviral drugs, from the surrounding plants is the most effective and sustainable method. However, it’s still a tough challenge to obtain high purity SA due to the complex components in the plant issue. In this study, based on the specific identification of boronate affinity, iron hydroxide oxide FeOOH with abundant functional groups was used as the substrate to prepare molecular imprinted polymers (FeOOH@MIPs) for selective recognition and adsorption of SA. Using 4-vinylphenylboronic acid (VPBA) as functional monomer, the imprinted polymers were prepared by the controllable directional surface imprinting method. FT-IR analysis and XPS study confirmed the characteristic structure and component of the products. From the results from the batch mode experiments, the maximum adsorption capacity of shikimic acid by FeOOH@MIPs can reach 42.919 mg g⁻¹, which was enhanced compared with nonimprinted products. In addition, the adsorption process was well fitted with Langmuir isotherm model and pseudo-second-order model, implying the chemisorption of SA onto FeOOH@MIPs through the monolayer. The investigation on pH factor showed that the adsorption amount towards SA increased and then declined with the increase of pH value in the surrounding solution, attributing to the feature of boronate affinity effect. More importantly, it was found that the adsorbent exhibited competitive reusability performance. FeOOH@MIPs maintained 86.45% of the first cycle adsorption capacity towards SA after 5 cycles, giving a reasonable proof for the feasible application of the products in the separation of substances containing the special structure of cis-diol.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3amodels 3amolecular imprinting 3ananorods 3apH 3ashikimic acid 3asorption isotherms 0aBoronate affinity 0aMolecular imprinted polymers 0aSelective adsorption 0aFeOOH1 aZhu, Yao1 aRong, Jian1 aMao, Kaili1 aYang, Dongya1 aZhang, Tao1 aXu, Jicheng1 aQiu, Fengxian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7475-75651 aPan, Jianming0 tColloids and surfaces.g2021 Aug. 05, v. 622 p.126639-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1266393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02953naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245016000170300001600330520124500346592002801591650002401619650002501643650001701668650001401685650002001699650001201719650001001731650001101741650002501752650001801777650002101795650001001816650002001826650002101846653002401867653001601891653002801907653002801935653002901963653003001992653002002022653002302042700001302065700001902078700001902097700001302116700001702129700001602146773014402162856008402306852000902390655001202399IND60543665420221120131134.0170105e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054366542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2013.10.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Shuncang10aSelective responses of enzymes in the two parallel pathways of rosmarinic acid biosynthetic pathway to elicitors in Salvia miltiorrhiza hairy root cultures  ap. 645-651.  aRosmarinic acid and salvianolic acid B are two important phenolic compounds with therapeutic properties in Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge. The biosynthesis of rosmarinic acid is initiated by two parallel pathways, namely the phenylpropanoid pathway and the tyrosine-derived pathway. Salvianolic acid B is a structural dimer of rosmarinic acid and is believed to be derived from rosmarinic acid. In the current study, methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and hyphal extracts from fungi were used as elicitors to examine the relationship between enzymes in the two parallel pathways and accumulation of phenolic compounds in S. miltiorrhiza hairy root cultures. The results showed that accumulations of rosmarinic acid, salvianolic acid B and total phenolics were enhanced by MeJA while suppressed by fugal extracts. Responses of enzymes in the tyrosine-derived pathway, at both the gene transcript and enzyme activity levels, showed a better consistency with alterations of phenolic compounds content after the two elicitors treated. Our study implied that compared with enzymes in the phenylpropanoid pathway, enzymes in the tyrosine-derived pathway are more correlated to rosmarinic acid and salvianolic acid B biosynthesis in S. miltiorrhiza hairy roots.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalvia miltiorrhiza 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3aelicitors 3aenzyme activity 3aenzymes 3afungi 3ahyphae 3amedicinal properties 3amessenger RNA 3amethyl jasmonate 3aroots 3arosmarinic acid 3asalvianolic acid 0aSalvia miltiorrhiza 0aHairy roots 0aRosmarinic acid pathway 0aPhenylpropanoid pathway 0aTyrosine-derived pathway 0aElicitor-induced response 0aRosmarinic acid 0aSalvianolic acid B1 aYan, Yan1 aWang, Bangqing1 aLiang, Zongsuo1 aLiu, Yan1 aLiu, Fenghua1 aQi, Zhihong0 tJournal of bioscience and bioengineering.g2014 May, v. 117 p.645-651dElsevier B.V.aThe Society for Biotechnology, Japanx1389-17237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2013.10.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03409naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245009000169520190800259592002802167650001802195650001502213650001302228650002602241650002202267650001202289650001702301650001802318650002002336650001202356650001602368650002602384650001202410650001202422650001602434650001002450650001102460653001602471653002602487653001802513653001902531653001602550653003302566700001602599700001902615700001602634700001402650773011902664856008702783852000902870655001202879IND60679328420221117212415.0201111e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067932842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jinsphys.2019.1040012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTougeron, K.10aTrans-generational effects on diapause and life-history-traits of an aphid parasitoid  aTransgenerational effects act on a wide range of insects’ life-history traits and can be involved in the control of developmental plasticity, such as diapause expression. Decrease in or total loss of winter diapause expression recently observed in some species could arise from inhibiting maternal effects. In this study, we explored transgenerational effects on diapause expression and traits in one commercial and one Canadian field strain of the aphid parasitoid Aphidius ervi. These strains were reared under short photoperiod (8:16 h LD) and low temperature (14 °C) conditions over two generations. Diapause levels, developmental times, physiological and morphological traits were measured. Diapause levels increased after one generation in the Canadian field but not in the commercial strain. For both strains, the second generation took longer to develop than the first one. Tibia length and wing surface decreased over generations while fat content increased. A crossed-generations experiment focusing on the industrial parasitoid strain showed that offspring from mothers reared at 14 °C took longer to develop, were heavier, taller with wider wings and with more fat reserves than those from mothers reared at 20 °C (8:16 h LD). No effect of the mother rearing conditions was shown on diapause expression. Additionally to direct plasticity of the offspring, results suggest transgenerational plasticity effects on diapause expression, development time, and on the values of life-history traits. We demonstrated that populations showing low diapause levels may recover higher levels through transgenerational plasticity in response to diapause-induction cues, provided that environmental conditions are reaching the induction-thresholds specific to each population. Transgenerational plasticity is thus important to consider when evaluating how insects adapt to changing environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAphidius ervi 3aAphidoidea 3adiapause 3aenvironmental factors 3ainsect physiology 3ainsects 3alife history 3alipid content 3amaternal effect 3amothers 3aparasitoids 3aphenotypic plasticity 3aprogeny 3arearing 3atemperature 3awings 3awinter 0aBet-hedging 0aPhenotypic plasticity 0aAphidius ervi 0aClimate-change 0aTemperature 0aTransgenerational plasticity1 aDevogel, M.1 avan Baaren, J.1 aLe Lann, C.1 aHance, T.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2020 Feb.,  Mar., v. 121 p.104001-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45772x0022-19107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2019.1040013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03451naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245012400165300001600289520143200305592002801737596007201765596007001837596007101907596003801978596003802016650001902054650002702073650002202100650001302122650002302135650001202158650001502170650002002185650001202205650002702217650001502244650002502259650001402284650001202298650001202310650002402322650001902346650002102365650000702386650001702393650002002410650002102430650001402451650000902465650002802474650000902502650002102511700001902532700005402551773012902605856008202734852000902816655001202825IND60662779820221117171042.0190906e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066277982DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-019-04175-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Danmei12aA new function of the biocontrol bacterium Lysobacter enzymogenes LE16 in the mineralization of soil organic phosphorus  ap. 299-309.  aAIMS: To evaluate the functions of a new biocontrol bacterium, Lysobacter enzymogenes LE16, in the mineralization of soil organic phosphorus (P) and in the stimulation of plant P uptake and plant growth. METHODS: Liquid culture, soil incubation, and pot experiments were used to study phosphatase production, inorganic P release from lecithin and soil organic P compounds, and the P uptake and growth of lettuce seedlings induced by L. enzymogenes LE16. RESULTS: This bacterium hydrolyzed lecithin by the release of acid, neutral and alkaline phosphatases in culture solutions with a pH ranging from 4.0 to 10.0 at 12–36 °C. The hydrolysis reactions were unaffected by NH₄⁺-N, NO₃⁻-N or urea at equal N concentrations but were promoted by low inorganic P. Bacterial inoculation significantly decreased the organic P but increased the water-soluble P and Olsen P in the soil. Compared to the use of chemical fertilizers alone, the P uptake, biomass, and economic yield of lettuce increased by 16.41%, 11.58%, and 11.30%, respectively, with an increase in soil Olsen P in the L. enzymogenes LE16 plus chemical fertilizer treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Environmental adaptation and phosphatase production could be the mechanisms involved in soil P mineralization and plant pathogen suppression by L. enzymogenes LE16. This is the first demonstration of a new use of L. enzymogenes LE16 in agriculture beyond plant protection.  aPublisher supplied data  aCYB17064cChongqing Scientific Innovation Project for Postgraduates  acstc2018jscx-mszd0133cChongqing Science and Technology Committee  acstc2017shms-xdny80084cChongqing Science and Technology Committee  aZY 2015-03cZunyi Tobacco Company  aZY 2018-01cZunyi Tobacco Company 3aLactuca sativa 3aLysobacter enzymogenes 3aammonium nitrogen 3abacteria 3abiological control 3abiomass 3acrop yield 3adisease control 3aenzymes 3afertilizer application 3ahydrolysis 3ainorganic phosphorus 3alecithins 3alettuce 3aliquids 3amineral fertilizers 3amineralization 3anitrate nitrogen 3apH 3aplant growth 3aplant pathogens 3aplant protection 3aseedlings 3asoil 3asoil organic phosphorus 3aurea 3awater solubility1 aHuang, Jianguo1 aYuan, Ling1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0001-96870 tPlant and soil.g2019 Sept., v. 442, no. 1-2 p.299-309dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl49373x0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-019-04175-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02633naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245013400169500001400303520107100317592002801388650001301416650001601429650001401445650001901459650002101478650002301499650002401522650002401546650001401570650001101584650000701595650001501602650002501617650001201642650000901654653002001663653002601683653002601709653003201735653001101767653001501778653002301793700006101816700002201877700002001899773010001919856008702019852000902106655001202115IND60714970020221120195829.0210415e20210416xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071497002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1282732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDaoud, Samar10aLipid oxidation in oil-in-water emulsions: Iron complexation by buffer ions and transfer on the interface as a possible mechanism  aNAL-light  aLipid oxidation is the main hurdle for omega-3 fatty acid enrichment in food and beverages. Fat oxidation reduces the quality and safety of supplemented products. A tuna oil-in-water emulsion (20%v/v) was exposed to iron-induced oxidation. Emulsions with changing emulsifiers and buffers were analyzed under different storage conditions (argon purging, pH variation) using Conjugated Dienes and Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances assays. The results showed that free iron ions cannot interact with oxygen. However, buffers (Citrate and phosphate) chelate iron ions (Fe (II)). Depending on the pH value and the type of buffer-Fe (II) complex, its prooxidant activity and spatial distribution are influenced. The complex charge defines the interactions with the oil-water interface, i.e., positively charged interfaces repel positively charged complexes which keeps the prooxidant away. The mechanistic understanding of this work will help formulators and product developers to choose the right buffer and emulsifier combination for oxidation sensitive emulsions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acitrates 3aemulsifiers 3aemulsions 3afood chemistry 3alipid metabolism 3alipid peroxidation 3aoil-water interface 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3apH 3aphosphates 3aspatial distribution 3astorage 3atuna 0aLipid oxidation 0aOil-in-water emulsion 0aIron-oxygen complexes 0aIron-counter ions complexes 0aBuffer 0aEmulsifier 0aInterfacial charge1 aBou-Maroun, Elias1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0208-858X1 aWaschatko, Gustav1 aCayot, Philippe0 tFood chemistry.g2021 Apr. 16, v. 342 p.128273-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1282733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03204naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245007600167506010400243506007600347520174100423592002802164506003702192650001202229650001702241650001602258650001502274650001802289650001502307650001102322650000902333650001502342650001002357650001502367653003502382653001002417653002302427653001902450700002702469700002502496700002502521773010302546856008802649852000902737655001202746IND60765910420221207055359.0220509e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076591042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.earscirev.2022.1039452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeng, Xia14aThe current and future role of biota in soil-landscape evolution models  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBiota are major drivers of geomorphological development. Vegetation and soil fauna act as ecosystem engineers, changing the environment through physical structures and individual activities such as litter layering, tree uprooting, and animal mounding. Furthermore, through varying litter quality triggering different degrees of animal bioturbation, they jointly drive soil and landscape development heterogeneously in space over time. Soil-landscape evolution models succeed in incorporating soil development with landscape evolution. However, the roles of biota and biotic interactions in these models are still underexposed. We cannot fully understand changes in environmental and soil-landscape systems without a proper appreciation of biotic processes. In this contribution, we first review the role of biota in pedological and geomorphological processes. Then we compare the coverage of soil and landscape processes of soil-landscape evolution models and outline the role of biota in current soil-landscape evolution models. Finally, we define five levels of soil-landscape evolution model complexity that allow increased detail in biota-soil-landscape interactions. The results show how vegetation characteristics and animal bioturbation in current models are simplified compared with geomorphological processes, and that the geomorphological impact of litter quality and quantity and interactions between vegetation and animals are not taken into consideration at all. As understanding the complex soil-landscape-biota system is fundamental in exploring the coevolution of ecosystem and landscape, it deserves more efforts to develop a biota-soil-landscape evolution model that does more justice to the manifold impacts of biota.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimals 3abioturbation 3acoevolution 3aecosystems 3ageomorphology 3alandscapes 3amodels 3asoil 3asoil fauna 3atrees 3avegetation 0aSoil-landscape evolution model 0aBiota 0aEcosystem engineer 0aLitter quality1 aKooijman, Annemieke M.1 aTemme, Arnaud J.A.M.1 aCammeraat, Erik L.H.0 tEarth-science reviews.g2022 Mar., v. 226 p.103945-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11685x0012-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2022.1039453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03196naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094024002200138024001900160040001800179100002100197245010200218300001800320500001500338506007600353520175300429592002802182506003702210650000902247650001102256650001402267650001002281650001502291650002902306650000902335650001802344650001002362650001302372650001802385650001502403653002402418700002102442700002202463700002102485700002102506773008802527856009002615852000902705655001202714IND60090534920221207125737.0141102e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009053492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.05.0392doi7 aPMC37679802pmcid7 a237694192pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEnsign, Laura M.10aEnhanced vaginal drug delivery through the use of hypotonic formulations that induce fluid uptake  ap. 6922-6929.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMucosal epithelia use osmotic gradients for fluid absorption and secretion. We hypothesized that administration of hypotonic solutions would induce fluid uptake that could be advantageous for rapidly delivering drugs through mucus to the vaginal epithelium. We found that hypotonic formulations markedly increased the rate at which small molecule drugs and mucoinert nanoparticles (mucus-penetrating particles, or MPP), but not conventional mucoadhesive nanoparticles (CP), reached the vaginal epithelial surface in vivo in mice. Additionally, hypotonic formulations greatly enhanced drug and MPP delivery to the entire epithelial surface, including deep into the vaginal folds (rugae) that drugs or MPP in isotonic formulations failed to reach efficiently. However, hypotonic formulations caused unencapsulated “free” drugs to be drawn through the epithelium, reducing vaginal retention. In contrast, hypotonic formulations caused MPP to accumulate rapidly and uniformly on vaginal surfaces, ideally positioned for localized sustained drug delivery. Using a mouse model of vaginal genital herpes (HSV-2) infection, we found that hypotonic delivery of free drug led to improved immediate protection, but diminished longer-term protection. In contrast, as we previously demonstrated, hypotonic delivery of drug via MPP led to better long-term retention and protection in the vagina. Importantly, we demonstrate that slightly hypotonic formulations provided rapid and uniform delivery of MPP to the entire vaginal surface, thus enabling formulations with minimal risk of epithelial toxicity. Hypotonic formulations for vaginal drug delivery via MPP may significantly improve prevention and treatment of reproductive tract diseases and disorders.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3arisk 3avagina 3asecretion 3adrugs 3aabsorption 3aHuman alphaherpesvirus 2 3amice 3aanimal models 3amucus 3atoxicity 3ananoparticles 3aepithelium 0aHuman herpesvirus 21 aHoen, Timothy E.1 aMaisel, Katharina1 aCone, Richard A.1 aHanes, Justin S.0 tBiomaterials.g2013 Sept., v. 34, no. 28 p.6922-6929dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.05.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01848naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002800145245006600173300001200239500001400251520090600265592002801171650001501199650001201214650001801226650001101244700001701255700002001272700002301292700001801315773010101333856007901434852000901513655001201522IND60120013420221122061943.0150118e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012001342DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2745.123422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReyer, Christopher P.O.10aForest resilience, tipping points and global change processes  ap. 1-4.  aEDITORIAL  aForests around the world are changing as a result of human activity.

This editorial summarizes the key findings of the seven papers in this Special Feature and puts them in the wider context of resilience thinking. Synthesis. The contributions to this Special Feature show that resilience is a useful concept to understand ecosystem change but that we have to develop a better understanding of the mechanisms and feedback loops involved in forest resilience and potential tipping points. Finally, this Special Feature presents evidence about how resilience thinking is used to better understand and manage degraded forests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystems 3aforests 3aglobal change 3ahumans1 aRammig, Anja1 aBrouwers, Niels1 aLangerwisch, Fanny1 aGibson, David0 tjournal of ecology.g2015 Jan., v. 103, no. 1 p.1-4dBlackwell Scientific Publ.x0022-04777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.123423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03009naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245014700161300001600308520161900324592002801943650002701971650001101998650001602009650002002025650001502045650001102060650001102071650001402082650001102096650001902107650001902126650000902145650001602154651001802170700002102188700001902209700002102228700001702249700002402266700001802290700001802308700002102326773009802347856007302445852000902518655001202527IND60163217920221121144827.0150530e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6016321792DNAL7 a10.1111/fog.121062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNishikawa, Haruka10aWind‐induced stock variation of the neon flying squid (Ommastrephes bartramii) winter–spring cohort in the subtropical North Pacific Ocean  ap. 229-241.  aOur examination of the neon flying squid (Ommastrephes bartramii) winter–spring cohort catch per unit effort (CPUE, an index of stock) revealed significant positive correlations with the interannual variations of observed chlorophyll‐a (Chl‐a) concentration and autumn–winter mixed layer depth (MLD) in the winter–spring feeding grounds of paralarvae and juveniles (130–170°E, 20–27°N). These correlations suggest the importance of integrated bottom‐up effects by the autumn–winter MLD for the neon flying squid stocks. However, the influence of autumn–winter MLD interannual variation in the forage availability for paralarvae and juveniles, i.e., particulate organic matter and zooplankton, has still been unclear. In this study, we use the lower trophic ecosystem model NEMURO, which uses the physical environmental data from the ocean reanalysis dataset obtained by the four‐dimensional variational (4DVAR) data assimilation method. The model‐based investigation enables us to clarify how the autumn–winter MLD controls the particulate organic matter and zooplankton abundance in the feeding grounds. Further, our investigation of the autumn–winter MLD interannual variation demonstrates that the stronger autumn wind in the feeding grounds develops a deeper mixed layer. Therefore, the deep mixed layer entrains nutrient‐rich water and enhances photosynthesis, which results in good feeding conditions for paralarvae and juveniles. Our results underline that the wind system interannual variation has critical roles on the winter–spring cohort of the neon flying squid stock.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOmmastrephes bartramii 3aautumn 3achlorophyll 3adata collection 3aecosystems 3aflight 3aforage 3ajuveniles 3amodels 3aorganic matter 3aphotosynthesis 3awind 3azooplankton 3aPacific Ocean1 aToyoda, Takahiro1 aMasuda, Shuhei1 aIshikawa, Yoichi1 aSasaki, Yuji1 aIgarashi, Hiromichi1 aSakai, Mitsuo1 aSeito, Masaki1 aAwaji, Toshiyuki0 tFisheries oceanography.g2015 May, v. 24, no. 3 p.229-241dBlackwell Sciencex1054-60067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fog.121063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03131naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005600145245008400201300001800285500002000303520205400323592002802377596005302405650001902458650001202477650001402489650002302503650001402526700006002540773012802600856008002728852000902808655001202817IND60752717820221120062417.0211006e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075271782DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2656.135392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Dongmin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1508-159010aMigration and tolerance shape host behaviour and response to parasite infection  ap. 2315-2324.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNumerous theoretical models have demonstrated that migration, a seasonal animal movement behaviour, can minimize the risks and costs of parasite infection. Past work on migration–infection interactions assumes migration is the only strategy available to organisms for dealing with the parasite infection, that is they migrate to a different environment to recover or escape from infection. Thus, migration is similar to the non‐spatial strategy of resistance, where hosts prevent infection or kill parasites once infected. However, an alternative defence strategy is to tolerate the infection and experience a lower cost to the infection. To our knowledge, no studies have examined how migration can change based on combining two host strategies (migration and tolerance) for dealing with parasites. In this paper, we aim to understand how both parasite transmission and infection tolerance can influence the host's migratory behaviour. We constructed a model that incorporates two host strategies (migration and tolerance) to understand whether allowing for tolerance affects the proportion of the population that migrates at equilibrium in response to infection. We show that the benefits of tolerance can either decrease or increase the host's migration. Also, if the benefit of migration is great, then individuals are more likely to migrate regardless of the presence of tolerance. Finally, we find that the transmission rate of parasite infection can either decrease or increase the tolerant host's migration, depending on the cost of migration. These findings highlight that adopting two defence strategies is not always beneficial to the hosts. Instead, a single strategy is often better, depending on the costs and benefits of the strategies and infection pressures. Our work further suggests that multiple host‐defence strategies as a potential explanation for the evolution of migration to minimize the parasite infection. Moreover, migration can also affect the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of parasite–host interactions.  aPublisher supplied data  aDEB‐1654609cDivision of Environmental Biology 3aanimal ecology 3aanimals 3aevolution 3amigratory behavior 3aparasites1 aShaw, Allison K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7969-83650 tjournal of animal ecology.g2021 Oct., v. 90, no. 10 p.2315-2324dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl16424x0021-87907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.135393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02076naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001700154245010000171300001600271520102300287592002801310650002001338650001001358650002301368650001401391650002001405650001001425650001901435650000901454651002101463700002401484700001801508700001801526773010601544856005501650852000901705655001201714IND50064471220221119141505.0130331e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006447122DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1574-0862.2012.00612.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Kwansoo10aSpecialization, diversification, and productivity: a panel data analysis of rice farms in Korea  ap. 687-700.  aThis article examines the microeconomics of productivity associated with specialization/diversification in production activities, with an application to Korean rice farms. Korean rice farms tend to be very small and highly specialized. Our analysis examines the productivity effects associated with both farm size and farm specialization/diversification in Korean agriculture. Relying on farm‐level panel data, the analysis studies farm productivity in a multi‐input multi‐output context, accounting not only for changes in inputs and technical change in rice production, but also for the role of diversification in the production of other crops in current and previous periods. We find positive but small productivity gains from farm diversification. These gains come mostly from complementarity effects across farm outputs, with minimal effect of scale economies. The positive complementarity effects work against nonconvexity effects, which provide strong productivity incentives for rice farms to specialize.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrop production 3acrops 3aeconomies of scale 3afarm size 3afarming systems 3afarms 3amicroeconomics 3arice 3aKorean Peninsula1 aChavas, Jean‐Paul1 aBarham, Brad,1 aFoltz, Jeremy0 tAgricultural economics.g2012 Nov., v. 43, no. 6 p.687-700dBlackwell Publishing Incx0169-51507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-0862.2012.00612.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02135naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245014600161300001400307520070700321592002801028650000801056650001301064650001201077650002501089650002101114650002001135650002101155650001501176650001201191650001101203650001801214650001401232650000701246650001101253650002001264653002401284653001701308653005101325653003701376653002801413700001601441700001601457773009001473856008101563852000901644655001201653IND60544697720221118043131.0160901e20140217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054469772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2013.12.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSerpi, C.10aElectroanalytical quantification of total dsDNA extracted from human sample using, an ionic liquid modified, carbon nanotubes paste electrode  ap. 26-32.  aDirect electrochemistry of dsDNA has been achieved by using an ionic liquid 1-butyl-4-methylpyridinium hexafluorophosphate modified carbon nanotubes paste electrode (IL-CNTPE).

The basal area decreased and the size structure of trees altered in the stands studied due to repeated, intense selective logging, in which larger trees were cut down as a priority. Sapling density in the stands was much lower than that in primary forests. In the simple and multiple regression analyses that were used to estimate the effects of selective logging on sapling density, sapling density had a significant positive correlation with tree density and had little correlation with the density of logged stumps or the height ofSasa (dwarf bamboo) growing on the forest floor. These results suggest that the establishment sites around canopy trees influenced the establishment of saplings, rather than the gaps caused by selective logging. However, both the coefficient of determination and the standardized partial regression coefficient of multiple regression analysis were higher for the stand with a dense cover ofSasa than for the stand with a sparse cover ofSasa. Thus, the success of regenerating forests with selective logging depends on both the site of advanced regeneration and the light conditions that regulate growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJapan 3aadvanced regeneration 3abamboos 3acanopy 3aforest litter 3anational parks 3aregression analysis 3aresearch 3astand structure 0aestablishment sites 0aPicea-Abies forest 0aSasa 0aselective logging 0asustainable yield1 aKubota, Yasuhiro1 aWatanabe, Nobuyuki0 tJournal of forest research.g1999 Feb. 1, v. 4, no. 1 p.41-45dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl3870061x1610-74037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF027603233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02368naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006700145245007400212300001800286500002000304520122300324592002801547650001901575650000901594650001301603650003201616650001401648650001501662650001701677700006101694700005801755773012801813856008001941852000902021655001202030IND60752717920221120062500.0211006e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075271792DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2656.135492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBruckerhoff, Lindsey A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9523-480810aDo fine‐scale experiments underestimate predator consumption rates?  ap. 2391-2403.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aUnderstanding ecological processes across spatial scales helps link observations and predictions from experiments to ecological patterns occurring at coarser scales relevant to management and conservation. Using fish, we experimentally manipulated the size of arenas to test the spatial scaling of predator–prey interactions. We measured variation in predator consumption and prey behaviour (prey aggregation, spatial overlap with predators and movement) across arena sizes. Variation in prey behaviour across arena sizes was hypothesized to drive consumption patterns by altering prey vigilance and encounter rates with predators. Per capita consumption and movement were highest in the largest arena relative to the smallest and we observed a mismatch between where bass were present and the highest densities of prey across all arena sizes. We hypothesize more movement in largest arenas increased encounter rates and drove the observed increase in consumption with increasing arena size.

Communities with multiple predators that interact and differ in their use of space, time of activity and hunting mode create a complex landscape for prey to avoid predation. Anthropogenic presence and disturbance have the potential to shift interactions among predators and prey and the where and when encounters occur. We examined how white‐tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus fawn spatiotemporal antipredator behaviour differed along an anthropogenic disturbance gradient that had black bears Ursus americanus, coyotes Canis latrans, bobcats Lynx rufus and humans present. We quantified (a) spatial co‐occurrence in species distributions, (b) temporal overlap across the diel cycle and (c) spatiotemporal associations between humans, bears, coyotes, bobcats, adult male deer and fawns. We also examined how deer vigilance behaviour changed across the anthropogenic disturbance gradient and survey duration. Anthropogenic disturbance influenced spatiotemporal co‐occurrence across multiple scales, often increasing spatiotemporal overlap among species. In general, species’ spatial co‐occurrence was neutral or positive in anthropogenically disturbed environments. Bears and fawns, coyotes and adult male deer, and bobcats and fawns all had higher temporal overlap in the agriculture‐development matrix sites. In addition, factors that influenced deer vigilance (e.g. distance to forest edge and predator relative abundance) in the agriculture‐development matrix sites did not in the forest matrix site. By taking into account the different antipredator behaviours that can be detected and the different scales these behaviours might occur, we were able to gain a more comprehensive picture of how humans reduce available niche space for wildlife, creating the neutral and positive spatiotemporal associations between species that studies have been seeing in more disturbed areas.  aPublisher supplied data  cPennsylvania Game Commission  cPNC Financial Corporation  cPennsylvania State University  cPNC Financial Corporation Graduate Fellowship  cPenn State Alumni Association Graduate Fellowship  cPenn State Bunton‐Waller Graduate Award 3aCanis latrans 3aLynx rufus 3aOdocoileus virginianus 3aUrsus americanus 3aadults 3aanimal ecology 3aanthropogenic activities 3aantipredatory behavior 3adeer 3aedge effects 3afawns 3aforests 3alandscapes 3amales 3apredation 3arisk 3asurveys 3awildlife1 aDiefenbach, Duane R.1 aTernent, Mark1 aLovallo, Matt1 aMiller, David1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3011-36770 tjournal of animal ecology.g2021 Oct., v. 90, no. 10 p.2377-2390dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl16424x0021-87907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.135483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03375naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005400150245016200204300001600366520171900382592002802101650001602129650001402145650001402159650002302173650001202196650001902208650001502227650002002242650001502262650001302277650000902290650001602299650001702315650001402332650001102346650001702357650002802374650001402402650002402416650001402440653002702454653001402481653001002495653001402505653001502519653002402534700005602558700001602614773009702630856008502727852000902812655001202821IND60766437720221117032712.0220314e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076643772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2022.01.1222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Quan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0501-753610aMolybdenum and zirconium oxides supported on KIT-6 silica: A recyclable composite catalyst for one–pot biodiesel production from simulated low-quality oils  ap. 907-922.  aThe development of feasible ecofriendly processes for biodiesel production is highly desirable to meet the requirement of green chemistry and sustainable development. To reach this goal, the molybdenum and zirconium oxides were incorporated into commercial available KIT-6, mesoporous silica nanoparticle, by a solvothermal method, to form MoO₃/ZrO₂/KIT-6 catalyst. The targeted solid composite catalysts were structurally characterized using XRD, TEM, SEM, XPS, EDS, TG, and nitrogen porosimetry measurement. The characterization results showed that the ordered porous structure of the support was well persevered with high surface area, and the molybdenum and zirconium oxides could be highly dispersed on the mesoporous support. The acidic nature of the solid catalyst was evaluated in detail by means of NH₃-TPD and infrared spectra of adsorbed pyridine techniques. It was indicated that the acidities of the solid catalysts, with both Brønsted and Lewis acid sites, could greatly affected their catalytic activity. This catalyst displayed high activities to the transesterification of triglycerides and esterification of free fatty acids (FFAs) simultaneously owing to the synergistic effect of Brønsted and Lewis acid sites, thus achieving one-pot heterogeneous production of biodiesel as the low-quality oil was used as feedstocks. The influence of reaction parameters and the catalyst reusability were also investigated, and the best oil conversion of 92.7% was obtained under the optimized reaction conditions. The targeted catalyst exhibited a better FFAs and water tolerant for the reaction, advantageously with no noticeable decline in the catalytic performance even after five reaction cycles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3abiodiesel 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adecline 3aesterification 3afeedstocks 3agreen chemistry 3amolybdenum 3anitrogen 3aoils 3aporosimetry 3aporous media 3apyridines 3asilica 3asurface area 3asustainable development 3asynergism 3atransesterification 3azirconium 0aHeterogeneous catalyst 0aBiodiesel 0aKIT-6 0aZirconium 0aMolybdenum 0aTransesterification1 aWenlei Xie, 1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8782-91341 aGuo, Lihong0 tRenewable energy.g2022 Mar., v. 187 p.907-922dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2022.01.1223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01896naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245010500164300001600269520084400285592002801129650001201157650001401169650002501183650002401208650001401232650002201246700001501268700001801283700001301301700001801314773010101332856008101433990002301514852000901537655001201546IND60093166820221117235339.0141103e20121001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009316682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2012.05.1002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuan, Xuezhi10aMCM-41 supported CoMo bimetallic catalysts for enhanced hydrogen production by ammonia decomposition  ap. 103-108.  aMCM-41 supported Co, Mo and CoMo bimetallic catalysts with different Co/Mo atomic ratios were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation, and the channels of MCM-41 acted as nano-reactor. The catalysts without pre-nitridation treatments were directly used to catalyze ammonia decomposition. The characterization of the catalysts was carried out by N₂ physisorption, H₂-TPR, Raman, XRD, TEM and XPS. The results show that the catalysts have the similar size distribution of metallic particles. Due to the synergistic effect between Co and Mo, MCM-41 supported CoMo bimetallic catalysts show higher ammonia decomposition activity compared to Co or Mo alone. The CoMo bimetallic catalyst with the Co/Mo atomic ratio of about 7/3 exhibits the highest NH₃ conversion.

Kristian10aLentil Water Use and Fallow Water Loss in a Semiarid Climate  ap. 723-728.  aepub  aWith renewed interest in legumes for green manures or as partial summer fallow replacement crops, it is important to know water requirements of these crops in semiarid agriculture. Our objective was to evaluate seasonal water use by black lentil (Lens culinaris Medikus cv. Indianhead), a potential fallow replacement crop, and to relate water use to parameters useful as soil water management tools. We measured evapotranspiration (ET) from two precision weighing lysimeters located on a Williams loam (fine-loamy, mixed Typic Argiboroll) near Sidney, MT. The lysimeters were in adjacent 180- by 180-mf ields in a typical strip-crop environmenot f the semiarid northern Great Plains. Bowen ratio estimates of ET were also obtained. Lentil was seeded no-till into wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) stubble on one lysimeter field in 1993, and the other was left in chemical fallow. Seeded and fallow fields were rotated in 1994. Water loss by ET from lentil and fallow lysimeters was the same (≂25 mm) for 3 wk following seeding. Plant height was related to growing degree days (GDD) in both years. Cumulative ET was related to GDD for both years until about 800 GDD, corresponding to nearly 300 nun ET. Deciding how much water to sacrifice (with hopes of recovery during the noncrop period) becomes a matter of judgment about probable rainfall. At full bloom (≂2 Mg ha⁻¹ dry matter production), the lentil crop used about 50 to 70 mm more water than fallow. Probably no more than 50 mm of water loss above that from fallow should be sacrificed if a grain crop is to be seeded the following year. From a practical standpoint, because plant height was closely related to both GDD and cumulative ET, it is plausible that a simple measure of lentil height (about 350 mmm aximumc) an give sufficient accuracy for determining when lentil growth, as a partial sunnner fallow replacement crop in a semiarid climate, should be terminated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aheight 3aplant characteristics 3aLens culinaris 3acover crops 3agreen manures 3afallow 3asoil water 3alosses from soil 3aheat sums 3aevapotranspiration 3adry matter accumulation 3acorrelation 3awater conservation 3asemiarid zones 3aMontana1 aPikul, Joseph L.1 aPrueger, John H.1 aHatfield, Jerry L.0 tAgronomy journal.g1996 Sept., v. 88, no. 5 p.723-728dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/148333Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj1996.00021962008800050007x3Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle01945naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245011300171300001600284520064600300592002800946650001100974650002100985650001201006650001901018650001801037650001701055650002401072650002201096650000901118650001601127650001001143651001101153653003001164653002001194653001801214653002401232653002401256700002501280700002201305773008201327856008101409852000901490655001201499IND60637800820221117220825.0190424s1995    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063780082DNAL7 a10.1163/22941932-900014302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDevall, Margaret S.10aDendroecological Analysis of Cordia Alliodora, Pseudobombax Septenatum and Annona Spraguei in Central Panama  ap. 411-424.  aSeveral plant communities in central Panama, each community located near a weather station, contain trees with annual growth rings, i. e.

Meanwhile, guanxi continues to be an important factor in the labor market and academic success of Chinese individuals, despite the shift from socialism to capitalism. In Japan, mutual monitoring among kin and coworkers make for a society based on strong ties. In Korea, voluntary associations are important communal spaces for meeting diverse contacts. In China’s neighborhoods, cooperation between neighbors coexists with social control from above to reinforce social hierarchy. The issue ends with a note about the importance of cultivating guanxi in organizations and in everyday life.  aFunding The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacademic achievement 3acapitalism 3akinship 3alabor market 3amonitoring 3asocial capital 3asocial networks 3asocialism 3aChina 3aJapan 3aKorean Peninsula 3aSouth East Asia 0ainternational comparisons 0akinship 0alabor markets 0aeducation 0avoluntary associations 0aneighborhoods 0aguanxi 0anetworks 0aEast Asian societies 0aChina 0aTaiwan 0aJapan 0aChinese diaspora 0aKorea1 aWellman, Barry0 tAmerican behavioral scientist.g, v. 59, no. 8 p.903-913dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2328x1552-33817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00027642155805853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02353naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245007900165300001400244520126100258592002801519650002401547650000901571650002001580650001801600650001901618650001101637653003001648653001801678653001801696653002301714700002001737700001801757773012201775856008501897852000901982655001201991IND50069526120221122060658.0190318e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006952612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2013.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Xiang10aDevelopment of a target recognition and following system for a field robot  ap. 17-24.  aThe objective of this study was to develop a target recognition and following system for a field robot. The platform used in this study was an electric vehicle that had been modified into an automatic vehicle. A 3D camera was attached in the front of the vehicle to deliver depth and grayscale information on the environment. The degrees of correspondence between objects present in consecutive frames were calculated using their spatial descriptors and grayscale features. A correspondence assigner was designed to recognize the same objects in consecutive frames, and their locations could be acquired at the same time. Based on a pursuit strategy, an appropriate steering angle was calculated for the robot vehicle to move towards the target. A PID controller was used to determine appropriate vehicle speed for maintaining a certain distance from the target. Field tests were conducted to evaluate robustness and performance of the system. Results showed that the robot vehicle was correctly and effectively guided to follow the target while preventing collisions with disturbances. RMS errors were 1.0m and 1.3° in terms of space and deflection angle, respectively, when following a target that moved in a straight line at an average speed of 1.1m/s.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomatic detection 3abias 3acomputer vision 3acontact angle 3adigital images 3arobots 0aCorrespondence assignment 0aRobot vehicle 0aSpace keeping 0aTarget recognition1 aNoguchi, Noboru1 aChoi, Jongmin0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2013 Oct., v. 98 p.17-24dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2013.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03153naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245019400168300001600362520179400378592002802172650001302200650001502213650003102228650002502259650001202284650001902296650001602315650002402331653002102355653002802376653002402404653002602428653001002454653002602464700002102490700002402511773011302535856008602648852000902734655001202743IND60637466820221119083657.0190529e20190720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063746682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.04.0702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKurda, Rawaz10aCONCRETop method: Optimization of concrete with various incorporation ratios of fly ash and recycled aggregates in terms of quality performance and life-cycle cost and environmental impacts  ap. 642-657.  aThis study shows how to optimize traditional and non-traditional concrete mixes from various perspectives, specifically technical performance (e.g. mechanical and durability characteristics), and economic (cost) and environmental (e.g. global warming and energy consumption) life cycle. Firstly, the weight to be considered for each of these perspectives (dimensions) of performance depends on the concrete application and on the user's requirements. In this study, concrete mixes containing various amounts of recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) and/or fly ash (FA) are optimized for different applications in the construction sector, namely high-rise building, sustainable residential housing, economical residential housing and residential housing close or far from the sea. For that purpose, the CONCRETop (a multi-criteria decision method for concrete optimization) methodology (developed by the authors of this study) was applied to these concrete mixes by considering the global requirement scenarios (e.g. cost, strength, green, service life and business as usual) that are normally demanded by users. This study is an example of CONCRETop's application and also contributes to its validation. The results show that, for all applications and scenarios that users may demand, the optimum concrete mixes in terms of concrete characteristics, cost and environmental impact are the ones produced with both FA and RCA incorporation, rather than their individual incorporation. This study shows that CONCRETop is straightforward in its application, i.e. it does not require excessive time and resources, and is focused on the final output, where the selection of the optimal concrete mixes can be directly used by the user, avoiding therefore lengthy inventory analysis and modifications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconcrete 3adurability 3aenergy use and consumption 3aenvironmental impact 3afly ash 3aglobal warming 3ainventories 3aresidential housing 0aOptimum concrete 0aMulti-criteria analysis 0aQuality performance 0aLife cycle assessment 0aCosts 0aEnvironmental impacts1 aBrito, Jorge de,1 aSilvestre, José D.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 July 20, v. 226 p.642-657dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.04.0703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03203naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002400153245009400177300001600271520190100287592002802188650005802216650001902274650002102293650002002314650002502334650002402359650003002383650001802413650001502431650001602446653003502462653003002497653001502527653002802542653001502570700002002585773009202605856008702697852000902784655001202793IND60546773120221117230042.0160903e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054677312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2013.08.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOberlack, Christoph10aAlleviating barriers to urban climate change adaptation through international cooperation  ap. 349-362.  aInternational cooperation on climate change adaptation is regarded as one of the major avenues to reduce vulnerability in developing countries. Nevertheless, it remains unclear which design properties of international arrangements match with specific problems in local adaptation processes. This paper analyses conditions and institutional design options under which international cooperation can facilitate climate adaptation in urban areas in developing countries. We conduct a qualitative meta-analysis of empirical evidence from 23 cases. Using the archetype approach, we identify re-appearing barriers and change factors in urban squatter settlements and municipal public sectors in developing countries. We characterise five generic modes of international cooperation for climate adaptation based on UNFCCC documents, process observation, and literature review. Combining these analyses, we develop testable propositions that explain how specific design options of international arrangements can alleviate barriers and make use of change factors for urban adaptation in developing countries. We find, first, that international cooperation has the most potential to tackle adaptation barriers in squatter settlements if its institutional mechanisms support improvements of procedures and rights in localised state–society interactions. Second, national or regional centres of competence may foster endogenous dynamics in municipal public sectors. Third, national adaptation policies can enable and incentivise municipal adaptation. Fourth, flexible indicators of adaptation benefits are instruments to tailor international decision making and monitoring systems to local needs. We conclude that these insights, the archetypes approach, and a multi-level study design can be used to advance research on international cooperation, barriers, and success factors for climate change adaptation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3adecision making 3adeveloping countries 3aexperimental design 3ainternational cooperation 3ameta-analysis 3amonitoring 3aurban areas 0aBarriers to climate adaptation 0aInternational cooperation 0aUrban poor 0aMunicipal public sector 0aArchetypes1 aEisenack, Klaus0 tGlobal environmental change.g2014 Jan., v. 24 p.349-362dElsevier Ltdx0959-37807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2013.08.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02533naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245014700207300001600354520120300370592002801573650001301601650001701614650001001631650001501641650001801656650001301674653004301687653002601730653002501756653003301781653004501814653002301859700005401882700002001936773009701956856008502053852000902138655001202147IND60766437920221117033531.0220314e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076643792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2022.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSon, Jonghyun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4926-472310aRelationship between number of turns of serpentine structure with metal foam flow field and polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell performance  ap. 372-383.  aMetal foam flow field is applied on a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) to improve its performance by enhancing mass transfer property. Generally, the metal foam is employed without any structure in the channel location, which results in the mainstream of reactants not flowing to the corner of the reaction area and instead of flowing straight from inlet to outlet. This causes an uneven reaction rate throughout the reaction area. To resolve the problem, the serpentine structure was devised on a metal foam flow field at the cathode to guide the reactant flow path to the corner of the reaction area. The number of turns of the serpentine structure was controlled as variables. With the increase in the number of turns, the reactant concentration at reaction sited increased, improving the PEMFC performance. At 0.5 V, PEMFC with metal foam and 2 turns serpentine structure shows 4.7% improved performance. However, due to the increased length of flow from the structure, the pressure drop that induced high parasitic loss became higher. As a result, the net power of PEMFC with serpentine structure considering parasitic loss improved 1.7% comparing to PEMFC with bulk metal foam.  aPublisher supplied data 3acathodes 3aelectrolytes 3afoams 3afuel cells 3amass transfer 3apolymers 0aPolymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell 0aMetal foam flow field 0aSerpentine structure 0aComputational fluid dynamics 0aMass transfer characteristic improvement 0aTwo phase analysis1 aUm, Sukkee1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8017-51471 aKim, Young-Beom0 tRenewable energy.g2022 Apr., v. 188 p.372-383dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2022.02.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02672naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245011800166520132700284592002801611650001501639650001601654650001201670650001201682650001401694650001501708650002201723650001301745650000901758650001801767650002001785650001501805650000901820651001201829651001101841700002201852700002201874700001901896700001801915700002501933700002901958773013401987856008402121852000902205655001202214IND60757560720221121083442.0211125e20211023xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075756072DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture111110422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLepse, Liga 10aInfluence of Baltic Agro-Environmental Conditions on Yield and Quality of Fava Bean Crops in Conventional Systems  aFava bean (Vicia faba L.) yields are featured by high variability, influenced by the agro-environmental conditions during the growing seasons. These legume crops are sensitive to hydric and heat stresses. The adaptation depends on the efficiency of specific cultivars to use the available resources to produce biomass. This capacity is determined by the genotype and agronomical management practices. The present work aimed to uncover the influence of Baltic agro-environmental conditions (fava bean cultivar, plant density, climate, and soil features) on yield and protein content. For this, field trials were set under Baltic agro-climatic conditions, in Latvia and Estonia with five commercially available fava bean cultivars, representing broad genetic variation (‘Gloria’, ‘Julia’, ‘Jogeva’, ‘Lielplatones’, and ‘Bauska’). The results evidenced ‘Bauska’, ‘Julia’, and ‘Lielplatones’, as the most productive cultivars in terms of seed yield (4.5, 3.7, and 4.6 t ha⁻¹, respectively) and protein yield (1.39, 1.22, and 1.36 t ha⁻¹, respectively) under Estonian and Latvian agro-climatic conditions. Sowing these specific cultivars at densities of 30–40 seeds m⁻² constitutes sustainable management for fava bean production in conventional cropping systems in the Baltic region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVicia faba 3aagriculture 3abiomass 3aclimate 3acultivars 3afaba beans 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3aheat 3aplant density 3aprotein content 3aseed yield 3asoil 3aEstonia 3aLatvia1 aVågen, Ingunn M.1 aZeipina, Solvita 1 aTorp, Torfinn 1 aOlle, Margit 1 aRosa, E.q(Eduardo),1 aDomínguez-Perles, Raul 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2021 Oct. 23, v. 11, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture111110423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03039naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002700176245007600203300001500279520155700294592002801851650001501879650001701894650001801911650002001929650001701949650001001966650001901976650002401995650000902019650001202028650002002040650001302060650001502073650001702088700004002105700002002145700002102165700002102186773015202207856007002359856009602429990002302525852000902548655001202557IND60608577020221118170250.0190510e20170809xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060857702DNAL7 a10.3791/560632doi7 aPMC56141422pmcid7 a288294102pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLandeira, Bruna Soares10aLive imaging of primary cerebral cortex cells using a 2d culture system  ap. e56063.  aDuring cerebral cortex development, progenitor cells undergo several rounds of symmetric and asymmetric cell divisions to generate new progenitors or postmitotic neurons. Later, some progenitors switch to a gliogenic fate, adding to the astrocyte and oligodendrocyte populations. Using time-lapse video-microscopy of primary cerebral cortex cell cultures, it is possible to study the cellular and molecular mechanisms controlling the mode of cell division and cell cycle parameters of progenitor cells. Similarly, the fate of postmitotic cells can be examined using cell-specific fluorescent reporter proteins or post-imaging immunocytochemistry. More importantly, all these features can be analyzed at the single-cell level, allowing the identification of progenitors committed to the generation of specific cell types. Manipulation of gene expression can also be performed using viral-mediated transfection, allowing the study of cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous phenomena. Finally, the use of fusion fluorescent proteins allows the study of symmetric and asymmetric distribution of selected proteins during division and the correlation with daughter cells fate. Here, we describe the time-lapse video-microscopy method to image primary cerebral cortex murine cells for up to several days and analyze the mode of cell division, cell cycle length and fate of newly generated cells. We also describe a simple method to transfect progenitor cells, which can be applied to manipulate genes of interest or simply label cells with reporter proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aastrocytes 3acell culture 3acell division 3acerebral cortex 3afluorescence 3agenes 3aimage analysis 3aimmunocytochemistry 3amice 3aneurons 3aoligodendroglia 3aproteins 3astem cells 3atransfection1 aAraújo, Jéssica Alves de Medeiros1 aSchroeder, Timm1 aMüller, Ulrich,1 aCosta, Marcos R.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2017 Aug. 09, , no. 126 p.e56063-e56063dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/560633Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/56063/live-imaging-primary-cerebral-cortex-cells-using-2d-culture  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02631naa a2200385 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005000099040001800149100001800167245006700185300001600252500000900268520145000277592002801727650001601755650002601771650001201797650002501809650001101834650001101845650001501856650002501871650002501896650002201921650001101943650001501954700001901969700001701988773012302005852000902128856009602137655001202233991582124890742620221119024914.0191122e197109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7191658382DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1971.00021962006300050037x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMillar, A.

Water potentials of florets and pedicels were always lower than leaf water potentials. Water potential difference between the florets and the soil of as much as ∗9 bars were found. The greatest drop in water potential was found between the flowers and the upper part of the seed stalk. These differences in water potential were found even when plants were growing in soil well supplied with water. Transpiration rates of the leaves were the greatest of all plant parts, the seed stalk next (about 15 to 20% of the flux density from the leaves), and the umbel lowest, representing a very small fraction of the total. Stomatal resistance of the leaves was at all times lower than seed stalk stomatal resistances. An almost on-off stomatal behavior by which the onion plant regulates its transpiration was found to operate in a narrow range of leaf water potential, ∗3 to ∗7 bars. The relation between flux density and water potential drop was found to be highly nonlinear in plants growing in different soils and under a wide range of soil water potential and environmental conditions. Impedance to water flow in the seed stalk was 5 to 8 times greater than in the leaves. For the same conditions potential drop between soil and root surface was less than 5 cm of water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllium cepa 3aenvironmental factors 3aflorets 3aleaf water potential 3aleaves 3aonions 3asoil water 3asoil water potential 3astomatal conductance 3astomatal movement 3aumbels 3awater flow1 aGardner, W.

In a first step sorptive extraction was studied both in the headspace (HSSE) and in the immerse mode (SBSE). The best results were obtained in the immersion mode which was further studied. The influence of the main factors: methanol (20%) and NaCl addition (0%), extraction temperature (40°C) and time (180min), extraction solvent volume (9mL) and stirring rate (600rpm) on the efficiency of SBSE was evaluated by means of experimental designs. In the case of TD, desorption time (10min), desorption temperature (300°C), cryo-focusing temperature (−30°C), vent flow (75mL/min) and vent pressure (7.2psi) were studied using both a fractioned factorial design and a central composite design (CCD). The method was validated in terms of apparent recoveries (AR%), method detection limits (MDLs) and precision at two different concentration levels. Although quantification using instrumental calibration rendered odd results in most of the cases, satisfactory recoveries (74–126%) were obtained in the case of matrix-matched calibration approach for all of the analytes and matrices studied at the two concentration levels evaluated. MDLs in the range of 0.01–0.8ng/g and 0.01–1.1ng/g were obtained for vegetables and amended soil samples, respectively. RSD values within 1–23% were obtained for all the analytes and matrices. Finally, the method was applied to the determination of musks in vegetable and amended soil samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarrots 3adesorption 3adetection limit 3aexperimental design 3aheadspace analysis 3alettuce 3amass spectrometry 3amethanol 3amixing 3apepper 3asodium chloride 3asoil amendments 3asoil sampling 3asolvents 3atemperature 0aMusks 0aStir-bar sorptive extraction 0aThermal desorption 0aVegetables 0aAmended soil1 aBizkarguenaga, Ekhiñe1 aIparraguirre, Arantza1 aFernández, Luis Angel,1 aZuloaga, Olatz1 aPrieto, Ailette0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2014 Feb. 17, v. 812 p.74-82dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2013.12.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02276naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245014000166300001600306520104100322592002801363650001201391650001101403650002301414650002501437650001501462650001401477650001301491650002401504650002201528650001601550650001301566700001801579700001801597700001901615700001801634773010101652856008101753990002301834852000901857655001201866IND60093167220221117235309.0141103e20121001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009316722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2012.06.1382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakasaka, Yuta10aKinetic study for burning regeneration of coked MFI-type zeolite and numerical modeling for regeneration process in a fixed-bed reactor  ap. 368-376.  aKinetic analysis of burning regeneration of coked MFI-type zeolite obtained by catalytic cracking of n-hexane was studied using a multiple-reaction model. Hydrogen contained in the coke was oxidized faster than carbon, and subsequently carbon remaining after the hydrogen combustion was gradually oxidized. Reaction rates of carbon and hydrogen correlated with the Arrhenius equation; and activation energies for the combustion of carbon and hydrogen were 156kJ/mol and 140kJ/mol, respectively, regardless of the coke loading. Regeneration of coked MFI-type zeolite in the fixed-bed reactor was simulated numerically using reaction rates obtained from the kinetic analysis. The numerical result for changes in gas composition with time at the reactor outlet agreed well with the experimental results. Axial distribution of the temperature and concentration of water vapor in the catalyst bed was obtained numerically and results showed that the temperature and water vapor near the outlet were higher than other location in the reactor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aburning 3acarbon 3acatalytic cracking 3achemical engineering 3acombustion 3aequations 3ahydrogen 3amathematical models 3awater temperature 3awater vapor 3azeolites1 aTago, Teruoki1 aKonno, Hiroki1 aOkabe, Akihiro1 aMasuda, Takao0 tChemical engineering journal.g2012 Oct. 1, v. 207-208 p.368-376dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2012.06.1383Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01917naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245013800157300001600295500001900311520083300330592002801163650001301191650001201204650001301216650002201229653001601251653002201267653002301289653002101312653004001333773012301373856007401496852000901570655001201579IND60694512720221116181534.0200513e19980801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069451272DNAL7 a10.1007/BF027621362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamada, Yozo10aTwo Effective Methods for the Evaluating Mental Work Load on Machine-Operators—Fractal Dimensional Analysis with the CGSA Method—  ap. 151-154.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn Japanese forestry the mental work loads (MWLs) of machine-operators have become one of significant problems. The RR intervals of two harvester-operators were measured in selective thinning operations. Fractal and harmonic components were separated from the spectra of the RR intervals with the Coarse-graining spectral analysis (CGSA) method. As all fractal dimensions concentrated around 1.5, these lower levels were considered that the operators suffered large MWLs from the thinning operations. The power of the 0.10 Hz spectral component of harmonic components reduced definitively in thinning operations, it became evident that thinning operations were stressful work for harvester-operators. As a result of this research, those two methods were proven to be more effective in estimating the MWLs of harvester-operators.  aPublisher supplied data 3aforestry 3aforests 3aresearch 3aspectral analysis 0aCGSA method 0afractal dimension 0aharvester-operator 0amental work load 0apower of 0.10 Hz spectral component0 tJournal of forest research.g1998 Aug. 1, v. 3, no. 3 p.151-154dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl3870061x1610-74037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF027621363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01585naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002500145245008100170300002000251520060400271592002800875650001400903650001100917650002100928650001300949650002200962650001300984650001300997650001201010700002601022773012101048856008101169852000901250655001201259IND60559242720171214000000.0161202e20161202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055924272DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.6b023582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOjeda-Porras, Andrea10aRecent Developments in Amide Synthesis Using Nonactivated Starting Materials  ap. 11548-11555.  aAmides are unquestionably one of the most important functional groups in organic chemistry because of their presence in numerous interesting molecules such as peptides, pharmaceutical agents, naturally occurring molecules, proteins and alkaloids, among others.

It is expected that reactive distillation (RD), which is a proven intensification strategy for esterification of individual alcohols can also be a promising option for simultaneous esterification of all the alcohols in fusel oil. To evaluate its feasibility and design a unit on large scale, kinetic and phase equilibrium models are necessary. In this work, we experimentally investigate reaction kinetics for all the esterification and trans-esterification reactions of the different constituents of fusel oil with acetic acid. The reactions are performed in the presence of cation exchange resin, Amberlyst-15, in a batch reactor over a wide range of parameters such as temperature, mole ratio and catalyst loading. A unified Langmuir–Hinshelwood–Hougen–Watson (LHHW) model is proposed for the reacting system consisting of all the alcohols and the experimental data is used to estimate the model parameters. The predictions are in line with the experimental data for individual alcohols as well as their mixtures. A feasible process based on reactive distillation is simulated in ASPEN PLUS using the kinetics developed in this work.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1-propanol 3aacetic acid 3acation exchange 3achemical engineering 3adistillation 3aesterification 3aethanol 3amodels 3aoils 3aprediction 3areaction kinetics 3atemperature1 aMahajani, Sanjay M.0 tChemical engineering journal.g2012 Oct. 1, v. 207-208 p.377-387dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2012.06.1393Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02466naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245009700165300001600262520106800278536023601346592002801582650001101610650002601621650002201647651001001669651001801679653001701697653002201714653001401736653001701750653001701767700002301784700002001807700002001827700002101847773011101868856008001979852000902059655001202068IND60620942220221120034925.0181114e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062094222DNAL7 a10.1177/00027642155805882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoase, Jeffrey10aReconnecting Here and TherebThe Reactivation of Dormant Ties in the United States and Japan  ap. 931-945.  aThis article examines the reactivation of dormant ties in Japan and the United States. Using the institutional approach to culture developed by Yamagishi et al., it is hypothesized that respondents living in Japan will be less likely to reconnect with dormant ties when prompted than respondents living in the United States. It is further hypothesized that interaction with kin and work ties will help to explain lower levels of reconnection in Japan than in the United States. To examine these hypotheses, we developed a field experiment in which 95 adults living in Japan and 68 adults living in the United States were prompted by a smartphone application to reconnect with dormant ties. The results of this study show strong support for the hypothesis that respondents living in Japan are less likely to reconnect with dormant ties than respondents living in the United States when prompted. There is also mixed support for the hypothesis that interaction with kin and work ties helps to explain lower levels of reconnection in Japan than in the United States.  aFunding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Financial support provided by the Research Organization of Information and Systems, Japan.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3afield experimentation 3amobile telephones 3aJapan 3aUnited States 0acollectivism 0apersonal networks 0aweak ties 0areconnection 0adormant ties1 aKobayashi, Tetsuro1 aSchrock, Andrew1 aSuzuki, Tsutomu1 aSuzuki, Takahisa0 tAmerican behavioral scientist.g, v. 59, no. 8 p.931-945dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2328x1552-33817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00027642155805883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03156naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245003600161300002000197500001500217520172700232592002801959650003701987650002202024650002602046650003402072650001302106650002402119650001802143650002502161650003502186650002302221653002202244653004902266653000902315653001202324653001202336653001302348653004702361653002102408700001902429700002302448773012602471856008002597852000902677655001202686IND60528311520221118230043.0160716e20150610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052831152DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.5b017782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAddou, Rafik10aSurface Defects on Natural MoS2  ap. 11921-11929.  a2019-12-06  aTransition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are being considered for a variety of electronic and optoelectronic devices such as beyond complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) switches, light-emitting diodes, solar cells, as well as sensors, among others. Molybdenum disulfide (MoS₂) is the most studied of the TMDs in part because of its availability in the natural or geological form. The performance of most devices is strongly affected by the intrinsic defects in geological MoS₂. Indeed, most sources of current transition metal dichalcogenides have defects, including many impurities. The variability in the electrical properties of MoS₂ across the surface of the same crystal has been shown to be correlated with local variations in stoichiometry as well as metallic-like and structural defects. The presence of impurities has also been suggested to play a role in determining the Fermi level in MoS₂. The main focus of this work is to highlight a number of intrinsic defects detected on natural, exfoliated MoS₂ crystals from two different sources that have been often used in previous reports for device fabrication. We employed room temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS), as well as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to study the pristine surface of MoS₂(0001) immediately after exfoliation. ICPMS used to measure the concentration of impurity elements can in part explain the local contrast behavior observed in STM images. This work highlights that the high concentration of surface defects and impurity atoms may explain the variability observed in the electrical and physical characteristics of MoS₂.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3achemical elements 3aelectrical properties 3ascanning tunneling microscopy 3acrystals 3aambient temperature 3astoichiometry 3amolybdenum disulfide 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3aphotovoltaic cells 0aintrinsic defects 0ainductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry 0aMoS2 0avacancy 0areports 0aimpurity 0ascanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy 0aintrinsic doping1 aColombo, Luigi1 aWallace, Robert M.0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2015 June 10, v. 7, no. 22 p.11921-11929dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.5b017783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02353naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001400146245013000160300001800290520110300308536012201411592002801533650002101561650002201582650002001604651001401624653002201638653001601660653001401676653001401690653001501704653001401719700001801733700002601751773011301777856008001890852000901970655001201979IND60620942420221120034938.0181114e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062094242DNAL7 a10.1177/00027642155805902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Hua10aSocial Ties, Communication Channels, and Personal Well-BeingbA Study of the Networked Lives of College Students in Singapore  ap. 1189-1202.  aIn this study, we analyze the personal networks of 379 college students in Singapore to explore the social affordances of traditional and new channels in communicating with different types of social relationships and their associations with personal well-being. Results suggest communication channels play a complex role in how strong and weak ties are related to personal well-being. On one hand, face-to-face communication, landlines, mobile phones, text messaging, and social network sites are associated with the strong ties that boost personal well-being. On the other hand, mobile phones, text messaging, social network sites, and video chat (but not face-to-face or landline communication) are associated with weak ties and personal well-being. This study contributes to the literature in two ways. First, we show that strong and weak ties are both important to the personal well-being of college students in Singapore; second, we show how different communication channels are associated with different kinds of social ties. Mobile and social media play a critical role in these social ties.  aFunding The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3acollege students 3amobile telephones 3asocial networks 3aSingapore 0apersonal networks 0astrong ties 0aweak ties 0anew media 0awell-being 0aSingapore1 aChua, Vincent1 aStefanone, Michael A.0 tAmerican behavioral scientist.g, v. 59, no. 9 p.1189-1202dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2328x1552-33817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00027642155805903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03228naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003100149245013400180520169700314592002802011650002202039650002402061650002002085650001502105650001602120650002302136650001002159650002302169650001002192650001102202650002702213650004302240650001402283650001902297700002502316700002502341700002502366700002902391700003002420700003402450700002902484700001802513773013402531856008402665852000902749655001202758IND60757561220221121112611.0211125e20211025xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075756122DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture111110462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMateus, Jackeline Rossetti10aBacillus velezensis T149-19 and Bacillus safensis T052-76 as Potential Biocontrol Agents against Foot Rot Disease in Sweet Potato  aSweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) tuberous roots are used for human consumption, animal feed, and many industrial products. However, the crop is susceptible to various pests and diseases, including foot rot disease caused by the phytopathogenic fungus Plenodomus destruens. Biological control of plant pathogens by Bacillus species is widely disseminated in agrosystems, but specific biological control agents against the foot rot disease-causing fungus are not yet available. Our previous studies showed that two Bacillus strains isolated from sweet potato roots—B. safensis T052-76 and B. velezensis T149-19—were able to inhibit P. destruens in vitro, but data from in vivo experiments using simultaneously the fungus and the bacteria were missing. In this study, both strains were shown to protect the plant from the disease and to mitigate the symptoms of foot rot disease in pot experiments. Total fungal community quantification using real-time PCR showed a significant decrease in the number of copies of the ITS gene when the bacteria were inoculated, compared to the control (with the fungus only). To determine the genes encoding antimicrobial substances likely to inhibit the fungus, their genomes were sequenced and annotated. Genes coding for mycosubtilin, bacillaene, macrolactin, bacillibactin, bacilysin, plantazolicin, plipastatin, dificidine, fengycin and surfactin were found in B. velezensis T149-19, while those coding for bacylisin, lichenysin, bacillibactin, fengycin and surfactin were found in B. safensis T052-76. Altogether, the data presented here contribute to advancing the knowledge for the use of these Bacillus strains as biocontrol products in sweet potato.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus safensis 3aBacillus velezensis 3aIpomoea batatas 3aPlenodomus 3aagriculture 3abiological control 3afeeds 3afungal communities 3agenes 3ahumans 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asurfactin 3asweet potatoes1 aDal’Rio, Isabella 1 aJurelevicius, Diogo 1 ada Mota, Fabio Faria1 aMarques, Joana Montezano1 aRamos, Rommel Thiago Juca1 ada Costa da Silva, Artur Luiz1 aGagliardi, Paulo Roberto1 aSeldin, Lucy 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2021 Oct. 25, v. 11, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture111110463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02758naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006300150245014700213300001600360520134800376592002801724650002001752650001101772650002201783650001401805650002401819650001101843650002701854650002901881650001401910651001301924653002101937653002501958653001401983653002401997653001002021700005902031700002502090700001802115773009702133856008502230852000902315655001202324IND60766438520221117032902.0220314e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076643852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2022.02.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbbasi, Kashif Raza1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6775-746810aAsymmetric impact of renewable and non-renewable energy on the industrial sector in Pakistan: Fresh evidence from Bayesian and non-linear ARDL  ap. 944-957.  aFor the last two decades, Pakistan has faced various economic obstacles, the most significant of which is the sluggish pace of industrial expansion caused by the energy crisis. To close this gap, Pakistan's government has made several efforts to save energy and lower the country's power shortage in recent years. To bridge this gap, we concentrate on a few key drivers to demonstrate vibrant recommendations and evidence to policymakers. In this context, the study investigates the asymmetric relationship between renewable energy consumption (REC), non-renewable energy (NRE), terrorism, inflation, and international trade in the industrial sector from 1970 to 2018 in Pakistan. We employed a novel co-integration approach known as a Nonlinear Autoregressive Distributed Lag (NARDL) model with the Bayesian approach. The results show that the industrial sector is increasing due to positive shocks in REC, whereas negative shock in REC decreases significantly at a 5% level. Additionally, NRE, terrorism, and inflation are positive and have a long-term substantial effect on the industrial sector. The results suggest that the most effective strategy for Pakistan is to combat terrorism and vigorously promote renewable energy, highlighting its advantages to the environment and industrial development while avoiding non-renewable resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aenergy 3aindustrialization 3ainflation 3ainternational trade 3amodels 3anonrenewable resources 3arenewable energy sources 3aterrorism 3aPakistan 0aRenewable energy 0aNon-renewable energy 0aInflation 0aInternational trade 0aNARDL1 aHussain, Khadim1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1415-46471 aRadulescu, Magdalena1 aOzturk, Ilhan0 tRenewable energy.g2022 Mar., v. 187 p.944-957dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2022.02.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02441naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245010800167300001600275520107300291592002801364650001601392650001501408650002101423650001301444650000901457650001101466650002101477650002301498650002001521650002201541650001601563650000801579653002501587653001501612653001101627653002801638700002301666700001801689700001801707700002201725773015001747856007701897852000901974655001201983IND60522339420221119144053.0160602e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052233942DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2008-08032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeitschko, Wolfgang10aZrCuSiAs-type Phosphide Oxides: TbRuPO, DyRuPO, the Series LnOsPO (Ln = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm), and ThAgPO  ap. 934-940.  aThe title compounds were prepared by solid-state reactions and via tin and NaCl/KCl fluxes. They crystallize with the tetragonal ZrCuSiAs-type structure (P4/nmm, Z = 2), which was refined from single-crystal X-ray data of PrOsPO (a = 402.1(1), c = 824.0(1) pm, wR2 = 0.0490, 365 F²) and ThAgPO (a = 396.1(1), c = 877.8(1) pm, wR2 = 0.0307, 314 F²). They belong to a large family of isotypic compounds, of which several, mainly fluorine doped, iron containing compounds LnFeAsO₁₋ₓFₓ were discovered to be superconducting with relatively high transition temperatures only recently in other laboratories. Chemical bonding in these compounds is briefly discussed, and the importance of the weakly bonding Fe-Fe interactions for the phase transitions and the superconductivity is emphasized from the viewpoint of structural chemistry. A brief account of the history of the preparation of these compounds in our laboratory is given. Originally many of these compounds were obtained only in small amounts as byproducts in the course of the preparation of ternaries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3abyproducts 3achemical bonding 3afluorine 3airon 3aoxides 3aphase transition 3apotassium chloride 3asodium chloride 3asuperconductivity 3atemperature 3atin 0aRare Earth Compounds 0aPhosphides 0aOxides 0aZrCuSiAs-type Compounds1 aZimmer, Barbara I.1 aGlaum, Robert1 aBoonk, Ludger1 aRodewald, Ute Ch.0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 63, no. 8 p.934-940dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23182x0932-07767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-2008-08033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02815naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245012000169300001400289520125400303592002801557650000901585650002901594650002601623650001801649650001501667650000901682650002401691650002401715650002301739650001501762650002301777650002301800650002201823650001201845650002301857650002501880650001801905650001601923653000901939653000901948653002301957653001601980653002501996700001602021700001502037700001802052700001702070773009002087856008702177852000902264655001202273IND60112659820221121001115.0190214e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011265982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2012.07.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHedley, C.B.10aSoil water status and water table depth modelling using electromagnetic surveys for precision irrigation scheduling  ap. 22-29.  aElectromagnetic surveys have been used to quantify soil variability with respect to soil water storage in an irrigated maize field. A fluctuating water table sub-irrigates the crop in some places, and a wireless sensor network simultaneously monitors real-time depth of water table and soil moisture content, with large differences in soil moisture measured at any one time in these uniformly textured sands. These large differences justify assessment of the spatio-temporal variability of soil hydraulic properties when aiming for precision management of the resource. Regression models were used to spatially predict water table depth and moisture content at 50cm using EM38 survey data, a rainfall time series and a wetness index extracted from a digital elevation model. A multiple linear regression modelling (MLM) approach was compared with a data‐mining approach using a random forest model (RF). The RF model implements a more thorough interrogation of the data using classification trees with subsequent regression of the data and provided the best prediction of soil moisture (R2=0.94; RMSE=0.03m3m−3 using RF; R2=0.77; RMSE=0.06m3m−3 using MLM) and water table depth (R2=0.91; RMSE=7.17cm using RF; R2=0.71; RMSE=12.48cm using MLM).  aPublisher supplied data 3acorn 3adigital elevation models 3airrigation scheduling 3alinear models 3aprediction 3arain 3aregression analysis 3aresource management 3asoil heterogeneity 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3asoil water storage 3aspatial variation 3asurveys 3atemporal variation 3atime series analysis 3awater content 3awater table 0aEM31 0aEM38 0aSAGA wetness index 0aWater table 0aPrecision irrigation1 aRoudier, P.1 aYule, I.J.1 aEkanayake, J.1 aBradbury, S.0 tGeoderma.g2013 May, v. 199 p.22-29dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2012.07.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01995naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245013500174300001400309520071200323592002801035650002501063650001501088650001101103650001501114650000701129650001401136650001101150650002001161650002001181653003701201653002001238653002301258653001201281653000901293700003301302700002801335700003001363773009001393856008101483852000901564655001201573IND60544698720221118043118.0160901e20140217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054469872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2013.12.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMolinero-Abad, Begoña10aSulfite oxidase biosensors based on tetrathiafulvalene modified screen-printed carbon electrodes for sulfite determination in wine  ap. 41-44.  aScreen-printed carbon electrodes have been modified with tetrathiafulvalene and sulfite oxidase enzyme for the sensitive and selective detection of sulfite.

In a machining process, a reasonable selection of cutting parameters can not only save the production cost and time, but also reduce the production carbon emissions. In addition, the wear conditions of different cutting tools also have great influence on cutting parameters selection as they could cause huge difference on carbon emissions. However, in traditional optimization methods of cutting parameters, the tool wear conditions are always ignored. Thus, in order to overcome this limitation, an optimization method of cutting parameters considering the tool wear conditions is developed. Firstly, the quantified relationships among cutting parameters, tool wear and production indexes (production carbon emissions, cost and time) are analysed. Then, a multi-objective cutting parameters optimization model is established based on the above production indexes to determine the optimal cutting parameters and tools. Thirdly, a modified NSGA-II algorithm is used to resolve the proposed model. Finally, a case study is designed to demonstrate the advantages and feasibility of the proposed approach. The results show that (i) the optimal cutting parameters change with the tool wear conditions; (ii) For the same type of cutting tools with different wear conditions, the optimal values of production carbon emissions, cost and time increase along with the raise of the tool wear conditions; (iii) For different available cutting tools with different tool wear conditions, it is necessary to apply a multi-objective optimization method to decide the optimal production carbon emissions, cost and time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acarbon 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3acutting 3aemissions 3amodels 3asustainable manufacturing 3asystem optimization 0aLow-carbon manufacturing 0aCutting parameters optimization 0aTool wear condition 0aNSGA-II algorithm 0aGame theory1 aZhou, Guanghui1 aZhang, Junjie1 aZhang, Chao0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 July 20, v. 226 p.706-719dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.04.1133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02506naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002400144245015300168300001800321500002000339520112200359592002801481650001501509650002001524650002301544650002301567650001801590650001901608650001001627650003301637650002201670650001301692650000701705650001801712650001801730650001601748700003701764700006201801773013401863856007801997852000902075655001202084IND60608318420221122153837.0180807e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060831842DNAL7 a10.1002/jssc.2018004152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPierson, Stephen A.10aRapid analysis of ultraviolet filters using dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction coupled to headspace gas chromatography and mass spectrometry  ap. 3081-3088.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAn ionic‐liquid‐based in situ dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction method coupled to headspace gas chromatography and mass spectrometry was developed for the rapid analysis of ultraviolet filters. The chemical structures of five ionic liquids were specifically designed to incorporate various functional groups for the favorable extraction of the target analytes. Extraction parameters including ionic liquid mass, molar ratio of ionic liquid to metathesis reagent, vortex time, ionic strength, pH, and total sample volume were studied and optimized. The effect of the headspace temperature and volume during the headspace sampling step was also evaluated to increase the sensitivity of the method. The optimized procedure is fast as it only required ∼7–10 min per extraction and allowed for multiple extractions to be performed simultaneously. In addition, the method exhibited high precision, good linearity, and low limits of detection for six ultraviolet filters in aqueous samples. The developed method was applied to both pool and lake water samples attaining acceptable relative recovery values.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUV filters 3adetection limit 3agas chromatography 3aheadspace analysis 3aionic liquids 3aionic strength 3alakes 3aliquid-phase microextraction 3amass spectrometry 3amoieties 3apH 3arapid methods 3asurface water 3atemperature1 aTrujillo‐Rodríguez, María J.1 aAnderson, Jared L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6915-87520 tJournal of separation science.g2018 Aug., v. 41, no. 15 p.3081-3088dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3924049x1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2018004153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02721naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245011000175300001800285520130800303592002801611650002101639650001501660650003001675650001901705650001201724650001301736650001401749650001601763650001101779650002001790653001401810653002101824653001501845653001401860653001601874653001901890653003601909700001701945700001501962700001701977700001701994700001802011773011502029856008602144852000902230655001202239IND60637468020221119083712.0191231e20190820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063746802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.04.1162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAyinla, Ridwan Tobi12aA review of technical advances of recent palm bio-waste conversion to activated carbon for energy storage  ap. 1427-1442.  aRecently, the conversion of palm waste to activated carbon for various applications has attracted significant attention from researchers. Over the years, abundant palm wastes have been generated due to active palm milling in various part of the world. These environmentally challenging wastes have been converted to valuable and economical materials for gas adsorption and water treatment but rarely for energy storage application. The lignocellulose composition of palm wastes has made it a favorable candidate for starting material of activated carbon for supercapacitor application. In this review, the pretreatment condition, factors to consider for choosing starting material, activation techniques, and activation parameters such as activation temperature, activation time, activation agent and impregnation ratio are analyzed. The advantages of the synergistic effect of the lignocellulose composition of different palm wastes for energy storage device is discussed. The major drawbacks in the conventional Barrett-Joiner-Halenda (BJH) porosity characterization technique are addressed and the novel Non-localized Density Functional Theory characterization technique is suggested. Conclusively, future prospects in the activation of palm bio-wastes for supercapacitor application are highlighted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3adensity functional theory 3alignocellulose 3amilling 3aporosity 3asynergism 3atemperature 3awastes 3awater treatment 0aBio-waste 0aActivated carbon 0aPalm waste 0aRenewable 0aEnvironment 0aEnergy storage 0aDensity functional theory (DFT)1 aDennis, J.O.1 aZaid, H.M.1 aSanusi, Y.K.1 aUsman, Fahad1 aAdebayo, L.L.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 Aug. 20, v. 229 p.1427-1442dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.04.1163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03770naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005600150245015300206300001300359520190300372592002802275650001902303650002202322650002102344650002102365650001702386650002902403650003902432650001702471650002302488650001302511650002502524650002802549650002202577650000902599650002402608650001702632650001802649651001002667653002402677653003502701653003902736653004902775653002802824700001802852700001502870700001502885700002002900700001502920700001802935700001402953700001702967773010202984856008503086852000903171655001203180IND60535628920221120131813.0190408e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053562892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2014.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFang, Huajun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4033-948210aExperimental nitrogen deposition alters the quantity and quality of soil dissolved organic carbon in an alpine meadow on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau  ap. 1-11.  aDissolved organic matter (DOM) plays a central role in driving biogeochemical processes in soils, but little information is available on the relation of soil DOM dynamics to microbial activity. The effects of NO3− and NH4+ deposition in grasslands on the amount and composition of soil DOM also remain largely unclear. In this study, a multi-form, low-dose N addition experiment was conducted in an alpine meadow on the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau in 2007. Three N fertilizers, NH4Cl, (NH4)2SO4 and KNO3, were applied at four rates: 0, 10, 20 and 40kgNha−1yr−1. Soil samples from surface (0–10cm) and subsurface layers (10–20cm) were collected in 2011. Excitation/emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy (EEM) was used to assess the composition and stability of soil DOM. Community-level physiological profile (CLPP, basing on the BIOLOG Ecoplate technique) was measured to evaluate the relationship between soil DOC dynamics and microbial utilization of C resources. Nitrogen (N) dose rather than N form significantly increased soil DOC contents in surface layer by 23.5%–35.1%, whereas it significantly decreased soil DOC contents in subsurface layer by 10.4%–23.8%. Continuous five-year N addition significantly increased the labile components and decreased recalcitrant components of soil DOM in surface layer, while an opposite pattern was observed in subsurface layer; however, the humification indices (HIX) of soil DOM was unaltered by various N treatments. Furthermore, N addition changed the amount and biodegradability of soil DOM through stimulating microbial metabolic activity and preferentially utilizing organic acids. These results suggest that microbial metabolic processes dominate the dynamics of soil DOC, and increasing atmospheric N deposition could be adverse to the accumulation of soil organic carbon pool in the alpine meadow on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpine meadows 3aammonium chloride 3aammonium sulfate 3abiodegradability 3acarbon sinks 3adissolved organic carbon 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3ahumification 3amicrobial activity 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aorganic acids and salts 3apotassium nitrate 3asoil 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil quality 3asoil sampling 3aChina 0aNitrogen deposition 0aDissolved organic matter (DOM) 0aExcitation–emission matrix (EEM) 0aCommunity level physiological profile (CLPP) 0aAlpine meadow ecosystem1 aCheng, Shulan1 aYu, Guirui1 aXu, Minjie1 aWang, Yongsheng1 aLi, Linsen1 aDang, Xusheng1 aWang, Lei1 aLi, Yingnian0 tApplied soil ecology.g2014 Sept., v. 81 p.1-11dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl55717x0929-13937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2014.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01393naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245010800163300002000271520037100291592002800662650001400690650001200704650001500716650001400731650002000745650002200765700001300787700001600800700001200816700001600828773012100844856008100965852000901046655001201055IND60559243420221119061143.0161202e20161202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055924342DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.6b024512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Changduo10aMetal-Free Cascade Oxidative Decarbonylative Alkylation/Arylation of Alkynoates with Alphatic Aldehydes  ap. 12065-12069.  aThe oxidative difunctionalization of aryl alkynoates with alphatic aldehydes as a cheap and abundant alkyl radical source was developed, providing a variety of trisubstituted alkenes in moderate to good yields.

However, using soil spectra measured directly in the field or with airborne imaging spectrometers remains challenging due to uncontrolled variations in surface soil conditions, like vegetation cover, soil moisture and roughness. In particular, soil moisture may dramatically degrade predictions of SOC content when using an empirical approach. This study aims to quantify the effect of soil moisture on the accuracy of SOC predictions, and propose a method to determine SOC content for moist samples with unknown moisture content. More than 100 soil samples were collected along a transect, in the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg. The soil samples were air-dried, moistened in steps of 0.05g water g soil−1 until saturation, and scanned in the laboratory with a visible and near infrared diffuse reflectance spectrometer. We computed the normalized soil moisture index (NSMI) to estimate the soil moisture content of the samples (R2=0.74), and used it to spectrally classify the samples according to their moisture content. SOC content was predicted using separate partial least square regressions developed on groups of samples with similar NSMI values. The root mean square error of prediction (RMSE) after validation was always below 5g C kg−1, with a ratio of prediction to deviation (RPD) greater than 2. The SOC content prediction models with a-priori knowledge of soil moisture gave similar RMSE as the ones after the NSMI classification. Hence, the NSMI might be used as a proxy of moisture content to improve SOC content prediction for spectral data acquired outside the laboratory since the method is simple and does not need other data than a simple band ratio of the spectra.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair drying 3aimage analysis 3amodels 3aprediction 3areflectance 3aroughness 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil sampling 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3aspectral analysis 3aspectrometers 3aspectroscopy 3avegetation cover 3awater content 3aLuxembourg 0aSoil organic carbon 0aSoil moisture 0aLaboratory Vis-NIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy 0aNormalized soil moisture index1 aStevens, Antoine1 aNoon, Carole1 avan Wesemael, Bas0 tGeoderma.g2013 May, v. 199 p.37-42dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2012.07.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02276naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245010300171520094300274592002801217650002301245650001601268650002101284650002301305650001701328650002101345650003301366650001801399650001201417651001201429700001901441700002001460700002301480700002601503700002801529700002301557700002301580700002401603773013401627856008401761852000901845655001201854IND60757561620221121083406.0211125e20211026xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075756162DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture111110502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuresan, Iulia C.10aConsumers’ Attitude towards Sustainable Food Consumption during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Romania  aThe COVID-19 pandemic affected consumers’ behavior worldwide. This paper aims to analyze consumers’ sustainable food behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic. The research was based on an online survey during May–October 2020 among 859 Romanian consumers. Principal component analysis and cluster analysis were employed to group the consumers based on their behavior. Furthermore, the binary-logistic regression was used to identify the socio-demographic profile of the identified groups. Based on the cluster analysis, the consumers were grouped into three main groups: indifferent, pro-environment protection, and health concerned. The results indicate a positive attitude towards sustainable food behavior. Consumers’ attitude towards sustainable food choice is mainly influenced by age and education level. The study offers valuable information for future public policy and marketing campaign regarding sustainable food behavior.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aagriculture 3acluster analysis 3aeducational status 3afood choices 3afood consumption 3aprincipal component analysis 3apublic policy 3asurveys 3aRomania1 aHarun, Rezhen 1 aArion, Felix H.1 aBrata, Anca Monica1 aChereches, Ioan Aurel1 aChiciudean, Gabriela O.1 aDumitras, Diana E.1 aOroian, Camelia F.1 aTirpe, Olivia Paula0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2021 Oct. 26, v. 11, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture111110503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02895naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245016100167300001600328520161400344592002801958650002201986650003102008650001102039650002002050650001002070650002102080650001102101650002502112650001302137650001502150653002202165653002702187653002402214653001602238653002602254700002302280773009202303856008102395852000902476655001202485IND60544699020221118043137.0160901e20140217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054469902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2013.12.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAzimi, Abolfazl10aComputational prediction and experimental selectivity coefficients for hydroxyzine and cetirizine molecularly imprinted polymer based potentiometric sensors  ap. 184-190.  aIn spite of the increasing usages number of molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) in many scientific applications, the theoretical aspects of participating intra molecular forces are not fully understood.

In the computational approaches and experimental study, methacrylic acid (MAA) was chosen as the functional monomer and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) as the cross linker for hydroxyzine and cetirizine imprinted polymers. Ab initio, DFT B3LYP method was carried out on molecular optimization. With regard to results obtained from molecules optimization and hydrogen bonding properties, possible configurations of 1:n (n≤5) template/monomer complexes were designed and optimized. The binding energy for each complex in gas phase was calculated. Depending on the most stable configuration, hydroxyzine and cetirizine imprinted polymer models were designed. The calculations including the porogen were also investigated. The theoretical charge distributions for the template and some potential interfering molecules were calculated. The results showed a correlation between the selectivity coefficients and the theoretical charge distributions. The results surprisingly show that charge distribution based model was able to predict the selectivity coefficients of MIP based potentiometric sensors.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical elements 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aenergy 3aethylene glycol 3agases 3ahydrogen bonding 3amodels 3amolecular imprinting 3apolymers 3aprediction 0aImprinted polymer 0aComputational approach 0aCharge distribution 0aSelectivity 0aPotentiometric sensor1 aJavanbakht, Mehran0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2014 Feb. 17, v. 812 p.184-190dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2013.12.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02885naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245008800163300002000251520134300271592002801614650001501642650002301657650001701680650001801697650004301715650001401758650001101772650001701783650001801800650001801818650003701836650001501873650001401888650001901902653003301921653001301954653001201967653003101979653002302010653001802033700002202051700001802073700002102091700001502112700002502127773012602152856008002278852000902358655001202367IND60528312220170710000000.0160716e20150610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052831222DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.5b020022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos, Ana C.10aSonication-Assisted Layer-by-Layer Assembly for Low Solubility Drug Nanoformulation  ap. 11972-11983.  aSonication-assisted layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly is a nanoencapsulation technique based on the alternate adsorption of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes, enabling the encapsulation of low solubility drugs. In this work, a top-down LbL technique was performed using a washless approach and ibuprofen (IBF) as a model class II drug. For each saturated layer deposition, polyelectrolyte concentration was determined by titration curves. The first layer was constituted by cationic poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH), given the IBF negative surface charge, followed by anionic polystyrenesulfonate (PSS). This polyelectrolyte sequence was made up with 2.5, 5.5, and 7.5 bilayer nanoshells. IBF nanoparticles (NPs) coated with 7.5 bilayers of PAH/PSS showed 127.5 ± 38.0 nm of particle size, a PDI of 0.24, and a high zeta potential (+32.7 ± 0.6 mV), allowing for a stable aqueous nanocolloid of the drug. IBF entrapment efficiency of 72.1 ± 5.8% was determined by HPLC quantification. In vitro MTT assay showed that LbL NPs were biocompatible. According to the number of coating layers, a controlled release of IBF from LbL NPs was achieved under simulated intestinal conditions (from 5 h up to 7 days). PAH/PSS-LbL NPs constitute a potential delivery system to improve biopharmaceutical parameters of water low solubility drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abiopharmaceuticals 3aelectrolytes 3aencapsulation 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aibuprofen 3amodels 3ananocapsules 3ananoparticles 3aparticle size 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3asolubility 3atitration 3azeta potential 0alayer-by-layer self-assembly 0awashless 0acolloid 0aelectrostatic interactions 0acontrolled release 0aoral delivery1 aPattekari, Pravin1 aJesus, Sandra1 aVeiga, Francisco1 aLvov, Yuri1 aRibeiro, António J.0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2015 June 10, v. 7, no. 22 p.11972-11983dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.5b020023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02916naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245022200165300001600387520139800403592002801801650002501829650002001854650001101874650002201885650001001907650002001917650002601937650001101963650001101974650004401985650001102029650001002040653001402050653001002064653001302074653001602087653001002103653004802113700002202161700002602183700002602209700001702235773009202252856008102344852000902425655001202434IND60544699220221118043047.0160901e20140217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054469922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2014.01.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConcejero, B.10aDirect accurate analysis of cysteinylated and glutathionylated precursors of 4-mercapto-4-methyl-2-pentanone and 3-mercaptohexan-1-ol in must by ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry  ap. 250-257.  aA direct method for the quantitative determination in grapes of four known precursors of the varietal aromas of the thiol character of wine has been optimized and validated. A small volume of centrifuged and filtered must is directly injected in the ultrahigh liquid performance chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry system (UHPLC-MS–MS). Must sugars and other early eluting polar compounds are diverted to the waste, not entering the ion source. Cysteinyl (CYS) and glutathionyl (GLU) precursors from 3-mercaptohexanol (3MH) and 4-mercapto-4-methylpentanone (4M4MP) are separated in 5min rendering narrow peaks (W1/2<9s). No system performance degradation has been noticed in series of more than 200 injections. A standard addition procedure using the consecutive injection of a spiked sample made it possible to satisfactorily correct for matrix effects, with recoveries very close to 100% in all cases. Intermediate reproducibility was satisfactory (RSD between 1 and 10%), except for the glutathione-4-mercapto-4-methyl-2-pentanone (GLUMP) precursor, for which this value is around 20%. The limits of detection in real-must were below 1μgL−1 for the precursors of the 4M4MP and for cysteine-3-mercaptohexan-1-ol (CYSMH) and glutathione-3-mercaptohexan-1-ol (GLUMH), 2 and 7μgL−1, respectively, what is enough for the determination of these precursors in musts of any variety.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3adetection limit 3agrapes 3amass spectrometry 3aodors 3apolar compounds 3aquantitative analysis 3asugars 3athiols 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 3awastes 3awines 0aPrecursor 0aGrape 0aCysteine 0aGlutathione 0aAroma 0aLiquid chromatography and mass spectrometry1 aPeña-Gallego, A.1 aFernandez-Zurbano, P.1 aHernández–Orte, P.1 aFerreira, V.0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2014 Feb. 17, v. 812 p.250-257dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2014.01.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03315naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245006400165500002200229520194700251592002802198650001302226650001102239650001002250650002102260650001402281650002602295650002302321650001502344650001302359650001402372650001502386650001002401650001402411650001102425650001202436651001002448653001702458653001302475653002302488653001302511653002102524700001902545700001702564700001202581700001702593700001402610773006802624856008402692852000902776655001202785IND60560400420221118141159.0170710s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056040042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2016.12.0642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Guyu10aMicroplastics in sediments of the Changjiang Estuary, China  aPre-press version  aMicroplastics are plastics that measure less than 5 mm in diameter. They enter the marine environment as primary sources directly from industrial uses, as well as secondary sources resulting from the degradation of large plastic debris. To improve the knowledge of microplastic pollution in China, we investigated samples from 53 estuarine sediment locations collected with a box corer within the Changjiang Estuary. Microplastics (<5 mm) were extracted from sediments by density separation, after which they were observed under a microscope and categorized according to shape, color and size. Identification was carried out using Micro-Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (μ-FT-IR).The abundance of microplastics in the Changjiang Estuary was mapped. The mean concentration was 121 ± 9 items per kg of dry weight, varying from 20 to 340 items per kg of dry weight. It was found that the concentration of microplastics was the highest on the southeast coast of Shanghai. The distribution pattern of microplastics may be affected by the Changjiang diluted water in summer. All of the microplastics collected were categorized according to shape, color and size. Among which fiber (93%), transparent (42%) and small microplastics (<1 mm) (58%) were the most abundant types. No clear correlation between microplastics and the finer sediment fraction was found. Rayon, polyester, and acrylic were the most abundant types of microplastics identified, indicating that the main source of microplastics in the Changjiang Estuary was from washing clothes (the primary source). It is possible to compare microplastic abundance in this study with the results of other related studies using the same quantification method. The identification of microplastics raises the awareness of microplastic pollution from drainage systems. The prevalence of microplastic pollution calls for monitoring microplastics at a national scale on a regular basis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclothing 3acoasts 3acolor 3adrainage systems 3aestuaries 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3amarine environment 3amonitoring 3aplastics 3apollution 3apolyesters 3arayon 3asediments 3asummer 3awashing 3aChina 0aMicroplastic 0aSediment 0aChangjiang estuary 0aμ-FT-IR 0aMarine pollution1 aZhu, Bangshang1 aYang, Dongqi1 aSu, Lei1 aShi, Huahong1 aLi, Daoji0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2016, dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2016.12.0643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02798naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245014600171520132400317592002801641650001201669650001101681650002601692650002001718650001801738650000901756650002001765650001401785650001901799650001601818651001501834651001201849653003001861653002601891653002101917653002701938653001301965653001101978700002001989700001702009700002202026700002802048700001502076700002302091773009902114856008202213852000902295655001202304IND60730181020221120200443.0210519s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073018102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.crm.2021.1002892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan der Pol, Thomas10aRegional economic analysis of flood defence heights at the German Baltic Sea coast: A multi-method cost-benefit approach for flood prevention  aMean and extreme sea-level uncertainties, as well as uncertainty about future flood exposure, hinder the risk-based optimisation of flood protection investments. To deal with these uncertainties, cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and methods for robust decision-making can be combined. This paper sequentially applies CBA, robust optimisation methods and info-gap analysis to find efficient and robust coastal flood protection strategies for the German Baltic Sea coast. The CBA results suggest that – under flood risk assumptions – a share of the coast of Schleswig-Holstein (9.3–10.1%; 60–65 km) and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4.1–10.0%; 78–189 km) with relatively high flood exposure, might currently be under-protected from a social welfare perspective. Present Value estimates of regional investment costs of five regret or loss minimising strategies range from 1.7 to 4.8 billion Euro across robustness metrics at 3% discounting. The info-gap analysis suggests that some of these strategies will fail to prevent large-scale damages under high-end scenarios. We conclude that a multi-method cost-benefit approach can be used to narrow down the number of solutions that are both potentially efficient and sufficiently robust by investigating strategy performance within, across and beyond predefined scenarios.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3acoasts 3acost benefit analysis 3adecision making 3aflood control 3arisk 3arisk management 3asea level 3asocial welfare 3auncertainty 3aBaltic Sea 3aGermany 0aClimate change adaptation 0aCost-benefit analysis 0aFlood protection 0aRobust decision-making 0aInfo-gap 0aRegret1 aHickel, Jochen,1 aMerkens, Jan1 aMacPherson, Leigh1 aVafeidis, Athanasios T.1 aArns, Arne1 aDangendorf, Sönke0 tClimate risk management.g2021, v. 32 p.100289-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23250x2212-09637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.crm.2021.1002893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03996naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245017100208300001100379520218700390592002802577596006502605596006502670596006502735596006502800596006502865596007002930650001303000650002203013650001403035650001103049650001103060650001203071650002203083650002903105650001603134700002303150700002303173700002803196700001703224700002403241700002603265700002203291773010903313856008303422852000903505655001203514IND60743525920221118025514.0220604e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074352592DNAL7 a10.1186/s13750-021-00228-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElmore, Jared A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5980-156110aEvidence on the effectiveness of small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS) as a survey tool for North American terrestrial, vertebrate animals: a systematic map protocol  ap. 15.  aBACKGROUND: Small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS) are replacing or supplementing manned aircraft and ground-based surveys in many animal monitoring situations due to better coverage at finer spatial and temporal resolutions, access, cost, bias, impacts, safety, efficiency, and logistical benefits. Various sUAS models and sensors are available with varying features and usefulness depending on survey goals. However, justification for selection of sUAS and sensors are not typically offered in published literature and existing reviews do not adequately cover past and current sUAS applications for animal monitoring nor their associated sUAS model and sensor technologies, taxonomic and geographic scope, flight conditions and considerations, spatial distributions of sUAS applications, and reported technical difficulties. We outline a systematic map protocol to collect and consolidate evidence pertaining to sUAS monitoring of animals. Our systematic map will provide a useful synthesis of current applications of sUAS-animal related studies and identify major knowledge clusters (well-represented subtopics that are amenable to full synthesis by a systematic review) and gaps (unreported or underrepresented topics that warrant additional primary research) that may influence future research directions and sUAS applications. METHODS: Our systematic map will investigate the current state of knowledge using an accurate, comprehensive, and repeatable search. We will find relevant peer-reviewed and grey literature as well as dissertations and theses using online publication databases, Google Scholar, and by request through a professional network of collaborators and publicly available websites. We will use a tiered approach to article exclusion with eligible studies being those that monitor (i.e., identify, count, estimate, etc.) terrestrial vertebrate animals. Extracted data concerning sUAS, sensors, animals, methodology, and results will be recorded in Microsoft Access. We will query and catalogue evidence in the final database to produce tables, figures, and geographic maps to accompany a full narrative review that answers our primary and secondary questions.  aPublisher supplied data  aAP20WSNWRC00C010cAnimal and Plant Health Inspection Service  aAP20WSNWRC00C026cAnimal and Plant Health Inspection Service  aAP20WSNWRC00C010cAnimal and Plant Health Inspection Service  aAP20WSNWRC00C026cAnimal and Plant Health Inspection Service  aAP20WSNWRC00C026cAnimal and Plant Health Inspection Service  aAP20WSNWRC00C010cAnimal and Plant Health Inspection Service (US) 3aInternet 3acomputer software 3adatabases 3aflight 3amodels 3asurveys 3asystematic review 3aunmanned aerial vehicles 3avertebrates1 aCurran, Michael F.1 aEvans, Kristine O.1 aSamiappan, Sathishkumar1 aZhou, Meilun1 aPfeiffer, Morgan B.1 aBlackwell, Bradley F.1 aIglay, Raymond B.0 tEnvironmental evidence.g2021 Dec., v. 10, no. 1 p.15-15dBioMed CentralwJournal:21545x2047-23827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13750-021-00228-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02878naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100002000158245013300178300001800311520137300329592002801702650002701730650001501757650002301772650002301795650002601818650001001844650001201854650001101866650001701877650002701894650001001921650001101931650000901942650002401951650002101975650001001996650001002006650000902016651001002025700003102035700001702066700002102083700002302104700002002127773013102147856007302278852000902351655001202360IND50070359520221119075024.0150206e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007035952DNAL7 a236532902pmid7 a10.1002/jsfa.62192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeppa, Giuseppe10aDescriptive sensory analysis of Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale di Modena DOP and Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale di Reggio Emilia DOP  ap. 3737-3742.  aBACKGROUND: Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale (ABT) is a typical Italian vinegar available in two different forms: Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale di Modena DOP (ABTM) and Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale di Reggio Emilia DOP (ABTRE). ABT is obtained by alcoholic fermentation and acetic bio‐oxidation of cooked grape must and aged at least 12 years in wooden casks and is known and sold around the world. Despite this widespread recognition, data on sensory characteristics of these products are very scarce. Therefore a descriptive analysis was conducted to define a lexicon for the ABT sensory profile and to create a simple, stable and reproducible synthetic ABT for training panellists. RESULTS: A lexicon of 20 sensory parameters was defined and validated and a synthetic ABT was prepared as standard reference. Simple standards for panellist training were also defined and the sensory profiles of ABTM and ABTRE were obtained. CONCLUSION: The obtained results confirm that descriptive analysis can be used for the sensory characterisation of ABT and that the sensory profiles of ABTM and ABTRE are very different. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that a lexicon and proper standard references are essential for describing the sensory qualities of ABT both for technical purposes and to protect the product from commercial fraud. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcoholic fermentation 3agrape must 3asensory evaluation 3asensory properties 2aAcetic Acidxanalysis 2aAdult 2aCooking 2aFemale 2aFermentation 2aFood Analysisxmethods 2aFruit 2aHumans 2aMale 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aReference Values 2aTaste 2aVitis 2aWood 0aItaly1 aGambigliani Zoccoli, Mario1 aNasi, Enrico1 aMasini, Giovanni1 aMeglioli, Giuseppe1 aZappino, Matteo0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2013 Dec., v. 93, no. 15 p.3737-3742dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.62193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02724naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245012900160300002000289520124200309592002801551650001501579650001401594650001701608650001101625650001401636650001401650650000701664650002201671650002301693650001801716653003301734653002901767653003801796653002901834653001001863700001801873700001801891700005601909700005501965700001702020773014202037856007802179852000902257655001202266IND60746468320221119231916.0210805e20210721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074646832DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c080762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBai, Yulong10aCarbon Dots with Absorption Red-Shifting for Two-Photon Fluorescence Imaging of Tumor Tissue pH and Synergistic Phototherapy  ap. 35365-35375.  aPhototherapy exhibits significant potential as a novel tumor treatment method, and the development of highly active photosensitizers and photothermal agents has drawn considerable attention. In this work, S and N atom co-doped carbon dots (S,N-CDs) with an absorption redshift effect were prepared by hydrothermal synthesis with lysine, o-phenylenediamine, and sulfuric acid as raw materials. The near-infrared (NIR) absorption features of the S,N-CDs resulted in two-photon (TP) emission, which has been used in TP fluorescence imaging of lysosomes and tumor tissue pH and real-time monitoring of apoptosis during tumor phototherapy, respectively. The obtained heteroatom co-doped CDs can be used not only as an NIR imaging probe but also as an effective photodynamic therapy/photothermal therapy (PDT/PTT) therapeutic agent. The efficiencies of different heteroatom-doped CDs in tumor treatment were compared. It was found that the S,N-CDs showed higher therapeutic efficiency than N-doped CDs, the efficiency of producing ¹O₂ was 27%, and the photothermal conversion efficiency reached 34.4%. The study provides new insight into the synthesis of carbon-based nanodrugs for synergistic phototherapy and accurate diagnosis of tumors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aapoptosis 3afluorescence 3alysine 3alysosomes 3aneoplasms 3apH 3aphotochemotherapy 3aphotothermotherapy 3asulfuric acid 0aheteroatom-doped carbon dots 0atwo-photon imaging probe 0aphotodynamic-photothermal effects 0asynergistic phototherapy 0atumor1 aZhao, Jingjin1 aWang, Shulong1 aLin, Tianran1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1228-20951 aYe, Fanggui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2530-36951 aZhao, Shulin0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 July 21, v. 13, no. 30 p.35365-35375dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c080763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02225naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245007200174300001600246520103900262592002801301650002301329650001101352650001501363650001001378651000901388653002301397653003401420653001001454653001401464653001501478700003401493700003301527700002301560700002301583773014101606856008301747852000901830655001201839IND60615798920221122134100.0200221e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061579892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jssas.2018.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChaab, Reza Karmulla10aPredicting header wheat loss in a combine harvester, a new approach  ap. 179-184.  aHeader loss of wheat in a combine harvester was modelled and evaluated at Badjgah Research Station, Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran. The main objective was to develop a characteristics dimensionless model to predict the header loss based on Buckingham pi theorem. A conventional New Holland TC5070 combine harvester was monitored in field studies. Parameters like rotational speed of reel (at 21, 25 and 35 rpm), forward speed (at 2, 3 and 4 km h⁻¹) and cutter bar height (at 15, 25 and 35 cm) were considered for field evaluation. Results showed that optimum values for reel index (ratio of forward speed to rotational speed of reel), height of cutter bar, forward speed of combine harvester and rotational speed of reel were 1.38, 15 cm, 4 km h⁻¹ and 21 rpm, respectively. Collected data were used to develop a model for predicting header loss as a function of parameters studied. Results from F-test between predicted and measured data were not significantly difference (p≤0.05) which is a prominent result.  aPublisher supplied data 3acombine harvesters 3amodels 3aprediction 3awheat 3aIran 0aBuckingham theorem 0aDimensional analysis approach 0aGrain 0aHead loss 0aReel index1 aKarparvarfard, Seyyed Hossein1 aRahmanian-Koushkaki, Hossein1 aMortezaei, Alireza1 aMohammadi, Mojtaba0 tJournal of the Saudi Society of Agricultural Sciences.g2020 Feb., v. 19, no. 2 p.179-184dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23282x1658-077X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jssas.2018.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04361naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006100151245014800212300001500360520266100375592002803036650001403064650001203078650002003090650001903110650003503129650002003164650001103184650001303195650001603208650002103224650001403245650002203259650002103281650001303302650002403315650001303339650001503352650001903367650001703386650001403403650001303417650001003430651001503440700002303455700002403478700002403502700001903526700002003545700002003565773011503585856008603700852000903786655001203795IND60597271820221118060338.0190719e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059727182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconhyd.2018.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPierce, Amanda A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1153-428110aDFN-M field characterization of sandstone for a process-based site conceptual model and numerical simulations of TCE transport with degradation  ap. 96-114.  aPlumes of trichloroethene (TCE) with degradation products occur at a large industrial site in California where TCE as a dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) entered the fractured sandstone bedrock at many locations beginning in the late 1940s. Groundwater flows rapidly in closely spaced fractures but plume fronts are strongly retarded relative to groundwater flow velocities owing largely to matrix diffusion in early decades and degradation processes in later decades and going forward. Multiple data types show field evidence for both biotic and abiotic dechlorination of TCE and its degradation products, resulting in non-chlorinated compounds. Analyses were conducted on groundwater samples from hundreds of monitoring wells and on thousands of rock samples from continuous core over depths ranging from 6 to 426 metres below ground surface. Nearly all of the present-day mass of TCE and degradation products resides in the water-saturated, low-permeability rock matrix blocks. Although groundwater and DNAPL flow primarily occur in the fractures, DNAPL dissolution followed by diffusion and sorption readily transfers contaminant mass into the rock matrix. The presence of non-chlorinated degradation products (ethene, ethane, acetylene) and compound specific isotope analysis (CSIA) of TCE and cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cDCE) indicate at least some complete dechlorination by both biotic and abiotic pathways, consistent with the observed mineralogy and hydrogeochemistry and with published results from crushed rock microcosms. The rock matrix contains abundant iron-bearing minerals and solid-phase organic carbon with large surface areas and long contact times, suggesting degradation processes are occurring in the rock matrix. Multiple, high-resolution datasets provide strong evidence for spatially heterogeneous distributions of TCE and degradation products with varying degrees of degradation observed only when using new methods that achieve better detection of dissolved gases (i.e., Snap Sampler™) and contaminant mass stored in the low permeability rock matrix (i.e., CORE-DFN™). Simulations using a discrete fracture-matrix (DFN-M) numerical model capable of rigorously simulating flow and transport in both the fractures and matrix, including interactions, show that even slow, first-order degradation rates (i.e., 5- to 20-year half-lives) informed by site-derived parameters can contribute strongly to natural attenuation, resulting in TCE plumes that become stationary in space and might even retreat after 50 to 100 years, if the DNAPL sources become depleted due to the combination of diffusion and degradation processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylene 3abedrock 3adata collection 3adechlorination 3adense nonaqueous phase liquids 3adissolved gases 3aethane 3aethylene 3agroundwater 3agroundwater flow 3ahalf life 3ahydrogeochemistry 3aindustrial sites 3aisotopes 3amathematical models 3aminerals 3amonitoring 3aorganic carbon 3apermeability 3asandstone 3asorption 3awells 3aCalifornia1 aChapman, Steven W.1 aZimmerman, Laura K.1 aHurley, Jennifer C.1 aAravena, Ramon1 aCherry, John A.1 aParker, Beth L.0 tJournal of contaminant hydrology.g2018 May, v. 212 p.96-114dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl42311x0169-77227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconhyd.2018.03.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03333naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245015400163300002000317520150400337592002801841650001501869650001501884650002001899650002601919650002001945650002201965650002001987650001702007650001702024650001302041650001402054650001702068650002602085653003202111653003102143653003402174653002502208653003502233700005602268700005502324700001702379700005302396700001502449700001202464700001802476700001302494700005502507773014202562856007802704852000902782655001202791IND60746468420220218000000.0210805e20210722xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074646842DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c080782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Tiancheng10aStimuli-Responsive Metal–Organic Framework on a Metal–Organic Framework Heterostructure for Efficient Antibiotic Detection and Anticounterfeiting  ap. 35689-35699.  aStimuli-responsiveness is an important characteristic that show promising potential in various applications. Herein, a novel ZIF-8-on-Tb-dpn (H₃dpn = 5-(2′,4′-dicarboxylphenyl)nicotic acid) heterostructure is constructed using a heteroepitaxial strategy combining the chemical-responsive (antibiotics) and light-responsive behaviors. The pyridine nitrogen of Tb-dpn acts as an anchor site for Zn²⁺, which helps to overcome the limit of lattice mismatch between two metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) and promotes the growth of ZIF-8 nanocrystals. Based on the synergy effect of two MOFs, ZIF-8-on-Tb-dpn exhibits an efficient turn-off response toward tetracycline and chloramphenicol via competitive absorption, Förster resonance energy transfer, and photoinduced electron transfer processes with limit of detection values of 5.6 and 37.6 nM, respectively, which are three- to −fivefold lower than those of Tb-dpn. Moreover, the nanocage of ZIF-8 is utilized to encapsulate photochromic spiropyran (SP) molecules and realize the reversible conversion between SP and merocyanine (MC) under visible light and ultraviolet light. The MC form is accompanied with strong adsorption at 555 nm, which can erase the emission of Tb³⁺. Therefore, a reversible invisible anticounterfeiting pattern is designed with SP ⊂ ZIF-8-on-Tb-dpn for information anticounterfeiting. The excellent stimuli-responsive ability makes the luminescent platform a potential candidate in luminescence applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aadsorption 3achloramphenicol 3acoordination polymers 3adetection limit 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy transfer 3aluminescence 3ananocrystals 3anitrogen 3apyridines 3atetracycline 3aultraviolet radiation 0astimuli-responsive behavior 0aMOF-on-MOF heterostructure 0aphotoluminescence performance 0aantibiotic detection 0ainformation anticounterfeiting1 aFan, Ruiqing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5461-96721 aZhang, Jian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9447-81091 aQin, Mingyue1 aChen, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0647-65631 aJiang, Xin1 aZhu, Ke1 aJi, Chengshan1 aHao, Sue1 aYang, Yulin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2108-662X0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 July 22, v. 13, no. 30 p.35689-35699dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c080783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02228naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245014100176520082200317592002801139650001801167650001101185650002401196650001001220650001701230650002901247650002701276653001901303653002901322653001601351653001901367653001601386700003301402700006701435700007401502700006701576773009501643856008301738852000901821655001201830IND60730181420221120200549.0211030e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073018142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fbio.2021.1009262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCano y Postigo, Luis O.10aSolid-state fermentation for enhancing the nutraceutical content of agrifood by-products: Recent advances and its industrial feasibility  aSolid-state fermentation (SSF) has become an attractive bioprocess with potential application at industrial scale.

Although there is a well-established research stream on the causes and mitigating factors for the bullwhip effect in forward supply chains, few studies have investigated how this phenomenon manifests itself in closed-loop supply chains. We argue that this phenomenon can affect the supply chain's environmental performance by increasing emissions, waste and consumption of natural resources. Aiming at filling this theoretical gap, this article compares the causes and mitigating factors of the bullwhip effect in forward supply chains and closed-loop supply chains. To this end, we employ a systematic literature review that combines bibliometric and content analyses. The studies examined in our review indicate that the causes of the bullwhip effect in closed-loop supply chains are similar to those in forward supply chains. However, most of the studies have not considered that the quality of returned products are different from the quality of their new counterparts' products, adding another variable into the complexity of a given supply chain which, in turn, could lead to higher variability, thereby causing the bullwhip effect. Regarding mitigation, we found that the primary mitigating factor is related to increasing the product return rate. Moreover, we suggest that closing a supply chain can reduce the bullwhip effect, which could lead to positive impacts in the environmental performance of supply chains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconsumers (people) 3aemissions 3aenvironmental performance 3asupply chain 3auncertainty 3awastes 0aClosed-loop supply chain 0aReverse supply chain 0aBullwhip effect 0aCircular economy 0aSustainability 0aGreen supply chain1 aDe Mello, Adriana Marotti1 ade Vasconcelos Gomes, Leonardo Augusto1 aNascimento, Paulo Tromboni de Souza,0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 Nov. 20, v. 202 p.376-389dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.08.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01601naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100001500135245007000150300001500220520058100235592002800816650001000844650002200854650001100876700004100887700001600928773015200944856006901096856010201165990002301267852000901290655001201299IND60676371220221121004336.0191115e20191114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067637122DNAL7 a10.3791/591722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Jaeil10aThree-dimensional shape modeling and analysis of brain structures  ap. e59172.  aStatistical shape analysis of brain structures has been used to investigate the association between their structural changes and pathological processes.

The polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were administered to the fish through food, intraperitoneal injection of peanut oil, or intraperitoneal implantation of silicone capsules. The retention of the PCBs in fish exposed through their diet was related with the substitution patterns of the compounds. Ortho-substituted congeners with no unsubstituted meta-para positions had high biomagnification potential. PCBs with low biomagnification all had adjacent vicinal hydrogens, indicating that congeners with this feature may have been metabolically eliminated. The retention characteristics of the PCBs in the diet-exposed and the injected zebrafish were similar. The pattern of congeners in Arctic char indicates that they have a lower capacity to metabolize PCBs compared to three-spined sticklebacks and zebrafish. The levels in the fish exposed to the PCBs through a silastic implant were negatively correlated with the hydrophobicity of the congeners. Most probably congener-specific release rates of the PCBs from the implants mask their retention characteristics. It is suggested that food, mimicking the natural intake route, should be used in PCB exposure studies to validate extrapolations to natural situations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aGasterosteus aculeatus 3aSalvelinus alpinus 3abioaccumulation 3acorrelation 3adiet 3aexposure pathways 3afish 3ahydrophobicity 3aintraperitoneal injection 3apeanut oil 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3asilicone1 aBerg, A.

A pot experiment was conducted to expose the plants to sewage-irrigated garden soil (mean 2.28 mg kg⁻¹ Cd) pretreated at three salinity levels. Under salinity stress, the concentrations of Cd in the two cultivars were significantly elevated compared with those in the controls, and the Cd concentration in Liuye was statistically higher than that in Quanhong (p < 0.05). Salinity-induced osmoregulation triggered different biogeochemical processes involved in Cd mobilization in the rhizosphere soil, Cd absorption, and translocation by the two cultivars. Rhizosphere acidification induced by an imbalance of cation over anion uptake was more serious in Liuye than in Quanhong, which obviously increased soil Cd bioavailability. Salinity-induced injuries in the cell wall pectin and membrane structure were worse in Liuye than in Quanhong, increasing the risk of Cd entering the protoplasts. The chelation of more cytoplasmic Cd²⁺ with Cl⁻ ions in the roots of Liuye promoted Cd translocation into the shoots. Furthermore, the less organic solutes in the root sap of Liuye than in that of Quanhong also favored Cd translocation into the shoots. Hence, osmoregulation processes can be regarded as important factors in reducing Cd accumulation in crop cultivars grown on saline soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aacidification 3abioavailability 3acadmium 3acations 3acell walls 3achelation 3achlorides 3acultivars 3agardens 3ahorticultural soils 3ahyperaccumulators 3aosmoregulation 3apectins 3aprotoplasts 3arhizosphere 3arisk 3aroots 3asaline soils 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asap 3ashoots 3asolutes 0aSalinity stress 0aOsmoregulation 0aCadmium accumulation 0aEdible amaranth1 aLi, Qu-Sheng1 aYang, Ping1 aYe, Han-Jie1 aChen, Zi-Shuo1 aGuo, Shi-Hong1 aWang, Lili,1 aHe, Bao-Yan1 aZeng, E.

Mealtime behavior problems of children who were fed orally were compared with children who received their total nutrition enterally. Methods: A chart review of 140 pediatric patients presenting to an outpatient Interdisciplinary Feeding Team (IFT) clinic was conducted. The sample consisted of 81 males and 59 females ranging from 1.5 months to 12.6 years of age (mean age, 36.5 months). Information included for analyses was obtained from the IFT intake form, final IFT report, and the Behavioral Pediatrics Feeding Assessment Scale (BPFAS). Results: Parents of children in both groups found child mealtime behaviors equally problematic according to mean intensity ratings and frequency of problems regarding both parent behavior and child behaviors. Conclusions: Regardless of feeding status (enteral versus oral feeding) of the child, parents of children with feeding and nutrition concerns benefit from intervention and support surrounding mealtimes. The specific mealtime strategies and needs of the parents, however, may differ depending on the feeding status of the child.  aPublisher supplied data 3abehavior problems 3achildren 3afemales 3amales 3anutrition 3aparental behavior 3aparents 3apatients 3apediatrics1 aMcGrath, Ann M.1 aAllred, Kelly E.1 aRudolph, Colin D.0 tNutrition in clinical practice.g, v. 17, no. 5 p.291-295dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl39209x1941-24527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/01154265020170052913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03325naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001600188245013400204300001600338506007600354520126100430592002801691506003701719650001901756650001401775650002001789650002201809650003401831650001301865650001501878650001301893650002801906650000901934650003501943650002101978650002801999651001002027653002202037653002202059653002202081653002502103653002302128700001702151700001402168700001802182700001802200700001602218700001902234700001502253700001602268700001202284700001302296700001602309700001502325700001602340700001302356700001202369700001302381700001702394773012502411856008202536852000902618655001202627IND60615799120221207114412.0181102e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061579912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gpb.2018.03.0052doi7 aPMC62050812pmcid7 a302083402pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Linna10aCCGD-ESCC: A Comprehensive Database for Genetic Variants Associated with Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma in Chinese Population  ap. 262-268.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEsophageal squamous-cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most lethal malignancies in the world and occurs at particularly higher frequency in China. While several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of germline variants and whole-genome or whole-exome sequencing studies of somatic mutations in ESCC have been published, there is no comprehensive database publically available for this cancer. Here, we developed the Chinese Cancer Genomic Database-Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (CCGD-ESCC) database, which contains the associations of 69,593 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with ESCC risk in 2022 cases and 2039 controls, survival time of 1006 ESCC patients (survival GWAS) and gene expression (expression quantitative trait loci, eQTL) in 94 ESCC patients. Moreover, this database also provides the associations between 8833 somatic mutations and survival time in 675 ESCC patients. Our user-friendly database is a resource useful for biologists and oncologists not only in identifying the associations of genetic variants or somatic mutations with the development and progression of ESCC but also in studying the underlying mechanisms for tumorigenesis of the cancer.

The etiology of essential hypertension (EH) has been explored in depth, but the pathophysiology is multifactorial, complex, and poorly understood. Recent findings showed a role of inherited mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in maternally inherited forms of hypertension. However, an impact of somatic mtDNA mutations in the development of EH is significantly less investigated. In this study, we examined whether the level of heteroplasmy for the 15059G>A mutation in the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene is associated with EH in T2D. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The heteroplasmy level in mtDNA isolated from blood of 189 diabetic participants randomly selected from general population (124 of whom had EH) was quantified using a real-time PCR. RESULTS: The 15059G>A heteroplasmy exceeding 39% was found to be significantly associated with a higher risk of EH (odds ratio 1.96; P (Fisher) 0.032).

In this paper, the limitation of the Leverett concept that the concept is not applicable in the case of nonspreading NAPLs is discussed through microscopic consideration. A new concept that can be applied in the case of nonspreading NAPLs as well as spreading NAPLs is then proposed. The validity of the proposed concept is confirmed by comparing with past experimental data and simulation results obtained using the conventional model based on the Leverett concept.

However, the disease outbreaks caused by Vibrio parahemolyticus have resulted in high mortality and disastrous economic losses in the mud crab culture industry. Immune priming has shown the capacity of protecting invertebrates against pathogens in the second exposure, with profound implications for the prevention of infectious diseases. In this study, the survival and immune responses of mud crabs received primary exposure to formalin-killed V. parahemolyticus (immune priming, IP) and secondary challenge with live counterparts (lethal challenge, LC) were investigated. The priming dose of 2 × 10⁵ cells·g⁻¹ of inactivated V. parahemolyticus showed the highest survival rate (75.7%). There was no significant difference among the primed groups that received lethal challenge at different time points (P > .05). The cumulative survival of the primed (FVP) group (73.5%) was significantly higher than that of the control (SA) and naïve groups after the second challenge with live V. parahemolyticus. The efficiency of pathogen clearance, total hemocyte count, and phagocytic rate were significantly increased in FVP group compared to SA group after the IP and LC treatments. By contrast, no significant changes in antibacterial activity, phagocytic index and phenoloxidase activity (excepting at 6 hpi) were found in the comparison between FVP and SA groups. These results suggested the occurrence of priming phenomenon in mud crab, primary immunization with inactivated V. parahemolyticus can improve survival following infection and enhance cellular immune responses, the particularly phagocytic rate that contributes to the elevated phagocytosis. This finding provides a novel direction in protecting mud crab against vibriosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScylla paramamosain 3aVibrio parahaemolyticus 3aanimal diseases 3aantibacterial properties 3acell-mediated immunity 3acrab culture 3acrabs 3adisease outbreaks 3aenzyme activity 3afinancial economics 3ahemocytes 3aimmune response 3aimmunization 3aindustry 3amarine crustaceans 3amonophenol monooxygenase 3apathogens 3aphagocytosis 3aprimary contact 3asecondary infection 3asurvival rate 3avibriosis 3aChina 0aScylla paramamosain 0aVibrio parahemolyticus 0aImmune priming 0aPhagocytosis1 aTran, Ngoc Tuan1 aZhu, Chunhua1 aZhang, Ming1 aYao, Defu1 aAweya, Jude Juventus1 aGong, Yi1 aMa, Hongyu1 aZhang, Yueling1 aLi, Guangli1 aLi, Shengkang0 tAquaculture.g2020 Dec. 15, v. 529 p.735671-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7356713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02986naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245010400163300002000267520172500287592002802012650001902040650001302059650002102072650002002093650002102113653002002134653002702154653001802181653001902199653001802218653003002236700006002266700005702326773014202383856007802525852000902603655001202612IND60746468920221119231825.0210805e20210721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074646892DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c081672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGo, Chae Young10aTailored Design of Electrochemically Degradable Anthraquinone Functionality toward Organic Cathodes  ap. 35729-35738.  aIn efforts to design organic cathode materials for rechargeable batteries, a fundamental understanding of the redox properties of diverse non-carbon-based functionalities incorporated into 9,10-anthraquinone is lacking despite their potential impact. Herein, a preliminary investigation of the potential of anthraquinones with halogenated nitrogen-based functionalities reveals that the Li-triggered structural collapse observed in the early stage of discharging can be ascribed to the preference toward the strong Lewis acid–base interaction of N–Li–X (X = F or Cl) over the repulsive interaction of the electron-rich N–X bond. A further study of three solutions (i.e., substitution of NX₂ with (i) BX₂, (ii) NH₂, and (iii) BH₂) to the structural decomposition issue highlights four conclusive remarks. First, the replacement of N and/or X with electron-deficient atom(s), such as B and/or H, relieves the repulsive force on the N–X bond without the assistance of Li, and thus, no structural decomposition occurs. Second, the incorporation of BH₂ is verified to be the most beneficial for improving the theoretical performance. Third, all the redox properties are better correlated with electron affinity and solvation energy than the electronegativity of functionality, implying that these key parameters cooperatively contribute to the electrochemical redox potential; additionally, solvation energy plays a crucial role in determining cathodic deactivation. Fourth, the improvement to the Li storage capability of anthraquinone using the third solution can primarily be ascribed to solvation energy remaining at a negative value even after the binding of more Li atoms than the other derivatives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthraquinones 3acathodes 3aelectrochemistry 3aredox potential 3asolvation energy 0aorganic cathode 0astructural degradation 0aanthraquinone 0aredox property 0afunctionality 0adensity functional theory1 aJang, Seung Soon1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1920-421X1 aKim, Ki-Chul,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9359-98110 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 July 21, v. 13, no. 30 p.35729-35738dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c081673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02462naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245010200167300002000269520116000289592002801449650001101477650001701488650001301505650002201518650001301540650002001553650001301573650001801586650001401604650001401618650001201632650001601644653002101660653002501681653002001706653001401726653001301740700001701753700001901770773013301789856008501922852000902007655001202016IND60586475320221118041410.0171213e20171204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058647532DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b023752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Mengkun10aPyrolysis-Based Technology for Recovering Copper from Transistors on Waste Printed Circuit Boards  ap. 11354-11361.  aWaste electronic components (ECs) recycling is a crucial part of waste printed circuit boards (WPCBs) recycling system. Waste transistors (WTs) are one of the largest obsolete ECs whose recycling technology has been poorly developed. This study presented a pyrolysis-based technology for recovering copper from WTs disassembled from WPCBs, including coarse crushing, pyrolysis, pulverizing, and sieving. First, the WTs were coarsely crushed to reduce the particle size of the epoxy molding compound (EMC). Second, the coarsely crushed WTs were pyrolyzed to damage the cross-linking network structure of EMC and reduce the hardness of EMC. Third, all of the pyrolysis residues were crushed and sieved to separate metals and nonmetals. Finally, an integrated recycling process was proposed based on above studies. In addition, the mechanism of the pyrolysis was analyzed based on bond theory and product analysis to deeply understand the recycling process. Under optimal conditions, 99.16% of copper in WTs were recovered with a purity of 92.75%. This paper provides a method for waste transistors recycling in an efficient and environmentally friendly way.  aPublisher supplied data 3acopper 3acrosslinking 3acrushing 3aelectronic wastes 3aepoxides 3agreen chemistry 3ahardness 3aparticle size 3apyrolysis 3arecycling 3asieving 3atransistors 0aWaste transistor 0aElectronic component 0aCopper recovery 0aPyrolysis 0aCrushing1 aWang, Jianbo1 aHsu, Chen-Min,0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2017 Dec. 04, v. 5, no. 12 p.11354-11361dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b023753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02459naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245009300173300001600266520094500282592002801227650001401255650002201269650001301291650001501304650001501319650002201334650001201356650001101368650001501379650001301394650001201407650001701419650001001436650001301446650001501459650001801474650000701492650001801499650002301517650001601540653001501556653001601571653001401587653001301601653001501614700002501629773018401654856008201838852000901920655001201929IND60615799520221122134128.0190415e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061579952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ejar.2018.07.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Senani, Ghadah M.10aAdsorption study of heavy metal ions from aqueous solution by nanoparticle of wild herbs  ap. 187-194.  aWild herbs (Equisetum, EH and Teucrium, TH) were used as environment friendly adsorbents in the present study. This study focuses on the investigation of the adsorption ability of Co, Cd and Li from aqueous solution. The adsorption of heavy metals onto EH and TH was dependent on particle size, dose, solution pH, contact time, and temperature. Kinetic data were tested using pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order kinetic models. The best fit was obtained with the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Langmuir and Freundlich models have been applied to calculate adsorption data and the thermodynamic parameters; entropy, ΔS°, enthalpy, ΔH°, and the Gibbs free energy, ΔG°; were determined. The results suggests that the adsorption of heavy metals by the wild herbs are endothermic and a spontaneous process. Thus, it was concluded that EH and TH are promising adsorbents for the adsorption of heavy metals from aqueous solutions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEquisetum 3aGibbs free energy 3aTeucrium 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3acadmium 3acobalt 3aendothermy 3aenthalpy 3aentropy 3aheavy metals 3aherbs 3akinetics 3ametal ions 3ananoparticles 3apH 3aparticle size 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature 0aWild herbs 0aHeavy metal 0aEquisetum 0aTeucrium 0aAdsorption1 aAl-Fawzan, Foziah F.0 tEgyptian Journal of Aquatic Research (Online).g2018 Sept., v. 44, no. 3 p.187-194dElsevier B.V.aNational Institute of Oceanography and FisherieswJournal:21572x2090-32787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejar.2018.07.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01499naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245004900170300001600219520057700235592002800812650001400840650001700854651001800871653000800889653000800897653001400905653001700919653001900936700001800955773010600973856008501079852000901164655001201173IND60599785020221120223106.0180702e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059978502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2013.06.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatheson, Troy14aThe Great Recession and the inflation puzzle  ap. 468-472.  aNotwithstanding high unemployment following the Great Recession, inflation in the United States has been remarkably stable.

All yeast was inactivated with sray-drying post treatment. The yeast products were evaluated for their nutritional value and health effects in diets for Atlantic salmon. The experimental diets consisted of a high-quality fishmeal-based reference diet (FM) and six experimental diets were 300 g kg⁻¹ of each of the processed yeast candidates were added to the FM control mixture. Fish were fed the diets for 21 days, and at the end of the experiment, feces were collected, and spleen, head kidney, distal intestine (DI) and plasma were sampled for assessment of immune response.Processing of yeast resulted in increased level of soluble protein in the yeast cream, with the highest level for yeast disrupted by cell crushing (20 K PSI). This was confirmed with scanning electron microscopy, where disrupted and cracked cells could be observed. Significant lower protein digestibility of the directly inactivated yeast coincided with the increased detection of whole yeast cells by flow cytometry in the DI content of fish fed the directly inactivated yeast. Autolysis for 16 h resulted in the highest protein digestibility, which was similar to the FM control.Interestingly, 16 h autolyzed yeast induced the secretion of IL-8, while cell crushed yeast induced the secretion of TNFα in the DI as analyzed by ELISA. To conclude, different down-stream processing of S. cerevisiae led to increased protein and β-glucan solubility that further increased protein digestibility in Atlantic salmon. Furthermore, different processing of the yeast triggered different immune stimulatory effects in Atlantic salmon.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aSalmo salar 3aaquaculture industry 3aautolysis 3abakers yeast 3abeta-glucans 3acrushing 3adigestibility 3adigestible protein 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aexperimental diets 3afeces 3afish 3aflow cytometry 3ahealth effects assessments 3aimmune response 3aingredients 3ainterleukin-8 3aintestines 3akidneys 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asecretion 3asolubility 3aspleen 3aspray drying 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aDI 0aFM 0aIL-1β 0aIL-8 0aTNFα 0aELISA 0aSEM 0aDown-stream processing 0aNutrient digestibility 0aAtlantic salmon1 aLagos, Leidy1 aLei, Peng1 aReveco-Urzua, Felipe Eduardo1 aMorales-Lange, Byron1 aHansen, Line Degn1 aSchiavone, Marion1 aMydland, Liv Torunn1 aArntzen, Magnus Øverlie1 aMercado, Luis1 aBenicio, Ricardo Tavares1 aØverland, Margareth0 tAquaculture.g2021 Jan. 15, v. 530 p.735707-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7357073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03249naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245012700161300001400288520164500302592002801947650001201975650004801987650001902035650002402054650001002078650001902088650002402107650001602131650001102147650000902158650002402167650002702191650001602218650002302234653002702257653002402284653003202308653002702340700001702367700001802384700002002402700001802422700002002440700001802460700001902478700002002497700001902517773008102536856008102617852000902698655001202707IND60556542020221123040527.0161115e20161215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055654202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2016.10.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Yong10aDisruption of calcium homeostasis by cardiac-specific over-expression of PPAR-γ in mice: A role in ventricular arrhythmia  ap. 12-21.  aAdverse cardiovascular effects induced by peroxisome proliferator activator receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) activation were observed in clinical setting. But the underlying mechanism is unclear. Now, transgenic mice with cardiac specific peroxisome proliferator activator receptor-γ overexpression (TG-PPAR-γ) were used to explore the possible mechanisms.Cardiac tissues from TG-PPAR-γ mice, a PPAR-γ over-expressing human cardiomyocyte line AC16 cell, and PPAR-γ agonist-treated primary cardiomyocytes were used to evaluate the expression of cardiac calcium regulatory proteins as sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase, Na+/Ca2+ exchanger 1, ryanodine receptor 2 and phospholamban. Intracellular Ca2+ levels were also examined by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy with Fluo-4/AM in these cells.In this study, frequent ventricular premature contraction and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia were observed in TG-PPAR-γ but not in wild-type mice. Besides, we found the calcium regulatory proteins expression were higher in the TG-PPAR-γ mice, PPAR-γ overexpressing human cardiomyocyte line AC16 cell and PPAR-γ agonist-treated primary cardiomyocytes than the control group respectively. In addition, an increase of intracellular calcium levels and CaMKII δ expression in PPAR-γ overexpression and PPAR-γ activation group. Moreover, Inhibition of CaMKII δ could improve the intracellular calcium levels and reduce the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmia.PPAR-γ over-expression perturbs the intracellular calcium homeostasis in cardiomyocytes which contribute to the ventricular arrhythmias and cardiac sudden death in TG-PPAR-γ mice.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acalcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 3acardiomyocytes 3aconfocal microscopy 3adeath 3aflow cytometry 3agene overexpression 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3amice 3aregulatory proteins 3asarcoplasmic reticulum 3atachycardia 3atransgenic animals 0aPPAR-γ overexpression 0aCalcium homeostasis 0aCalcium regulatory proteins 0aVentricular arrhythmia1 aGu, Zhen-Jie1 aWu, Mao-Xiong1 aHuang, Tu-Cheng1 aOu, Jing-Song1 aNi, Huiping-Son1 aLin, Mao-Huan1 aYuan, Wo-Liang1 aWang, Jing-Feng1 aChen, Yang-Xin0 tLife sciences.g2016 Dec. 15, v. 167 p.12-21dElsevier Inc.x0024-32057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2016.10.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03173naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245018700163300001600350520140300366592002801769650001801797650001401815650001801829650001901847650001601866650002801882650001201910650001901922650001201941650001201953650002301965650001101988650001001999650000802009650001102017650001202028650002402040650001702064650002302081650002402104650002302128651001002151700001702161700002102178700002102199700001902220700001902239700001602258700001802274700002402292700001702316773012502333856008102458990002302539852000902562655001202571IND60094836120221121004313.0141104e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009483612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dsx.2012.11.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJoseph, Lee10aEvaluation of existing and candidate measures of obesity for detection of insulin resistance and cardiometabolic risk among Asian Indians: Development of two clinically useful models  ap. 181-186.  aBACKGROUND: The optimal measure of obesity continues to be debated. The objective of this study was to evaluate existing and candidate measures of obesity for detecting the presence of cardiometabolic risk and insulin resistance among Asian Indians. METHODS: Anthropometry, detailed body composition analysis, blood pressure, lipids, fasting blood glucose and fasting serum insulin were measured in a cross-sectional study involving 507 subjects from North India. RESULTS: In females, all indices of obesity, except waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and total body fat (TBF) to waist circumference (WC) ratio and in men, all indices of obesity including fat mass index and WHR, were significantly associated with insulin resistance and cardiovascular risk factors (p<0.05). Using stepwise logistic regression, two models were developed excluding WC and WHR, respectively. In model 1, subscapular skinfold thickness, WHR and age in males, and waist circumference to square of height ratio (WS²R) and age in females; and in model 2, subscapular skinfold thickness, WS²R and visceral adiposity index in males, and TBF to WC ratio, WS²R and age in females showed strong and significant association with the presence of cardiovascular risk factors or insulin resistance. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical models for measurement of obesity developed by us would help in detecting cardiometabolic risk in Asian Indians.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAsian Indians 3aadiposity 3ablood glucose 3ablood pressure 3ablood serum 3across-sectional studies 3afasting 3afat mass index 3afemales 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3alipids 3amales 3amen 3amodels 3aobesity 3aregression analysis 3arisk factors 3askinfold thickness 3awaist circumference 3awaist-to-hip ratio 3aIndia1 aMisra, Anoop1 aChandra, Mekhala1 aVikram, Naval K.1 aKondal, Dimple1 aMisra, Ranjita1 aPatel, T.G.1 aGoel, Kashish1 aPandey, Ravindra M.1 aKumar, Pawan0 tDiabetes & metabolic syndrome: clinical research & reviews.g2012 , v. 6, no. 4 p.181-186dElsevier Ltdx1871-40217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2012.11.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02552naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245008700173300001400260520125100274592002801525650001701553650001301570650001001583650001601593650002101609650002001630650001101650650001701661650001301678653000901691653001601700653002501716653001201741653002201753700002201775700002001797700002301817700002101840700002001861773013001881856008602011852000902097655001202106IND60597272520221118060500.0190318e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059727252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconhyd.2018.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPortois, Clément10aField demonstration of foam injection to confine a chlorinated solvent source zone  ap. 16-23.  aA novel approach using foam to manage hazardous waste was successfully demonstrated under active site conditions. The purpose of the foam was to divert groundwater flow, that would normally enter the source zone area, to reduce dissolved contaminant release to the aquifer. During the demonstration, foam was pre generated and directly injected surrounding the chlorinated solvent source zone. Despite the constraints related to the industrial activities and non-optimal position of the injection points, the applicability and effectiveness of the approach have been highlighted using multiple metrics. A combination of measurements and modelling allowed definition of the foam extent surrounding each injection point, and this appears to be the critical metric to define the success of the foam injection approach. Information on the transport of chlorinated solvents in groundwater showed a decrease of contaminant flux by a factor of 4.4 downstream of the confined area. The effective permeability reduction was maintained over a period of three months. The successful containment provides evidence for consideration of the use of foam to improve traditional flushing techniques, by increasing the targeting of contaminants by remedial agents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3aaquifers 3afoams 3agroundwater 3agroundwater flow 3ahazardous waste 3amodels 3apermeability 3asolvents 0aFoam 0aGroundwater 0aChlorinated solvents 0aIn situ 0aDNAPL containment1 aEssouayed, Elyess1 aAnnable, M.

Design expert software was employed to examine the influence of different concentrations of dye, adsorbent dosage, contact time and pH on the removal efficiency of Eriochrome Black T using sludge. Additionally, the factorial design was applied to examine the interaction effect of these four variables on the adsorption process. The results were also subjected to examine the correlation between the actual and theoretical EBT dye removal efficiencies (%) which showed how closely the predicted distribution results followed the experimental values. Moreover, the experimental results were subjected to Halsey and Jovanovic adsorption isotherms to explain the adsorption process.

Here, we demonstrate an acoustofluidic method for submicron particle enrichment within a spinning droplet driven by a unidirectional transducer. The unidirectional transducer generates intense sound energy with relatively low attenuation. Droplets placed offset in the wave propagation path on a polydimethylsiloxane film undergo strong pressure gradients, deforming into an ellipsoid shape and spinning at high speed. Benefitting from the drag force induced by the droplet spin and acoustic streaming and the radial force induced by the droplet compression and expansion, the submicron particles in the liquid droplet quickly enrich toward the central area following a spiral trajectory. Through numerical calculations and experimental processes, we have demonstrated the possible mechanism responsible for particle enrichment. The application of biological sample processing has also been exploited. This study anticipates that the strategy based on the spinning droplet and particle enrichment method will be highly desirable for many applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3aanalytical chemistry 3abiochemistry 3adroplets 3aenergy 3aliquids 3amedicine 3apolydimethylsiloxane1 aFan, Cui1 aZhou, Mingyong1 aJiang, Fengze1 aDrummer, Dietmar1 aJiang, Bingyan0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2021 Sept. 23, v. 93, no. 39 p.13293-13301dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c029143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03434naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245008500169300001400254520179000268592002802058650002802086650001602114650001202130650001202142650001902154650001902173650002102192650002102213650001502234650001102249650001502260650000902275650002602284650001702310653000902327653002502336653001202361653001002373653000902383653001002392653000702402653000802409653000802417653000802425700001602433700002402449700001402473700005902487700001502546700002202561700001602583700006202599773008102661856008102742852000902823655001202832IND60556542220221123040535.0170628e20170615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055654222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2016.10.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, Stephen B.10aImpact of cardiac-specific expression of CD39 on myocardial infarct size in mice  ap. 54-59.  aPrior work suggests that ischemic preconditioning increases the level of CD39 in the heart and contributes to cardiac protection. Therefore, we examined if targeted cardiac expression of CD39 protects against myocardial injury.Mice with cardiac-specific expression of human CD39 (αMHC/hCD39-Tg) were generated, characterized and subjected to left coronary artery ischemia-reperfusion injury and infarct size at 24h following injury quantified.αMHC/hCD39-Tg mice have increased in cardiac ATPase and ADPase activity compared to WT littermates. The increased activity in αMHC/hCD39-mice was inhibited by the CD39 antagonist sodium polyoxotungstate (POM-1). Measurement of basal cardiac function by echocardiography revealed that αMHC/hCD39-Tg mice have a lower resting heart rate and increased stroke volume. In response to myocardial ischemia, systolic and diastolic function was better preserved in αMHC/hCD39-Tg compared to WT mice. Comparison of Tau also revealed preserved cardiac relaxation during ischemia in αMHC/hCD39-Tg hearts. Assessment of myocardial infarct size in response to 60min of ischemia and 24h of reperfusion demonstrated a significant reduction in infarct size in αMHC/hCD39-Tg hearts. Analysis of isolated cardiomyocytes revealed no basal difference in calcium transients between WT and αMHC/hCD39-Tg cardiomyocytes. However, in response to isoproterenol stimulation, there was a trend toward lower calcium transients in αMHC/hCD39 cardiomyocytes suggesting less calcium accumulation in response to metabolic stress.Cardiac-specific expression of CD39 reduces myocardial dysfunction and infarct size following ischemia-reperfusion injury. Increasing nucleotidase expression in the heart may be a novel approach to protect the heart from ischemic injury.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3aantagonists 3aapyrase 3acalcium 3acardiac output 3acardiomyocytes 3acoronary vessels 3aechocardiography 3aheart rate 3ahumans 3ainfarction 3amice 3amyocardial infarction 3anucleotidase 0aCD39 0aIschemia-reperfusion 0aInfarct 0aαMHC 0aCD39 0aPOM-1 0aTg 0aATP 0aADP 0aAMP1 aXu, Zhaobin1 aNovitskaya, Tatiana1 aZhang, Bo1 aChepurko, Elena1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8335-55251 aPu, Xin-An1 aWheeler, Debra G.1 aZiolo, Mark1 aGumina, Richard J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8298-11290 tLife sciences.g2017 June 15, v. 179 p.54-59dElsevier Inc.x0024-32057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2016.10.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03319naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002700152245007600179300001600255520218300271592002802454650001902482650002102501650001802522650000902540650001602549650002102565651001402586653002002600653001902620653001002639653001702649653001902666700002302685700002402708773010502732856008702837852000902924655001202933IND60597272620221118060354.0200712e20181115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059727262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosres.2018.06.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade la Casa, Antonio C.10aSecular variation of rainfall regime in the central region of Argentina  ap. 196-210.  aApart from modifying the total amount of rain, another emerging impact of global warming on the rainfall regime could be an increase in the frequency and intensity of events, as well as their greater variability over time and space. The objectives of this work were to evaluate the long-term climatic variation of the precipitation regime in the central region of Argentina, determining the intensity and nature of the changes, and also examining the two typical modalities of representing the trend of change: linear and periodic models. Rainfall records were analyzed of the Córdoba Observatorio and Pilar Observatorio weather stations, as from 1910 and 1925 respectively, which belong to the Servicio Meteorológico Nacional (SMN) official network, and from a rain gauge located in Colonia Caroya, with data available as from 1929, that were selected by extension criteria, temporal integrity and geographical proximity. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall test (M-K) was used to identify the nature of the change, and the Theil-Sen (T-S) to evaluate intensity. These determine a significant linear trend (P < 0.05) in the region for total amount (PP) of rainfall, number of events (DPP), proportion of warm semester rainfall with respect to annual value, intensity (INT and PPmax) and variability, both annually and for the warm semester, when most of the annual rainfall occurs. However, adjusting these rainfall series to a simple sine function reveals a periodic behavior that explains a greater proportion of the observed variability with respect to the linear model, showing a negative phase of PP, DPP and PPmax during the period 1930–1950, which subsequently becomes positive between 1970 and 2000. Rainfall variability presents great dispersion in the region so neither the sine function nor the third-degree polynomial were appropriate to represent its long-term behavior. The linear trend loses statistical significance when the periodic behavior is incorporated into the analysis, leaving open the question about the influence of global warming on changes in the hydrological cycle and particularly on the rainfall regime in the central territory of Argentina.  aPublisher supplied data 3aglobal warming 3ahydrologic cycle 3alinear models 3arain 3arain gauges 3aweather stations 3aArgentina 0aRainfall regime 0aClimate change 0aTrend 0aLinear model 0aPeriodic model1 aOvando, Gustavo G.1 aDíaz, Guillermo J.0 tAtmospheric research.g2018 Nov. 15, v. 213 p.196-210dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11823x0169-80957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2018.06.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02661naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245011600166520110400282592002801386650002701414650001601441650001401457650001701471650003601488650001301524650001601537650001701553650002401570650001701594650001001611650001501621650002601636650001601662650001901678653002401697653002701721653001301748653002201761653003101783700001801814700001801832700001701850700002101867700002001888700001901908700001701927773009501944856008302039852000902122655001202131IND60730182320221120200457.0211030e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073018232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fbio.2021.1009592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Long-Jie10aType I collagen from sea cucumber (Stichopus japonicus) and the role of matrix metalloproteinase-2 in autolysis  aAutolysis is a major issue affecting the quality of sea cucumber during transportation and processing. To further clarify the mechanism, characteristics of type I collagen from sea cucumber Stichopus japonicas and its degradation by recombinant matrix metalloproteinase-2 (rMMP-2) were investigated. Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images showed that the body wall of fresh sea cucumber with intact collagen fibrils was disaggregated after autolysis. Pepsin-soluble collagen of Stichopus japonicas (SjPSC) was prepared and its filamentous feature was observed using SEM. Circular dichroism spectrum analysis showed that SjPSC had native triple helix structure and its denaturation temperature was 34.0 °C using differential scanning calorimeter. The α chain gene of SjPSC encoding 1400 amino acid residues was cloned. A polyclonal antibody against SjPSC was prepared and was used to detect collagen degradation during autolysis. The effect of rMMP-2 on the body wall strongly suggested that MMP-2 had an important role in sea cucumber autolysis by disaggregating collagen fibres into fibrils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApostichopus japonicus 3aamino acids 3aautolysis 3acalorimeters 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3acollagen 3adegradation 3adenaturation 3aelectron microscopy 3agelatinase A 3agenes 3aintegument 3apolyclonal antibodies 3atemperature 3atransportation 0aStichopus japonicas 0aSea cucumber autolysis 0aCollagen 0aMolecular cloning 0aMatrix metalloproteinase-21 aSun, Le-Chang1 aCao, Kai-Yuan1 aChen, Yu-Lei1 aZhang, Ling-Jing1 aLiu, Guang-Ming1 aJin, Tengchuan1 aCao, Min-Jie0 tFood bioscience.g2021 June, v. 41 p.100959-dElsevier LtdwJournal:21610x2212-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fbio.2021.1009593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02761naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245014900171300002000320520141700340592002801757650002501785650001001810650001801820650001201838650001601850650001601866651001101882651002001893700002101913700002001934700005801954700006002012700001902072700005902091773013202150856008402282852000902366655001202375IND60752646620221119164151.0211005e20210924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075264662DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.1c029482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdegoke, John A.10aUltraviolet/Visible and Near-Infrared Dual Spectroscopic Method for Detection and Quantification of Low-Level Malaria Parasitemia in Whole Blood  ap. 13302-13310.  aThe scourge of malaria infection continues to strike hardest against pregnant women and children in Africa and South East Asia. For global elimination, testing methods that are ultrasensitive to low-level ring-staged parasitemia are urgently required. In this study, we used a novel approach for diagnosis of malaria infection by combining both electronic ultraviolet–visible (UV/vis) spectroscopy and near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy to detect and quantify low-level (1–0.000001%) ring-staged malaria-infected whole blood under physiological conditions uisng Multiclass classification using logistic regression, which showed that the best results were achieved using the extended wavelength range, providing an accuracy of 100% for most parasitemia classes. Likewise, partial least-squares regression (PLS-R) analysis showed a higher quantification sensitivity (R² = 0.898) for the extended spectral region compared to UV/vis and NIR (R² = 0.806 and 0.556, respectively). For quantifying different-stage blood parasites, the extended wavelength range was able to detect and quantify all thePlasmodium falciparum accurately compared to testing each spectral component separately. These results demonstrate the potential of a combined UV/vis–NIR spectroscopy to accurately diagnose malaria-infected patients without the need for elaborate sample preparation associated with the existing mid-IR approaches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3ablood 3aleast squares 3amalaria 3aparasitemia 3awavelengths 3aAfrica 3aSouth East Asia1 aDe Paoli, Amanda1 aAfara, Isaac O.1 aKochan, Kamila1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7248-86371 aCreek, Darren J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7497-70821 aHeraud, Philip1 aWood, Bayden R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3581-447X0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2021 Sept. 24, v. 93, no. 39 p.13302-13310dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c029483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01533naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245007400172300001600246520058300262592002800845650001400873650001300887653000800900653000800908653002200916653001800938653001500956653001500971700002100986773010601007856008501113852000901198655001201207IND60599785420221120223125.0180702e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059978542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2013.06.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLindner, Florian10aLevel-k reasoning and time pressure in the 11–20 money request game  ap. 542-545.  aArad and Rubinstein (2012a) have designed a novel game to study level-k reasoning experimentally. Just like them, we find that the depth of reasoning is very limited and clearly different from that in equilibrium play. We show that such behavior is even robust to repetitions; hence there is, at best, little learning. However, under time pressure, behavior is, perhaps coincidentally, closer to that in equilibrium play. We argue that time pressure evokes intuitive reasoning and reduces the focal attraction of choosing higher (and per se more profitable) numbers in the game.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomics 3alearning 0aC91 0aC72 0aLevel-k reasoning 0aTime pressure 0aRepetition 0aExperiment1 aSutter, Matthias0 tEconomics letters.g2013 Sept., v. 120, no. 3 p.542-545dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3059x0165-17657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2013.06.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01343naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245010100173300001600274520025900290592002800549650002300577650001100600650002300611653000800634653000800642653000800650653001800658653002100676653002500697653002500722653001400747700002000761773010600781856008500887852000900972655001200981IND60599785520221120223110.0180702e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059978552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2013.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValadkhani, Abbas13aAn alternative approach to the modelling of interest rate pass through and asymmetric adjustment  ap. 491-494.  aWe propose an alternative approach to examine the nonlinear (asymmetric) behaviour of interest rates which can be both size and sign dependent.

The fat body interplays with other tissues to respond to the physiological needs of the body's growth and coordinates various metabolic processes at different developmental stages and under different environmental conditions. The identification of various conserved genetic functions and signaling pathways relating to the Drosophila fat body may provide clues to lipometabolic disease and other aspects of tissue remodeling in humans. Here, we discuss recent insights into how regulation of fat body remodeling contributes to hemostasis with a special focus on how signaling networks and internal physiological states shape different aspects of the lipid metabolism in Drosophila.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila 3adevelopmental stages 3aenergy 3aenvironmental factors 3afat body 3ahemostasis 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3alipid metabolism 3asignal transduction 0a20E 0aAKH 0aAKHR 0aALS 0aAPF 0aATGL 0aBmm 0aCC 0aDILP 0aIGF 0aIGF-BPs 0aIIS 0aImp-L2 0aIPCs 0aInR 0aJH 0aLDs 0aLsd1 0aLsd2 0aNlaz 0aPG 0aPI3K 0aPTTH 0aSir2 or Sirtuin 0aSlif 0aTG 0aTAG 0aTOR 0aUpd2 0aFat body remodeling 0aFat mobilization 0aEnergy storage 0aLipometabolism 0aDrosophila1 aYang, Xiaohang1 aXi, Yongmei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7374-25640 tLife sciences.g2016 Dec. 15, v. 167 p.22-31dElsevier Inc.x0024-32057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2016.10.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01411naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245004600173300001600219520045700235592002800692650001200720653000800732653000800740653000800748653000800756653001100764653001500775653002100790653002400811700002300835773012100858856008500979852000901064655001201073IND60599785720221120223102.0180702e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059978572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2013.06.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCostantini, Mauro10aCapital mobility and global factor shocks  ap. 513-515.  aThis paper focuses on the effects of global factors on the saving–investment relationship.

Therefore, adequate monitoring of insecticide resistance is an essential element in the control of Ae. aegypti and the diseases it transmits. We estimated the frequency and intensity (Resistance Frequency Rapid Diagnostic Test [F‐RDT] and Resistance Intensity Rapid Diagnostic Test [I‐RDT]) of pyrethroid resistance in populations of Ae. aegypti from Mexico using the bottle bioassay and results were related to the frequencies of knockdown resistance (kdr) mutations V1016I and F1534C. RESULTS: All populations under study were resistant to the pyrethroids: bifenthrin (99%), d‐(cis–trans)‐phenothrin (6.3% cis, 91.7% trans) and permethrin (99.5%) according to F‐RDT, and showed moderate to high‐intensity resistance at 10× the diagnostic dose (DD) in I‐RDT. Frequencies of the kdr mutation V1016I in Ae. aegypti populations were correlated with moderate permethrin resistance at 10× DD, whereas F1534C mutation frequencies were correlated with high bifenthrin resistance at 5× DD. Both I1016 and C1535 were highly correlated with high‐intensity phenothrin resistance at 1× to 10× DD. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that high frequencies of kdr mutations V1016I and F1534C are reflected in the results of F‐RDT and I‐RDT tests. Bioassays in conjunction with the characterization of genetic resistance mechanisms are indispensable in the strategic and rational management of resistance in mosquitoes. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aAedes aegypti 3abifenthrin 3abioassays 3adengue 3agenetic resistance 3ainsecticide resistance 3amonitoring 3amutation 3apermethrin 3aphenothrin 3apyrethrins 3aresistance mechanisms 3aMexico1 aGutierrez‐Rodriguez, Selene M1 aVillanueva‐Segura, Olga Karina1 aPonce‐Garcia, Gustavo1 aMorales‐Forcada, Franco1 aAlvarez, Leslie C1 aFlores, Adriana E1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8554-88650 tPest management science.g2018 Sept., v. 74, no. 9 p.2176-2184dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl59519x1526-498X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.49163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04303naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245018900177300001400366520217000380592002802550650002302578650002002601650001802621650002502639650002602664650002002690650000802710650001302718650001802731650001002749650004102759650001502800650002002815650001402835650001902849650002702868650001802895650001702913650001702930650003002947650001702977650001402994650001903008650001503027650001303042650001303055650003103068653001803099653002103117653002303138653002403161700006503185700007503250700003003325700004303355700002603398700002103424773010203445856008503547852000903632655001203641IND60535626020221121051830.0190408e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053562602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2014.02.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarros, Aline Ferreira10aNematicidal activity of volatile organic compounds emitted by Brassica juncea, Azadirachta indica, Canavalia ensiformis, Mucuna pruriens and Cajanus cajan against Meloidogyne incognita  ap. 34-43.  aUnderstanding the effect of plant volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on soil nematodes and water may explain plant damage in the field and how some nematode management strategies reduce soil nematode populations. M. incognita is a damaging plant pathogenic nematode that affects crops worldwide. The aims of this study were to evaluate the effect of the VOCs emitted by five common crops used for soil incorporation to control the second-stage juveniles (J2) of Meloidogyne incognita. To investigate the “in vitro” role of water in the relationship between nematodes and plant VOCs. And to identify the volatile molecules by gas chromatography (GC/MS). The method used permitted the volatile molecules from macerated plant organs to only contact the J2 nematodes by air. Plants organs from all plants macerated with and without water emitted VOCs that immobilized J2 nematodes, with higher levels emitted when the plant organs were macerated without water. Only water exposed to VOCs from neem and mustard leaves were capable of immobilizing M. incognita J2. The M. incognita J2 exposed to neem and mustard VOCs and inoculated in tomato seedlings resulted in reduced gall formation and nematode reproduction, showing the nematicidal effect of the plant-emitted VOCs. GC/MS analysis revealed the presence of 58 and 32 molecules in the VOCs emitted from neem and mustard macerates, respectively. Alcohols were found in both the neem and mustard VOCs. Esters were found in the neem VOCs, and sulfur-containing compounds, mostly isothiocyanates, were found in mustard. Our results demonstrate that plant VOCs contain diversified molecules that affect M. incognita mobility, pathogenicity and reproduction. Nematode toxic VOCs may be retained in water, which prevents the VOCs from escaping into the air and causing the water to become toxic to nematodes. These data may explain part of the role of VOCs in the biofumigation process, through plant incorporation with the soil, and suggests that irrigation performed directly after incorporation may trap the VOCs in soil water and thereafter retain nematode toxicity longer than incorporation that is performed later.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAzadirachta indica 3aBrassica juncea 3aCajanus cajan 3aCanavalia ensiformis 3aMeloidogyne incognita 3aMucuna pruriens 3aair 3aalcohols 3abiofumigation 3acrops 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3airrigation 3aisothiocyanates 3ajuveniles 3amustard greens 3anematicidal properties 3apathogenicity 3aplant damage 3aplant organs 3aplant parasitic nematodes 3areproduction 3aseedlings 3asoil nematodes 3asoil water 3atomatoes 3atoxicity 3avolatile organic compounds 0aBiofumigation 0aNematode control 0aGas chromatography 0aRoot-knot nematodes1 aCampos, Vicente Paulo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3284-74121 ada Silva, Júlio Carlos Pereira1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1961-66951 aPedroso, Márcio Pozzobon1 aMedeiros, Flávio Henrique Vasconcelos1 aPozza, Edson Ampélio1 aReale, Ana Luiza0 tApplied soil ecology.g2014 Aug., v. 80 p.34-43dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl55717x0929-13937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2014.02.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02908naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245016600161300001400327520139400341592002801735650001501763650001501778650002501793650001601818650002101834650001601855650001701871650001301888650002601901650000701927650001401934650002701948650001301975650001701988650001702005650001202022653004802034653002802082653004902110653002402159700001602183700001802199700001702217773009002234856008102324852000902405655001202414IND60544695920221118043018.0160901e20140131xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054469592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2013.12.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Ning12aA self-assembly pipette tip graphene solid-phase extraction coupled with liquid chromatography for the determination of three sulfonamides in environmental water  ap. 25-31.  aA sensitive, economical, and miniaturized self-assembly pipette tip graphene solid-phase extraction (PT-G-SPE) coupled with liquid chromatography fluorescence detection (LC-FD) was developed for rapid extraction and determination of three sulfonamide antibiotics (SAs) in environmental water samples. The PT-G-SPE cartridge, assembled by packing 1.0mg of graphene as sorbent into a 100μL pipette tip, showed high adsorption capacity for the SAs owing to the large surface area and unique structure of graphene. The factors that affected the extraction efficiency of PT-G-SPE, including sample volume, pH, sorbent amount, washing solvent and eluent solvent were optimized. Good linearity for SAs was obtained in a range of 2–4000pgmL−1 with correlation coefficients (r2)≥0.9993. The recoveries of the SAs at three spiked levels ranged from 90.4% to 108.2% with relative standard deviations (RSD)≤6.3%. In comparison with other sorbents such as C18, HLB, SCX, PCX, and multiwalled carbon nanotubes, one advantage of using graphene as sorbent of pipette tip solid-phase extraction (PT-SPE) was that PT-G-SPE could adsorb larger sample volume (10mL) at a small amount of sorbent (1mg) and low solvent consumption with good extraction efficiency, which not only increased the fraction of analytes to LC and the sensitivity of SAs determination, but also reduced the cost and pollution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aanalytical chemistry 3aantibiotics 3acarbon nanotubes 3acorrelation 3afluorescence 3agraphene 3aliquid chromatography 3apH 3apollution 3asolid phase extraction 3asolvents 3asulfonamides 3asurface area 3awashing 0aPipette tip graphene solid-phase extraction 0aSulfonamide antibiotics 0aLiquid chromatography-fluorescence detection 0aEnvironmental water1 aHan, Yehong1 aYan, Hongyuan1 aSong, Yanxue0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2014 Jan. 31, v. 810 p.25-31dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2013.12.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02402naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010000167300001600267520113800283592002801421650002501449650002101474650001501495650001501510650001401525650001801539650002401557650001901581650001101600650001301611650003401624650001601658700002201674700002401696700002101720700002501741773010101766856008101867990002301948852000901971655001201980IND60093164720221117234258.0141103e20121001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009316472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2012.06.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBertei, Antonio10aMorphological and electrochemical modeling of SOFC composite cathodes with distributed porosity  ap. 167-174.  aA steady-state mathematical model of charge and mass transport and electrochemical reaction in porous composite cathodes for solid oxide fuel cell application is presented. The model, based on local mass and charge balances, describes the domain as a continuum, characterizing kinetics as well as mass and charge transport using effective properties, related to cathode microstructure and material properties by percolation theory. The distribution of morphological properties along the electrode thickness, as experimentally observed on scanning electron microscope images of the samples investigated, is taken into account. This feature allows the model to reproduce the dependence of electrode thickness and oxygen partial pressure on polarization resistance in the range 600–850°C. It is found that for cathodes made of strontium-doped lanthanum manganite (LSM) and yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), the exchange current, which represents the kinetic constant of the oxygen reduction reaction, follows an Arrhenius behavior with respect to the temperature and it is dependent on the square root of the oxygen partial pressure.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical engineering 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3afuel cells 3alanthanum 3amass transfer 3amathematical models 3amicrostructure 3aoxygen 3aporosity 3ascanning electron microscopes 3atemperature1 aBarbucci, Antonio1 aCarpanese, M.

Insects from refuges must mate with insects from Bt maize to slow resistance evolution. We used stable isotope labeling to observe Diabrotica virgifera virgifera emergence, dispersal, physical characteristics, and mating in Bt and refuge maize planted in different refuge configurations. Our objective was to assess how refuge type facilitates mating between insects from Bt and refuge plants. RESULTS: Mating between D. v. virgifera beetles from different plant types was more likely in seed blends compared with strip refuges. Adult D. v. virgifera from refuge plants emerged before those from Bt plants. In strip refuges, D. v. virgifera from refuge plants did not disperse far from refuge boundaries. Larval host plant type did not affect adult size. Larger males and females were more likely to mate. Low proportions of D. v. virgifera from refuge plants were found in 5% seed blend refuges. CONCLUSION: Seed blend refuges can help to facilitate gene flow between D. v. virgifera beetles from Bt and refuge maize, but current approaches do not meaningfully contribute to delaying resistance because numbers of refuge beetles produced are insufficient. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aDiabrotica virgifera virgifera 3aadults 3acorn 3aevolution 3afemales 3agene flow 3agene pool 3ahost plants 3ainsect resistance 3ainsects 3aisotope labeling 3alarvae 3amales 3apest management 3aresistance management 3astable isotopes 3atoxins 3atransgenic plants1 aKrupke, Christian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3507-32100 tPest management science.g2018 Sept., v. 74, no. 9 p.2195-2203dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl59519x1526-498X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.49273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02230naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245007200159300001400231520124200245592002801487650002201515650002101537650001001558650001001568650002701578650001301605650002501618650001301643650001201656650002201668700002001690773012001710856004101830852000901871655001201880IND50066148320221121184955.0130502e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006614832DNAL7 a10.1007/BF033234392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoundal, Vikas10aMicroRNA-based RNA Interference Vector for Gene Silencing in Plants  ap. 79-82.  aRNA interference (RNAi) is a powerful tool for functional gene analysis, which has been successfully used to down-regulate the levels of specific target genes. In this study a microRNA 159a-based binary vector was constructed which can be used for hpRNA expression. Hairpin (hp) RNA expression cassettes carrying the gene sequences are typically constructed on binary plasmid and delivered into plant cells by Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation. This system allows simple insertion of 21- nt target gene sequences into microRNA backbone, to facilitate the processing of microRNA hpRNA by the endogenous machinery of host, thereby producing artificial microRNA carrying the sequence of target gene(s). The functionality of new vector system was tested by silencing viral gene in transgenic plants. Strong down regulation of viral gene was observed in virus infected tobacco plants transformed with pAmiR₁₅₉ vector. The processing of amIRNA leading to viral-specific sIRNA was confirmed by northern blotting. This vector system provides an important addition to the plant molecular biologists’ toolbox, which will significantly facilitate the use of RNAi technology for analyses of various gene functions in plant cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNorthern blotting 3aRNA interference 3acells 3agenes 3agenetic transformation 3amicroRNA 3anucleotide sequences 3aplasmids 3atobacco 3atransgenic plants1 aPraveen, Shelly0 tJournal of plant biochemistry and biotechnology.g2010 Jan., v. 19, no. 1 p.79-82dSpringer-Verlagx0971-78117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF03323439  aDNAL 7aarticle03243naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245010400162300001600266520168700282536036701969592002802336650001302364650001802377651001202395651001202407651001602419651001902435653002102454653002202475653001602497653001202513653001202525653001202537653001602549700001902565700001702584700002002601773011102621856008002732852000902812655001202821IND60620940120221120234026.0181114e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062094012DNAL7 a10.1177/00027642145664962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeer, Nasar10aExamining ‘Postmulticultural’ and Civic Turns in the Netherlands, Britain, Germany, and Denmark  ap. 702-726.  aThere is a widely shared view that the appeal of multiculturalism as a public policy has suffered considerable political damage. In many European states the turn to “civic” measures and discourses has been deemed more suitable for the objectives of minority integration and the promotion of preferred modes of social and political unity. It is therefore said that the first decade of the new century has been characterized by a reorientation in immigrant integration policies—from liberal culturalist to the “return of assimilation” (Brubaker, 2001), on route to a broader “retreat from multiculturalism” (Joppke, 2004). In this article, we argue that such portrayals mask a tendency that is more complicated in some cases and much less evident in others. To elaborate this, we offer a detailed account of the inception and then alleged movement away from positions in favor of multiculturalism in two countries that have adopted different versions of it, namely the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, and two countries that have historically rejected multiculturalism, namely Denmark and Germany. We argue that while there is undoubtedly a rhetorical separation between multiculturalism and civic integration, the latter is in some cases building on the former, and broadly needs to be understood as more than a retreat of multiculturalism. Taking seriously Banting and Kymlicka’s argument that understanding the evolution of integration requires the “the mind-set of an archaeologist,” we offer a policy genealogy that allows us to set the backlash against multiculturalism in context, in manner that explicates its provenance, permutations, and implications.  aFunding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

This work investigated the safening capacity of antioxidant enzymes in RR juvenile leaves following glyphosate treatment and examined cross tolerance to paraquat. RESULTS: Basal antioxidant enzyme activities were similar between glyphosate‐susceptible (GS) and RR biotypes. Lipid peroxidation was first detected in RR mature leaves at 8 h after treatment (HAT) and by 32 HAT was 5.3 and 21.1 times greater than that in RR juvenile leaves and GS leaves, respectively. Preceding lipid peroxidation in the RR biotype at 2 and 4 HAT, the only increase in enzymatic activity was observed in ascorbate‐glutathione cycle enzymes in RR juvenile leaves, particularly ascorbate peroxidase, dehydroascorbate reductase, and glutathione reductase. Sensitivity to paraquat was similar between biotypes. CONCLUSION: The RR biotype is not inherently more tolerant to oxidative stress. The difference in tissue damage between RR juvenile and mature leaves following glyphosate treatment is attributable at least partially to the transient increase in antioxidant enzyme expression in juvenile leaves (0–8 HAT), but may also be attributable to lower overall RR induction in juvenile leaves compared with mature leaves. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmbrosia trifida 3aantioxidants 3aascorbate peroxidase 3abiotypes 3aenzyme activity 3aglutathione dehydrogenase (ascorbate) 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3aglyphosate 3aherbicide resistance 3ajuveniles 3aleaves 3alipid peroxidation 3aoxidative stress 3aparaquat1 aNie, Haozhen1 aJiang, Yiwei1 aYoung, Bryan G0 tPest management science.g2018 Sept., v. 74, no. 9 p.2125-2132dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl59519x1526-498X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.49093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03569naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245009900172300001400271520177800285592002802063650001302091650001402104650001802118650001602136650002102152650001402173650001502187650002602202650001202228650002002240650001602260650002602276650001402302650000902316650001502325650001802340650000902358650001402367650000902381650001502390650001102405653000802416653002402424653001702448653003102465653001402496700002102510700002302531700002102554700002102575700002402596700001802620700002002638700002302658700002502681700001702706773010202723856008502825852000902910655001202919IND60535626320221121030040.0190408e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053562632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2014.02.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFuchs, Jacques G.10aEvaluation of the causes of legume yield depression syndrome using an improved diagnostic tool  ap. 26-36.  aThe aim of the study was to establish a diagnostic tool to narrow down the causes for pea yield depressions. A differential two-level diagnostic test system was established under controlled conditions using peas (Pisum sativum L.) as test plants. Soils from 22 organically managed sites with unexplained moderate to high pea yield losses were tested in level 1 diagnostics (γ-irradiation to eliminate potentially harmful organisms, nutrient additions to compensate for potential nutrient deficiencies or activated charcoal amendment to bind and thereby to immobilize potentially phytotoxic compounds). Results showed that organisms harmful to the test plant were the primary cause of limited germination and growth in most of the sampled soils, whereas a positive effect of nutrient addition was rarely found and toxins were not involved. Level 2 diagnostics (pesticides targeting ascomycetes, oomycetes, Rhizoctonia spp., nematodes) further narrowed down the organisms involved in yield depressions. Oomycetes were identified as the primary reason for limited germination rates, and, in some soils, also for limited growth of established seedlings. In other soils, a multitude rather than a single group of pathogens was involved in limited growth. Plant-pathogenic nematodes were never found to be limiting for crop growth parameters. Harmful effects of pesticides were found in several soils, hinting at an important role of beneficial soil organisms in the suppression of pathogens causing yield depression in legumes. The bioassay used in the present study was robust and could thus serve as a low-cost tool for agricultural advisors and farmers to predict the risk of yield losses in legumes and to narrow down causes, helping them to develop appropriate strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNematoda 3aOomycetes 3aPisum sativum 3aRhizoctonia 3aactivated carbon 3abioassays 3acrop yield 3adiagnostic techniques 3afarmers 3agamma radiation 3agermination 3anutrient deficiencies 3apathogens 3apeas 3apesticides 3aphytotoxicity 3arisk 3aseedlings 3asoil 3asoil biota 3atoxins 0aPea 0aOrganic agriculture 0aSoil fatigue 0aSoil-borne plant pathogens 0aOomycetes1 aThuerig, Barbara1 aBrandhuber, Robert1 aBruns, Christian1 aFinckh, Maria R.1 aFließbach, Andreas1 aMäder, Paul,1 aSchmidt, Harald1 aVogt-Kaute, Werner1 aWilbois, Klaus-Peter1 aLucius, Tamm0 tApplied soil ecology.g2014 July, v. 79 p.26-36dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl55717x0929-13937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2014.02.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01882naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002000148242006400168245006400232300001400296520075800310592002801068650002601096650000901122650001601131650001701147650002101164650003201185650003001217650001701247650000901264650001201273773015401285856008401439852000901523655001201532IND4504654520221120220703.0141112e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||fre||7 aIND450465452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anicom.2012.04.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeaufils, J.-P.10aHemolytic anemia in a dog infected by Mycoplasma haemocanis10aHemolytic anemia in a dog infected by Mycoplasma haemocanis  ap. 43-47.  aA dog was presented one year after splenectomy, with a hemolytic anaemia, probably initiated by Mycoplasma haemocanis.

In most cases, existing leachate quantification measures only take into account one source – precipitation, which resulted in serious underestimation in China due to its waste properties: high moisture contents. To overcome this problem, a new estimation method was established considering two sources: (1) precipitation infiltrated throughout waste layers, which was simulated with the HELP model, (2) water squeezed out of the waste itself, which was theoretically calculated using actual data of Chinese waste. The two sources depended on climate conditions and waste characteristics, respectively, which both varied in different regions. In this study, 31 Chinese cities were investigated and classified into three geographic regions according to landfill leachate generation performance: northwestern China (China-NW) with semi-arid and temperate climate and waste moisture content of about 46.0%, northern China (China-N) with semi-humid and temperate climate and waste moisture content of about 58.2%, and southern China (China-S) with humid and sub-tropical/tropical climate and waste moisture content of about 58.2%. In China-NW, accumulated leachate amounts were very low and mainly the result of waste degradation, implying on-site spraying/irrigation or recirculation may be an economic approach to treatment. In China-N, water squeezed out of waste by compaction totaled 22–45% of overall leachate amounts in the first 40years, so decreasing the initial moisture content of waste arriving at landfills could reduce leachate generation. In China-S, the leachate generated by infiltrated precipitation after HDPE geomembranes in top cover started failing, contributed more than 60% of the overall amounts over 100years of landfilling. Therefore, the quality and placing of HDPE geomembranes in the top cover should be controlled strictly for the purpose of mitigation leachate generation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3airrigation 3alandfill leachates 3alandfills 3amodels 3amunicipal solid waste 3apolyethylene 3aspraying 3atemperate zones 3avariance 3awater content 3aChina 0aMunicipal solid waste 0aLeachate generation 0aHydrological modelling 0aPrecipitation infiltration 0aWaste water squeezing 0aRegional variation1 aDamgaard, Anders1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0452-12201 aKjeldsen, Peter1 aShao, Li-Ming1 aHe, Pin-Jing0 tWaste management.g2015 Dec., v. 46 p.362-372dElsevier Ltdx0956-053X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.09.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03689naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003200150245006900182300001400251520206000265592002802325650001502353650002902368650002102397650001502418650001502433650001202448650002302460650002302483650002202506650001502528650001302543650001302556650001702569650000902586650002202595651001102617653001602628653001702644653002902661653002302690653001202713653002402725700002602749700003102775700002602806700002602832700002202858700005902880773010202939856008503041852000903126655001203135IND60535626420221121051354.0190408e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053562642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2014.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBartz, Marie Luise Carolina10aEarthworm richness in land-use systems in Santa Catarina, Brazil  ap. 59-70.  aBrazil is a megadiverse country from which around 10% of all species are known. However, many areas in Brazil have not been adequately studied, particularly for soil animals. This includes the state of Santa Catarina, where only 18 of the approximately 300 known Brazilian earthworm species occur, and where very little is known of the impacts of land use management on earthworm populations (density and diversity). Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate earthworm species richness in five different land-use systems (LUS) with increasing anthropogenic impact: native forest (NF), eucalyptus plantation (EP), pasture (PA), integrated crop-livestock (ICL) and no-tillage cropping (NT), in six counties, three each from the Western and Plateau regions of the state. Nine monoliths of 25cm×25cm×20cm depth were sampled at each site and worms hand sorted. Qualitative samples were also taken by digging at least 20 holes per site to improve the likelihood of collecting rare species. Samples were taken in the Winter and Summer months of 2011–2012 (July–August 2011, December 2011–January 2012). Contrary to expectations, species richness was higher in LUS with higher (ICL and NT=15 and 17 spp.) vs. lower anthropogenic impacts (EP, PA, NF=9–10 spp.), mainly due to the presence of exotic species in the cropping systems. Native species predominated in PA and NF, although natives were also found in highly disturbed ecosystems (NT, ICL) and in the West region all worms collected in NT were native. In total 24 species were identified in all LUS, with 19 native species, including several that were new to science. Several species were collected exclusively in each region, and overall qualitative samples yielded 24 species while quantitative samples only 16. Therefore, qualitative sampling appears to be more effective in determining earthworm species richness at regional levels, although quantitative samples are a useful addition when LUS are compared within a region, and if abundance and diversity index calculations are needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus 3aanthropogenic activities 3acropping systems 3aearthworms 3aecosystems 3aforests 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3aland use planning 3ano-tillage 3apastures 3aplateaus 3arare species 3asoil 3aspecies diversity 3aBrazil 0aOligochaeta 0aBiodiversity 0aLand-use intensification 0aAgricultural sites 0aPasture 0aAtlantic rainforest1 aBrown, George Gardner1 ada Rosa, Marcio Gonçalves1 aFilho, Osmar Klauberg1 aJames, Samuel Wooster1 aDecaëns, Thibaud1 aBaretta, Dilmar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9088-54840 tApplied soil ecology.g2014 Nov., v. 83 p.59-70dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl55717x0929-13937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2014.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02410naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245006900168520117100237592002801408650001601436650001001452650001201462650001601474650001101490650001201501650001401513650001701527650000901544650003501553650001401588700001901602700001801621700001701639700001701656700002001673700001901693700001701712700002001729773013401749856008401883852000901967655001201976IND60757558920221122033031.0211125e20211118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075755892DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture111111622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Lianping 10aSLL1-ZH Regulates Spikelets Architecture and Grain Yield in Rice  aThe spikelet developmental processes that control structure and floral organ identity play critical roles in rice grain yield formation. In this study, we characterized a novel rice mutant, SLL1-ZH, which exhibits a variety of defective agronomic characters, including semi-dwarf, rolling leaf, deformed panicles, and reduced grains production. Morphological analysis also revealed that the SLL1-ZH mutant shows numerous defects of floral organs, such as cracked glumes, hooked and thin lemmas, shrunken but thickened paleas, an indeterminate number of stamens and stigmas, and heterotopic ovaries. Map-based cloning identified a single nucleotide substitution (C to G) in the first exon of LOC_Os09g23200 that is responsible for the SLL1-ZH phenotype. In addition, qPCR analysis showed a significant change in the relative expression of SLL1-ZH in the mutant during inflorescence differentiation and in the different floral organs. Transcription of rice floral organ development-related factors also changed significantly in the mutant. Therefore, our results suggested that SLL1-ZH plays a great role in plant growth, spikelet development, and grain yield in rice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3aexons 3aflowers 3agrain yield 3aleaves 3amutants 3aphenotype 3aplant growth 3arice 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aspikelets1 aWang, Jingxin 1 aWen, Xiaoxia 1 aPeng, Zequn 1 aChen, Daibo 1 aZhang, Yingxin 1 aCheng, Shihua 1 aCao, Liyong 1 aZhan, Xiaodeng 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2021 Nov. 18, v. 11, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture111111623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03165naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005800142245010100200520176400301592002802065596003402093596003602127650002202163650002702185650001602212650001302228650001202241650000902253650001502262650002602277650001202303650001602315650002602331650001802357650001302375650001702388651001202405700006102417700006102478773010702539856007602646852000902722655001202731IND60637799220221123032851.0190424e20190407xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063779922DNAL7 a10.1155/2019/81596712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoltani, Nader1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8687-437110aWeed Control in Corn and Soybean with Group 15 (VLCFA Inhibitor) Herbicides Applied Preemergence  aLimited information exists on the efficacy of pethoxamid for annual grass and broadleaf control in corn and soybean in Ontario. A total of 10 field experiments (5 with corn and 5 with soybean) were conducted during 2015 to 2017 in Ontario, Canada, to compare the weed control efficacy of dimethenamid-P at 544 g·ai·ha⁻¹, pethoxamid at 840 g·ai·ha⁻¹, pyroxasulfone at 100 g·ai·ha⁻¹, and S-metolachlor at 1050 g·ai·ha⁻¹ applied preemergence (PRE). Reduced weed interference with pyroxasulfone and dimethenamid-P resulted in corn yield that was similar to the weed-free control; however, weed interference with pethoxamid and S-metolachlor reduced corn yield 28 and 33%, respectively. Reduced weed interference with pyroxasulfone resulted in soybean yield that was similar to the weed-free control; however, weed interference with pethoxamid, dimethenamid-P, and S-metolachlor reduced soybean yield 27, 27, and 30%, respectively. At 4 and 8 weeks after application (WAA), all VLCFA inhibitor herbicides (Group 15) provided excellent redroot pigweed control (90 to 99%) in corn. There were no differences in common ragweed control, density, and dry weight among the VLCFA inhibitor herbicide evaluated; pyroxasulfone provided highest numeric common ragweed control and lowest numeric density and dry weight. At 4 and 8 WAA, pyroxasulfone provided the best common lambsquarters and wild mustard control and lowest numeric density and dry weight in corn and soybean. At 8 WAA, the VLCFA inhibitor herbicides controlled green foxtail 91 to 96% in corn; dimethenamid-P provided better control of green foxtail than pethoxamid in soybean.

Experimental data revealed that all estimated constants including kinetic rate constant of magnetite formation, first order rate constant of goethite reductive dissolution and Langmuir sorption capacity of FeII onto goethite followed the order G1>G2~G3, which is in agreement with the calculated site density. The high intrinsic reactivity of G1 emphasizes the importance of crystal faces reactivity for the transformation process. The presence of specific crystal faces (e.g. (021) or (121)) may favor the formation of inner-sphere complexes and therefore the electron transfer. Spectroscopic investigations suggested that partial conversion of goethite to magnetite may proceed via solid-state reaction, but dissolution/re-crystallization process cannot be fully excluded. The coordination of FeII at goethite surface via the formation of bidentate or tridentate complex is a prerequisite to electron transfer, a key step to initiate solid-state transformation process or reductive dissolution reaction. The presence of strong chelating ligand (e.g. phosphate) is expected to hinder the adsorption sites and therefore affect both topotactic and reconstructive processes. Microscopic level characterizations such as crystal structure and surface site density are therefore required to describe the transformation extent of iron oxides.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystal structure 3agoethite 3aelectron transfer 3amagnetite 3aspectroscopy 3aadsorption 0aSorption 0aMagnetite 0airon oxides 0aDissolution 0aGoethite 0aTransformation1 aAbdelmoula, M.1 aFaure, P.1 aRuby, C.1 aHanna K.,0 tGeoderma.g2013 Apr., v. 197-198 p.9-16dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2012.12.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02374naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002600146245004900172300001800221520123200239536012201471592002801593650001101621650001101632650001601643650002201659650001701681651001801698653001601716653002001732653001101752700002001763700002601783773011401809856008001923852000902003655001202012IND60620940720221120234044.0181114e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062094072DNAL7 a10.1177/00027642145665022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDouglas, Karen Manges10aImmigration in the Era of Color-Blind Racism  ap. 1429-1451.  aFor most of the history of the United States, race played an explicit role in immigration laws that designated only Whites (and later Blacks) as eligible for U.S. citizenship. Today, however, we are in a new era in race relations—one that Eduardo Bonilla-Silva refers to as “colorblind racism.” Color-blind racism provides a critical perspective for understanding the enduring role of race in immigration practices in the post–Civil Rights era. This article illustrates this enduring reality within immigration policies and practices utilizing the color-blind perspective. We begin by summarizing the key tenets of Bonilla-Silva’s color-blind racism. We then overview immigration policies and practices in effect during the era of explicit racialization. Next, we contrast policies and practices with the more subtle employment of racialization today. The bulk of our article is devoted to illustrating how the racialized impact of immigration policies and procedures serves as a mechanism for the reproduction of color blindness and a racially unequal social order. We conclude with a discussion on the difficulties of grappling with this reality in a racially stratified society that is reluctant to acknowledge it.  aFunding The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBlacks 3aWhites 3aimmigration 3aissues and policy 3areproduction 3aUnited States 0aimmigration 0acolor blindness 0aracism1 aSaenz, Rogelio,1 aMurga, Aurelia Lorena0 tAmerican behavioral scientist.g, v. 59, no. 11 p.1429-1451dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2328x1552-33817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00027642145665023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03265naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245010400174300001800278520192700296592002802223650002202251650002302273650001702296650001602313650001702329650001602346650001102362650001902373650001902392650002102411650002802432650001202460650000702472650002002479650001802499650003102517650001302548650001502561700002802576700002002604773011902624856005502743852000902798655001202807IND4510072920221120231122.0150730e20010701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451007292DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1432-1327.2001.02282.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeers, Paul M. M.10aModulation of the lipid binding properties of the Nâterminal domain of human apolipoprotein E3  ap. 3728-3735.  aApolipoprotein E (apoE) plays a critical role in plasma lipid homeostasis through its function as a ligand for the lowâdensity lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family. Receptor recognition is mediated by residues 130â150 in the independently folded, 22âkDa Nâterminal (NT) domain. This elongated globular fourâhelix bundle undergoes a conformational change upon interaction with an appropriateÂ lipid surface. Unlike other apolipoproteins, apoE3 NT failed to fully protect human LDL from aggregation induced by treatment with phospholipaseâC. Likewise, in dimyristoylglycerophosphocholine (Myr2GroâPCho) vesicle transformation assays, 100âÂµg apoE3 NT induced only 15% reduction in vesicle (250âÂµg) light scattering intensity after 30âmin. ApoE3 NT interaction with modified lipoprotein particles or Myr2GroâPCho vesicles was concentrationâdependent whereas the vesicle transformation reaction was unaffected by buffer ionic strength. In studies with the anionic phospholipid dimyristoylglycerophosphoglycerol, apoE3 NTâmediated vesicle transformation rates were enhanced >â10âfold compared with Myr2GroâPCho and activity decreased with increasing buffer ionic strength. Solution pH had a dramatic effect on the kinetics of apoE3 NTâmediated Myr2GroâPCho vesicle transformation with increased rates observed as a function of decreasing pH. Fluorescence studies with a single tryptophan containing apoE3 NT mutant (L155W) revealed increased solvent exposure of the protein interior at pH values below 4.0. Similarly, fluorescent dye binding experiments with 8âanilinoâ1ânaphthalene sulfonate revealed increased exposure of apoE3 NT hydrophobic interior as a function of decreasing pH. These studies indicate that apoE3 NT lipid binding activity is modulated by lipid surface properties and protein tertiary structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapolipoprotein E3 3abinding properties 3ablood lipids 3adye binding 3afluorescence 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3ahydrophobicity 3aionic strength 3alight scattering 3alow density lipoprotein 3amutants 3apH 3aphospholipase C 3aphospholipids 3aprotein tertiary structure 3asolvents 3atryptophan1 aNarayanaswami, Vasanthy1 aRyan, Robert O.0 tEuropean journal of biochemistry.g2001 July 1, v. 268, no. 13 p.3728-3735dBlackwell Science Ltdx0014-29567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1432-1327.2001.02282.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03554naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100003000155245019600185300001600381520178800397592002802185650001702213650002302230650002802253650001502281650001502296650001302311650001602324650001902340650001202359650001502371650001902386650001802405650001502423650002902438650001902467650001502486650001302501653001902514653002102533653002402554653001302578653004702591700002502638700002602663700002902689700002302718700002402741700002302765700002502788773007702813856008902890852000902979655001202988IND60570571120221117222708.0170708e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057057112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.06.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuraishi, Khurrum Shehzad10aIonic liquids toxicity on fresh water microalgae, Scenedesmus quadricauda, Chlorella vulgaris &Botryococcus braunii; selection criterion for use in a two-phase partitioning bioreactor (TPPBR)  ap. 642-651.  aA promising method of Carbon dioxide (CO2) valorization is to use green microalgae photosynthesis to process biofuel. Two Phase Partitioning Bioreactors (TPPBR) offer the possibility to use non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPL) to enhance CO2 solubility; thus making CO2 available to maximize algae growth. This requires relatively less toxic hydrophobic Ionic Liquids (ILs) that comprise a new class of ionic compounds with remarkable physicochemical properties and thus qualifies them as NAPL candidates. This paper concerns the synthesis of ILs with octyl and butyl chains as well as different cations containing aromatic (imidazolium, pyridinium) and non-aromatic (piperidinum, pyrrolidinium) rings for CO2 absorption studies. The authors measured their respective toxicity levels on microalgae species, specifically, Scenedesmus quadricauda, Chlorella vulgaris and Botryococcus braunii.Results revealed that octyl-based ILs were more toxic than butyl-based analogues. Such was the case for bmim-PF6 at double saturation with an absorbance of 0.11, compared to Omim-PF6 at 0.17, bmim-NTf2 at 0.02, and Omim-NTf2 at 0.14, respectively. CO2 uptake results for ILs bearing octyl-based chains compared to the butyl analog were 54% (nCO2/nIL) (i.e., moles of CO2 moles of IL) and 38% (nCO2/nIL), respectively.Conclusively, 1-butyl-1-methylpiperidinium absorbed 13% (nCO2/nIL) and appeared the least toxic, having an absorbance of 0.25 at 688 nm (double saturation at 7 d) compared to 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium, which showed the highest toxicity with zero absorbance. Accordingly, these findings suggest that 1-butyl-1-methylpiperidinium is capable of transporting CO2 to a system containing green microalgae without causing significant harm; thus allowing its use in TPPBR technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBotryococcus 3aChlorella vulgaris 3aScenedesmus quadricauda 3aabsorbance 3aabsorption 3abiofuels 3abioreactors 3acarbon dioxide 3acations 3afreshwater 3ahydrophobicity 3aionic liquids 3amicroalgae 3anonaqueous phase liquids 3aphotosynthesis 3asolubility 3atoxicity 0aCarbon dioxide 0aGreen microalgae 0aIonic liquids (ILs) 0aToxicity 0aTwo-phase partitioning bio reactor (TPPBR)1 aBustam, Mohamad Azmi1 aKrishnan, Sooridarsan1 aAminuddin, Noor Fathanah1 aAzeezah, Noraisyah1 aGhani, Noraini Abd.1 aUemura, Yoshimitsu1 aLévêque, Jean Marc0 tChemosphere.g2017 Oct., v. 184 p.642-651dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.06.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02478naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005800146245011500204300001800319520104500337592002801382650001401410650001701424650002301441650001401464650002801478650004301506650001201549650001501561650001601576650001801592650000901610650001701619650001001636653001801646653001701664653001501681653001701696700001601713700001301729700001701742700001201759773014801771856008001919852000901999655001202008IND60604933920221119002401.0180718e20180620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060493392DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.8b021022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yinghuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6940-571410aMetabolism Distribution and Effect of Thiamethoxam after Oral Exposure in Mongolian Racerunner (Eremias argus)  ap. 7376-7383.  aSystematic evaluation of the metabolism, distribution, and effect of thiamethoxam in Mongolian racerunner (Eremias argus) was carried out after oral exposure. HPLC equipped with Q Exactive focus was used for identification and concentration analysis of thiamethoxam and its metabolites. Percutaneous and urine excretions were the primary ways for the elimination of thiamethoxam and its metabolites, and the limiting factor was urine output. Demethylated thiamethoxam and clothianidin were the main metabolites of thiamethoxam in lizards. CYP3A4, CYP3A7, and CYP2C9 played a crucial role in the metabolism process. Aldehyde oxidase only dominated the nitro-reduction process of demethylated thiamethoxam and clothianidin. Glutathione S-transferase might be related to the clearance process of thiamethoxam and its metabolites. The findings indicated that thiamethoxam might pose potential carcinogenic and hepatic injury risk to lizards.

However, considerable cost and high reaction temperatures are commonly required. Alternatively, photo-SCR working at low temperature has attracted widespread interest. In the present work, Pr₁₋ₓCeₓFeO₃/palygorskite (Pal) nanocomposite was synthesized by an in situ sol-gel method. Results indicate that Pr₁₋ₓCeₓFeO₃ remain as a perovskite solid solution uniformly immobilized on the surface of Pal when x is less than 0.05. CeO₂ co-precipitates with Pr₁₋ₓCeₓFeO₃ when x is beyond 0.05, leading to an enhanced charge separation induced by the formation of intimate direct Z-scheme heterostructure of Pr₁₋ₓCeₓFeO₃/CeO₂, which is unraveled by the photoluminescence spectroscopy and Mott-Schottky analysis and further verified by the DFT calculations. Under visible light irradiation, the influence of the doping amount of Ce (from 0.05 to 0.5) on the NO conversion and N₂ selectivity was investigated. The Pr₀.₇Ce₀.₃FeO₃/Pal was found to achieve the highest NO conversion rate of 92% and 99% N₂ selectivity. In addition, the SO₂ and H₂O resistance experiment show that the doping of Ce could benefit the formation of cerium sulphate which prevents NH₃ from being sulfated by SO₂ while Pal prevents the catalysts from being corroded by H₂O, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3acatalysts 3aceric oxide 3acerium 3aindustry 3airradiation 3ananocomposites 3anitric oxide 3apalygorskite 3aphotoluminescence 3asol-gel processing 3aspectroscopy 3asulfates 3asulfur dioxide 3atemperature 3atitanium 3avanadium 0aPalygorskite 0aPerovskite 0aCeO2 0aDirect Z-scheme 0aPhoto-SCR 0aDenitrification1 aShi, Haiyang1 aYan, Xiangyu1 aZuo, Shixiang1 aZhang, Yuying1 aChen, Qun1 aYao, Chao1 aNi, Chaoying0 tJournal of catalysis.g2019 Jan., v. 369 p.190-200dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2018.11.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03841naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245007500161300001800236520209000254592002802344650002202372650001902394650002502413650002702438650001802465650002202483650002902505650001402534650001102548650002102559650001702580650001702597650002702614650002302641650001302664650002002677650001202697650002002709650002202729650001602751700001902767700001902786700005902805700002002864700001802884700002002902700007002922700006302992773014703055856007603202852000903278655001203287IND60695933420221118235442.0200520e20200429xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069593342DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.9b134502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGupta, Chitrak10aCharge Transfer and Chemo-Mechanical Coupling in Respiratory Complex I  ap. 9220-9230.  aThe mitochondrial respiratory chain, formed by five protein complexes, utilizes energy from catabolic processes to synthesize ATP. Complex I, the first and the largest protein complex of the chain, harvests electrons from NADH to reduce quinone, while pumping protons across the mitochondrial membrane. Detailed knowledge of the working principle of such coupled charge-transfer processes remains, however, fragmentary due to bottlenecks in understanding redox-driven conformational transitions and their interplay with the hydrated proton pathways. Complex I from Thermus thermophilus encases 16 subunits with nine iron–sulfur clusters, reduced by electrons from NADH. Here, employing the latest crystal structure of T. thermophilus complex I, we have used microsecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations to study the chemo-mechanical coupling between redox changes of the iron–sulfur clusters and conformational transitions across complex I. First, we identify the redox switches within complex I, which allosterically couple the dynamics of the quinone binding pocket to the site of NADH reduction. Second, our free-energy calculations reveal that the affinity of the quinone, specifically menaquinone, for the binding-site is higher than that of its reduced, menaquinol form—a design essential for menaquinol release. Remarkably, the barriers to diffusive menaquinone dynamics are lesser than that of the more ubiquitous ubiquinone, and the naphthoquinone headgroup of the former furnishes stronger binding interactions with the pocket, favoring menaquinone for charge transport in T. thermophilus. Our computations are consistent with experimentally validated mutations and hierarchize the key residues into three functional classes, identifying new mutation targets. Third, long-range hydrogen-bond networks connecting the quinone-binding site to the transmembrane subunits are found to be responsible for proton pumping. Put together, the simulations reveal the molecular design principles linking redox reactions to quinone turnover to proton translocation in complex I.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aThermus thermophilus 3aadenosine triphosphate 3abinding sites 3acrystal structure 3aelectron transport chain 3aelectrons 3aenergy 3ahydrogen bonding 3amenaquinones 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial membrane 3amolecular dynamics 3amutation 3anaphthoquinones 3aprotons 3aredox reactions 3asimulation models 3aubiquinones1 aKhaniya, Umesh1 aChan, Chun Kit1 aDehez, Francois1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8076-62221 aShekhar, Mrinal1 aGunner, M.

Toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) was used to quantify the metal mobility after soil treatment. The structural parameters of modified bentonites, including the BET surface area, basal spacing and zeta potential were obtained as a function of the TMA and DTMA loading at 40, 80, 120, 160 and 200% of the bentonite's cation exchange capacity, respectively. The results indicated that the characteristics of the organo-bentonites fundamentally varied depending on the species and concentration of modifiers loaded on bentonite. T-Bents and D-Bents manifested distinct immobilization effectiveness towards various metals. In association with the organo-bentonite characteristics, the main interactive mechanisms for Cu, Zn and Cd proceeded via cation exchange, Hg proceeded via physical adsorption and partitioning, Cr and As proceeded via specific adsorption and electrostatic attraction, respectively. This study provided operational and mechanistic basis for optimizing the organic clay synthesis and selecting as the appropriate amendment for remediation of heavy metal contaminated soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aarsenic 3abentonite 3acadmium 3acation exchange 3acation exchange capacity 3achromium 3aclay 3acopper 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aheavy metals 3aleaching 3amercury 3aremediation 3asoil treatment 3asurface area 3atetramethylammonium compounds 3atoxicity 3azeta potential 3azinc 0aOrgano-bentonite 0aSoil 0aHeavy metal 0aStabilization1 aXu, Jian1 aJiang, Xiaohong1 aLiu, Cun1 aMcCall, Wesley1 aLu, Jinlong0 tChemosphere.g2017 Oct., v. 184 p.884-891dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.06.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02219naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245007200164300001600236520076100252592002801013650001001041650001401051650001401065650001701079650001101096650001001107650001601117650002301133650001001156650001201166653001901178653002301197653002001220653001001240653001101250653001401261700002401275700001801299700002101317700001901338700001801357700002501375700002601400700002101426700002601447773014001473856007901613852000901692655001201701IND60720264720221119192101.0210822e20130901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072026472DNAL7 a10.2478/bvip-2013-00622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuzek, Dominika10aWild boar meat sensory attributes contributing general meat quality  ap. 357-363.  aThe purpose of the study was to establish relationship between different sensory attributes of wild boar meat, as well as to develop a prediction model of sensory attributes demanded. The sensory analysis of 40 samples of wild boar meat (the loin) was performed. For wild boar meat, tenderness, juiciness, colour, taste, aroma, and off-flavours are significantly correlated with general quality of meat, assessed by the sensory panel. The results from the study indicate that wild boar meat reveals characteristic sensory traits; however, texture as well as off-flavours do not play an important role in creating general quality, but the most important factors influencing the general quality of wild boar meat included juiciness, colour, taste, and aroma.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolor 3agame meat 3ajuiciness 3ameat quality 3amodels 3aodors 3aoff flavors 3asensory evaluation 3ataste 3atexture 0awild boar meat 0asensory attributes 0ageneral quality 0aaroma 0acolour 0ajuiciness1 aGłąbska, Dominika1 aPlewa, Paweł1 aKozań, Karolina1 aPietras, Jacek1 aPlewa, Rafał1 aPogorzelska, Ewelina1 aPogorzelski, Grzegorz1 aTrajer, Jędrzej1 aWierzbicka, Agnieszka0 tBulletin of the Veterinary Institute in Puławy =.g2013 Sept. 01, v. 57, no. 3 p.357-363dSciendowJournal:J000000137x2300-32357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/bvip-2013-00623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01059naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002200112245007100134300001600205520019500221592002800416650001000444650001100454650001600465650000900481651000900490653001000499653001700509653001600526653001500542653000900557700002600566773013200592852000900724655001200733IND60477718120221121110609.0160105e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047771812DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaboori, Alireza,12aA new species of larval Abrolophus (Acari: Erythraeidae) from Iran  ap. 149-154.  aAbrolophus iraninejadi sp. nov.

Solar water heating (SWH) systems can help save up to 90% of the utilized energy for water heating. In this study, a compound parabolic concentrator (CPC) solar collector has been coupled to three different configurations of TES system. A comprehensive analysis on the effects of PCMs arrangements in TES systems viz three PCMs (case 1) and five PCMs (case 2) on the energy efficiency, exergy efficiency, and overall loss coefficient of the solar collector and TES system has been made and compared with sensible TES system. An experimental data showed an augmented energy storage of 12% and 41% in “case 1” and “case 2” over sensible TES system as a result of reduction in heat losses with the cascaded arrangement of PCMs. The collector paired with case 2 configuration clearly exhibited a higher exergy efficiency due to supply of heat transfer fluid at relatively lower temperature while compared to other TES configurations. The outcomes of this study reveal the key role of cascaded arrangement of PCMs for enhancing energy and exergy efficiencies of solar collector.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy efficiency 3aexergy 3aheat transfer 3apollution 3aresearch 3asolar collectors 3asolar radiation 3atemperature 3athermal energy1 aKumaresan, Vellaisamy1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3309-291X0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Aug., v. 29, no. 40 p.61135-61147dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-20209-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02169naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245015100163300001600314520081200330592002801142650002501170650001201195650001501207650001601222650001701238650002701255650001701282650002001299650001701319650002101336650002501357653000901382653001901391653002501410653002101435653001301456700001901469700001901488773014001507856007901647852000901726655001201735IND60720264920221119192050.0210822e20130901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072026492DNAL7 a10.2478/bvip-2013-00642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalikci, Engin10aSelected acute phase proteins, oxidative stress biomarkers, and antioxidants in aborting and non-aborting goats infected with Border disease virus  ap. 371-374.  aGoats were grouped into three health categories based on the clinically and serologically proven cases: infected nonaborting (group A) (n = 10), infected aborting (group B) (n = 10), and non-infected (group C) (n = 10).

In this study, a total of 32 ejaculates were collected from four Kordian bucks (8 ejaculates for each buck). On the day of semen collection, four ejaculates (one ejaculate for each buck) were pooled and diluted with egg yolk Tris-based extenders containing 0 (E0), 2 (E2), 4 (E4), and 6 (E6) percent of rosemary aqueous extract. After thawing, sperm motility (computer-assisted sperm motility analysis (CASA)), membrane integrity (eosin/nigrosin) and functionality (Hypoosmotic swelling (HOS) test), abnormal morphology, lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde (MDA) production), capacitation status (Chlortetracycline (CTC)), mitochondrial activity (rhodamine-123) and apoptotic features (Annexin V/propidium iodide) were assessed. The results showed that E4 extender significantly improved total (45.71±1.49) and progressive (24.86±0.84) motility, functional membrane (47.18±1.37), and integrity (49.25±1.17) of post-thawed buck spermatozoa when compared to E0 (36.43±1.49, 18.43±0.84, 39.42±1.37 and 41.32±1.17, respectively) and E6 (30.43±1.49, 16.29±0.84, 34.54±1.37 and 36.39±1.17, respectively) extenders. Moreover, spermatozoa with abnormal morphology were significantly increased in E6 (22.5±1.07) compared to E2 (17.29±1.07) and E4 (16.11±1.07) extenders. The results showed that only E2 (1.69±0.08) extender significantly decreased the level of MDA formation when compared to E0 (2.04±0.08) and E4 (2.03±0.08) extender. In this study, different level of rosemary aqueous extract failed to alter the CTC staining patterns and the mitochondrial activity of post-thawed buck spermatozoa. Moreover, E4 extender significantly increased live (55.92±2.97) and decreased dead (22.64±3.37) spermatozoa compared to other extenders. In conclusion, addition of rosemary aqueous extract at level of 4% can improve post-thawed buck spermatozoa quality. More studies are required to reveal the active components in rosemary extract.  aPublisher supplied data 3abucks 3achlortetracycline 3acryopreservation 3aegg yolk 3aiodides 3alipid peroxidation 3amalondialdehyde 3arosemary 3asemen 3asperm motility 3aspermatozoa 3athawing 0aRosemary 0aFreezing 0aBuck 0aSperm1 aZhandi, Mahdi1 aZare-Shahneh, Ahmad1 aNajafi, Abozar1 aMahdi Nabi, Mohammad1 aMohammadi-Sangcheshmeh, Abdullah0 tSmall ruminant research.g2013 Aug., v. 114, no. 1 p.120-125dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44843x0921-44887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2013.05.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02353naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245014500165300001600310520104500326592002801371650002501399650002701424650001801451650001101469650002601480650001801506650001501524650001501539650002101554653003101575653002501606653002101631653001701652700002101669700002001690700002201710773012401732856007801856852000901934655001201943IND60774672920221121234624.0220422e20130901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077467292DNAL7 a10.1556/avet.2013.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPawlak, Krzysztof10aEffect of weak electromagnetic field on cardiac work, concentration of thyroid hormones and blood aminotransferase level in the chick embryo  ap. 383-392.  aThe aim of the study was to determine the effect of alternating electromagnetic field (EMF; 50 Hz frequency, 50 and 100 μT induction) on cardiac work of the chick embryo. Eggs from the experimental groups were exposed to EMF throughout incubation. During the experiment, heart rate (ballistocardiographic method), thyroxine (T₄) and triiodothyronine (T₃) concentrations, heart weight, ventricle wall thickness, and levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were determined. The results show, for the first time, that the exposure of chick embryos to EMF augments the heart rate, especially from 17 days of incubation. The increased heart rate in the embryos exposed to EMF was associated with considerable increases in plasma T₄ and T₃ concentrations, which were recorded during the final stage of embryogenesis. The significant effect of the 100-μT field on heart weight and blood AST levels in the embryos suggests that EMF has a direct effect on the physiological function of cardiac muscle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalanine transaminase 3aaspartate transaminase 3achick embryos 3achicks 3aelectromagnetic field 3aembryogenesis 3aheart rate 3amyocardium 3atriiodothyronine 0aWeak electromagnetic field 0aballistocardiography 0athyroid hormones 0achick embryo1 aSechman, Andrzej1 aNieckarz, Zenon1 aWojtysiak, Dorota0 tActa veterinaria Hungarica.g2013 Sept. 1, v. 61, no. 3 p.383-392dAkadémiai KiadówJournal:jnl35480x1588-27057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1556/avet.2013.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01844naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010900166300001600275520068900291592002800980650001401008650002001022650001201042650001101054653001001065653003001075653002501105653002101130700001501151700001101166700001801177700002201195700005901217773010201276856008301378852000901461655001201470IND60622602020221120222912.0210121e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062260202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2018.11.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Kaixuan12aA highly efficient and sulfur-tolerant Pd2Si/CNTs catalyst for hydrodesulfurization of dibenzothiophenes  ap. 363-371.  aA highly active and sulfur-tolerant 3 wt% Pd₂Si/CNTs catalyst was prepared by chemical vapor deposition, in which dichlorodimethylsilane was used as an Si source.

In addition to chemical analysis, the toxicity of the treated water during the treatment was monitored using a bioluminescence inhibition test and estrogenic and anti-estrogenic tests.The compounds 1H-benzotriazole (BTZ) and two tolyltriazoles (TTZs), 4-methyl-1H-benzotriazole (4-MBTZ) and 5-methyl-1H-benzotriazole (5-MBTZ), were present in the reverse osmosis concentrate at the highest concentrations (7.4 and 12.8 μg L−1, respectively) and were partially removed by the fungal treatment under sterile conditions (58% for BTZ and 92% for TTZs) and non-sterile conditions, although to lesser extents (32% for BTZ and 50% for TTZs).Individual biotransformation studies of BTZ and the TTZs by T. versicolor in a synthetic medium and further analysis via on-line turbulent flow chromatography coupled to an HRMS-Orbitrap allowed the tentative identification of the transformation products (TPs). Six TPs were postulated for BTZ, two TPs were postulated for 4-MBTZ, and four TPs were postulated for 5-MBTZ. Most of these TPs are suggested to have been generated by conjugation with some sugars and via the methylation of the triazole group. Only TP 148 A, postulated to be derived from the biotransformation of BTZ, was observed in the effluent of the bioreactor treating the reverse osmosis concentrate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoriolus versicolor 3aaseptic conditions 3abioluminescence 3abioreactors 3abiotransformation 3achemical analysis 3achromatography 3adecontamination 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3afungi 3amethylation 3amonitoring 3areverse osmosis 3asugars 3atoxicity 3atriazoles 3aturbulent flow 0aBenzotriazoles 0aReverse osmosis concentrate 0aTrametes versicolor 0aTransformation products 0aOn-line turbulent flow chromatography coupled to HRMS1 aBadia-Fabregat, Marina1 aRodríguez-Mozaz, Sara1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2962-81441 aCaminal, Glòria,1 aVicent, Teresa1 aBarceló, Damià,0 tChemosphere.g2017 Oct., v. 184 p.1054-1070dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.06.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04019naa a2200841 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002100186245005900207300002000266506007600286520155200362592002801914506003701942650001001979650001701989650002402006650001102030650002102041650002202062650001602084650002202100650001902122650001602141650001702157650001202174650001102186650001002197650002302207650001502230650001802245653001302263653002302276653002802299653001502327653000902342700002102351700001502372700002502387700001502412700001402427700002102441700001802462700001602480700002002496700003002516700001902546700002202565700001902587700002202606700002102628700002102649700001702670700002202687700002202709700002202731700001902753700002402772700002002796700002702816700001602843700002202859700002002881773017602901856007903077852000903156655001203165IND60173778120221207112617.0150603e20130813xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017377812DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.13115651102doi7 aPMC37469182pmcid7 a238981742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPanigrahy, Dipak10aEpoxyeicosanoids promote organ and tissue regeneration  ap. 13528-13533.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEpoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), lipid mediators produced by cytochrome P450 epoxygenases, regulate inflammation, angiogenesis, and vascular tone. Despite pleiotropic effects on cells, the role of these epoxyeicosanoids in normal organ and tissue regeneration remains unknown. EETs are produced predominantly in the endothelium. Normal organ and tissue regeneration require an active paracrine role of the microvascular endothelium, which in turn depends on angiogenic growth factors. Thus, we hypothesize that endothelial cells stimulate organ and tissue regeneration via production of bioactive EETs. To determine whether endothelial-derived EETs affect physiologic tissue growth in vivo, we used genetic and pharmacological tools to manipulate endogenous EET levels. We show that endothelial-derived EETs play a critical role in accelerating tissue growth in vivo, including liver regeneration, kidney compensatory growth, lung compensatory growth, wound healing, corneal neovascularization, and retinal vascularization. Administration of synthetic EETs recapitulated these results, whereas lowering EET levels, either genetically or pharmacologically, delayed tissue regeneration, demonstrating that pharmacological modulation of EETs can affect normal organ and tissue growth. We also show that soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitors, which elevate endogenous EET levels, promote liver and lung regeneration. Thus, our observations indicate a central role for EETs in organ and tissue regeneration and their contribution to tissue homeostasis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacids 3aangiogenesis 3acompensatory growth 3acornea 3acytochrome P-450 3aendothelial cells 3aendothelium 3aepoxide hydrolase 3agrowth factors 3ahomeostasis 3ainflammation 3akidneys 3alipids 3aliver 3aliver regeneration 3apleiotropy 3atissue repair 0aautacoid 0aorgan regeneration 0asmall molecule mediator 0aangiocrine 0aVEGF1 aKalish, Brian T.1 aHuang, Sui1 aBielenberg, Diane R.1 aLe, Hau D.1 aYang, Jun1 aEdin, Matthew L.1 aLee, Craig R.1 aBenny, Ofra1 aMudge, Dayna K.1 aButterfield, Catherine E.1 aMammoto, Akiko1 aMammoto, Tadanori1 aInceoglu, Bora1 aJenkins, Roger L.1 aSimpson, Mary A.1 aAkino, Tomoshige1 aLih, Fred B.1 aTomer, Kenneth B.1 aIngber, Donald E.1 aHammock, Bruce D.1 aFalck, John R.1 aManthati, Vijaya L.1 aKaipainen, Arja1 aD’Amore, Patricia A.1 aPuder, Mark1 aZeldin, Darryl C.1 aKieran, Mark W.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 Aug. 13, v. 110, no. 33 p.13528-13533dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.13115651103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02694naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245013800162300001600300520134000316592002801656650001601684650002601700650001801726650002001744650002001764650002001784650001001804653002601814653001601840653000801856653001001864653001901874700002001893700002101913700001801934700001901952700002301971700001901994700002402013773012402037856007802161852000902239655001202248IND60774673120221120171931.0220422e20140901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077467312DNAL7 a10.1556/avet.2014.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaleszka, Anna10aExpression of adiponectin receptors 1 and 2 in the ovary and concentration of plasma adiponectin during the oestrous cycle of the pig  ap. 386-396.  aThe aim of this study was to compare the expression levels of adiponectin receptor 1 and adiponectin receptor 2 mRNAs and proteins in porcine ovaries during four stages (days 2 to 3, 10 to 12, 14 to 16, 17 to 19) of the oestrous cycle and to measure adiponectin plasma concentrations during the same phases of the cycle. Higher mRNA expression of adiponectin receptor 1 was detected in porcine granulosa cells than in corpora lutea and theca cells (P < 0.01). In contrast, higher gene expression of adiponectin receptor 2 occurred in newly developed and mature corpora lutea (P < 0.01). The adiponectin receptor 1 protein content was the highest in corpora lutea isolated on days 2 to 3 of the cycle and was the lowest in theca interna cells (P < 0.01). The profile of adiponectin receptor 2 protein was similar to that of adiponectin receptor 1. Adiponectin plasma concentrations were significantly higher throughout the luteal phase than in the follicular phase (P < 0.01). In conclusion, the presence of adiponectin receptor 1 and adiponectin receptor 2 mRNAs and proteins in the porcine ovary suggests that adiponectin may directly affect ovarian functions through its own specific receptors. The expression of both receptors and adiponectin plasma concentration were dependent on hormonal status related to the stage of the cycle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadiponectin 3aadiponectin receptors 3aestrous cycle 3agene expression 3amenstrual cycle 3aprotein content 3aswine 0aAdiponectin receptors 0aadiponectin 0apig 0aovary 0aoestrous cycle1 aSmolinska, Nina1 aNitkiewicz, Anna1 aKiezun, Marta1 aDobrzyn, Kamil1 aCzerwinska, Joanna1 aSzeszko, Karol1 aKamiński, Tadeusz,0 tActa veterinaria Hungarica.g2014 Sept. 1, v. 62, no. 3 p.386-396dAkadémiai KiadówJournal:jnl35480x1588-27057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1556/avet.2014.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03079naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005900146245011500205300001800320520142000338592002801758650001801786650001601804650001601820650001301836650001701849650001501866650001801881650002301899650001701922650001001939650001301949650004201962650001602004650002602020650001202046650001802058650001602076650001002092653003002102653002702132653001702159653001202176653002002188700001902208700006002227700002502287773014802312856008002460852000902540655001202549IND60689669120221119041530.0200422e20200306xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068966912DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.9b074142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTse, Timothy J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6359-073610aChanges in Bacterial Populations and Their Metabolism over 90 Sequential Cultures on Wheat-Based Thin Stillage  ap. 4717-4729.  aWheat-based thin stillage (W-TS) is a liquid co-product of wheat fermentation for ethanol production, which typically contains substantial amounts of glycerol. Two-stage fermentation, via endemic microorganisms, can be used in processes to convert this compound to more valuable products and simplify the enrichment process through the clarification of the medium and concentration of particles as a protein-rich concentrate. We recultured bacteria 90 times (72 h at 37 °C) on fresh W-TS to determine the stability of the culture and metabolic processes. Next-generation sequencing of W-TS revealed the presence of a predominant Lactobacillus community that rapidly displaced competing microorganisms (e.g., Pediococcus) in subsequent fermentations. These organisms produced bacteriocins (e.g., helveticin J, interpreted through the presence of bacteriocin genes) and acidified the fermentation broth (through the production of succinic acid: 1.7 g/L, lactic acid: 1.8 g/L, and acetic acid: 4.1 g/L). Furthermore, the microbial community produced cobalamin (inferred through sequencing) and converted glycerol (10 g/L reduced to 3.5 g/L after 72 h) to 1,3-propanediol (6.1 g/L after 72 h). Altogether, Lactobacilli were identified as the predominant endemic microorganisms in W-TS after the first 10 cultures. The community was stable and provided a novel approach to increase the value of organic solutes in W-TS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus 3aPediococcus 3aacetic acid 3abacteria 3abacteriocins 3acoproducts 3aculture media 3aethanol production 3afermentation 3agenes 3aglycerol 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3alactic acid 3amicrobial communities 3asolutes 3asuccinic acid 3avitamin B12 3awheat 0aWheat-based thin stillage 0atwo-stage fermentation 0aLactobacilli 0aethanol 0a1,3-propanediol1 aShen, Jianheng1 aShim, Youn Young1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5039-82191 aReaney, Martin J.

Modifies the Composition of Gut Microbiota and Alleviates Acetic Acid-Induced Colitis in Rats  ap. 7384-7392.  aUlcerative colitis (UC), one type of chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), is a chronic and recurrent disorder of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. As camellia oil (CO) is traditionally used to treat GI disorders, this study investigated the role of CO on acetic acid-induced colitis in the rat. The composition of the gut microbial community is related to many diseases; thus, this study also investigated the effects of CO on the composition of the gut microbiota. The rats were fed a dose of 2 mL/kg body weight CO, olive oil (OO), or soybean oil (SO) once a day for 20 days, and the gut microbiota was analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Results of the gut microbiota examination showed significant clustering of feces after treatment with CO and OO; however, individual differences with OO varied considerably. Compared to SO and OO, the intake of CO increased the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes, the α-diversity, relative abundance of the Bifidobacterium, and reduced Prevotella of the gut microbiota. On day 21, colitis was induced by a single transrectal administration of 2 mL of 4% acetic acid. However, pretreatment of rats with CO or OO for 24 days slightly enhanced antioxidant and antioxidant enzyme activities and significantly reduced inflammatory damage and lipid peroxidation, thus ameliorating acetic acid-induced colitis. These results indicated that CO was better able to ameliorate impairment of the antioxidant system induced by acetic acid compared to OO and SO, which may have been due to CO modifying the composition of the gut microbiota or CO being a rich source of phytochemicals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBifidobacterium 3aCamellia oleifera 3aFirmicutes 3aPrevotella 3aacetic acid 3aantioxidants 3abody weight 3acolitis 3aenzyme activity 3afeces 3agastrointestinal system 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alipid peroxidation 3amicrobial communities 3aolive oil 3aphytopharmaceuticals 3arats 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3asoybean oil 3aspecies diversity 0agut microbiota 0acamellia oil 0aolive oil 0aacetic acid 0ainflammatory bowel disease 0acolitis1 aTung, Yu-Tang1 aWu, Chun-Ching1 aTu, Pang-Shuo1 aYen, Gow-Chin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9538-42190 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2018 June 13, v. 66, no. 28 p.7384-7392dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.8b021663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02670naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010900167300001600276520137500292592002801667650001501695650001501710650001301725650001801738650001201756650001301768650001701781650001001798650001101808650001701819650003101836650001301867653000901880653001501889653002401904653001601928653001701944653000901961653001201970700001801982773012102000856008202121852000902203655001202212IND60558649720221119201213.0180904e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055864972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jes.2016.09.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaini, Vipin K.10aDevelopment of metal organic framework-199 immobilized zeolite foam for adsorption of common indoor VOCs  ap. 321-330.  aReticulated foam shaped adsorbents are more efficient for the removal of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), particularly from low VOC-concentration indoor air streams. In this study composite structure of zeolite and metal organic frameworks (MOFs), referred as ZMF, has been fabricated by immobilization of fine MOF-199 powder on foam shaped Zeolite Socony Mobil-5 (ZSM-5) Zeolitic structure, referred as ZF. The ZMF possess a uniform and well-dispersed coating of MOF-199 on the porous framework of ZF. It shows higher surface area, pore volume, and VOCs adsorption capacity, as compared to ZF-structure. Post-fabrication changes in selective adsorption properties of ZMF were studied with three common indoor VOCs (benzene, n-hexane, and cyclohexane), using gravimetric adsorption technique. The adsorption capacity of ZMF with different VOCs follow the order of benzene>n-hexane>cyclohexane. In comparison with MOF-199 and ZF, the composite structure ZMF shows improvement in selectivity for benzene from other two VOCs. Further, improvement in efficiency and stability of prepared ZMF was found to be associated with its high MOF loading capacity and unique morphological and structural properties. The developed composite structure with improved VOCs removal and recyclability could be a promising material for small to limited scale air pollution treatment units.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aair flow 3aair pollution 3abenzene 3acoatings 3acyclohexanes 3afoams 3ahexane 3asurface area 3avolatile organic compounds 3azeolites 0aVOCs 0aAdsorption 0aComposite materials 0aSelectivity 0aZeolite foam 0aMOFs 0aHKUST-11 aPires, João,0 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2017 May, v. 55 p.321-330dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12417x1001-07427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2016.09.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02745naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100001200157245011800169300001600287520140800303592002801711650001601739650002201755650002201777650001801799650001201817650002001829650001301849650002101862650001101883650001801894650001501912653002001927653001801947653002401965653001601989700002102005700001602026700001802042700003202060773010602092856009202198852000902290655001202299IND60743985220221122061548.0210716e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074398522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2021.05.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Dan10aOptimal control as a tool to investigate the profitability of a Chinese plant factory - lettuce production system  ap. 319-332.  aAlthough optimal control has been used extensively for greenhouse climate management, its application to plant factories is still in its infancy. In this paper, profitability of growing lettuce in a Chinese plant factory is investigated by means of optimal control computations. To that end, first, a lettuce growth model is adapted to fit a plant factory environment. Next, this model is calibrated and validated using nine sets of experimental data with different LED light intensities. Using the calibrated and validated model, optimal control computations are used to produce a 3D plot revealing the influence of the electricity and lettuce price on maximum profit. Lettuce's physiological demand for dark periods during artificial lighting is incorporated by fixing this dark period to eight hours a day. Therefore, the optimal LED light intensity pattern obtained from the optimal control computations could be used in the actual production process. Maximum profit can reach 264.88 RMB m⁻² assuming a Chinese plant factory fresh lettuce price of 34.5 RMB kg⁻¹. When lettuce must be sold at 5.01 RMB kg⁻¹, which represents the price for an open field product, profit always comes out negative. Besides, LED lighting is not advised when the electricity price is greater than 0.84 RMB kWh⁻¹ under these circumstances. Profit is only positive when the lettuce price is over 20 RMB kg⁻¹.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectricity 3aelectricity costs 3agreenhouse effect 3agrowth models 3alettuce 3alight intensity 3alighting 3amodel validation 3aprices 3aprofitability 3ascotophase 0aOptimal control 0aPlant factory 0aLED light intensity 0aDark period1 aAhmed, Hesham A.1 aTong, Yuxin1 aYang, Qichang1 avan Willigenburg, L.

Annual average rainfall explains 88% variability in fish count rise within a polynomial relationship, and average rise amounts to 34% across the rivers. In low rainfall years, many migrated species disappear indicating their incapability to reproduce in other habitat conditions. Species depletion percentage ranges from 6.4 to 34.9 across the rivers, with an average depletion of 8%. Species number also differs between high and low precipitation years in each river. Some rivers act as sources and some as sinks for these migrated species. They survive temporarily in sinks, but reproduce only in sources ensuring temporary availability in rivers beyond their ecological amplitude. Such recurring phenomena may have led to habitat adaptations and diversification. High rainfall years trigger realized niche expansion beyond fundamental niche in some ichthyofaunal populations through flood induced river interconnectivity and habitat homogeneity during intense monsoon.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3afish 3ahabitats 3amigratory behavior 3amonsoon season 3arain 3arivers 3aIndia 0aEcotype 0aFish-diversity 0aHabitat-adaptation 0aInterconnected- Rivers 0aMigration1 aRoy, Sovan0 tIndian journal of ecology.g2021 Dec., v. 48, no. 4 p.1155-1164dIndian Ecological SocietywJournal:16635x0304-52507nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02808naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245012000155300002000275520168700295592002801982650001402010650002302024650001202047650001102059650001202070650001202082650001302094650002102107650002202128650001502150650003002165700001902195700001302214773012402227856007402351852000902425655001202434IND60640593620221120141110.0190504e20160601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064059362DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra06095a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGajewy, J.10aFine tuning of molecular and supramolecular properties of simple trianglimines – the role of the functional group  ap. 53358-53369.  aChiral, triangular poly-azamacrocycles (trianglimines) readily available from enantiomerically pure trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane and various aromatic dialdehydes, differ in their nature and substitution pattern. The highly symmetrical macrocycle having two electron-donating groups attached to the aryl moieties is formed under thermodynamic control that fulfilled the so called entropy of symmetry rule. Conversely, from the 2-nitroterephthaldehyde a kinetic product of trivial C₁ symmetry is solely obtained, whereas from 2-methoxyterepthaldehyde a mixture of C₃- and C₁-symmetrical macrocycles are formed. The factors that contribute to the mechanism of the macrocycle formation were determined on the basis of an experimental/theoretical approach. The non-symmetrical structure of the macrocycle resulted from a symmetrical intermediate that appeared during cyclocondensation. The chiroptical properties of the trianglimines were studied by means of experimental ECD and VCD methods supported by quantum-chemical calculations. The nitro-substituted trianglimine appeared to be a simple, low molecular weight supergelator forming in polar media of stable chiral organogels. The structure of the gel is affected by the nature and chirality of the dopant. The hexaimine macrocycles after reduction of the CN imine bonds formed trianglamines – useful chiral ligands in stereoselective synthesis. The Zn–trianglamine complexes were employed as catalysts for asymmetric hydrosilylation of prochiral ketones, providing products of enantiomeric excess up to 98%. This remains the best result obtained for Zn–diamine catalysed asymmetric hydrosilylation of ketones so far.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aentropy 3aimines 3aketones 3aligands 3amoieties 3amolecular weight 3aoptical isomerism 3aorganogels 3astereoselective synthesis1 aSzymkowiak, J.1 aKwit, M.0 tRSC advances.g2016 June 01, v. 6, no. 58 p.53358-53369dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra06095a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04319naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005900139245014600198300001800344500002000362520168700382592002802069596008702097596008302184596008602267596008602353596009602439596009602535596009502631596004202726596005902768596005902827596005902886650001502945650001502960650001202975650001302987650001603000650002403016650001803040650001903058650002203077650001503099650002603114650001303140650001603153650001403169700001803183700001203201700001803213700001903231700001203250700002003262700002103282700001903303700002303322700002003345700005803365773015103423856007403574852000903648655001203657IND60782925920221120051341.0220714e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078292592DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.70922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Fang‐fang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9658-761610aInvestigating the performance and mechanism of nitrogen gas fixation and conversion to ammonia based on biocathode bioelectrochemistry system  ap. 2163-2170.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Nowadays, microbial electrochemistry is widely used to produce valuable products (CH₄, CH₃CH₂OH, CH₃COOH, etc.) from carbon dioxide. Meanwhile, given that low‐value nitrogen (N₂) is abundantly available as a feedstock for chemicals, thus ammonia (NH₃) synthesis using bioelectrochemistry is still a promising technology. However, considering N₂ stability and ammonium (NH₄⁺) adsorption with a proton exchange membrane, developing suitable microbial systems for NH₃ synthesis still faces challenges. Based on this, we developed a single‐chamber biocathode bioelectrochemical system for efficient NH₃ production. RESULTS: For the reaction system that we constructed, NH₄⁺ production reached 6.31 mg L⁻¹ within 10 days, and NH₄⁺ production was positively correlated with current density. A C₂H₂ reduction assay further verified the activity of nitrogenase enzyme. Microbial community analysis revealed that Clostridia plays a crucial role in the N₂ fixation process, and the synergistic interaction between different microorganisms favors electron transfer and an increase in NH₃ production. CONCLUSIONS: The results of a series of experiments have proved that this green and economical method can be used to efficiently generate NH₄⁺. This reaction system not only utilizes the advantages of obtaining electrons for reduction reaction, but also improves electron transfer and avoids the shortcomings of NH₄⁺ adsorption. Additionally, this in‐depth study of N₂ fixation mechanism provides a theoretical reference for other applications of bioelectrochemical systems. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI).  aPublisher supplied data  aYDZJSX2021A015cCentral Government Guides Local Science and Technology Development  a2020JQ‐790cNatural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China  a201901D211058cNatural Science Foundation for Young Scientists of Shanxi Province  a201901D211100cNatural Science Foundation for Young Scientists of Shanxi Province  a2019L0138cScience Technology Innovation Project of Higher Education Institutions in Shanxi  a2019L0143cScience Technology Innovation Project of Higher Education Institutions in Shanxi  a20190606cYouths Talents Support Program of Shaanxi Association for Science and Technology  cChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation  a21978187cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a21978196cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a22008167cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aClostridia 3aadsorption 3aammonia 3aammonium 3abiocathodes 3abioelectrochemistry 3abiotechnology 3acarbon dioxide 3aelectron transfer 3afeedstocks 3amicrobial communities 3anitrogen 3anitrogenase 3asynergism1 aLi, Fei‐fei1 aLin, Yu1 aGuo, Li‐jun1 aZhang, Lu‐lu1 aLi, Rui1 aTian, Qi‐yuan1 aWang, Yun‐fang1 aWang, Ya‐wen1 aZhang, Xiao‐chao1 aLiu, Jian‐xin1 aFan, Cai‐mei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8491-42100 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2022 Aug., v. 97, no. 8 p.2163-2170dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.70923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02694naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100006500157245008900222300001600311520139300327592002801720650001301748650001601761650001101777650001101788650001501799650001101814650001601825650002501841653002201866653002001888653003101908700006201939700002602001700002602027700003602053773010602089856009202195852000902287655001202296IND60743985320221122061457.0210716e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074398532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2021.06.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuijpers, Wouter J.P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1951-782210aFruit development modelling and performance analysis of automatic greenhouse control  ap. 300-318.  aThis paper presents a receding horizon optimal control (RHOC) method with an economic objective function for balancing the cost of resources (resource use×cost) with income through yield (yield×product price). This paper considers the two elements that determine the income through yield. The first element is yield and associated fruit development. A new, computationally viable, approach to model the income through yield is proposed and its prediction accuracy with respect to the original model is evaluated. The new approach employs a model that predicts at each time step, the future income through yield based on the assimilates partitioned to the fruits at the current time step. Simulations suggest that the assumptions made to arrive at the model for the new approach, do not significantly affect the accuracy of the predictions. The second element considered in this paper is the product price and the uncertainty inherent in its forecasts. Historical product price data are used to generate artificial product price forecasts. An uncertainty analysis, in combination with the artificial product price forecasts, showed that the product price forecast error does not considerably affect the optimised control strategy. Season-wide simulations with RHOC suggest that the product price forecast error does not considerably affect the value of the economic objective function.  aPublisher supplied data 3afruiting 3agreenhouses 3aincome 3amodels 3aprediction 3aprices 3auncertainty 3auncertainty analysis 0aFruit development 0aOptimal control 0aGreenhouse climate control1 aAntunes, Duarte J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3047-93341 aHemming, S.q(Silke),1 avan Henten, Eldert J.1 avan de Molengraft, Marinus J.G.0 tBiosystems engineering.g2021 Aug., v. 208 p.300-318dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl70639x1537-51107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2021.06.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02173naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100001600157245007500173300001600248520105000264592002801314650001201342650002001354650002001374650001001394650001101404653001101415653002101426653001801447653002201465653001401487653002201501700001401523700001901537700001701556773011301573856009201686852000901778655001201787IND60743985420221122061406.0210716e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074398542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2021.06.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Weijun12aA CNN-based lightweight ensemble model for detecting defective carrots  ap. 287-299.  aCarrot grading plays a crucial role in producing high-competitive carrot products. However, carrot grading mainly depends on manual work nowadays, and this unreliable situation leads to high labor consumption, low efficiency, and unstable standard. In this study, a lightweight model (CarrotNet) based on machine vision with DCNN was proposed with the inspiration of several classic CNNs. The optimizations were conducted for the influential hyper-parameters in CarrotNet through comparative analysis. And the partial layers of the network were removed by the ablation study to obtain a more efficient structure. Furthermore, ensemble learning was adopted in the model to further improve the model accuracy. In the test set, the proposed model CarrotNet gained an accuracy of 97.04%, the modeling time of 1.42 h, the model size of 8.18 MB, and the detection speed of about 80 images per second. The robust performance of CarrotNet in the carrot dataset indicates that it can be used in on-line detection and grading of carrot external quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarrots 3acomputer vision 3adata collection 3alabor 3amodels 0aCarrot 0aExternal defects 0aDeep learning 0aLightweight model 0aCarrotNet 0aEnsemble learning1 aWei, Shuo1 aZheng, Zhaohui1 aYang, Deyong0 tBiosystems engineering.g2021 Aug., v. 208 p.287-299dElsevier LtdaIAgrEwJournal:jnl70639x1537-51107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2021.06.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03871naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003200135040001800167100002200185245019500207300001200402506007600414520194000490592002802430506003702458650002602495650002102521650002602542650001302568650001102581650001902592650001302611650001102624650002002635650001402655650001702669650001602686650001102702650001702713650002602730650002502756650001302781650000902794650001602803650001102819650001402830651001202844700002202856700002302878700002202901700002402923700001602947700002002963700002302983700001703006700002003023700002403043773010003067856004503167852000903212655001203221IND50066285920221207052651.0140121e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006628592DNAL7 a235570212pmid7 aPMC36391792pmcid7 a10.1186/1754-6834-6-492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEikmeyer, Felix G10aDetailed analysis of metagenome datasets obtained from biogas-producing microbial communities residing in biogas reactors does not indicate the presence of putative pathogenic microorganisms  ap. 271.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: In recent years biogas plants in Germany have been supposed to be involved in amplification and dissemination of pathogenic bacteria causing severe infections in humans and animals. In particular, biogas plants are discussed to contribute to the spreading of Escherichia coli infections in humans or chronic botulism in cattle caused by Clostridium botulinum. Metagenome datasets of microbial communities from an agricultural biogas plant as well as from anaerobic lab-scale digesters operating at different temperatures and conditions were analyzed for the presence of putative pathogenic bacteria and virulence determinants by various bioinformatic approaches. RESULTS: All datasets featured a low abundance of reads that were taxonomically assigned to the genus Escherichia or further selected genera comprising pathogenic species. Higher numbers of reads were taxonomically assigned to the genus Clostridium. However, only very few sequences were predicted to originate from pathogenic clostridial species. Moreover, mapping of metagenome reads to complete genome sequences of selected pathogenic bacteria revealed that not the pathogenic species itself, but only species that are more or less related to pathogenic ones are present in the fermentation samples analyzed. Likewise, known virulence determinants could hardly be detected. Only a marginal number of reads showed similarity to sequences described in the Microbial Virulence Database MvirDB such as those encoding protein toxins, virulence proteins or antibiotic resistance determinants. CONCLUSIONS: Findings of this first study of metagenomic sequence reads of biogas producing microbial communities suggest that the risk of dissemination of pathogenic bacteria by application of digestates from biogas fermentations as fertilizers is low, because obtained results do not indicate the presence of putative pathogenic microorganisms in the samples analyzed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aClostridium botulinum 3aEscherichia coli 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteria 3abiogas 3abioinformatics 3abotulism 3acattle 3adata collection 3adatabases 3afermentation 3afertilizers 3ahumans 3ametagenomics 3amicrobial communities 3anucleotide sequences 3aproteins 3arisk 3atemperature 3atoxins 3avirulence 3aGermany1 aRademacher, Antje1 aHanreich, Angelika1 aHennig, Magdalena1 aJaenicke, Sebastian1 aMaus, Irena1 aWibberg, Daniel1 aZakrzewski, Martha1 aPühler, A.,1 aKlocke, Michael1 aSchlüter, Andreas,0 tBiotechnology for biofuels.g2013 Dec., v. 6, no. 1 p.271-271dSpringer-Verlagx1754-68347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1754-6834-6-49  aDNAL 7aarticle02611naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245009700161300001600258520113400274592002801408650002501436650001701461650002101478650002001499650001701519650001601536650002701552650001201579650002301591650001001614650002001624650001101644650001301655650001901668650001101687650001301698653002001711653002001731653002001751653001301771653002901784653001301813700001801826700002101844700001501865773012301880856008102003852000902084655001202093IND60774673620221122025443.0220422e20041001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077467362DNAL7 a10.1556/avet.52.2004.4.32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalogh, K.10aEffect of excess selenium supplementation on the glutathione redox system in broiler chicken  ap. 403-411.  aSelenium, as part of selenocysteine, is the active centre of selenoenzymes. Excess amount of selenium generates oxygen free radicals and reacts with thiol compounds such as reduced glutathione, composing seleno-diglutathione. These reactions impair the amount and/or activity of the biological antioxidant defence system. In the present experiment the effects of two inorganic selenium sources (Na₂SeO₃, Na₂SeO₄) on lipid peroxidation and on the content and activity of some components of the antioxidant defence mechanism were studied in Ross 308 hybrid cockerels. In the tissues examined, the glutathione redox system was altered in different ways as an effect of excess selenium. The amount of glutathione and, consequently, glutathione peroxidase activity declined in the blood plasma and in the red blood cell haemolysate, while in the liver malondialdehyde concentration increased only at the end of the experimental period as a result of the boosted enzyme activity. The authors suppose that the cause of increased lipid peroxidation was the potential toxic effect of selenium accumulation above the actual demand.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3ablood plasma 3abroiler chickens 3aenzyme activity 3aerythrocytes 3aglutathione 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ahybrids 3alipid peroxidation 3aliver 3amalondialdehyde 3aoxygen 3aselenium 3aselenocysteine 3athiols 3atoxicity 0abroiler chicken 0abroiler chicken 0abroiler chicken 0atoxicity 0aglutathione redox system 0aSelenium1 aWeber, Maria,1 aErdélyi, Márta1 aMézes, M.0 tActa veterinaria Hungarica.g2004 Oct. 1, v. 52, no. 4 p.403-411dAkadémiai KiadówJournal:jnl35480x1588-27057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1556/avet.52.2004.4.33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02603naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100003200144245015300176300001600329520124600345592002801591650000801619650000901627650001701636650001501653650002901668650001201697650001701709650001301726653000901739653001201748653003001760653001901790653001801809653002901827700002201856700001901878700002201897700002201919773014001941856007902081852000902160655001202169IND60720265620221119192138.0210822e20130901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072026562DNAL7 a10.2478/bvip-2013-00712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŚwiątkiewicz, Małgorzata10aEffect of feeding genetically modified maize and soybean meal to sows on their reproductive traits, haematological indices and offspring performance  ap. 413-418.  aThe effect of Roundup Ready MON-40-3-2 soybean meal and Bt maize MON810 on sows performance and haematological indices, including parameters of erythrocytes, leukocytes, and trombocytes, as well as the piglets rearing indices were evaluated in the experiment carried out on 24 sows and their progeny.

Trend cases of thirteen stations in the EAR were analyzed using the Mann–Kendall (MK) trend and Şen trend tests. The homogeneity test and autocorrelation functions of the data of the stations were considered to comment. The analyses in this study were based on approximately 60-year (1960–2019, except for 17203 (1961–2019), 17285 (1961–2019), and 17204 (1964–2019)) records at thirteen meteorological stations. Drought cases in the previous studies for the EAR were also compared with the trend results of this study. The findings showed that there was no statistically significant trend for twelve stations except for the 17285 according to the MK trend test. Although seven stations (17046, 17201, 17100, 17097, 17199, 17204, and 17165) had a statistically significant upward trend, four stations (17203, 17094, 17285, and 17172) had a statistically significant downward trend according to the Şen trend test. Two stations (17099 and 17096) had no statistically significant trend. In the light of these findings, the statistically significant trends in minimum total monthly rainfall reported above should be considered in water resources management, engineering structures, biological/chemical processes, atmospheric conditions, and social-economic issues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTurkey (country) 3aautocorrelation 3aclimatology 3adrought 3ameteorological data 3arain0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2022 Apr., v. 148, no. 1-2 p.603-615dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl3932171x0177-798X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-022-03947-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03242naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024001100132040001800143100002600161245010000187300001600287506017300303520155000476650001402026650002102040650001602061650001402077650001002091650003002101650001102131650001502142650000902157650001102166650001602177650001602193650001802209650002402227700002202251700001602273700001802289700001802307700002002325700002202345700003002367773009302397856011202490956010402602961000902706852000902715655001202724IND50060163720221214224118.0130311s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006016372DNAL7 a2616632aris7 a10113/558642hdl8 ans1149  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBodenstine, Thomas M.10aPre-osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 promote breast cancer cell growth in bone in a murine xenograft model  ap. 189-196.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aThe bones are the most common sites of breast cancer metastasis. Upon arrival within the bone microenvironment, breast cancer cells coordinate the activities of stromal cells, resulting in an increase in osteoclast activity and bone matrix degradation. In late stages of bone metastasis, breast cancer cells induce apoptosis in osteoblasts, which further exacerbates bone loss. However, in early stages, breast cancer cells induce osteoblasts to secrete inflammatory cytokines purported to drive tumor progression. To more thoroughly evaluate the role of osteoblasts in early stages of breast cancer metastasis to the bones, we used green fluorescent protein'la beled human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435, which both induce osteolysis after intra'fe moral injection in athymic mice, and the murine pre'os teoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1 to modulate osteoblast populations at the sites of breast cancer metastasis. Breast cancer cells were injected directly into the femur with or without equal numbers of MC3T3-E1 cells. Tumors grew significantly larger when co'in jected with breast cancer cells and MC3T3-E1 cells than injected with breast cancer cells alone. Osteolysis was induced in both groups, indicating that MC3T3-E1 cells did not block the ability of breast cancer cells to cause bone destruction. MC3T3-E1 cells promoted tumor growth out of the bone into the extraosseous stroma. These data suggest that breast cancer cells and osteoblasts communicate during early stages of bone metastasis and promote tumor growth. 3aapoptosis 3abreast neoplasms 3acell growth 3acytokines 3afemur 3agreen fluorescent protein 3ahumans 3ametastasis 3amice 3amodels 3aosteoblasts 3aosteoclasts 3astromal cells 3axenotransplantation1 aBeck, Benjamin H.1 aCao, Xuemei1 aCook, Leah M.1 aIsmail, Aimen1 aPowers, J.

In the present study, we targeted the binding of PA to the ATR/TEM8 Von Willebrand factor type A (VWA) domain, which we cloned into Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity under denaturing conditions. To develop an anthrax toxin inhibitor, we selected and identified short single strand RNA aptamers (approximately 30mer) consisting of different sequences of nucleic acids with a high binding affinity in the 100 nanomolar range against the recombinant ATR/TEM8 VWA domain using systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX). Five candidate aptamers were further characterized by several techniques including secondary structural analysis. The inhibitor efficiency (IC50) of one of the aptamers toward anthrax toxin was approximately 5μM in macrophage RAW 264.7 cells, as determined from cytotoxicity analysis by MTT assay. We believe that the candidate aptamers should be useful for blocking the binding of PA to its receptor in order to neutralize anthrax toxin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus anthracis 3aEscherichia coli 3aRNA 3aanthrax 3aanthrax toxin 3abinding capacity 3ablood coagulation factors 3acytotoxicity 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amacrophages 3aneutralization 3aoligonucleotides 3apathogens 3asystematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment 0aAnthrax toxin 0aATR 0aRNA aptamer 0aATR 0aTEM8 0aVWA 0aPA 0aLF 0aSELEX 0assDNA 0aRNA 0aPCR1 aGedi, Vinayakumar1 aHa, Na-Reum1 aCho, Jun-Haeng1 aPark, Hae-Chul1 aYoon, Moon-Young0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2015 June, v. 77 p.293-302dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2015.03.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02531naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002900142245016100171300001400332520110600346592002801452650002201480650002001502650000901522650001401531650000901545650001201554650001701566650002301583651001201606653002301618653001301641653001201654653001401666653002201680653002201702653001301724653002001737653001801757700001801775700002101793700001801814700003001832773010201862856007601964852000902040655001202049IND60695934320221118235649.0200520e20200519xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069593432DNAL7 a10.1675/063.043.01072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurgues, María Fernanda10aTemporal Variation of Kelp Gull's (Larus dominicanus) Diet on a Coastal Island of the Rio de la Plata Estuary, Uruguay: Refuse as an Alternative Food Source  ap. 65-74.  aTemporal variation in the diet of the Kelp Gull in relation to feeding on refuse was studied at a reproductive colony on Isla de las Gaviotas, Uruguay. Diet was assessed temporally within the reproductive season, and inter-annually for 2011 and 2012 reproductive seasons, and the 2013 non-reproductive season. Data analysis was focused on the proportion of the most important diet items recorded in regurgitated pellets: fish and organic refuse. Fish and organic refuse correlated negatively at an intra-monthly scale. Additionally, fish was more frequently recorded during the incubation period (68% of pellets) than during the chick-rearing period (42% of pellets). Conversely, proportion of organic refuse was larger during the chick-rearing period (18% of pellets) than during the incubation period (8% of pellets). During reproduction, fish proportion in diet was larger (2011 = 41% of pellets, 2012 = 32% of pellets) than refuse (2011 = 16% of pellets, 2012 = 15%) and the opposite situation occurred during the non-reproductive season (fish 2013 = 14% of pellets, refuse 2013 = 41% of pellets).  aPublisher supplied data 3aLarus dominicanus 3abreeding season 3adiet 3aestuaries 3afish 3apellets 3asolid wastes 3atemporal variation 3aUruguay 0aanthropogenic food 0aforaging 0agarbage 0agull diet 0agull reproduction 0aincubation period 0alandfill 0anestling period 0aseasonal diet1 aLenzi, Javier1 aMachín, Emanuel1 aGenta, Lucía1 ade Mello, Franco Teixeira0 tWaterbirds.g2020 May 19, v. 43, no. 1 p.65-74dWaterbirds SocietywJournal:6297x1524-46957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1675/063.043.01073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02820naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006000152245007300212300001600285520163600301592002801937650002001965650001301985650001201998650001102010650002202021650000902043650001402052650001002066653003202076653002002108653001202128653001702140653003502157653002402192700002102216773009002237856008602327852000902413655001202422IND60602770520221120091636.0180711e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060277052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.peptides.2015.07.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAgersnap, Mikkel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5827-587010aNonsulfated cholecystokinins in the small intestine of pigs and rats  ap. 121-127.  aCholecystokinin (CCK) is a gut hormone that acts via two receptors. The CCKA-receptor requires the tyrosyl residue in the C-terminal bioactive site of CCK to be O-sulfated, whereas, the CCKB-receptor binds irrespective of sulfation. Consequently, unsulfated CCK peptides – if present – may constitute a hormone system that acts only through the CCKB-receptor. Therefore, we have now examined whether, CCK peptides occur in nonsulfated form in the small intestine of pigs and rats. The concentrations of sulfated and nonsulfated CCK were measured by RIAs, one specific for sulfated CCKs and a new two-step assay specific for nonsulfated CCK. For further characterization, the intestinal extracts were subjected to size- and ion exchange-chromatography.The intestinal concentrations of sulfated and nonsulfated CCK were highest in the duodenum and the proximal part of jejunum both in the pig and the rat. The porcine duodenal mucosa contained 193±84pmol/g sulfated CCK and 31±10pmol/g nonsulfated CCK, and the upper rat intestine 70±19pmol/g and 8±2pmol/g, respectively. The degree of sulfation correlated with the endoproteolytic proCCK processing. Thus, 38% of porcine CCK-58 was unsulfated, whereas, only 12% of CCK-8 was unsulfated.The results show that a substantial part of intestinal CCK peptides in rats and pigs are not sulfated, and that the longer peptides (CCK-58 and CCK-33) are less sulfated than the shorter (CCK-22 and CCK-8). Hence, the results demonstrate that proCCK in the gut is processed both to sulfated and unsulfated α-amidated peptides of which the latter are assumed to act via the CCKB-receptor.  aPublisher supplied data 3acholecystokinin 3aduodenum 3ajejunum 3amucosa 3aradioimmunoassays 3arats 3areceptors 3aswine 0aNonsulfated cholecystokinin 0aCholecystokinin 0aGastrin 0aGut hormones 0aPosttranslational modification 0aTyrosyl O-sulfation1 aRehfeld, Jens F.0 tPeptides.g2015 Sept., v. 71 p.121-127dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11832x0196-97817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2015.07.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01582naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245007800177300001600255520043100271592002800702650003300730650001000763650001000773650003000783651001300813653000900826653003300835653001000868653000800878653002400886700001600910700001500926700001700941700002300958773012400981856008201105852000901187655001201196IND60774673820221121052848.0220422e20060901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077467382DNAL7 a10.1556/avet.54.2006.3.112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValenčáková, Alexandra10aFirst report on Encephalitozoon intestinalis infection of swine in Europe  ap. 407-411.  aEncephalitozoon intestinalis infection of sows is reported from a pig farm in Slovakia.

This work focuses towards understanding the interaction of chloroethyl nitrosourea derivatives; lomustine, nimustine and semustine with tRNA using spectroscopic approach in order to elucidate their auxiliary anticancer action mechanism inside the cell. Attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), Fourier transform infrared difference spectroscopy, circular dichroism spectroscopy and UV–visible spectroscopy were employed to investigate the binding parameters of tRNA-CENUs complexation. Results of present study demonstrate that all CENUs, studied here, interact with tRNA through guanine nitrogenous base residues and possibly further crosslink cytosine residues in paired region of tRNA. Moreover, spectral data collected for nimustine-tRNA and semustine-tRNA complex formation indicates towards the groove-directed-alkylation as their anti-malignant action, which involves the participation of uracil moiety located in major groove of tRNA. Besides this, tRNA-CENUs adduct formation did not alter the native conformation of biopolymer and tRNA remains in A-form after its interaction with all three nitrosourea derivatives studied. The binding constants (Ka) estimated for tRNA complexation with lomustine, nimustine and semustine are 2.55×102M−1, 4.923×102M−1 and 4.223×102M−1 respectively, which specify weak type of CENU's binding with tRNA. Moreover, molecular modeling simulations were also performed to predict preferential binding orientation of CENUs with tRNA that corroborates well with spectral outcomes. The findings, presented here, recognize tRNA binding properties of CENUs that can further help in rational designing of more specific and efficient RNA targeted chemotherapeutic agents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aHodgkin disease 3abinding properties 3abiopolymers 3abrain 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3acytosine 3adata collection 3adrug therapy 3aguanine 3alung neoplasms 3amechanism of action 3amelanoma 3amolecular models 3aspectral analysis 3atransfer RNA 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3auracil 0aCENUs 0aMolecular modeling 0aFTIR spectroscopy 0aCD spectroscopy 0aDrug-RNA interaction1 aTyagi, Gunjan1 aChadha, Deepti1 aMehrotra, Ranjana0 tJournal of photochemistry and photobiology.g2017 Jan., v. 166 p.1-11dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6193x1011-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2016.09.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02375naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245011400164300001600278520130500294592002801599650001401627650001001641650001301651650001001664650001601674653000901690653002301699653001401722653001401736700002301750700002401773773014001797856007901937852000902016655001202025IND60720265820221119192245.0210822e20130901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072026582DNAL7 a10.2478/bvip-2013-00732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWysocki, Paweł10aAnalysis of proapoptotic changes in boar spermatozoa stored at 16 °C in different short-term semen extenders  ap. 425-428.  aThe aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of boar semen storage in different short-term extenders (BTS, Kortowo-3, and M III) on the percentage of spermatozoa showing proapoptotic and necrotic changes. For the first time in this study, Annexin V isolated from swine placenta has been used to determine proapoptotic changes in stored boar spermatozoa. The changes were determined using the IN Cell Analyzer 2000. A gradual decrease in motility was observed on successive days of storage. Spermatozoa incubated in the BTS extender were characterised by the highest average motility, which reached 75% on the 1ˢᵗ d and 39% on day 5. Motility of spermatozoa stored in BTS was significantly higher than those stored in Kortowo-3 and M III extenders after 5 d of storage. Diluted semen contained 1.5% to 2.8% spermatozoa with proapoptotic changes. The discussed process was intensified on the 3ʳᵈ d of storage when the percentage of apoptotic spermatozoa was determined at 8.3% to 14.6%, and the content of dead spermatozoa exceeded 25%. The analysed extenders differed insignificantly in their ability to protect semen against proapoptotic changes during storage. From the methodological point of view, Hoechst 33258 could be used additionally to stain sperm cells regardless of their status.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3aboars 3aplacenta 3asemen 3aspermatozoa 0aboar 0asemen preservation 0aextenders 0aapoptosis1 aŁyjak, Aleksandra1 aKordan, Władysław0 tBulletin of the Veterinary Institute in Puławy =.g2013 Sept. 01, v. 57, no. 3 p.425-428dSciendowJournal:J000000137x2300-32357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/bvip-2013-00733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02939naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245010700162300001600269500001100285520178800296592002802084650001102112650002302123650002802146650001502174650002402189650002202213700002402235700006302259700006602322773013002388856007402518852000902592655001202601IND60782926320221123044230.0220714e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078292632DNAL7 a10.1002/ncp.107852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLyons, Gemma C.

In order to improve nutrition delivery to critically ill patients, an understanding of the barriers that prevent guideline adherence is required. It is known that clinicians’ knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs of the role of nutrition may act as a potential barrier to nutrition delivery, but whether this remains true in critical care is unknown. The aim of this systematic scoping review was to summarize the literature exploring the knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs of clinicians around nutrition support in critically ill patients. A search of four online databases (MEDLINE via Ovid, Emcare via Ovid, PsycINFO, and CINAHL via EBSCOhost) was conducted on August 14, 2020, to identify literature that reported on clinicians’ knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs of nutrition in adult intensive care patients. Data were extracted on study and participant characteristics, methodology, and key study outcomes related to nutrition. Eighteen articles met eligibility criteria and were included in the review. Key findings included the following: nutrition was seen as a priority that ranked below life‐saving interventions; differences in perceived clinician responsibilities exist; common barriers to nutrition delivery included inadequate resourcing, lack of nutrition protocols, and gastrointestinal intolerance; and identified facilitators included nutrition education and the presence of a supportive multidisciplinary team. The implementation of nutrition protocols, enhanced clinical nutrition education, and further clarification of roles and responsibilities pertaining to nutrition may assist in improving nutrition delivery in critical care.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aclinical nutrition 3agastrointestinal system 3aguidelines 3anutrition education 3asystematic review1 aSummers, Matthew J.1 aMarshall, Andrea P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7692-403X1 aChapple, Lee‐anne S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9818-24840 tNutrition in clinical practice.g2022 Aug., v. 37, no. 4 p.825-842dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39209x0884-53367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ncp.107853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03439naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245018200165300002000347520181900367592002802186596005902214596005902273596005602332650002302388650001102411650001902422650002502441650002302466650003302489650001502522650001302537650001402550650001502564650002102579651001002600700001902610700001702629700001502646700005702661700001602718773015502734856008302889852000902972655001202981IND60791811920221119162628.0220831e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079181192DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-022-20143-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Jinling10aDoes government intervention affect CO2 emission reduction effect of producer service agglomeration? Empirical analysis based on spatial Durbin model and dynamic threshold model  ap. 61247-61264.  aAchieving carbon peak and carbon neutrality is an inherent requirement for countries to promote green recovery and transformation of the global economy after the COVID-19 pandemic. As “a smoke-free industry,” producer services agglomeration (PSA) may have significant impacts on CO₂ emission reduction. Therefore, based on the nightlight data to calculate the CO₂ emissions of 268 cities in China from 2005 to 2017, this study deeply explores the impact and transmission mechanism of PSA on CO₂ emissions by constructing dynamic spatial Durbin model and intermediary effect model. Furthermore, the dynamic threshold model is used to analyze the nonlinear characteristics between PSA and CO₂ emissions under different degrees of government intervention. The results reveal that: (1) Generally, China’s CO₂ emissions are path-dependent in the time dimension, showing a “snowball effect.” PSA significantly inhibits CO₂ emissions, but heterogeneous influences exist in different regions, time nodes, and sub-industries; (2) PSA can indirectly curb CO₂ emissions through economies of scale, technological innovation, and industrial structure upgrading. (3) The impact of PSA on China’s CO₂ emissions has an obvious double threshold effect under different degree of government intervention. Accordingly, the Chinese government should increase the support for producer services, dynamically adjust industrial policies, take a moderate intervention, and strengthen market-oriented reform to reduce CO₂ emissions. This study opens up a new path for the low-carbon economic development and environmental sustainability, and also fills in the theoretical gaps on these issues. The findings and implications will offer instructive guideline for early achieving carbon peak and carbon neutrality.  aPublisher supplied data  a71463057cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41661112cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a18SKSJ034cChongqing Municipal Education Commission 3aCOVID-19 infection 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aeconomic development 3aempirical research 3aenvironmental sustainability 3aguidelines 3aindustry 3apollution 3atechnology 3athreshold models 3aChina1 aYang, Xiaodong1 aNie, Chunxia1 aSu, Xufeng1 aZhao, Junfeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8750-09341 aRan, Qiying0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Aug., v. 29, no. 40 p.61247-61264dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-20143-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02908naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245016200204300001600366520143000382592002801812596002001840650001201860650001201872650001201884650001901896650001601915650001201931650001901943650001601962651002101978651001001999700002602009700002502035700001902060700001502079700002002094700001402114700002602128700001802154700002302172700001802195773013302213856008302346852000902429655001202438IND60771122120221119013250.0220417e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077112212DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-022-03949-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaha, Saurav1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6844-251610aSpatiotemporal variability of weather extremes over eastern India: evidences of ascertained long-term trend persistence and effective global climate controls  ap. 643-659.  aThe present study acknowledged climate variability induced periodic variation in localized extreme weather event occurrences under diverse agro-eco regions of Eastern Himalayas of India during the past five decades. The widespread rise in warm nights (TN90p; 0.31–1.67 days year⁻¹), reduced daily rainfall intensity (SDII), and changes in other weather extremes, viz. temperature and precipitation extremes, signified clear signals on regional atmospheric warming across eastern India. The agro-ecological regions under extended Bramhaputra valley and coastal belts of south Bengal experienced the most persistent shifts in temperature extremes, while the upper Himalayan range extended from North Bengal to Arunachal Pradesh experienced the steepest decline in average daily rainfall intensity and other absolute quantitative estimates of precipitation extremes over past five decades. Together with El Niño and La Niña events, large-scale global atmospheric circulations particularly expansion of warmer Pacific Warm Pool (PWP) and changes in Atlantic Meridional Mode (AMM) contributed to the periodic dynamics in weather extreme occurrences from monthly to annual time scale over eastern India. Our findings will be useful for better understanding of regional climatology, designing, and successful implantation of location-specific suitable agricultural policies towards climate change adaptation in near future.  aPublisher supplied data  aOXX01713cNICRA 3aEl Nino 3aLa Nina 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimatology 3adecline 3arain intensity 3atemperature 3aHimalayan region 3aIndia1 aChakraborty, Debasish1 aHazarika, Samarendra1 aShakuntala, I.1 aDas, Bappa1 aChhabra, Aakash1 aSadhu, S.1 aChakraborty, Debashis1 aMukherjee, J.1 aSingson, Lungmuana1 aMishra, V.

Photocatalyst g-C3N4 was well immobilized on the hyphae surface of P. chrysosporium by calcium alginate. The typical absorption edge in visible light region for g-C3N4 was at about 460 nm, and the optical absorption bandgap of g-C3N4 was estimated to be 2.70 eV, demonstrating the great photoresponsive ability of g-C3N4. An optimized g-C3N4 content of 0.10 g in immobilized P. chrysosporium and an optimized immobilized P. chrysosporium dosage of 1.0 g were suitable for organic matters removal. The removal efficiency of total organic carbon (TOC) reached 74.99% in 72 h with the initial TOC concentration of 100 mg L−1. In addition, the gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) measurements showed that immobilized P. chrysosporium presented an outstanding removal performance for almost all organic compounds in landfill leachate, especially for the volatile fatty acids and long-chain hydrocarbons. The overall results indicate that the combination P. chrysosporium with photocatalyst g-C3N4 for organic matters removal from landfill leachate may provide a more comprehensive potential for the landfill leachate treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhanerochaete chrysosporium 3aabsorption 3acalcium alginate 3acarbon 3acarbon nitride 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahydrocarbons 3ahyphae 3airradiation 3alandfill leachates 3aphotocatalysts 3avolatile fatty acids 0aGraphitic carbon nitride 0aLandfill leachate 0aOrganic matters removal 0aPhotocatalytic degradation 0aPhanerochaete chrysosporium1 aLiu, Yutang1 aZeng, Guangming1 aChen, Guiqiu1 aWan, Jia1 aZeng, Yunxiong1 aWang, Longlu1 aWu, Haipeng1 aXu, Piao1 aZhang, Chen1 aCheng, Min1 aHu, Tianjue0 tChemosphere.g2017 Oct., v. 184 p.1071-1079dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.06.0653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03134naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005000144245009500194300002000289520153600309592002801845650002101873650002801894650002101922650001601943650001901959650001601978650002201994650002402016650001902040650000902059650001402068650003002082650001902112650001902131650001402150650002302164653001902187653001302206653002202219700001902241700002102260700001702281700005902298700001702357700001302374773014202387856007802529852000902607655001202616IND60689669720221119041421.0200422e20200326xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068966972DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c002752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Le1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9545-709110aIntrafibrillar Mineralized Collagen–Hydroxyapatite-Based Scaffolds for Bone Regeneration  ap. 18235-18249.  aAs one of the major challenges in the field of tissue engineering, large skeletal defects have attracted wide attention from researchers. Collagen (Col) and hydroxyapatite (HA), the most abundant protein and the main component in natural bone, respectively, are usually used as a biomimetic composite material in tissue engineering due to their excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability. In this study, novel intrafibrillar mineralized Col–HA-based scaffolds, constructed in either cellular or lamellar microstructures, were established through a biomimetic method to enhance the new bone-regenerating capability of tissue engineering scaffolds. Moreover, iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn), two of the essential trace elements in the body, were successfully incorporated into the lamellar scaffold to further improve the osteoinductivity of these biomaterials. It was found that the lamellar scaffolds demonstrated better osteogenic abilities compared to both in-house and commercial Col–HA-based cellular scaffolds in vitro and in vivo. Meanwhile, Fe/Mn incorporation further amplified the osteogenic promotion of the lamellar scaffolds. More importantly, a synergistic effect was observed in the Fe and Mn dual-element-incorporated lamellar scaffolds for both in vitro osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and in vivo bone regeneration loaded with fresh bone marrow cells. This study provides a simple but practical strategy for the creation of functional scaffolds for bone regeneration.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatibility 3abiocompatible materials 3abiodegradability 3abiomimetics 3abone formation 3abone marrow 3abone marrow cells 3acomposite materials 3ahydroxyapatite 3airon 3amanganese 3amesenchymal stromal cells 3amicrostructure 3amineralization 3asynergism 3atissue engineering 0aintrafibrillar 0alamellar 0abone regeneration1 aRowe, David W.1 aPerera, Inosh P.1 aZhang, Jiyao1 aSuib, Steven L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3073-311X1 aXin, Xiaonan1 aWei, Mei0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Mar. 26, v. 12, no. 16 p.18235-18249dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c002753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01429naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002300112245012500135300001400260520043600274592002800710650001400738650001200752650001600764650001600780651000900796653001800805653001300823653001900836653001600855653000900871700002100880700001900901700002000920773013000940852000901070655001201079IND60477719320221121214528.0160105e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047771932DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPešić, Vladimir,10aNew records of water mites (Acari: Hydrachnidia) from Khorassan Province (Iran), with the description of one new species  ap. 73-82.  aNew records of water mites (Acari: Hydrachnidia) from Khorassan Province (NE Iran) are presented.

The case was characterised by a chronic course with signs of spinal pain and acute paraplegia. The diagnosis was established by radiography, myelography, post-myelographic CT examination, and laboratory tests including routine blood work and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology, and confirmed by postmortem pathological and microbiological examinations. Diagnostic imaging showed severe osteolysis, ventral spondylosis and spinal cord compression at the 4th and 5th lumbar vertebrae. The blood tests revealed mild leukocytosis and anaemia, while CSF cytology showed lymphocytic and mononuclear pleocytosis. Necropsy demonstrated severe osteomyelitis and meningomyelitis, but the source of infection could not be established. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first description of canine vertebral osteomyelitis caused by this organism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPasteurella canis 3aanemia 3ablood 3abone resorption 3acase studies 3acell biology 3acerebrospinal fluid 3achronic diseases 3adogs 3amales 3amyelography 3anecropsy 3aosteomyelitis 3apain 3aspinal cord 0aDog 0avertebral osteomyelitis 0aPasteurella canis1 aJakab, Csaba1 aJánosi, Katalin1 aSellyei, Boglárka1 aIpolyi, Tamás1 aSzabó, Zoltán,1 aArany-Tóth, Attila1 aNémeth, Tibor,0 tActa veterinaria Hungarica.g2010 Dec. 1, v. 58, no. 4 p.413-421dAkadémiai KiadówJournal:jnl35480x1588-27057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1556/avet.58.2010.4.23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02567naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001200144245011600156300002000272520102300292592002801315650001301343650002401356650002001380650001701400650001601417650002401433650001901457650001501476650001901491650001401510650002201524653003001546653002801576653001201604653001601616653001601632700005501648700001401703700001801717700001601735700001801751700005501769700002001824773014201844856007801986852000902064655001202073IND60689669820221119041257.0200422e20200330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068966982DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c002832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Lin10aDual Photoluminescence Emission Carbon Dots for Ratiometric Fluorescent GSH Sensing and Cancer Cell Recognition  ap. 18250-18257.  aWe developed a facile strategy for the fabrication of dual-emission carbon nanodots (CDs) and demonstrated their applications for ratiometric glutathione (GSH) sensing and for differentiating cancer cells from normal cells. Dual-emission CDs were synthesized using a simple hydrothermal treatment of alizarin carmine as the carbon source, manifesting intriguing dual-emission behavior at 430 and 642 nm. With increasing GSH concentration, the fluorescence band at 430 nm increased gradually, whereas that at 642 nm decreased slightly. With monitoring of the intrinsic ratiometric fluorescence variation (I₄₃₀ₙₘ/I₆₄₂ₙₘ), as-prepared CDs were developed as an effective platform for ratiometric fluorescent GSH sensing, with a linear range of 1–10 to 25–150 μM and a detection limit of 0.26 μM. More importantly, confocal fluorescent imaging of cancer cells and normal cells indicated that obtained CDs could be implemented as an effective tool to visualize cancer cells with overexpressing GSH.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalizarin 3acarbon quantum dots 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3aglutathione 3ahot water treatment 3aimage analysis 3amonitoring 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aphotoluminescence 0adual-emission carbon dots 0aratiometric fluorescent 0asensing 0arecognition 0acancer cell1 aShi, Lihong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4791-40481 aJia, Jing1 aEltayeb, Omer1 aLu, Wenjing1 aTang, Youhong1 aDong, Chuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1827-87941 aShuang, Shaomin0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Mar. 30, v. 12, no. 16 p.18250-18257dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c002833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03942naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024003700128040001800165100002500183245013300208300001800341520192700359592002802286596007002314650002602384650002502410650002202435650001402457650001102471650001002482650001402492650001202506650004102518650001602559650001402575650002202589650001802611650001402629650002402643650001002667650001302677650000902690650003202699650001202731650001302743651001902756653001402775653002002789653001902809653001802828653002502846653002202871700001902893700001702912700002202929700005702951700005803008773014803066856008103214852000903295655001203304IND60604935020221119001820.0180718e20180625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060493502DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.8b032572doi7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.8b032572chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurungi, Lucy Kananu10aIdentification of Key Root Volatiles Signaling Preference of Tomato over Spinach by the Root Knot Nematode Meloidogyne incognita  ap. 7328-7336.  aThe root knot nematode, Meloidogyne incognita (Kofoid and White) Chitwood, is a serious pest of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and spinach (Spinacea oleracea) in sub-Saharan Africa. In East Africa these two crops are economically important and are commonly intercropped by smallholder farmers. The role of host plant volatiles in M. incognita interactions with these two commodities is currently unknown. Here, we investigate the olfactory basis of attraction of tomato and spinach roots by the infective second stage juveniles (J2s) of M. incognita. In olfactometer assays, J2s were attracted to root volatiles from both crops over moist sand (control), but in choice tests using the two host plants, volatiles of tomato roots were more attractive than those released by spinach. Root volatiles sampled by solid phase microextraction (SPME) fiber and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) identified a total of eight components, of which five (2-isopropyl-3-methoxypyrazine, 2-(methoxy)-3-(1-methylpropyl)pyrazine, tridecane, and α- and β-cedrene) occurred in the root-emitted volatiles of both plants, with three (δ-3-carene, sabinene, and methyl salicylate) being specific to tomato root volatiles. In a series of bioassays, methyl salicylate contributed strongly to the attractiveness of tomato, whereas 2-isopropyl-3-methoxypyrazine and tridecane contributed to the attractiveness of spinach. M. incognita J2s were also more attracted to natural spinach root volatiles when methyl salicylate was combined than to spinach volatiles alone, indicating that the presence of methyl salicylate in tomato volatiles strongly contributes to its preference over spinach. Our results indicate that since both tomato and spinach roots are attractive to M. incognita, identifying cultivars of these two plant species that are chemically less attractive can be helpful in the management of root knot nematodes.  aPublisher supplied data  cAgricultural Research Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100007917 3aMeloidogyne incognita 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aSpinacia oleracea 3abioassays 3acarene 3acrops 3acultivars 3afarmers 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahost plants 3ajuveniles 3amethyl salicylate 3aolfactometers 3apyrazines 3aroot-knot nematodes 3aroots 3asabinene 3asand 3asolid phase microextraction 3aspinach 3atomatoes 3aEastern Africa 0aKairomone 0aMeloidogyne sp. 0aroot volatiles 0asemiochemical 0aSolanum lycopersicum 0aSpinacea oleracea1 aKirwa, Hillary1 aCoyne, Danny1 aTeal, Peter E.

In general serostudies (n = 1314), four avian groups (psittaciform, raptor, penguin, and zoo) were found to have samples with antibody reactivity. Penguin, raptor, and zoo groups were found to have higher levels of antibody to Aspergillus than the psittaciform group. Additional clinical information was collected on 303 cases, which resulted in the definition of presumptive normal, probable, and confirmed infection groups. Although the confirmed group was more likely to have antibody reactivity, the mean antibody index was not found to be significant between presumptive normal and probable or confirmed cases. 3adisease detection 3aserodiagnosis 3aclinical examination 3aaspergillosis 3aantibodies 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aanimal pathogenic fungi 3awild birds 3aimmune response 3aAspergillus 3azoo animals 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Fungalxblood 2aAspergillosisxbloodxepidemiologyximmunologyxveterinary. 2aAspergillusximmunology 2aBird Diseasesxbloodxepidemiologyximmunology. 2aBirds 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxveterinary 2aSeroepidemiologic Studies 2aTime Factors 0aFloridaxepidemiology. 0adiagnostic techniques 0abirds 0adisease diagnosis1 aWatson, Toshiba1 aArheart, Kristopher L.0 tAvian diseases.g2009 Dec., v. 53, no. 4 p.491-494dAmerican Association of Avian Pathologistsx0005-20867nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1637/8673-030209-Reg.13Available from publisher's Web site  a20100301b20100305c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/02/03  aOther US 7aarticle02614naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002100186245010700207300001600314506007600330520130900406592002801715506003701743650002401780650003001804650001201834653002901846653002001875653002601895700001901921700001901940700002201959773017101981856007902152852000902231655001202240IND60178666920221207080644.0150604e20140114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017866692DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.13152731112doi7 aPMC38961632pmcid7 a243671162pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHilbe, Christian10aDemocratic decisions establish stable authorities that overcome the paradox of second-order punishment  ap. 752-756.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIndividuals usually punish free riders but refuse to sanction those who cooperate but do not punish. This missing second-order peer punishment is a fundamental problem for the stabilization of cooperation. To solve this problem, most societies today have implemented central authorities that punish free riders and tax evaders alike, such that second-order punishment is fully established. The emergence of such stable authorities from individual decisions, however, creates a new paradox: it seems absurd to expect individuals who do not engage in second-order punishment to strive for an authority that does. Herein, we provide a mathematical model and experimental results from a public goods game where subjects can choose between a community with and without second-order punishment in two different ways. When subjects can migrate continuously to either community, we identify a bias toward institutions that do not punish tax evaders. When subjects have to vote once for all rounds of the game and have to accept the decision of the majority, they prefer a society with second-order punishment. These findings uncover the existence of a democracy premium. The majority-voting rule allows subjects to commit themselves and to implement institutions that eventually lead to a higher welfare for all.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amathematical models 3apublic services and goods 3asociety 0aevolution of cooperation 0apool punishment 0ainstitution formation1 aTraulsen, Arne1 aRöhl, Torsten1 aMilinski, Manfred0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2014 Jan. 14, v. 111, no. 2 p.752-756dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.13152731113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02356naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245008500131300001200216520116500228592002801393650002201421650002201443650001501465650001601480650001401496650001301510650001501523650001301538650001201551650001101563650001601574650002001590650001601610651001001626653001501636653001201651700001801663700002001681700002001701700002101721700001801742773014101760852000901901655001201910IND60710321520221121225042.0200908e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071032152DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSubbarayudu, B10aSorghum Resistance to Rice Weevil, Sitophilus oryzae: Antibiosis and Antixenosis  ap. 1-5.  aTwenty sorghum cultivars along with a maintainer line, 296B were screened for susceptibility to Sitophilus oryzae at the Directorate of Sorghum Research (DSR), Rajendranagar, Hyderabad, India.

First, identification of units that are outlying with respect to the baseline hazard is awkward since this hazard is implicit (rather than explicit) in the Cox partial likelihood. Second (and more seriously), identification of modest treatment effects is often difficult since the model fails to acknowledge any similarity across the strata. We consider a number of hierarchical modeling approaches that preserve the integrity of the stratified design while offering a middle ground between traditional stratified and unstratified analyses. We investigate both fully parametric (Weibull) and semiparametric models, the latter based not on the Cox model but on an extension of an idea by Gelfand and Mallick (1995, Biometrics51, 843â852), which models the integrated baseline hazard as a mixture of monotone functions. We illustrate the methods using data from a recent multicenter AIDS clinical trial, comparing their ease of use, interpretation, and degree of robustness with respect to estimates of both the unitâspecific baseline hazards and the treatment effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiometry 3aclinical trials 3adata collection 3amodels 3aregression analysis1 aHodges, James S.0 tBiometrics.g1999 Dec., v. 55, no. 4 p.1162-1170dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0006-341X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0006-341X.1999.01162.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03363naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011900170520180600289592002802095650002402123650001102147650002702158650002302185650002502208650001102233650001202244650001302256650001402269650001502283650001202298650001902310650002202329650001102351650001702362650001502379650002502394650002002419653003002439653002502469653003402494653002102528653001702549700002202566700002702588700002302615773011202638856008602750852000902836655001202845IND60683672320221122032250.0200412e20200520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068367232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1203042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShamaei, Laleh10aIndustrial waste lignin as an antifouling coating for the treatment of oily wastewater: Creating wealth from waste  aTreatment of oily wastewater is of paramount importance to prevent unbearable water pollution caused by large discharge volume from industrial and household activities. Membrane technology is an effective oily wastewater treatment technology. However, it suffers from fouling if the membrane element is not modified to possess anti-oil-fouling propensity. Here, we converted an agro-industrial waste into an asset by coating hydrophilic sulfonated kraft lignin on polyethersulfone (PES) membrane using layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly. The polyelectrolytes used in the LbL process were lignin as a polyanion and poly (diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (pDAC) as a polycation. The effects of polyelectrolyte concentration and the number of coating bilayers were examined to fabricate a membrane with an enhanced anti-fouling propensity and minimal loss in permeation performance. The membrane with the highest anti-fouling performance was obtained by coating 3 pDAC/lignin bilayers with 2 wt% concentration of the individual polyelectrolyte solution. This membrane demonstrated a low flux decline of 23.1%, and a high flux recovery ratio of 93.8% when was utilized for the filtration of the n-hexadecane-in-water emulsion as synthetic oily wastewater. The pristine PES membrane showed a flux decline of 44.2%, and the flux recovery ratio of 75.9% under similar test conditions. The improvement in anti-fouling properties of the LbL-assembled membrane was achieved due to its higher underwater oleophobicity (22.6° ± 0.5°) as compared to the pristine PES membrane (71.1° ± 0.7°). The present study opens up a new paradigm to develop anti-fouling membranes by using hydrophilic industrial waste lignin in LbL surface modification of conventional polymeric membranes for oily wastewater treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural wastes 3aanions 3aantifouling activities 3aantifouling agents 3aartificial membranes 3aassets 3acations 3acoatings 3aemulsions 3afiltration 3afouling 3ahydrophilicity 3aindustrial wastes 3alignin 3apermeability 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3awater pollution 0aOily wastewater treatment 0aSurface modification 0aLayer-by-layer (LbL) assembly 0aPolyethersulfone 0aAnti-fouling1 aKhorshidi, Behnam1 aIslam, Muhammad Amirul1 aSadrzadeh, Mohtada0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 May 20, v. 256 p.120304-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1203043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02889naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245014500169520143100314592002801745650002701773650002401800650001801824650002901842650002601871650002001897650001801917650001601935650002901951650001501980650001701995650002002012650002802032650001002060650001302070650001502083650002502098651001402123700001602137700001702153700001402170700001402184773012702198856008502325852000902410655001202419IND60742632720221123003920.0210624e20210604xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074263272DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms90612242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Qianxian 10aProbiotic Potential and Cholesterol-Lowering Capabilities of Bacterial Strains Isolated from Pericarpium Citri Reticulatae ‘Chachiensis’  aPericarpium Citri Reticulatae ‘Chachiensis’ (PCR-Chachiensis), the pericarps of Citri Reticulatae Blanco cv. Chachiensis, is a food condiment and traditional medicine in southeast and eastern Asia. Its rich and various bacterial community awaits exploration. The present study is the first report on probiotic screening and characterization of bacteria from PCR-Chachiensis. Based on 64 culturable bacterial isolates, 8 strains were screened out to have great survival in the simulated gastrointestinal stressful condition, being nonhemolytic and without biogenic amine formation. They were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing as two Bacillus, three Lactobacillus, and three strains from Bacillales. Their probiotic properties, cholesterol-lowering potential and carbohydrate utilization capability were further investigated. Though these eight strains all displayed distinct cholesterol removal potential, Bacillus licheniformis N17-02 showed both remarkable cholesterol removal capability and presence of bile salt hydrolase gene, as well as possessing most of the desirable probiotic attributes. Thus, it could be a good probiotic candidate with hypocholesterolemic potential. Bacillus megaterium N17-12 displayed the widest carbohydrate utilization profile and the strongest antimicrobial activity. Hence, it was promising to be used as a probiotic in a host and as a fermentation starter in fermented food or feed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus licheniformis 3aBacillus megaterium 3aLactobacillus 3aantimicrobial properties 3abacterial communities 3abiogenic amines 3acarbohydrates 3acholesterol 3acholoylglycine hydrolase 3acondiments 3afermentation 3afermented foods 3agastrointestinal system 3agenes 3apericarp 3aprobiotics 3atraditional medicine 3aEast Asia1 aLi, Jingyu 1 aMa, Yongkai 1 aChen, Qi 1 aChen, Gu 0 tMicroorganisms.g2021 June 04, v. 9, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms90612243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02488naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002100112245008700133300001300220520116200233592002801395650001801423650002201441650002501463650002201488650002501510650002601535650001501561650002601576650001201602650001801614650002301632650001001655650001601665650001501681650001601696653001401712653002801726653002501754653002801779653002601807700002201833700002401855773014201879852000902021655001202030IND60710321620221121234218.0200908e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071032162DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPriyadarshini, G10aBioefficacy of Selective Insecticides against Lepidopteran Pod Borers in Pigeonpea  ap. 6-10.  aField trial was conducted to evaluate comparative efficacy of six insecticides against pod borer complex viz., gram pod borer (Helicoverpa armigera Hubner), pod fly (Melanagromyza obtusa Malloch), flower webber cum borer (Maruca vitrata Geyer), and plume moth (Exelastis atomosa Walsingham).

PCL/PI blends, in which the portion of PCL was 75 and 50, were mixed with a compatibilizer by a melt-blending technique. The resulting blends were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry and scanning electron microscopy and also their mechanical properties were determined. Afterwards, the blend films were buried in the soil. Remarkable level of weight loss was achieved in 6 weeks, ∼46%. The results showed that the addition of SOLE helped to improve the compatibility between PCL and PI due to its amphipathic property, and, besides, accelerated the weight loss of the films in soil, increasing microorganism growth on the film.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aenvironmental technology 3agrafting (plants) 3amechanical properties 3apolymers 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asoil 3asoybean oil 3asoybeans 3athermogravimetry 0aPolymer blend 0acompatibilizer 0amiscibility 0abiomass 0agrafting plant1 aAndou, Yoshito1 aNakayama, Natsuki1 aYoshinaga, Keita1 aShirai, Y.q(Yoshihito),0 tEnvironmental technology.g2017 Sept. 17, v. 38, no. 18 p.2362-2372dTaylor & Francisx1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2016.12611863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02839naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245023000173300001600403520136100419592002801780650001401808650002001822650002401842650002901866650002001895650001601915650001201931650001501943650003301958650002401991650002402015650001602039653001302055653002302068653002502091653000802116653001002124653002002134700002302154700002002177773009002197856008502287852000902372655001202381IND60607857220221118041710.0180830e20161115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060785722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2016.09.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMostafaei, Mostafa10aModeling the effects of ultrasound power and reactor dimension on the biodiesel production yield: Comparison of prediction abilities between response surface methodology (RSM) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS)  ap. 626-636.  aBiodiesel is as an alternative petro-diesel fuel produced from the renewable resources. The use of novel technologies such as ultrasound technology for biodiesel production intensifies the reaction and reduces the process cost. The present study is aimed to evaluate and compare the prediction and simulating efficiency of the response surface methodology (RSM) and adaptive Neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) approaches for modeling the transesterification yield achieved in ultrasonic reactor. The influence of independent variables (reactor diameter, liquid height and ultrasound intensity) on the conversion of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) was investigated by Box-Behnken design of RSM and two ANFIS approaches (hybrid and back-propagation optimization methods). All models were compared statistically based on the training and validation data set by the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean squares error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean relative percent deviation (MRPD). The calculated R2 for RSM and two ANFIS models were 0.9669, 0.9812 and 0.9808, respectively. All models indicated good predictions, however, the ANFIS models were more precise compared to the RSM model, which proves that the ANFIS is a powerful tool for modeling and optimizing FAME production in ultrasound reactor.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiesel 3adata collection 3aexperimental design 3afatty acid methyl esters 3afuel production 3afuzzy logic 3aliquids 3aprediction 3aresponse surface methodology 3asystem optimization 3atransesterification 3aultrasonics 0aModeling 0aUltrasound reactor 0aBiodiesel production 0aRSM 0aANFIS 0aFAME efficiency1 aJavadikia, Hossein1 aNaderloo, Leila0 tEnergy.g2016 Nov. 15, v. 115 p.626-636dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2016.09.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02216naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245011300131300001400244520121400258592002801472650002101500650001501521650001601536650001701552650001701569650001901586650001501605650001901620653001801639653002201657653002801679700001901707773014301726852000901869655001201878IND60710321720221121234102.0200908e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071032172DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, S.

There was complete control of the aphids L. erysimi after 35, 42 and 49 days after the pre-bloom treatment as its population was reduced to zero during both the years under study. The treatment involving application of carbofuran followed by post-bloom spray of cypermethrin (T₂) resulted in significantly higher seed yield of 12.5 and 14.1 q/ha during 2010 and 2011, respectively, whereas the seed yield in control plots during the respective years was significantly lower (6.4 and 7.9 q/ha) than all the treatments. The pre-bloom treatment of carbosulfan followed by post bloom spray of cypermethrin (T₄) emerged as the most economic treatment during both the years with B: C ratio of 3.7: 1 and 4.9: 1.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLipaphis erysimi 3acarbofuran 3acarbosulfan 3acypermethrin 3aimidacloprid 3ainsect control 3aseed yield 3asoil treatment 0aMustard aphid 0apost-bloom sprays 0ainsecticidal treatments1 aKumar, Swaroop0 tIndian journal of plant protection.g2013 Mar., v. 41, no. 1 p.11-15dPlant Protection Association of IndiawJournal:2004x2249-78707nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02526naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003900135040001800174100001800192245012000210500001900330506007600349520110600425592002801531506003701559650001501596650002801611650002001639650001501659650001601674650001101690650001601701650001401717653001701731653001801748653001901766700001701785700002001802700002001822700002001842700001901862773009201881856008601973852000902059655001202068IND60690884020221207134200.0201230e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069088402DNAL7 a311934712pmid7 aPMC65297202pmcid7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e017022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Sanjay10aInvestigation of nanoparticle immobilized cellulase: nanoparticle identity, linker length and polyphenol hydrolysis  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCellulase containing nanobiocatalysts have been useful as an extraction tool based on their ability to disrupt plant cell walls. In this work, we investigate the effect of nanoparticle composition and chemical linkage towards immobilized cellulase activity. Cellulase nanoconstructs have been prepared, characterized and compared for their loading efficiencies with standard assays and enzyme kinetics and correlate well with the cognate loading efficiencies. Application of the cellulase-immobilized nanoparticles on onion skins results in release of a distinctive composition of polyphenols. The aglycosidic form of quercetin is the dominant product of onion skin hydrolysis affected by cellulase nanobiocatalysts. Chitosan-coated iron oxide nanoparticles with APTES-conjugated cellulase are found to be most effective for polyphenol release and for transformation of glycosidic to aglycosidic form of quercetin. These results shed light on the activity of immobilized cellulase beyond their role in cell wall disruption and are important for the practical application of cellulase nanobiocatalysts.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acell walls 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aenzyme kinetics 3ahydrolysis 3airon oxides 3aonions 3apolyphenols 3aquercetin 0aBiochemistry 0aBiotechnology 0aBioengineering1 aMorya, Vinod1 aGadhavi, Joshna1 aVishnoi, Anjani1 aSingh, Jaskaran1 aDatta, Bhaskar0 tHeliyon.g2019 May, v. 5, no. 5 p.e01702-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e017023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03208naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005600139245008500195300001600280500001900296500002000315520178300335592002802118650001602146650002602162650001202188650001602200650002102216650001502237650001702252650001902269650002102288650001702309650001302326650001602339650001902355650002102374650001802395650002102413650001302434700002502447700006002472773012402532856007302656852000902729655001202738IND60732537020221120123838.0210330e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073253702DNAL7 a10.1111/ppl.133802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoyal, Vinod1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7325-191410aEmerging warriors against salinity in plants: Nitric oxide and hydrogen sulphide  ap. 896-908.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe agriculture sector is vulnerable to various environmental stresses, which significantly affect plant growth, performance, and development. Abiotic stresses, such as salinity and drought, cause severe losses in crop productivity worldwide. Soil salinity is a major stress suppressing plant development through osmotic stress accompanied by ion toxicity, nutritional imbalance, and oxidative stress. Various defense mechanisms like osmolytes accumulations, activation of stress‐induced genes, and transcription factors, production of plant growth hormones, accumulation of antioxidants, and redox defense system in plants are responsible for combating salt stress. Nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen sulphide (H₂S) have emerged as novel bioactive gaseous signaling molecules that positively impact seed germination, homeostasis, plant metabolism, growth, and development, and are involved in several plant acclimation responses to impart stress tolerance in plants. NO and H₂S trigger cell signaling by activating a cascade of biochemical events that result in plant tolerance to environmental stresses. NO‐ and H₂S‐mediated signaling networks, interactions, and crosstalks facilitate stress tolerance in plants. Research on the roles and mechanisms of NO and H₂S as challengers of salinity is entering an exponential exploration era. The present review focuses on the current knowledge of the mechanisms of stress tolerance in plants and the role of NO and H₂S in adaptive plant responses to salt stress and provides an overview of the signaling mechanisms and interplay of NO and H₂S in the regulation of growth and development as well as modulation of defense responses in plants and their long term priming effects for imparting salinity tolerance in plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacclimation 3aagricultural industry 3adrought 3ahomeostasis 3ahydrogen sulfide 3ametabolism 3anitric oxide 3aosmotic stress 3aoxidative stress 3aplant growth 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3aseed germination 3asoil salinity 3astress tolerance 3atoxicity1 aJhanghel, Dharmendra1 aMehrotra, Shweta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4869-36220 tPhysiologia plantarum.g2021 Apr., v. 171, no. 4 p.896-908dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl52817x0031-93177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ppl.133803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03699naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002300176245009700199300001500296520212300311592002802434650001002462650001502472650001902487650001402506650001402520650001002534650001802544650001502562650001602577650000802593650001202601650002702613650001302640650001102653650001502664650001502679700001602694700002002710700002102730700002002751700002102771700002102792773015202813856007002965856010203035990002303137852000903160655001203169IND60608613820221120164643.0190510e20171121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060861382DNAL7 a10.3791/565792doi7 aPMC57554522pmcid7 a292864522pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaiman, Melissa I.10aEsophageal heat transfer for patient temperature control and targeted temperature management  ap. e56579.  aControlling patient temperature is important for a wide variety of clinical conditions. Cooling to normal or below normal body temperature is often performed for neuroprotection after ischemic insult (e.g. hemorrhagic stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, cardiac arrest, or other hypoxic injury). Cooling from febrile states treats fever and reduces the negative effects of hyperthermia on injured neurons. Patients are warmed in the operating room to prevent inadvertent perioperative hypothermia, which is known to cause increased blood loss, wound infections, and myocardial injury, while also prolonging recovery time. There are many reported approaches for temperature management, including improvised methods that repurpose standard supplies (e.g., ice, chilled saline, fans, blankets) but more sophisticated technologies designed for temperature management are typically more successful in delivering an optimized protocol. Over the last decade, advanced technologies have developed around two heat transfer methods: surface devices (water blankets, forced-air warmers) or intravascular devices (sterile catheters requiring vascular placement). Recently, a novel device became available that is placed in the esophagus, analogous to a standard orogastric tube, that provides efficient heat transfer through the patient's core. The device connects to existing heat exchange units to allow automatic patient temperature management via a servo mechanism, using patient temperature from standard temperature sensors (rectal, Foley, or other core temperature sensors) as the input variable. This approach eliminates vascular placement complications (deep venous thrombosis, central line associated bloodstream infection), reduces obstruction to patient access, and causes less shivering when compared to surface approaches. Published data have also shown a high degree of accuracy and maintenance of target temperature using the esophageal approach to temperature management. Therefore, the purpose of this method is to provide a low-risk alternative method for controlling patient temperature in critical care settings.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3ablood flow 3acardiac arrest 3acatheters 3aesophagus 3afever 3aheat transfer 3ahemorrhage 3ahypothermia 3aice 3aneurons 3aneuroprotective effect 3apatients 3astroke 3atechnology 3athrombosis1 aGray, Maria1 aHaymore, Joseph1 aHegazy, Ahmed F.1 aMarkota, Andrej1 aBadjatia, Neeraj1 aKulstad, Erik B.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2017 Nov. 21, , no. 129 p.e56579-e56579dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/565793Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/56579/esophageal-heat-transfer-for-patient-temperature-control-targeted  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02179naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245009900175300001600274520105500290592002801345650001401373650004401387650002001431650001501451650003101466653001601497653002501513653001501538653001401553700002501567700002201592773012101614856008501735852000901820655001201829IND60524196320221122230128.0160705e20160503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052419632DNAL7 a10.1080/10256016.2016.11058012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWinnicka, Elżbieta10aSynthesis of deuterium-labelled halogen derivatives of L-tryptophan catalysed by tryptophanase  ap. 231-238.  aThe isotopomers of halogen derivatives of l -tryptophan (l -Trp) (4′-F-, 7′-F-, 5′-Cl- and 7′-Br- l -Trp), specifically labelled with deuterium in α -position of the side chain, were obtained by enzymatic coupling of the corresponding halogenated derivatives of indole with S -methyl- l -cysteine in ²H ₂O, catalysed by enzyme tryptophanase (EC 4.1.99.1). The positional deuterium enrichment of the resulting tryptophan derivatives was controlled using ¹H NMR. In accordance with the mechanism of the lyase reaction, a 100% deuterium labelling was observed in the α -position; the chemical yields were between 23 and 51%. Furthermore, β -F- l -alanine, synthesized from β -F-pyruvic acid by the l -alanine dehydrogenase reaction, has been tested as a coupling agent to obtain the halogenated deuterium-labelled derivatives of l -Trp. The chemical yield (∼30%) corresponded to that as observed with S -methyl- l -cysteine but the deuterium label was only 63%, probably due to the use of a not completely deuterated incubation medium.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeuterium 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3astable isotopes 3atryptophan 3atryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase 0aamino acids 0adeuterated compounds 0ahydrogen-2 0asynthesis1 aSzymańska, Jolanta,1 aKańska, Marianna0 tIsotopes in Environmental and Health Studies.g2016 May 3, v. 52, no. 3 p.231-238dTaylor & Francisx1477-26397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10256016.2016.11058013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01753naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005800142245006400200300001800264520065200282592002800934650001900962650001200981650001300993650001301006650002701019650001201046650001101058700006601069700006101135773014601196856007601342852000901418655001201427IND60627166120190520000000.0190128e20181214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062716612DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.8b123182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Weiqiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9497-637810aMetal-Free Transfer Hydroiodination of C–C Multiple Bonds  ap. 1135-1140.  aThe design and a gram-scale synthesis of a bench-stable cyclohexa-1,4-diene-based surrogate of gaseous hydrogen iodide are described.

The surrogate fragments into toluene and ethylene, easy-to-remove volatile waste. This hydroiodination reaction avoids precarious handling of hydrogen iodide or hydroiodic acid.

A key component of these processes is the ability to inject high temperature steam into the formation to fracture it which in turn raises its permeability and mobilizes the oil by lowering its viscosity. The dynamics of steam fracturing are not fully resolved especially how steam fingers into the reservoir and how its state changes as heat losses occur from the injected steam. The results of this study reveal that steam condensate, pressurized by the steam vapour upstream, fractures the formation. The results also show that dilation of the reservoir during steam injection relieves the pressure which in turn lowers the steam injection pressure below that of the case where no dilation occurs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acondensates 3aheat 3aoil fields 3aoil sands 3aoils 3apermeability 3asteam 3atemperature 3aviscosity 3aAlberta 3aChina 0aOil sands 0aCyclic steam simulation 0aSteam injection 0aSteam fracturing 0aBitumen 0aHeavy oil1 aWang, Jingyi1 aGates, Ian D.0 tEnergy.g2016 Nov. 15, v. 115 p.969-985dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2016.09.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02752naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245011400165300001800279500001900297520136700316592002801683650001901711650001401730650001501744650002001759650001101779650001301790650002401803650002001827653003001847653002101877653001901898653002001917700005701937700005501994700005502049773014402104856008502248852000902333655001202342IND60741504620221122002445.0210615e20210604xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074150462DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c027262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Xin10aCo and Mo Co-doped Fe₂O₃ for Selective Ethylene Production via Chemical Looping Oxidative Dehydrogenation  ap. 8002-8011.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this study, we investigate Co and/or Mo doped Fe₂O₃ (CoₓMo₁–ₓ/Fe₂O₃, x = 0, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 1) as redox catalysts for chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) of ethane. Under the cyclic redox reaction mode, the five as-prepared samples behave differently toward ethane conversion. Among the five redox catalysts, CoFe₂O₄ (x = 1) is highly reactive and tends to overoxidize ethane into CO₂, while Mo/Fe₂O₃ (x = 0) exhibits promising ethylene selectivity but inferior H₂ removal capability. By tuning the molar ratio of Co/(Co + Mo), 87.4% ethylene selectivity at 56.2% ethane conversion can be achieved by the Co₀.₃Mo₀.₇/Fe₂O₃ (x = 0.3) redox catalyst at 825 °C and 6000 h–¹. C₂H₆-TPR results show that the selectivity of Co₀.₃Mo₀.₇/Fe₂O₃ alters as the ODH reaction proceeds due to the dynamic change of surface properties of the redox catalyst in the reaction. XPS results indicate that a relatively low Fe content as well as a high Mo content at the near-surface of the redox catalyst is beneficial for its ethylene selectivity in CL-ODH of ethane. DFT calculations reveal that Co cations in the Co₀.₃Mo₀.₇/Fe₂O₃ structure are responsible for the activity and H₂ combustion capability of the redox catalyst, while Mo plays a key role in tuning the ethylene selectivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3acombustion 3adehydrogenation 3aethane 3aethylene 3aethylene production 3agreen chemistry 0aoxidative dehydrogenation 0achemical looping 0aredox catalyst 0aDFT calculation1 aZheng, Chaohe1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9850-95901 aLi, Fanxing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2580-04211 aZhao, Haibo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2693-44990 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2021 June 04, v. 9, no. 23 p.8002-8011dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c027263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01491naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001500112245008300127300001400210520050800224592002800732650002500760650001400785650001600799650002600815650001500841650001700856653002000873653002500893653002300918700001900941700001900960700002200979773014301001852000901144655001201153IND60710322020221121164512.0200908e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071032202DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJemimah, N10aBioefficacy of Newer Insecticides Against Safflower Aphid Uroleucon compositae  ap. 30-32.  aField trial was conducted to evaluate comparative efficacy of newer insecticidal molecules against safflower aphid, Uroleucon compositae (Theobald).

It comprises several species which are native to the Mediterranean region and can serve as valuable medicinal plants, because of their biological and pharmacological properties. In fact, the local populations often use it for different medicinal purposes, as expectorant, antiseptic, antispasmodic, carminative, cardiac, antirheumatic, and diuretic. Many natural compounds extracted from Thymus display biological activities, with relevance to essential oils (EOs) which have arouse much interest. Thymus-derived EOs and their components have numerous applications as natural agents in food preservation, while also displaying antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral properties. They are very interesting worldwide as potential sources of novel antimicrobial compounds to serve as alternatives to treat infectious diseases. However, there is not yet a thorough review of this genus from Iran. The present review was, therefore, conducted to discuss EO components, its biological activity, and to refer the molecular studies performed until present. This review is mainly meant to provide relevant information on the phytochemical features of Iranian Thymus species, with emphasis on EO, providing guidance for the selection of accessions or species with the best chemical profiles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLamiaceae 3aanti-infective agents 3aantiseptics 3aantiviral properties 3aessential oils 3afood preservation 3ainfectious diseases 3amedicinal plants 3amedicinal properties 3aparasympatholytics 3aIran 3aMediterranean region 0aAntimicrobial 0aBioactive component 0aEssential oil 0aIran 0aThymus1 aRahimmalek, Mehdi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5853-83621 aTrindade, Helena1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1209-26220 tIndustrial crops and products.g2019 Aug., v. 134 p.89-99dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2019.02.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03054naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245010400207520166900311592002801980650002402008650001502032650001302047650002102060650002202081650002102103650002002124650000702144650002002151653004602171653003402217653004702251653002102298653002502319653001802344700003102362700001802393700001702411773011202428856008302540852000902623655001202632IND60781480720221120095232.0220726e20221015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078148072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2022.1144952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorlock, Sascha1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5675-438410aBio-inorganic hybrid structures for direct electron transfer to photosystem I in photobioelectrodes  aSynthetic materials can be combined with biological components in many ways. One example that provides scientists with multiple challenges is a photobioelectrode that converts sunlight into electrons in a biohybrid approach. In the present study several key parameters are evaluated concerning their influence on the direct electron transfer from a 3D indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode material to photosystem I (PSI) as a light-harvesting biomolecule. In contrast to previous investigations, no mediating molecule is added to shuttle the electrons to the luminal side of PSI. Thus, this setup is less complex than foregoing ones. The solution composition drastically influences the interaction of PSI with the ITO surface. Here, the application of higher buffer concentrations and the addition of salts are advantageous, whereas the nature of the buffer ions plays a minor role. The artificial electrode material's thickness is adjustable since a spin-coating procedure is used for preparation. With a 30 μm thick structure and immobilized PSI cathodic photocurrents up to 10.1 μA cm⁻² are obtained at 100 mW cm⁻² illumination intensity and an applied potential of −0.1V vs. Ag/AgCl. Over a period of three days the photobioelectrodes are illuminated for a total of 90 min and stored between the measurements at ambient temperature. The stability of the setup is noteworthy as still about 90% of the photocurrent is retained. The photocathode described here offers many positive features, including a high onset potential for the photocurrent starting sligthly above the redox potentail of P700, and applicability in a wide pH range from pH 5 to 8.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3abiosensors 3acathodes 3aelectric current 3aelectron transfer 3aindium tin oxide 3alight intensity 3apH 3asolar radiation 0aDirect electron transfer of photosystem I 0aBiohybrid photovoltaic system 0aSemitransparent three-dimensional material 0aIndium tin oxide 0aSolution composition 0apH dependence1 aSubramanian, Senthil Kumar1 aZouni, Athina1 aLisdat, Fred0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2022 Oct. 15, v. 214 p.114495-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2022.1144953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02821naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245008500169300001600254520117700270592002801447650000801475650001101483650001401494650001301508650001601521650001501537650001401552650001101566650000901577650001601586650001101602650002301613650000901636650001301645650002001658650001101678650001801689650001501707650001101722653002101733653001601754653001501770653002201785653001401807653001801821653002201839653001801861653002201879700001601901700001701917700001601934700002201950700002001972773012101992856008502113852000902198655001202207IND60524196520221122230227.0160705e20160503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052419652DNAL7 a10.1080/10256016.2016.11253502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Congjian10aSpatial and temporal characteristics of stable isotopes in the Tarim River Basin  ap. 281-297.  aBy using 233 isotope samples, we investigated the spatial and temporal variations of δ ¹⁸O and δ ²H in precipitation and surface water, and the contribution of different water sources in the rivers within the Tarim River Basin (TRB), which receives snow/glacier meltwater, groundwater, and rainfall. Our study revealed a similar seasonal pattern of precipitation δ ¹⁸O and δ ²H at both the north and south edges of the basin, indicating the dominant effect of westerly air masses in the summer and the combined influence of westerly and polar air masses during the winter, although the southern part showed more complex precipitation processes in the summer. River water in the basin has relatively large temporal variations in both δ ¹⁸O and δ ²H showing a distinct seasonal pattern with lower isotope values in May than in September. Higher d -excess values throughout the year in the Aksu river and the Tizinafu river suggest that water may be intensively recycled in the mountains of the TRB. Based on isotopic hydrograph separation, we found that groundwater is the main water source that discharges the entire basin although individual rivers vary.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abasins 3adeuterium 3aglaciers 3agroundwater 3ahydrograph 3amountains 3aoxygen 3arain 3ariver water 3arivers 3aseasonal variation 3asnow 3asnowmelt 3astable isotopes 3asummer 3asurface water 3awatersheds 3awinter 0adeuterium excess 0agroundwater 0ahydrogen-2 0aisotope hydrology 0aoxygen-18 0aprecipitation 0arunoff components 0asurface water 0aTarim River Basin1 aLi, Xingong1 aChen, Yaning1 aLi, Weihong1 aStotler, Randy L.1 aZhang, Yongqing0 tIsotopes in Environmental and Health Studies.g2016 May 3, v. 52, no. 3 p.281-297dTaylor & Francisx1477-26397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10256016.2016.11253503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02336naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100001700162245009400179300001600273500001900289500000900308520116300317592002801480650001301508650001301521650001701534650002501551650000901576650001501585650001501600650001501615650001501630650001401645650002001659650001101679700002001690773012201710856009701832852000901929655001201938IND60663771320221121043324.0191122e196907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066377132DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1969.00021962006100040012x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShear, G.

Equal annual applications of phosphate mixed in the tilled soil and applied to the surface of untilled soil resulted in more available phosphorus accumulation in the upper 5 cm of the untilled soil. The total amount of available phosphorus for the upper 20 cm of soil was greater in untilled soil despite the fact that available phosphorus was lower than in tilled soil in two of the 5-cm increments below the surface layer. Potassium availability was not affected by tillage or method of application. Soil compaction after six years as based on bulk density showed no difference related to tillage. The maintenance of high yields of corn in successive years without tillage was shown. There was no benefit from tillage in alternate years as compared with no tillage. An average increase in corn grain yields and equal or better stover yields from no tillage as compared with conventional tillage was found. The need for more frequent liming with the no-tillage method was demonstrated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3aagronomy 3abulk density 3aconventional tillage 3acorn 3aloam soils 3ano-tillage 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3asoil compaction 3astover1 aMoschler, W.

In this work, an electrochemical quantitative polymerase chain reaction (E-PCR) platform was developed for multiplexed and quantitative SbM analysis in limited and precious samples with single-nucleotide discrimination. A locked nucleic acid (LNA)-mediated multiplexed PCR system in a single, closed tube setup was firstly constructed to selectively amplify the SbM genes while suppressing the wild-type alleles. The amplicons were detected simultaneously through hybridization with the sequence-specific hairpin probes anchored on a reduced graphene oxide-gold nanoparticles functionalized electrode surface. With the inclusion of an LNA-mediated PCR step upstream of the electrochemical detection, we improved the limit of detection (LOD) by 2 orders of magnitude, down to an ultralow-level of 5 copies μL⁻¹. The platform achieved an ultra-sensitive and specific detection with 0.05% against a background of 10, 000 copies of wild-type alleles. It is highly adaptive and has the potential to enable expanded multiplexed detection in parallel, thus providing a universal tool for multiplexed SbM identification.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3agraphene 3ahybridization 3amutation 3amutational analysis 3anucleic acids 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 0aSingle-based mutation 0aMultiplexed detection 0aE-PCR platform 0aLNA-Mediated PCR1 aSun, Hong1 aXu, Gaolian1 aGuan, Mengdi1 aZhang, Qingyang1 aWang, Zhiying1 aDong, Zaizai1 aChen, Wenhui1 aYang, Xiaoxiao1 aQiao, Anbang1 aFan, Yubo1 aCai, Xinxia1 aChen, Zhou1 aChang, Lingqian1 aWei, Bo0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2022 Oct. 15, v. 214 p.114496-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2022.1144963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03100naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100005700138245014100195300001600336500002000352520158600372592002801958596007901986650002002065650001902085650001802104650002302122650001402145650001002159650001202169650002202181650002002203650001902223650002402242650001602266651001202282700005502294700005702349700005602406773012202462856007302584852000902657655001202666IND60789448120221119003452.0220820e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078944812DNAL7 a10.1002/osp4.1632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElbe, A.‐M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8392-245110aCorrelates and predictors of obesity‐specific quality of life of former participants of a residential intensive lifestyle intervention  ap. 188-193.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aINTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between weight loss during and after a unique type of weight loss intervention, namely, a residential intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI), and participants' obesity‐specific health‐related quality of life (HRQOL) several years after the intervention. In the residential ILI under investigation, participants attended a 10‐ to 12‐week long course away from their daily living environment, namely, at Ubberup Folk High School located in Denmark. METHODS: A total of 79 former participants (31 male, mean age 36.6; SD = 12.7 years) who had participated in the intervention on average 5.3 (SD = 3.2) years ago were recruited for this study. They completed a questionnaire on weight‐related quality of life (IWQOL‐lite) and physical activity, as well as measurements of VO₂max, blood pressure, Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance, waist circumference and hand grip strength. RESULTS: The study results showed that weight change after the end of the intervention could predict HRQOL whereas how much weight they lost during the intervention could not. Furthermore, almost all of the investigated physiological factors were related to participants' current HRQOL. Waist circumference showed relationships with four of the five aspects of HRQOL. CONCLUSION: Focusing on behavioural change, adhering to improved lifestyle and maintaining weight loss after the end of the intervention seem to be the key not only for cardio‐metabolic risk factors but also for sustainable HRQOL.  aPublisher supplied data  cUniversity of Copenhagen Excellence Program for Interdisciplinary Research 3abehavior change 3ablood pressure 3ahand strength 3ainsulin resistance 3alifestyle 3amales 3aobesity 3aphysical activity 3aquality of life 3aquestionnaires 3awaist circumference 3aweight loss 3aDenmark1 aElsborg, P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1770-22741 aDandanell, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6412-25071 aHelge, J.

This study aims to evaluate China’s grain yield (GY) from 2000 to 2014 and investigate the potential driving factors (PDFs) that affect the spatial-temporal dynamics of GY, including land, labor force, capital, and macro-background. Specifically, the locational Gini coefficient and exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) were used to characterize the spatial patterns of GY and its correlations with PDFs. Spatial regression models (SRMs) were employed to investigate the spatial dependence of GY on each PDF in 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2014. Results reveal that China’s grain production has been on the rise with high-yield regions distributed mainly within the northeastern agricultural regions. Moreover, the proportion of counties in the northeastern agricultural regions with high grain yield has increased, while the number of low-yielding counties has increased in other agricultural regions. This finding highlights the increasing trend of spatial polarization in grain production. The significant bivariate Moran’s I (p < 0.05) further revealed a global spatial spillover effect in the spatial correlation of GY and four PDFs. The spatial correlations could be categorized into four types: high GY and high PDFs, high GY and low PDFs, low GY and high PDFs, and low GY and low PDFs. SRMs were capable of quantifying the spatial dependence of GY on various PDFs, thereby revealing that land factors had a substantial effect on the grain production dynamics nationwide. The exploration of the spatial relationships between GY and PDFs provide a reference for formulating scientific and reasonable agricultural policies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapital 3afood security 3agrain yield 3alabor force 3aland use planning 3aregression analysis 3aspatial data 3asustainable development 3aChina 0aFood security 0aGrain yield 0aPotential driving forces 0aESDA 0aCounty1 aChen, Yiyun1 aZhang, Yan1 aChen, Min1 aFennell, Shailaja1 aLuan, Bo1 aWang, Feng1 aMeng, Dan1 aLiu, Yaolin1 aJiao, Limin1 aWang, Jing0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 May 10, v. 255 p.120312-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1203123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02129naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245013300174520089700307592002801204650002301232650001201255650001301267650001101280650001301291650001301304650001501317650001101332650001601343653001101359653001501370653001801385653001901403653002801422700002501450700002301475700001901498773010801517856008501625852000901710655001201719IND60661614520221122235804.0200210e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066161452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2019.1062002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHashmi, Syed Farhan10aInfluence of reaction conditions on solvolysis of organosolv lignin using water and green organic co-solvents as reaction medium  aThis study investigated the non-catalyzed solvolysis of sulphur free organosolv lignin using mixtures of organic solvents (methanol, ethanol and 2-methyltetrahydrofuran) and water with emphasis on the novel biphasic 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MTHF)/water reaction medium. The effect of co-solvents, co-solvent-to-water ratio and temperature were studied. 2-MTHF proved to be effective co-solvent with water that significantly suppressed char formation and also demonstrated promising protection effect on monoaromatic compounds. The yield of solvolyzed lignin (SL) and char were in the range of 40.0–88.6% and 10.4–0.1% respectively, based on initial amount of dried lignin.

In most of the field studies reported, the N-fertilizer used with no-tillage has been ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulfate, or ammonium-based mixed fertilizers. We conducted field experiments for 3 years on three moderately well-drained Mattapex, Bertie, and Delanco silt loam soils (all Aquic Hapludults), comparing topdressed UG, UP, UAN solution (30% N), and AN at four N rates (45, 90, 135, and 180 kg/ha) on yields of continuous corn (Zea mays L). A zero N plot was included in each of the four replicates. Yields were significantly higher from AN than from other N sources in 1978 at Forage Farm and in 1976 and 1978 at Wye Institute. Average yield from UAN exceeded that from UP and UG at Wye Institute. In 1978, when rainfall was above normal, even at the highest rate of N (180 kg/ha) total N uptake was barely sufficient to obtain maximum yields at Forage Farm and Poplar Hill and was clearly inadequate at Wye Institute. With 180 kg/ha of N applied, N%TDM when gain had reached the dough stage was about 0.9 at Wye Institute and 1.1 at the other sites. Values associated with estimated maximum yields generally exceed 1.2%. In 1978, estimated recoveries of applied N were higher from AN than from the other N sources at Wye Institute and Forage Farm.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHapludults 3aPopulus 3aZea mays 3aagronomy 3aammonium nitrate 3aammonium sulfate 3acorn 3afarms 3aforage 3ano-tillage 3arain 3asilt loam soils 3atotal nitrogen 3aurea 3aurea ammonium nitrate1 aDzienia, Stanislaw1 aStanford, George0 tAgronomy journal.g1980 Mar., v. 72, no. 2 p.337-341dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj1980.00021962007200020020x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03020naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245010000171520181400271592002802085650001502113650001202128650001902140650001302159650001302172650001302185650001402198650001102212650002002223650001902243650001702262650001102279653001602290653000902306653002602315653001902341700001702360700001402377773011202391856008602503852000902589655001202598IND60683673220221123000625.0200412e20200520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068367322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1203142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Guixiang10aChanges in abiotic dissipation rates and bound fractions of antibiotics in biochar-amended soil  aTo understand the impacts of molecular structures and biochar types on abiotic dissipation and bound fractions of antibiotics in soil, nine biochar types were applied into a soil contaminated with 16 antibiotics. In soil without biochar, the abiotic dissipation rates of antibiotics were generally tetracyclines (TCs) > sulfonamides (SAs) > quinolones (QLs). The trend was quite consistent with the total amounts of oxygen (O), nitrogen (N) and/or sulphur (S) atoms in antibiotic molecular structures. The dissipation trends of TCs (excluding oxytetracycline) and QLs (excluding ofloxacin) were just opposite the order of their logKₒw values, indicating that hydrophobic adsorption played the key role in their abiotic dissipation. The reason why oxytetracycline and ofloxacin were unique is they had one more O-containing functional group, when compared with the other TCs and QLs, respectively, resulting in their different hydrophobic adsorption affinities. For SAs, sulfadiazine and sulfachinoxalin had the highest and lowest abiotic dissipation rates, respectively. QLs and TCs were the dominant tightly bound fractions, while molecular structures influenced the bound fractions of SAs. In biochar-treated soils, biochars produced at 250 °C generally had a positive effect on the abiotic dissipation rates of antibiotics. The effect sizes of biochars produced at 400 °C and 600 °C for the abiotic dissipation of antibiotics were influenced by both biochar type and antibiotic molecular structure. Biochar type had the strongest impact on SA bound fractions, followed by TCs, while it had minimal influence on QLs. Biochars generally decreased the apparent distribution coefficients (Kₐₚₚ) of antibiotics in soil, indicating an increase in antibiotic leaching following biochar addition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abiochar 3ahydrophobicity 3aleaching 3amoieties 3anitrogen 3aofloxacin 3aoxygen 3aoxytetracycline 3apolluted soils 3asulfadiazine 3asulfur 0aAntibiotics 0aFate 0aSequential extraction 0aPotential risk1 aZhao, Zhihua1 aZhu, Yuen0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 May 20, v. 256 p.120314-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1203143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03902naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245014800172300001600320520191300336592002802249650001602277650002502293650001702318650001402335650003602349650001702385650001802402650002002420650001202440650001602452650001302468650001302481650001102494650001102505650002802516650002602544650002102570650001702591650001402608650002602622650002902648650001702677651001702694653000802711653000802719653001202727653001202739653000802751653002002759653001502779653002502794653001702819653002302836653001502859700002002874700001602894700001802910700001502928700006402943773011403007856008603121852000903207655001203216IND60634391020221119194438.0190410e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063439102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2019.03.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZonyane, Samkele10aGeographic-based metabolomic variation and toxicity analysis of Sutherlandia frutescens L. R.Br. – An emerging medicinal crop in South Africa  ap. 414-423.  aSutherlandia frutescens (syn. Lessertia frutescens), an indigenous southern African species, is important for the local and global phytomedicine's industry. As farming of medicinal plants in South Africa is not extensive, wild populations are also used as a source of material to bulk available cultivated yields prior to industrial processing. This may cause inconsistency in the quality of medicinal products derived from this species, inducing discrepancies in the plant’s therapeutic profile. The current study aimed to elucidate the phytochemical variations among S. frutescens plants growing in different geographical localities, especially in areas which have not been studied before. One set of extracts were generated using a 50% acetonitrile and formic acid solution (0.1%) (v/v). By using a targeted metabolomics approach, two major phytochemical groups, sutherlandins and sutherlandiosides were used to display metabolite-based clusters after LC–MS/MS analysis. Plants from different geographical locations grouped into separate chemical lineages. Another set of ethanol and aqueous extracts of pooled leaf materials were screened for their toxicity effect on the hatching rate of zebrafish embryos and mortality of larvae at different concentrations, ranging from 5 to 300 μg ml−1. We also calculated the LC50 values using a zebrafish microplate bioassay and this value was 297.57 μg ml−1 for the water extract. The aqueous extracts were relatively less toxic compared to ethanol extracts (LC50 value of 40.54 μg ml−1). Both the hatching rate and mortality were negatively affected by increasing extract dosages. The highest concentrations, between 200 to 300 μg ml−1, caused acute lethal effects for both extract types. This study adds additional evidence of the cytotoxicity reported by others in this species and will further aid in the domestication of S. frutescens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aLessertia frutescens 3aacetonitrile 3abioassays 3achemical constituents of plants 3acytotoxicity 3adomestication 3aembryo (animal) 3aethanol 3aformic acid 3ahatching 3aindustry 3alarvae 3aleaves 3alethal concentration 50 3aliquid chromatography 3amedicinal plants 3ametabolomics 3amortality 3aprocessing technology 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atherapeutics 3aSouth Africa 0adpf 0ahpf 0aLC–MS 0aOPLS-DA 0aPCA 0aBotanical drugs 0aFlavonoids 0aMetabolite profiling 0aNutraceutics 0aPlant metabolomics 0aTerpenoids1 aChen, Longsheng1 aXu, Min-Jie1 aGong, Zhu-Nan1 aXu, Shuwen1 aMakunga, Nokwanda P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1507-251X0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2019 July, v. 133 p.414-423dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2019.03.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01487naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100001800162245010000180300001600280500001900296500000900315520048800324592002800812650002600840650001300866650001100879650002400890651001100914700001900925773012300944856009701067852000901164655001201173IND60663771720221120063221.0191122e195609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066377172DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1956.00021962004800090009x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNjøs, Arnor,10aStandard Errors of Field Experiments at the Farm Crop Institute, Agricultural College of Norway  ap. 416-418.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aepub  aSynopsisIn calculating standard errors for 349 experiments carried out in 1951-54, average C.V. values varied from 7.1% in barley trials to 14.5% in timothy trials, second cut.

Total E values over the cropping season for rice (BI, BI ᵢ) were the highest (>600 mm), while those for sugar beet (DI), maize (SI and DI) and berseem (BI ᵢ) were the lowest (<250 mm). The differences were due to a combination of atmospheric demand, soil moisture, the presence of surface standing water, root depth, and the length and timing of the cropping season. The DI and SI methods had the advantage for water saving, while the FI ᵢ and BI ᵢ methods were effective for crops with shallow root lengths.

In this study, chemical composition of essential oils from medicinal plants namely Acorus calamus, Allium sativum, Mucuna pruriens, and Sesamum indicum L showed invitro antibacterial and antifungal properties against fruits spoilage microbes were evaluated. Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometry analysis confirmed the presence of major metabolites namely Hydroxylamine (98.26%), 1,2,4 - trimethoxy-5-1-propenyl (93.07%), Dodecanoic acid, 1,2,3-propanetriyl ester (92.64) and 2-diisoprophylphosphinnoethane (67.97%) from the studied plants. The minimum inhibitory concentration of the essential oils against bacteria were ranged from 11.3 ± 2.3 to 617 ± 4.9 μg/ml and fungi were ranged from 1.1 ± 0.4 to 292 ± 3.2 μg/ml, respectively. Among the essential oil, Allium sativum showed significant antibacterial activity with least minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentrations (11.3 ± 2.3 μg/ml and 24 ± 1.6 μg/ml) while Sesamum indicum oil showed the least activity with high minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentrations values (460 ± 11.9 μg/ml and 940 ± 12.8 μg/ml). Interestingly, Allium sativum documented the highest antifungal activity against Penicillium notatum and also significantly inhibited the growth of other tested fungal species such as, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus and Rhizopus microsporus. Among all tested essential oils, in combination of studied antibiotics, essential oils from Allium sativum showed excellent synergistic activity against seven out of nine spoilage microbes. Two-way analysis of variance showed significant depletion of pathogenic microorganism due to the effect of essential oils (p < 0.05). In addition, essential oil from Allium sativum significantly reduced the growth of Aspertillus flavus and Aspergillus niger on plum fruit. Results revealed the application of essential oil from Allium sativum counter Aspergillus flavus growth and prevented deterioration of plum fruit.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcorus calamus 3aAllium sativum 3aAspergillus flavus 3aAspergillus niger 3aMucuna pruriens 3aPenicillium chrysogenum 3aRhizopus microsporus 3aSesamum indicum 3aanalysis of variance 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotics 3aantifungal properties 3abacteria 3achemical composition 3adodecanoic acid 3aessential oils 3afruits 3afungi 3ahydroxylamine 3amedicinal plants 3ametabolites 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3aoils 3aplums 3aspectroscopy 3aspoilage bacteria 3asynergism 0aEssential oils 0aAntimicrobial activity 0aSynergistic activity 0aFruit spoilage 0aProtein leakage 0aPlum fruit1 aViayaraghavan, Ponnuswamy1 aIlavenil, Soundarrajan1 aAl-Dhabi, Naif Abdullah1 aChoi, Ki Choon1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8071-50970 tIndustrial crops and products.g2019 July, v. 133 p.54-62dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2019.03.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03398naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002200176245012700198300001500325520181400340592002802154650001302182650001002195650002402205650002302229650001102252650000902263650001102272650002002283650001302303650001102316650001402327650001202341650001002353650001302363700001902376700001802395700002202413700002002435700002102455700002302476700002202499773015202521856007002673856010502743990002302848852000902871655001202880IND60608614120221120164640.0190510e20171119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060861412DNAL7 a10.3791/565842doi7 aPMC57554282pmcid7 a292864582pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMégevand, Pierre10aSurgical training for the implantation of neocortical microelectrode arrays using a formaldehyde-fixed human cadaver model  ap. e56584.  aThis protocol describes a procedure to assist surgeons in training for the implantation of microelectrode arrays into the neocortex of the human brain. Recent technological progress has enabled the fabrication of microelectrode arrays that allow recording the activity of multiple individual neurons in the neocortex of the human brain. These arrays have the potential to bring unique insight onto the neuronal correlates of cerebral function in health and disease. Furthermore, the identification and decoding of volitional neuronal activity opens the possibility to establish brain-computer interfaces, and thus might help restore lost neurological functions. The implantation of neocortical microelectrode arrays is an invasive procedure requiring a supra-centimetric craniotomy and the exposure of the cortical surface; thus, the procedure must be performed by an adequately trained neurosurgeon. In order to provide an opportunity for surgical training, we designed a procedure based on a human cadaver model. The use of a formaldehyde-fixed human cadaver bypasses the practical, ethical and financial difficulties of surgical practice on animals (especially non-human primates) while preserving the macroscopic structure of the head, skull, meninges and cerebral surface and allowing realistic, operating room-like positioning and instrumentation. Furthermore, the use of a human cadaver is closer to clinical daily practice than any non-human model. The major drawbacks of the cadaveric simulation are the absence of cerebral pulsation and of blood and cerebrospinal fluid circulation. We suggest that a formaldehyde-fixed human cadaver model is an adequate, practical and cost-effective approach to ensure proper surgical training before implanting microelectrode arrays in the living human neocortex.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPrimates 3ablood 3acerebrospinal fluid 3acost effectiveness 3aethics 3ahead 3ahumans 3ainstrumentation 3ameninges 3amodels 3aneocortex 3aneurons 3askull 3asurgeons1 aWoodtli, Alain1 aYulzari, Aude1 aCosgrove, G.

Tellurium-centered chalcogen bonds are at least as active as antimony-centered pnictogen bonds, whereas iodine-centered halogen bonds are 3 orders of magnitude less active. Irregular voltage-dependent single-channel currents, high gating charges, and efficient dye leakage support for the formation of bulky, membrane-disruptive supramolecular amphiphiles due to “too strong” binding of anions to tris(perfluorophenyl)stibanes. In contrast, the chalcogen-bonding bis(perfluorophenyl)tellanes do not cause leakage and excel as carriers with nanomolar activity, with P₍Cₗ/Nₐ₎ = 10.4 for anion/cation selectivity and P₍Cₗ/NO₃₎ = 4.5 for anion selectivity. The selectivities are lower with pnictogen-bonding carriers because their membrane-disturbing 3D structure also affects weaker binders (P₍Cₗ/Nₐ₎ = 2.1, P₍Cₗ/NO₃₎ = 2.5). Their 2D structure, directionality, hydrophobicity, and support from proximal anion−π interactions are suggested to contribute to the unique power of chalcogen bonds to transport anions across lipid bilayer membranes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanions 3acations 3adyes 3ahalogens 3ahydrophobicity 3alipid bilayers 3asurfactants1 aTsemperouli, Maria1 aPoblador-Bahamonde, Amalia I.1 aBenz, Sebastian1 aSakai, Naomi1 aSugihara, Kaori1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3512-60361 aMatile, Stefan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8537-83490 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2019 Jan. 08, v. 141, no. 2 p.810-814dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.8b125543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02102naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245008300172300001800255520094200273592002801215650001601243650001501259650001101274650000901285650003701294650001501331650001501346653003001361653002001391653001101411700002001422700001601442700002801458700002501486773011101511856008501622852000901707655001201716IND60576315720221121232523.0170802e20170727xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057631572DNAL7 a10.1080/02626667.2017.13434762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeña-Sancho, C.10aUpward infiltration–evaporation method to estimate soil hydraulic properties  ap. 1683-1693.  aDetermination of saturated hydraulic conductivity, K ₛ, and the van Genuchten water retention curve θ (h) parameters is crucial in evaluating unsaturated soil water flow. The aim of this work is to present a method to estimate K ₛ, α and n from numerical analysis of an upward infiltration process at saturation (Cap0), with (Cap0 + h) and without (Cap0) an overpressure step (h) at the end of the wetting phase, followed by an evaporation process (Evap). The HYDRUS model as well as a brute-force search method were used for theoretical loam soil parameter estimation. The uniqueness and the accuracy of solutions from the response surfaces, K ₛ–n, α–n and K ₛ–α , were evaluated for different scenarios. Numerical experiments showed that only the Cap0 + Evap and Cap0 + h + Evap scenarios were univocally able to estimate the hydraulic properties. The method gave reliable results in sand, loam and clay-loam soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aevaporation 3aloam soils 3amodels 3asand 3asaturated hydraulic conductivity 3asoil water 3awater flow 0asoil hydraulic properties 0ainverse methods 0aHYDRUS1 aGhezzehei, T.A.1 aLatorre, B.1 aGonzález-Cebollada, C.1 aMoret-Fernández, D.0 tHydrological sciences journal.g2017 July 27, v. 62, no. 10 p.1683-1693dTaylor & Francisx2150-34357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2017.13434763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02043naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245009400166300001600260520083400276592002801110650001501138650001201153650001901165650001701184650000901201650001101210650000901221650002301230650001801253650001101271651001001282653001501292653002901307653001601336653002601352700001901378700001501397700001301412773009001425856008501515852000901600655001201609IND60607858220221118041631.0180830e20161115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060785822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2016.09.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Sheng12aA novel cascade refrigeration process using waste heat and its application to coal-to-SNG  ap. 486-497.  aTo efficiently develop coal-based chemical processes in China faces many challenges. A large amount of waste heat in the process is not efficiently employed. The proportion of energy that is fully utilized is extremely low. This paper proposes cascade refrigeration technology (CRT) that combines a LiBr absorption refrigeration with a NH3 absorption refrigeration. The CRT is driven by low-grade waste heat below 150 °C and produces high-grade cold energy. The CRT is applied to a coal-to-SNG project as a case study. In a 4 billion Nm³/a coal-to-SNG plant, the CRT is integrated to use low-grade heat taken from the methanation unit. Produced cold energy is used in the Rectitsol unit to remove CO2. Results show that it reduces the compression refrigeration by 16%. The absolute gain is 3.4 × 10⁷ million CNY per year.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aammonia 3acarbon dioxide 3acase studies 3acold 3aenergy 3aheat 3amethane production 3arefrigeration 3awastes 3aChina 0aWaste heat 0aAbsorption refrigeration 0aCoal-to-SNG 0aCascade refrigeration1 aLiang, Jianeng1 aYang, Siyu1 aQian, Yu0 tEnergy.g2016 Nov. 15, v. 115 p.486-497dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2016.09.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01539naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100001700162245009100179300001600270500001900286500000900305520053100314592002800845650001300873650002300886650001600909650001100925650001300936650001900949700001900968773012100987856009601108852000901204655001201213IND60663772020221120073520.0191122e195605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066377202DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1956.00021962004800050003x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHesse, W.

The increase in protein content was observed in both the target tissues of mussels exposed to 0.03 μg/L chlorpyrifos when compared with control mussels. The pattern of acid DNase activity in digestive gland and gills indicated a tissue-specific response, although the lowest concentration of chlorpyrifos caused changes in acid DNase activity in both tissues. In the digestive gland, the increase of acid DNase activity was observed in mussel exposed to 0.03 μg/L chlorpyrifos, followed by decrease up to 100 μg/L chlorpyrifos. Enzyme activity in the gills showed a dose response effect. The results support the use of acid DNase activity in the digestive gland as a sensitive response to an environmentally relevant range of pesticide concentrations.

However, the responses of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) growth and yield to different straw returning modes with an equivalent carbon (C) input are still unclear. A four-year field experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of different straw returning modes on the soil temperature, soil water content, soil nutrient availability, cotton root growth, cotton nutrient status, cotton canopy photosynthetic properties and seedcotton yield in a barley-cotton rotation system in Yancheng, China. Based on an equivalent C input, five treatments were set: straw-biochar incorporation (SB), straw incorporation with microbial inoculant (SI), straw incorporation (S), straw mulching (SM), and the control without straw or straw-biochar (CK). Treatments with straw and straw-biochar significantly enhanced most cotton growth parameters, and consequently increased the seedcotton yield from the second year to the fourth year. Such beneficial effects induced by the applications of straw and straw-biochar tended to progressively increase annually. In the fourth year, seedcotton yields in SB, SI, S and SM were significantly increased by 24.2%, 16.1%, 14.3% and 8.2%, respectively, compared with that of the control. The highest increase in seedcotton yield in SB was due to the greatest improvements in the contents of soil available nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K); root biomass; NPK uptake by cotton; partitioning percentage of NPK to bolls; and canopy apparent photosynthesis rate. The lowest increase in seedcotton yield in SM was mainly ascribed to a reduction of 2.4-3.2 ℃ in the daily maximum temperature of topsoil at the early growth stage of cotton. Overall, compared with other crop straw returning modes, converting straw into biochar and incorporating it into fields could be an appropriate practice for sustaining high seedcotton yield in the barley-cotton rotation system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGossypium hirsutum 3abiochar 3abiomass 3abolls 3acanopy 3acarbon 3acotton 3acrop production 3adevelopmental stages 3afield crops 3afield experimentation 3afields 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3aphosphorus 3aphotosynthesis 3apotassium 3aresearch 3aroot growth 3asoil nutrients 3asoil temperature 3asoil water content 3astraw 3atopsoil 3ayields 3aChina 0aStraw returning mode 0aNutrient status 0aSeedcotton yield1 aKong, Fanxuan1 aWang, Zhi1 aLuo, Ying1 aLv, Xiaobing1 aZhou, Zhiguo1 aMeng, Yali0 tField crops research.g2019 Aug. 28, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl10215x0378-42907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2019.1076163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02439naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245019100171520126400362592002801626650001801654650002201672650001101694650001201705650001801717650002001735650001501755650001301770650002101783700002001804700002601824700001801850773012701868856008501995852000902080655001202089IND60742634020221120235002.0210624e20210607xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074263402DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms90612362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyen Anh Duc,10aEnhancing Sesquiterpenoid Production from Methane via Synergy of the Methylerythritol Phosphate Pathway and a Short-Cut Route to 1-Deoxy-D-xylulose 5-Phosphate in Methanotrophic Bacteria  aSesquiterpenoids are one of the most diverse classes of isoprenoids which exhibit numerous potentials in industrial biotechnology. The methanotrophs-based methane bioconversion is a promising approach for sustainable production of chemicals and fuels from methane. With intrinsic high carbon flux though the ribulose monophosphate cycle in Methylotuvimicrobium alcaliphilum 20Z, we demonstrated here that employing a short-cut route from ribulose 5-phosphate to 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) could enable a more efficient isoprenoid production via the methylerythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway, using α-humulene as a model compound. An additional 2.8-fold increase in α-humulene production yield was achieved by the fusion of the nDXP enzyme and DXP reductase. Additionally, we utilized these engineering strategies for the production of another sesquiterpenoid, α-bisabolene. The synergy of the nDXP and MEP pathways improved the α-bisabolene titer up to 12.24 ± 0.43 mg/gDCW, twofold greater than that of the initial strain. This study expanded the suite of sesquiterpenoids that can be produced from methane and demonstrated the synergistic uses of the nDXP and MEP pathways for improving sesquiterpenoid production in methanotrophic bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiotechnology 3abiotransformation 3acarbon 3amethane 3amethanotrophs 3aoxidoreductases 3aphosphates 3aribulose 3asesquiterpenoids1 aPham, Diep Ngoc1 aChau, Tin Hoang Trung1 aLee, Eun Yeol0 tMicroorganisms.g2021 June 07, v. 9, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms90612363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03279naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002100186245007400207300001800281506007600299520164100375592002802016506003702044650001402081650003102095650001702126650002102143650001902164650001502183650001102198650001702209650001202226650001402238650000702252650001602259650001902275653001902294653002202313653002302335653000902358653001202367700001402379700002402393700001502417700002202432700002202454773017302476856007902649852000902728655001202737IND60178668120221207093658.0150604e20140114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017866812DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.13180181112doi7 aPMC38961522pmcid7 a243793712pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChamberlin, Adam10aHydrophobic plug functions as a gate in voltage-gated proton channels  ap. E273-E282.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aVoltage-gated proton (Hv1) channels play important roles in the respiratory burst, in pH regulation, in spermatozoa, in apoptosis, and in cancer metastasis. Unlike other voltage-gated cation channels, the Hv1 channel lacks a centrally located pore formed by the assembly of subunits. Instead, the proton permeation pathway in the Hv1 channel is within the voltage-sensing domain of each subunit. The gating mechanism of this pathway is still unclear. Mutagenic and fluorescence studies suggest that the fourth transmembrane (TM) segment (S4) functions as a voltage sensor and that there is an outward movement of S4 during channel activation. Using thermodynamic mutant cycle analysis, we find that the conserved positively charged residues in S4 are stabilized by countercharges in the other TM segments both in the closed and open states. We constructed models of both the closed and open states of Hv1 channels that are consistent with the mutant cycle analysis. These structural models suggest that electrostatic interactions between TM segments in the closed state pull hydrophobic residues together to form a hydrophobic plug in the center of the voltage-sensing domain. Outward S4 movement during channel activation induces conformational changes that remove this hydrophobic plug and instead insert protonatable residues in the center of the channel that, together with water molecules, can form a hydrogen bond chain across the channel for proton permeation. This suggests that salt bridge networks and the hydrophobic plug function as the gate in Hv1 channels and that outward movement of S4 leads to the opening of this gate.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aapoptosis 3aelectrostatic interactions 3afluorescence 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrophobicity 3ametastasis 3amodels 3amutagenicity 3amutants 3aneoplasms 3apH 3aspermatozoa 3athermodynamics 0avoltage gating 0amutagenesis cycle 0amolecular dynamics 0aVSOP 0ablocker1 aQiu, Feng1 aRebolledo, Santiago1 aWang, Yibo1 aNoskov, Sergei Y.1 aLarsson, H.

In this study, we develop a robust and efficient analytical system, the aptamer-based chemiluminescent optical fiber immunosensor (aptamer-COFIS), for ultrasensitive detection of biomarkers. In the aptamer-COFIS system, target aptamer-primer probe is used as the bridge to combine antibody-antigen immunoreaction on the fiber surface with chemiluminescent signal amplification. The antibody-antigen (target)-aptamer sandwich-like reaction is coupled with rolling cycle amplification (RCA), which is capable to produce hundreds of binding sites to connect with the streptavidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase nanocomposites for signal amplification. Using prostate specific antigen (PSA), the most reliable and specific biomarker of prostate cancer, as the test sample, we show that the proposed strategy can greatly improve the sensor response with a wide linear range of 0.01–1000 pg/mL and an extremely low limit-of-detection of 3.2 fg/mL. Our results indicate that the proposed method presents high selectivity and good accuracy for ultrasensitive sensing biomarkers in complex clinical samples. Moreover, with additional advantages by using optical fiber as the ideal carrier of biorecognition elements and the transducer of chemiluminescent signal, the aptamer-COFIS system with a low-cost compact design is convenient for operation, making it suitable for cost-effective on-site and real time analysis of various biomarkers in early diagnosis of diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3achemiluminescence 3acost effectiveness 3aearly diagnosis 3aimmune response 3aimmunosensors 3ananocomposites 3aoptical fibers 3aperoxidase 3aprostate-specific antigen 3aprostatic neoplasms 0aAptamer 0aChemiluminescent optical fiber immunosensor 0aRolling cycle amplification 0aUltrasensitive detection 0aProstate specific antigen1 aHuang, Jingwen1 aLi, Dingsong1 aYang, Li0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2022 Oct. 15, v. 214 p.114505-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2022.1145053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02356naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001600142245013100158300001800289520111400307592002801421650001401449650002301463650002101486650001801507700001401525700001601539700001501555700001401570700001201584700006001596700005101656700005601707773014601763856007601909852000901985655001201994IND60627167220221118022744.0190128e20181218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062716722DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.8b127962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yidong10aKinetic Resolution of Allylic Alcohol with Chiral BINOL-Based Alkoxides: A Combination of Experimental and Theoretical Studies  ap. 1150-1159.  aThe development and characterization of enantioselective catalytic kinetic resolution of allylic alcohols through asymmetric isomerization with chiral BINOL derivatives-based alkoxides as bifunctional Brønsted base catalysts were described in the study. A number of chiral BINOL derivatives-based alkoxides were synthesized, and their structure–enantioselectivity correlation study in asymmetric isomerization identified a promising chiral Brønsted base catalyst, which afforded various chiral secondary allylic alcohols (ee up to 99%, S factor up to >200). In the mechanistic study, alkoxide species were identified as active species and the phenol group of BINOL largely affected the high reactivity and enantioselectivity via hydrogen bonding between the chiral Brønsted base catalyst and substrates. The strategy is the first successful synthesis strategy of various chiral secondary allylic alcohols through enantioselective transition-metal-free base-catalyzed isomerization. The applicability of the strategy had been demonstrated by the synthesis of the bioactive natural product (+)-veraguensin.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3aenantioselectivity 3ahydrogen bonding 3aisomerization1 aLiu, Song1 aLi, Dongmei1 aZhang, Nan1 aPeng, Lei1 aAo, Jun1 aSong, Choong Eui1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9221-67891 aLan, Yu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2328-00201 aYan, Hailong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3378-02370 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2018 Dec. 18, v. 141, no. 2 p.1150-1159dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.8b127963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02233naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245014800170300002000318520100800338592002801346650001101374650001101385650002001396650002701416650001101443650001401454650001901468650002401487650001301511700005901524700002301583700001801606773015501624856008301779852000901862655001201871IND60791808520221119051831.0220831e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079180852DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-022-20122-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShahbaz, Muhammad10aInvestigation of economic and financial determinants of carbon emissions by panel quantile regression analysis: the case of Visegrád countries  ap. 60777-60791.  aThis study determines the impacts of gross domestic product, domestic bank credits given to private sector, and military expenditures on carbon emissions based on 1990–2019 time period. The panel quantile regression approach is applied for the Visegrád group countries. Our empirical results reveal that domestic bank credit given to private sector has a positive and meaningful impact on carbon emissions at medium and high quantile levels. On the other hand, it has been determined that gross domestic product has a reducing impact on carbon emissions, but military expenditures have an increasing impact on carbon emissions. Besides, as consequences of such tests, the difference between the quantiles, that is, the heterogeneous structure was revealed. A separate model was created with a different panel quantile approach for robustness control, and the results were compared by giving different values to penalty term. These results provide strong evidence for decision-makers and implementers.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acredit 3adecision making 3agross domestic product 3amodels 3apollution 3aprivate sector 3aregression analysis 3aresearch1 aIlarslan, Kenan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5097-75521 aYildiz, Münevvere1 aVo, Xuan Vinh0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Aug., v. 29, no. 40 p.60777-60791dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-20122-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01754naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245020900164300002000373520074700393592002801140650001301168650001201181650001201193650002201205700001301227700001301240773012101253856008101374852000901455655001201464IND60550482720221119141710.0160911e20151106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055048272DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.5b019752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Rongzhou10aSynthesis of a-Alkylated Ketones via Tandem Acceptorless Dehydrogenation/a-Alkylation from Secondary and Primary Alcohols Catalyzed by Metal–Ligand Bifunctional Iridium Complex [Cp*Ir(2,2′-bpyO)(H2O)]  ap. 10769-10776.  aA new strategy for the synthesis of α-alkylated ketones via tandem acceptorless dehydrogenation/α-alkylation from secondary and primary alcohols was proposed and accomplished.

The aim of our work was to investigate the formation of algal flocs as an efficient method for the treatment of wastewater and separation of algal cells. RESULTS: The progressive change of activated sludge to algal flocs was evaluated under static and stirring conditions using a synthetic substrate (modified Blue Green‐11 medium) and the secondary effluent from an activated sludge wastewater treatment plant. Algal flocs were observed in all cultures by day 10 and a high chlorophyll concentration was detected in all cases reaching values up to 610–630 μg L⁻¹ at the end of the experiment after 30 days. The size of flocs in all cultures at either static or mixing conditions ranged from 330 to 994 μm, resulting in biomass concentration from 330 to 660 mg L⁻¹. The cultures in secondary effluent at static conditions presented the greatest size, and the mean diameter on days 10 and 30 was 250 and 994 μm, respectively. The cultures were efficient in nutrient removal and, by the end of the experiment, nitrates and phosphates were completely consumed. CONCLUSIONS: Algal flocs were developed from activated sludge without adding any other flocculant and a highly efficient biomass was developed, which can easily settle and remove nutrients from the medium. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI).  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3aalgae 3abiomass 3abiotechnology 3achlorophyll 3aflocculants 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment1 aManariotis, Ioannis D1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3577-85200 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2022 Aug., v. 97, no. 8 p.2143-2148dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.70893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01824naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100007000152245011000222300001400332520049500346592002800841650004400869650002000913650001000933650001400943650002300957650001100980650001900991650001701010650001801027650001301045650002301058653001201081653001801093653001501111700002401126700002201150700002101172773011401193856008601307852000901393655001201402IND60551897120221121193256.0161019e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055189712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2015.02.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShahabi-Ghahfarrokhi, Iman1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6224-997710aGreen bionanocomposite based on kefiran and cellulose nanocrystals produced from beer industrial residues  ap. 85-91.  aEnvironmental concern about synthetic polymers and nanoparticles bring about development of the green bionanocomposite.

Cogwheel PBIs assemble with identical structural order irrespective of molecular chirality to generate helical columns jacketed with an alkyl coat with length equal to half the helical pitch, exhibiting helical deracemization in the crystal state. These assemblies were accessible only via annealing or cooling and reheating at 1 °C/min. Recently it was discovered that hybrid rr8 sequence-defined dendrons with r and linear n-octyl (8) chains enabled the formation of the cogwheel phase at 10 °C/min upon heating but not cooling. Here we report four libraries of hybrid PBIs with sequence-defined dendrons containing r and n-alkyl (CₙH₂ₙ₊₁) chains with n = 6, 7, 9, and 10. Structural analysis of these libraries by fiber X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry reveals that the 9r9 sequence enables an extraordinary acceleration of cogwheel assembly at rates of up to 50 °C/min on heating and cooling, providing, to the best of our knowledge, the fastest crystallizing supramolecular or covalent macromolecule known. Solid-state NMR studies help to elucidate this unexpected and unprecedented extraordinary acceleration of hierarchical self-organization, which arises from a combination of crystal packing of the ideal tertiary structure and alkyl chain dynamics. This general model raises questions about the use of achiral motifs to achieve high structural order in chiral systems and the need for disorder to create order in complex biological and bioinspired synthetic systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aannealing 3acooling 3acrystallization 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aheat 3amodels 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoptical isomerism1 aPartridge, Benjamin E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2359-12801 aHuang, Ning1 aOlsen, James T.1 aSahoo, Dipankar1 aZeng, Xiangbing1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4896-80801 aUngar, Goran1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9743-26561 aGraf, Robert1 aSpiess, Hans W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4779-654X1 aPercec, Virgil1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5926-04890 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2020 Apr. 28, v. 142, no. 20 p.9525-9536dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.0c033533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02915naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245008100166300001600247520150200263592002801765650002501793650001701818650001401835650001801849650001901867650002001886650003101906650001201937650001701949650001601966650001801982650002002000650001302020650002402033650003202057650004102089653001102130653001502141653001202156653001702168653001702185700001602202700001902218773008902237856008602326852000902412655001202421IND60602768020221120092439.0180711e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060276802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.peptides.2015.04.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Fan10aEffects of Apelin on RAW264.7 cells under both normal and hypoxic conditions  ap. 133-143.  aMacrophages are an important source of pro-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic factors, which can promote pathological processes involving inflammation and angiogenesis. This study investigated the effects of Apelin on macrophages under both normal and hypoxic conditions. Under normal culture conditions, Apelin down-regulated the mRNA expression levels of monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP1), monocyte chemotactic protein 3 (MCP3), macrophage inflammatory protein 1 (MIP1α, MIP1β), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), Angiopoietin 2 (Ang2) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα). The supernatant concentrations of MCP1, MCP3, MIP1α, MIP1β, macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP2) and TNFα proteins were significantly decreased in the Apelin treated group. Hypoxia induced profound up-regulations of the angiogenic, chemokine, and inflammatory factors at both the mRNA and protein levels. Apelin suppressed the hypoxia-induced increases in MCP1, MCP3, MIP2, MIP1β and TNFα expression. The underlying mechanism of Apelin inhibit inflammation is regulating NF-κB/JNK signal pathway. Additionally, Apelin can protect macrophages from apoptosis and can enhance cell migration during hypoxia. And cleaved Caspase9/3 pathways were involved in Apelin inhibiting RAW264.7 apoptosis. In conclusion, we showed the effect of Apelin on RAW264.7 macrophage under normal and hypoxic condition, which could further influence the angiogenesis and inflammation process that promoted by macrophages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic conditions 3aangiogenesis 3aapoptosis 3acell movement 3achemokine CCL2 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3ahypoxia 3ainflammation 3amacrophages 3amessenger RNA 3aprotein content 3aproteins 3asignal transduction 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3avascular endothelial growth factor A 0aApelin 0aMacrophage 0aHypoxia 0aInflammation 0aAngiogenesis1 aBai, Yujing1 aJiang, Yanrong0 tPeptides.g2015 July, v. 69 p.133-143dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11832x0196-97817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2015.04.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02775naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005400148245013200202300002000334520149700354592002801851596005901879596005901938650002101997650003002018650001302048650001402061650002202075650001302097650001202110651001002122700001802132700001602150773015502166856008302321852000902404655001202413IND60791808720221119051710.0220831e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079180872DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-022-20284-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXin, Chong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6308-390510aEnvironmental innovation ambidexterity and customer relationship performance: evidence from the manufacturing industry in China  ap. 60998-61011.  aCleaner production and pollution prevention are not only essential for enterprises to improve resource utilization efficiency and competitiveness, but also realistic requirements for enterprises to comply with green manufacturing policies and regulations. Many previous studies have investigated the impacts of environmental innovation on products and environmental performance, but few of them have explored the impact of environmental innovation on customer relationships. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the basic strategies to enhance customer relationship in the context of green development. Building upon the resource-based view, the dynamic capability perspective, and the upper echelons theory, this study develops a conceptual model focusing on the effects of environmental innovation ambidexterity (EIA) on customer relationship performance (CRP), the mediating effects of green product innovation (GPI), and the moderating role of top management’s environmental awareness. The results of a survey of 285 high-tech manufacturing enterprises in China show that EIA has a positive effect on CRP. The results of the study also indicate that GPI mediates the relationship between EIA and CRP, and top management’s environmental awareness moderates the impact of EIA on CRP. The results offer novel insights for suppliers to improve CRP, and provide theoretical guidance for high-tech manufacturing enterprises to effectively implement pollution prevention and GPI.  aPublisher supplied data  a71672030cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a72072028cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3acustomer service 3aenvironmental performance 3aindustry 3apollution 3apollution control 3aresearch 3asurveys 3aChina1 aZheng, Chenna1 aSun, Minghe0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Aug., v. 29, no. 40 p.60998-61011dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-20284-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03030naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245006600164300001200230520187800242592002802120650002802148650002702176650003002203650002102233650001102254650001402265650002402279650002202303650002402325650002602349700002202375700001802397700001502415773013402430856008302564852000902647655001202656IND60743983020221120085955.0210723e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074398302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jneb.2021.04.4552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Lucy10aP113 Parental Correlates of Preschoolers’ Physical Activity  ap. S77.  aIn combination with healthy eating, physical activity is an essential component of a healthy lifestyle that can help prevent a range of chronic diseases among children. As role models and gatekeepers, parents can influence children's eating and physical activity behaviors through healthy practices, helping and teaching children to make healthy choices for themselves that will last a lifetime.To investigate the associations between demographic characteristics, parental feeding practices, and child physical activity in preschool-age children.Participants of this cross-sectional study included parents (n = 273) of preschool-age children ages 3 to 5 years, recruited from early childhood education centers (n = 24).Independent variables (IVs) included parent and child demographics, parent weight status, feeding practices, parent role modeling, home meal preparation, and child fruit and vegetable consumption. Binary dependent variables (DVs) included participation in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and participation in physical activity for more than 60 minutes a day (TPA). Logistic regression models determined associations between IVs and DVs.The participant's married status (OR = 3.625, CI = 3.609-3.641), child weight (OR = 2.920, CI = 2.905-2.935), and less spousal meal preparation (OR = 0.450, CI = 0.448-0.451) were associated with MVPA. On the other hand, lower parent weight (OR = 0.366, CI = 0.364-0.368), less food restriction (OR = 0.509, CI = 0.508-0.511), and more food monitoring (OR = 1.618, CI = 1.615-1.622) were associated with TPA.Overall, the results suggest that parent characteristics and feeding practices are associated with child physical activity. Addressing this interconnectedness between eating and physical activity will allow families and providers to better understand how to promote healthy behaviors in children.  aPublisher supplied data 3across-sectional studies 3ademographic statistics 3aearly childhood education 3afood preparation 3afruits 3alifestyle 3anutrition education 3aphysical activity 3aregression analysis 3avegetable consumption1 aSrivastava, Deepa1 aDinkel, Danae1 aDev, Dipti0 tJournal of nutrition education and behavior.g2021 July, v. 53, no. 7 p.S77-S77dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl70490x1499-40467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jneb.2021.04.4553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02777naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002300186245009200209300002000301500001500321506007600336520086700412592002801279506003701307650002201344650001501366650001301381650001201394650001601406650002801422650001701450650001701467650001901484650001401503650001201517650001401529650002501543650002101568650001801589653001601607653002001623653002401643653002401667653001701691700002501708700002201733700002301755700002401778700002401802700002501826700002701851700002101878773017601899856007902075852000902154655001202163IND60173776320221207111249.0150603e20130813xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017377632DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.13070961102doi7 aPMC37468552pmcid7 a238981942pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPlotnikov, Egor Y.10aProtective effect of mitochondria-targeted antioxidants in an acute bacterial infection  ap.

Inflammatory response and the accompanying oxidative stress can contribute to kidney tissue damage, resulting in infection-induced intoxication that can become fatal in the absence of antibiotic therapy. Here, we show that pyelonephritis was associated with oxidative stress and renal cell death. Oxidative stress observed in pyelonephritic kidney was accompanied by a reduced level of mitochondrial B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2). Importantly, renal cell death and animal mortality were both alleviated by mitochondria-targeted antioxidant 10(6′-plastoquinonyl) decylrhodamine 19 (SkQR1). These findings suggest that pyelonephritis can be treated by reducing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and thus by protecting mitochondrial integrity and lowering kidney damage.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aprotective effect 3acell death 3alymphoma 3aanimals 3aantibiotics 3areactive oxygen species 3ainflammation 3atherapeutics 3apyelonephritis 3amortality 3akidneys 3apoisoning 3abacterial infections 3aoxidative stress 3aB-lymphocytes 0aphenoptosis 0ainnate immunity 0atoll-like receptors 0aurological diseases 0aantioxidants1 aMorosanova, Maria A.1 aPevzner, Irina B.1 aZorova, Ljubava D.1 aManskikh, Vasily N.1 aPulkova, Natalya V.1 aGalkina, Svetlana I.1 aSkulachev, Vladimir P.1 aZorov, Dmitry B.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 Aug. 13, v. 110, no. 33 p.E3100-E3108dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.13070961103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02915naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245005500167300001600222520158700238592002801825650002201853650001301875650002101888650002101909650002501930650001901955650001401974650001601988653002202004653002202026653001102048653001402059653001902073700002502092700002202117700002102139700002102160700002302181700001902204700002002223773012402243856008102367852000902448655001202457IND60774670520221120213627.0220422e20090901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077467052DNAL7 a10.1556/avet.57.2009.3.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJánosi, Katalin10aAerosol infection of calves with Histophilus somni  ap. 347-356.  aThe purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate an aerosol infection method with Histophilus somni that closely resembles the natural way of infection of calves. Another aim was to compare the virulence of two H. somni strains by collecting clinical and postmortem data of experimentally infected and control animals. Seventeen conventionally reared 3-month-old calves were divided into three groups. Two groups of six animals each were exposed to suspensions containing H. somni on three consecutive days using a vaporiser mask. The third group of five animals was used as control. The data of individual clinical examination were recorded daily. All animals were exterminated, and gross pathology of all lungs was evaluated on the 15th day after the first infection. Both H. somni strains caused an increase of rectal temperature, respiratory signs, decrease of weight gain, and severe catarrhal bronchopneumonia in both infected groups. Although some chronic lesions were detected in the lungs of the control animals as well, the histopathological findings in the infected and control groups were different. H. somni was recultured from all lungs in the challenged groups but it could not be reisolated or detected by PCR examination in the control group. This is the first paper on aerosol challenge of calves with H. somni using repeated infection and verified by detailed pathological, bacteriological and histopathological examination. The infection method proved to be successful. There was no difference in the virulence of the two H. somni strains used in the trial.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaemophilus somni 3aaerosols 3abody temperature 3abronchopneumonia 3aclinical examination 3ahistopathology 3avirulence 3aweight gain 0aHistophilus somni 0aaerosol infection 0acattle 0apathology 0ahistopathology1 aStipkovits, László1 aGlávits, Róbert1 aMolnár, Tamás,1 aMakrai, László1 aGyuranecz, Miklós1 aVarga, János,1 aFodor, László0 tActa veterinaria Hungarica.g2009 Sept. 1, v. 57, no. 3 p.347-356dAkadémiai KiadówJournal:jnl35480x1588-27057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1556/avet.57.2009.3.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03078naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003200133040001800165100001800183245016000201300001600361506007600377520140900453592002801862506003701890650002501927650001901952650001701971650002201988650001202010650001802022650001302040650003902053650004802092650002702140650004202167650002802209650004602237650002002283650002902303700002002332700002302352700002402375773010602399856008202505852000902587655001202596IND4473411820221207062101.0120502e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447341182DNAL7 a222746272pmid7 aPMC32895692pmcid7 a10.1105/tpc.111.0905972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Lianwei10aMultistep Assembly of Chloroplast NADH Dehydrogenase-Like Subcomplex A Requires Several Nucleus-Encoded Proteins, Including CRR41 and CRR42, in Arabidopsis  ap. 202-214.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aChloroplast NADH dehydrogenase-like complex (NDH) mediates photosystem I cyclic electron transport and chlororespiration in thylakoids. Recently, substantial progress has been made in understanding the structure of NDH, but our knowledge of its assembly has been limited. In this study, a series of interactive proteomic analyses identified several stroma-localized factors required for the assembly of a stroma-protruding arm of NDH (subcomplex A). In addition to further characterization of the previously identified CHLORORESPIRATORY REDUCTION1 (CRR1), CRR6, and CRR7, two novel stromal proteins, CRR41 and CRR42, were discovered. Arabidopsis thaliana mutants lacking these proteins are specifically defective in the accumulation of subcomplex A. A total of 10 mutants lacking subcomplex A, including crr27/cpn60β4, which is specifically defective in the folding of NdhH, and four mutants lacking NdhL–NdhO subunits, were extensively characterized. We propose a model for subcomplex A assembly: CRR41, NdhO, and native NdhH, as well as unknown factors, are first assembled to form an NDH subcomplex A assembly intermediate (NAI500). Subsequently, NdhJ, NdhM, NdhK, and NdhI are incorporated into NAI500 to form NAI400. CRR1, CRR6, and CRR42 are involved in this process. CRR7 is likely to be involved in the final step, in which the fully assembled NAI, including NdhN, is inserted into thylakoids.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3achloroplasts 3aelectron transfer 3amutants 3aphotosystem I 3aproteins 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCell Nucleusxgenetics 2aChloroplastsxenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNADH Dehydrogenasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Binding 2aTandem Mass Spectrometry1 aFukao, Yoichiro1 aFujiwara, Masayuki1 aShikanai, Toshiharu0 tplant cell.g2012 Jan., v. 24, no. 1 p.202-214dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx1040-46517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.111.0905973Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle03105naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245016400155300002000319520168400339592002802023650004402051650003702095650001602132650002602148650001302174650002102187650001202208650002602220650004402246650001102290650001502301650001202316650002302328650002002351650001602371700001702387700001602404700001702420700001502437773012402452856007402576852000902650655001202659IND60640591320221120182003.0190504e20160418xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064059132DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra06033a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Cong10aInvestigating into the liquid oxygen compatibility of a modified epoxy resin containing silicon/phosphorus and its mechanical behavior at cryogenic temperature  ap. 38300-38309.  aA 9,10-dihydro–9–oxa–10–phosphaphenanthrene–10–oxide (DOPO) derivative (DOPO–TVS) was synthesized through a reaction between DOPO and triethoxyvinylsilane (TVS). To modify the common epoxy resin molecular without consuming the epoxy group, the general bisphenol F epoxy resin was first treated with isocyanate propyl triethoxysilane (IPTS). In the next step, the pretreated epoxy resin and DOPO–TVS were mixed to initiate the sol–gel process to generate the organic–inorganic hybrid Si–O–Si network within the epoxy matrix. The characterization of each reaction product was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance (¹H NMR, ³¹P NMR) spectroscopy. The liquid oxygen compatibility of the cured epoxy resin was evaluated through mechanical impact in accordance with ASTM D2512-95. The surface elemental composition of the specimen before and after mechanical impact was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results of liquid oxygen mechanical impact showed that the liquid oxygen compatibility of the silicon/phosphorus containing epoxy resin was obviously enhanced. Moreover, the surface element composition also confirms the migration of the silicon to the surface of the cured epoxy resin and the generation of phosphoric oxyacid, which belongs to the condensed phase flame retardant mechanism. The tensile test and fracture toughness test under cryogenic conditions (77 K) were also carried out. The results showed that the modified epoxy resin possesses an elevated toughness property, which was attributed to the flexible Si–O–Si network in the cured modified epoxy resin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3abisphenol F 3aelemental composition 3aepoxides 3aflame retardants 3aliquids 3amechanical properties 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoxygen 3aphosphorus 3asilicon 3asol-gel processing 3astable isotopes 3atemperature1 aLi, Jialiang1 aWu, Zhanjun1 aPeng, Weibin1 aZhou, Dayu0 tRSC advances.g2016 Apr. 18, v. 6, no. 44 p.38300-38309dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra06033a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02465naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006800148245008100216300002000297520115800317592002801475650002501503650002601528650001901554650001001573650001401583650001901597650001601616650001401632650001301646650001601659650001901675650001301694650001201707651001301719700002401732700002001756700002001776773015501796856008301951852000902034655001202043IND60754825320221120060326.0211024e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075482532DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-020-10463-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeorgieva, Stanislava K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2373-614410aTrace elements in commonly used medicinal plants from Varna region, Bulgaria  ap. 59277-59283.  aIn this study, we assessed the concentrations of some trace and toxic elements (Cd, Pb, Zn, Cu, Ni, Cr, Fe, and Mn) in traditionally used wild medicinal plants: chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla), white yarrow (Achillea millefolium), linden (Tilia sp.), and elder (Sambucus nigra L.) collected from urban and rural region near Varna, Bulgaria. Concentrations of examined elements were determined by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) after sample mineralization. The samples were digested with concentrated nitric acid in a microwave system. Mean element levels in medicinal herbs were established in decreasing order as follows: Fe > Mn > Zn ≈ Cu > Pb > Ni > Cr > Cd. The content of toxic elements in medicinal herbs was found significantly higher in areas with intensive traffic compared with a suburban area. Instead discrimination between metal content in rural and urban samples was confirmed by PCA. Concentrations of toxic elements Cd and Pb in all plant species from the rural region were found in the range from not detected to 0.08 and 0.796 ng/kg, respectively and were below the permissible limit of the WHO.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAchillea millefolium 3aMatricaria chamomilla 3aSambucus nigra 3aTilia 3achamomile 3amineralization 3anitric acid 3apollution 3aresearch 3arural areas 3asuburban areas 3atoxicity 3atraffic 3aBulgaria1 aGeorgieva, Angelika1 aPeteva, Zlatina1 aDimova, Dilyana0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 Nov., v. 28, no. 42 p.59277-59283dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-10463-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02707naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245011400158300001600272520129200288592002801580650001701608650001101625650002401636650001601660650001001676650001601686650001001702650001001712650001101722650001201733650001101745650001001756650001001766650001301776650001001789650001301799650000901812650001101821650001101832651001401843700001901857700001901876700002701895700002101922700001801943700001701961773011701978856007302095852000902168655001202177IND60519578020221121002652.0160505e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051957802DNAL7 a10.1111/mve.121562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPERKINS, L.

Setal fragments from O. lunifer larvae have been identified in the placentas of experimentally aborted fetuses and their dams, and in clinical abortions. The gregarious larvae build silken nests in which large numbers cohabit over spring, summer and autumn. The final instars disperse to pupation sites in the ground where they overwinter. Field‐collected O. lunifer larvae, their nests and nearby soil were examined using light and electron microscopy to identify setae likely to cause EAFL and to determine where and how many were present. Microtrichia, barbed hairs and true setae were found on the exoskeletons of the larvae. True setae matching the majority of setal fragments described from equine tissue were found on third to eighth instar larvae or exuviae. The number of true setae increased with the age of the larva; eighth instars carried around 2.0–2.5 million true setae. The exuvia of the pre‐pupal instar was incorporated into the pupal chamber. The major sources of setae are likely to be nests, dispersing pre‐pupal larvae and their exuviae, and pupal chambers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNotodontidae 3aautumn 3aelectron microscopy 3aexoskeleton 3afarms 3afetal death 3afetus 3ahairs 3ahorses 3ainstars 3alarvae 3amoths 3anests 3aplacenta 3apupae 3apupation 3asoil 3aspring 3asummer 3aAustralia1 aZALUCKI, M.

Many microbes in natural environments have the ability to utilize glycerol as a sole carbon and energy source. The focus of this study was to screen for microorganisms from soil, capable of glycerol utilization and its conversion to value added products such as ethanol and 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PDO). Twelve bacterial isolates were screened for glycerol utilization ability in shake flask fermentations using M9 media supplemented with analytical grade glycerol (30 g/L) at various pH values (6, 7 and 8) and temperatures (30°C, 35°C and 40°C). Among these, six bacterial isolates (SM1, SM3, SM4, SM5, SM7 and SM8) with high glycerol degradation efficiency (>80%) were selected for further analysis. Highest level of 1,3-PDO production (15 g/L) was observed with isolate SM7 at pH 7 and 30°C, while superior ethanol production (14 g/L) was achieved by isolate SM9 at pH 8 and 35°C, at a glycerol concentration of 30 g/L. The selected strains were further evaluated for their bioconversion efficiency at elevated glycerol concentrations (50–110 g/L). Maximum 1,3-PDO production (46 g/L and 35 g/L) was achieved at a glycerol concentration of 70 g/L by isolates SM4 and SM7 respectively, with high glycerol degradation efficiency (>90). Three isolates (SM4, SM5 and SM7) also showed greater glycerol tolerance (up to 110 g/L). The isolates SM4 and SM7 were identified as Klebsiella pneumoniae and SM5 as Enterobacter aerogenes by 16S rDNA analysis. These novel isolates with greater glycerol tolerance could be used for the biodegradation of glycerol waste generated from the biodiesel industry into value-added commercial products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterobacter aerogenes 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3aaerobic conditions 3abiodegradation 3abiodiesel 3abiotransformation 3acarbon 3aenergy 3aenvironmental health 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3afermentation 3aglycerol 3aindustry 3amicroorganisms 3apH 3aribosomal DNA 3asoil 3atemperature 3avalue added 3avalue-added products 3awastes 0aGlycerol dehydratase (GD) 0a16S rDNA 0a1,3-propanediol 0a(1,3-PDO) 0aethanol1 aMchunu, Siphesihle1 aAshwani Kumar,1 aKumar, Kuttanpillai Santhosh1 aGovender, Algasan1 aPermaul, Kugen1 aSingh, Suren0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2014 Jan. 2, v. 49, no. 1 p.85-92dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-41177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10934529.2013.8247333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03173naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245013600172300001600308520150300324592002801827650001801855650001901873650002001892650002401912650001901936650001601955650002001971650001901991650001902010650002402029650001602053650001202069650002902081650002102110650001502131650001602146650000902162650001802171653000902189653002102198653004302219653001302262653002402275700001902299700001602318700001702334700001502351700001502366700001802381700002002399773007802419856008902497852000902586655001202595IND60568550020221119153003.0170709e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056855002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.04.1232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Beibei10aBiosurfactant-producing microorganism Pseudomonas sp. SB assists the phytoremediation of DDT-contaminated soil by two grass species  ap. 137-142.  aPhytoremediation together with microorganisms may confer the advantages of both phytoremediation and microbial remediation of soils containing organic contaminants. In this system biosurfactants produced by Pseudomonas sp. SB may effectively help to increase the bioavailability of organic pollutants and thereby enhance their microbial degradation in soil. Plants may enhance the rhizosphere environment for microorganisms and thus promote the bioremediation of contaminants. In the present pot experiment study, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) residues underwent an apparent decline after soil bioremediation compared with the original soil. The removal efficiency of fertilizer + tall fescue, fertilizer + tall fescue + Pseudomonas, fertilizer + perennial ryegrass, and fertilizer + perennial ryegrass + Pseudomonas treatments were 59.4, 65.6, 69.0, and 65.9%, respectively, and were generally higher than that in the fertilizer control (40.3%). Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) verifies that plant species greatly affected the soil bacterial community irrespective of inoculation with Pseudomonas sp. SB. Furthermore, community composition analysis shows that Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria were the three dominant phyla in all groups. In particular, the relative abundance of Pseudomonas for fertilizer + tall fescue + Pseudomonas (0.25%) was significantly greater than fertilizer + tall fescue and this was related to the DDT removal efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcidobacteria 3aActinobacteria 3aDDT (pesticide) 3aFestuca arundinacea 3aLolium perenne 3aPseudomonas 3abioavailability 3abiodegradation 3abiosurfactants 3acommunity structure 3afertilizers 3agrasses 3amultidimensional scaling 3aphytoremediation 3apollutants 3arhizosphere 3asoil 3asoil bacteria 0aDDTs 0aPhytoremediation 0aBiosurfactant-producing microorganisms 0a16S rRNA 0aBacterial community1 aWang, Qingling1 aLiu, Wuxing1 aLiu, Xiaoyan1 aHou, Jinyu1 aTeng, Ying1 aLuo, Yongming1 aChristie, Peter0 tChemosphere.g2017 Sept., v. 182 p.137-142dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.04.1233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02978naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245013700170300001600307520159900323592002801922650002701950650001401977650002901991650001402020650001102034650001302045650002102058650001202079650002102091650000902112650001602121650001202137653002202149653001702171653002202188700001902210700001802229700001202247700001502259700001502274773013502289856008702424852000902511655001202520IND60743692520221117173058.0210926e20210801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074369252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.06.1512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Shaodan10aNew insights into how starch structure synergistically affects the starch digestibility, texture, and flavor quality of rice noodles  ap. 731-738.  aThe functionalities of gluten-free rice noodles are significantly affected by starch hierarchical structures. Identifying the structures that synergistically determine noodle integrated functionalities is vital to designing health-promoting starchy foods with desirable consumer sensory and nutritional qualities. This study reports on the changes in starch structures and functionalities (starch digestibility, texture, and flavor) of rice noodles during household cooking processes (steaming, boiling, and stir-frying), and describes an underlying structure-functionality relationship. Results show that all the cooking processes examined increased starch reassembled ordered structures, especially short-range ordered structures, helical and crystalline structures, and ordered aggregate structures. Steaming and boiling led to a decrease in rapidly digestible starch (RDS) and an increase in slowly digestible starch, while stir-frying yielded a reduction in RDS content and an increase in resistant starch in rice noodles. Steaming and boiling decreased while stir-frying increased the flavor variety of noodles. All cooking processes examined altered noodle textures, with a significant increase in hardness, gumminess, and chewiness. Structure-functionality relationships suggested short-range ordered structures, crystalline structures, and the ordered molecular and aggregate structures of noodles synergistically determined starch digestion, texture, and flavor. By structuring such key structures, the digestion, texture, and flavor of rice noodles can thus be reasonably controlled.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbohydrate structure 3achewiness 3adigestible carbohydrates 3adigestion 3aflavor 3ahardness 3ahealth promotion 3anoodles 3aresistant starch 3arice 3astir frying 3atexture 0aStructural design 0aRice noodles 0aHousehold cooking1 aChi, Chengdeng1 aZhang, Yiping1 aLi, Lin1 aChen, Ling1 aLi, Xiaoxi0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2021 Aug. 01, v. 184 p.731-738dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.06.1513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02103naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245007500176520095200251592002801203650001301231650002101244650002101265650001901286650001701305650001001322650001201332650001701344650002301361653002601384653002201410653001801432653002401450653002501474700002001499773010201519856008701621852000901708655001201717IND60768891720221121073507.0220706e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076889172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2022.1124222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKunde, Shalvi Sinai10aTargeted delivery of albumin nanoparticles for breast cancer: A review  aBreast cancer has been identified as one of the most common cancers diagnosed in women.

The aim of this study was to establish the prevalence of E.coli producing Extended-Spectrum beta-Lactamase (ESBL) antibiotics from rats and gregarious animals in a semirural area of Gabon and to evaluate the origin of a resistance distribution in the environment from animal feces. The bacterial culture was carried out, and the identification of E. coli strains on a specific medium and the antibiotic susceptibility tests allowed establishing the prevalence. Characterization of resistance genes was performed by gene amplification after DNA extraction. On 161 feces collected in rats, 32 strains were isolated, and 11 strains of E. coli produced ESBL with a prevalence of 34.37%. Molecular tests showed that CTX-M genes 214 bp were identified in rats. The presence of CTX-M genes could have a human origin. So, the rats can carry ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae which poses a risk to human health and pets in this region of Gabon.  aPublisher supplied data  cCenter of Primatology (CDP) of the International Center for Medical Research of Franceville (CIRMF) 3aDNA 3aEscherichia coli 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacterial culture 3abeta-lactamase 3abeta-lactamase bacteria 3afeces 3agene amplification 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3amultiple drug resistance 3arisk 3aveterinary medicine 3aGabon1 aMbehang Nguema, Pierre Philippe1 aNdong Atome, Guy Roger1 aMabika Mabika, Arsène1 aNgoubangoye, Berthelemy1 aKomba Tonda, Wed Leslie1 aObague Mbeang, Jean Constant1 aLebibi, Jacques0 tVeterinary medicine international.g2020 July 18, v. 2020dHindawiwJournal:21537x2042-00487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2020/51634933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02654naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245016700169300001500336520116300351592002801514650001101542650002501553650001601578650001801594650001701612650001901629650001101648650001301659650002001672650000701692650001501699650002001714650001801734650001901752650001101771650000901782653001601791653001701807653001801824653000901842700001901851700001901870700002301889700001701912773012601929856008402055852000902139655001202148IND60121836120221120085846.0150325e20140102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012183612DNAL7 a10.1080/10934529.2013.8247372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPathak, Ashish10aComparison of bioleaching of heavy metals from municipal sludge using indigenous sulfur and iron-oxidizing microorganisms: Continuous stirred tank reactor studies  ap. 93-100.  aA comparative study was undertaken using indigenous sulfur-oxidizing microorganisms and iron-oxidizing microorganisms in separate 12 litre continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTRs) for solubilization of heavy metals from anaerobically digested sewage sludge. The CSTRs were operated at hydraulic retention times (HRTs) ranging from 4 to 10 days using sewage sludge feed having near neutral pH. The pH, oxidation–reduction potential (ORP) and solubilization efficiency of metals were found to be highly dependent on HRT and an increase in HRT led to higher solubilization of metals in both the CSTRs. In both the CSTRs, the CSTR operated with sulfur-oxidizing microorganisms at an HRT of 8 days was found to be optimum in solubilizing 58% Cu, 52% Ni, 72% Zn and 43% Cu from the sludge. The nutrient value, nitrogen and phosphorus of bioleached sludge was also conserved (<20% loss) at 8 days HRT. The metals fractionation study conducted using BCR sequential extraction procedure suggested that most of the metals remaining in the bioleached sludge were in the more stable fractions (F3 and F4) and, therefore, can be safely apply as a fertilizer on land.  aPublisher supplied data 3acopper 3aenvironmental health 3afertilizers 3afractionation 3aheavy metals 3amicroorganisms 3anickel 3anitrogen 3anutritive value 3apH 3aphosphorus 3aredox potential 3asewage sludge 3asolubilization 3asulfur 3azinc 0aBioleaching 0aheavy metals 0asewage sludge 0aCSTR1 aKothari, Richa1 aDastidar, M.G.1 aSreekrishnan, T.R.1 aKim, Dong J.0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2014 Jan. 2, v. 49, no. 1 p.93-100dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-41177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10934529.2013.8247373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02616naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006900148245015100217300002000368520132200388592002801710650001501738650000801753650002201761650002201783650002301805650001701828650001701845650001401862650001301876700006601889700006501955773015502020856008202175852000902257655001202266IND60754825720221120043108.0211024e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075482572DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-020-10195-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzewczyńska, Małgorzata1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3319-302410aDetermination of phthalates in particulate matter and gaseous phase emitted in indoor air of offices [Erratum: November 2021, Vol.28(42), p.59328]  ap. 59319-59327.  aPhthalate esters (PAEs) are endocrine disrupters and can disrupt the functioning of different hormones, causing adverse effects on human health. Due to the potential exposure to phthalates in office rooms, their concentrations in the air of these premises after their renovation and furnishing were determined. The aim of the study was to determine the content of these compounds in the gas phase and adsorbed on the particles. Thus, the combined sampler with filters and adsorption tube was used for air sampling. Samples were analyzed by GC-MS. The gas fraction was dominated by dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), and the inhalable fraction by dibutyl phthalate (DBP) and 2-(diethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP). The total concentration of phthalates in the respirable fraction in the furnished rooms was as much as 92% of the phthalates determined in the inhalable fraction. In the rooms immediately after renovation and those arranged and used by employees for 7 months, their concentration in the respirable fraction did not exceed 25% of the phthalates in the inhalable fraction. Phthalate concentration in the renovated rooms after 7 months of their usage dropped by 84% in relation to PAEs concentration in newly arranged rooms and by 68% in relation to the phthalate concentration in empty rooms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aair 3adibutyl phthalate 3adiethyl phthalate 3adimethyl phthalate 3ahuman health 3aparticulates 3apollution 3aresearch1 aDobrzyńska, Elżbieta1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1175-20241 aPosniak, Małgorzata,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1595-96630 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 Nov., v. 28, no. 42 p.59319-59327dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-10195-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03296naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001100151245013200162520134200294592002801636650001501664650001701679650001601696650001601712650001901728650001601747650001401763650002501777650002101802650001601823650001601839650001701855650002601872650002001898650001801918650001701936650001501953650001301968651001001981653002401991653001802015653001402033653002502047653001702072653000702089653000802096653000802104653001802112653000802130653000702138653000802145653000802153653000802161653001202169653000802181653000802189653000802197653001002205653000702215653001102222700001702233700001602250700001702266700001202283700002202295700001502317773011102332856008602443852000902529655001202538IND60790595920221119022215.0220914e20221015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079059592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2022.1234342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Na10aUncovering the effects and mechanism of Danggui Shaoyao San intervention on primary dysmenorrhea by serum metabolomics approach  aDanggui Shaoyao San (DSS) is a well-known prescription for relieving primary dysmenorrhea (PD) of women in China. However, its pharmacological mechanism has not been thoroughly uncovered. Here, an integrative UPLC-Q-TOF-MS-based serum metabolomics approach coupled with multivariate data analysis has been proposed to investigate the effects and mechanism of DSS on estradiol benzoate and oxytocin-induced PD rats. 31 potential biomarkers of PD were screened and identified, mainly involving phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, glycerophospholipid metabolism, primary bile acid biosynthesis, and the occurrence of PD could destroy biological homeostasis in vivo by monitoring these pathways. After DSS treatment, 18 identified different metabolites were restored to the nomal state in varying degrees and could be potential biomarkers contributing to the treatment of DSS. These findings implyed that DSS exhibited a therapeutic effect on PD rats through regulating multiple abnormal pathways. Of note, this study discovered some potential biomarkers related to PD for the first time, such as L-tyrosine, glycocholic acid, citric acid, palmitoylcarnitine, cholesterol. It preliminarily proved the pathophysiology of PD and action mechanisms of DSS on PD, and provided a novel insight into the effectiveness of DSS on PD.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3abiosynthesis 3ablood serum 3acholesterol 3achromatography 3acitric acid 3aestradiol 3aglycerophospholipids 3aglycocholic acid 3ahomeostasis 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3amultivariate analysis 3apathophysiology 3aphenylalanine 3atherapeutics 3atryptophan 3atyrosine 3aChina 0aDanggui Shaoyao San 0aUPLC-Q-TOF-MS 0aMechanism 0aPrimary dysmenorrhea 0aMetabolomics 0aPD 0aTCM 0aDSS 0aUPLC-Q-TOF-MS 0aESI 0aRt 0aPGs 0aVIP 0aPCA 0aOPLS-DA 0aDBS 0aGS1 0aGS2 0aANOVA 0aPC 0alysoPC1 aCui, Xiaoyan1 aMa, Chunyan1 aYu, Yongzhou1 aLi, Zhe1 aZhao, Lanqingqing1 aXiong, Hui0 tJournal of chromatography.g2022 Oct. 15, v. 1209 p.123434-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2022.1234343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03132naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245012000170520149900290592002801789650001601817650002901833650002101862650001901883650001101902650001701913650001401930650001901944650003001963650001901993650001602012650001802028650000902046650002102055650001502076650001202091650001502103653001602118653003502134653003702169653003502206653002402241700001602265700001202281700001702293700001802310700002002328700001702348700001502365773010202380856008702482852000902569655001202578IND60768891920221121100136.0220706e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076889192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2022.1124242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiu, Xiaoming10aExperimental study of β-TCP scaffold loaded with VAN/PLGA microspheres in the treatment of infectious bone defects  aAntibiotic bone cement filling technology has been widely used in the treatment of infectious bone defects for decades.

Repairing bone defects and control infection at the same time is the pain spot of orthopaedic area. In this study, we develop a composite scaffold that aiming at effectively repair infectious bone defects simultaneously. Vancomycin hydrochloride(Van) /Poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid(PLGA) microspheres prepared by double emulsion method were successfully loaded into β-tricalcium phosphate scaffold through electrostatic and physical crosslinking. Full characterization, including mechanical properties, biocompatibility, in vitro release profile and antibacterial properties of the composite scaffolds(CPSFs) were performed. The rabbit osteomyelitis model based on big hole and small hole methods was established. Pharmacodynamics study, including the local bacteriostatic and osteogenic ability were evaluated by X-ray, Micro-CT and histopathology at 4 months after surgery. These findings indicate that a reliable rabbit model of local bone defect infection successfully established by big hole approach. The CPSFs with significant histocompatibility and biocompatibility could sustained release vancomycin for extended duration.

This study collected samples of PM₂.₅ (atmospheric fine particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 μm) at five sites in different functional areas of Zhengzhou in 2016 to investigate the chemical properties and sources of PM₂.₅ at three pollution levels, i.e., PM₂.₅ ≤ 75 μg/m³ (non-pollution, NP), 75 μg/m³ < PM₂.₅ ≤ 150 μg/m³ (moderate pollution, MP), and PM₂.₅ > 150 μg/m³ (heavy pollution, HP). Chemical analysis was conducted, and source categories and potential source region were identified for PM₂.₅ at different pollution levels. The health risks of toxic elements were evaluated. Results showed that the average PM₂.₅ concentration in Zhengzhou was 119 μg/m³, and the sum of the concentrations of SO₄²⁻, NO₃⁻, and NH₄⁺ increased with the aggravation of pollution level (23, 42, and 114 μg/m³ at NP, MP, and HP days, respectively). Positive Matrix Factorization analysis indicated that secondary aerosols, coal combustion, vehicle traffic, industrial processes, biomass burning, and dust were the main sources of PM₂.₅ at three pollution levels, and accounted for 38.4%, 21.6%, 16.7%, 7.4%, 7.7%, and 8.1% on HP days, respectively. Trajectory clustering analysis showed that close-range transport was one of the dominant factors on HP days in Zhengzhou. The potential source areas were mainly located in Xinxiang, Kaifeng, Xuchang, and Pingdingshan. Significant risks existed in the non-carcinogenic risk of As (1.4–2.3) for children at three pollution levels and the non-carcinogenic risk of Pb (1.0–1.4) for children with NP and MP days.  aPublisher supplied data  a51808510cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a51778587cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2017YFC0212400cNational Key Research and Development Program of China Stem Cell and Translational Research  a162300410255cNatural Science Foundation of Henan Province 3aaerodynamics 3abiomass 3achemical analysis 3acoal 3acombustion 3adust 3aparticulates 3apollution 3aresearch 3arisk 3atoxicity 3atraffic 3aChina1 aJiang, Nan1 aZhang, Ruiqin1 aYu, Xue1 aLi, Shengli1 aMiao, Qingqing0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 Nov., v. 28, no. 42 p.59329-59344dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-10943-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02108naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245009300165300002000258520111300278592002801391650001101419650001101430650002001441650002301461650001901484650001301503650001601516700002201532700002101554773012301575856007501698852000901773655001201782IND60559058920221119183535.0161124e20131219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055905892DNAL7 a10.1021/jp410185n2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJensen, Rasmus
Lybech10aTemperature Effect on Radiative Lifetimes: The Case of Singlet Oxygen in Liquid Solvents  ap. 16227-16235.  aA change in solvent can have an appreciable effect on the rate constant for the O₂(a¹Δg) → O₂(X³Σg–) radiative transition at ∼1275 nm. The data thus obtained have played an important role in understanding mechanisms by which environment-dependent perturbations can influence forbidden electronic transitions. We now report that the rate constant for O₂(a¹Δg) radiative deactivation, kᵣ, also responds to changes in temperature. This result can have practical ramifications in experiments that use O₂(a¹Δg) phosphorescence to quantify yields of photosensitized O₂(a¹Δg) production. From a fundamental perspective, this result is significant, partly because there is little precedence for temperature-dependent changes in radiative rate constants. The data also require a re-evaluation of the current model by which oxygen is perturbed by solvent. Specifically, the evidence indicates that it is not appropriate to evaluate the interaction as a 1:1 complex between a given solvent molecule M and oxygen. Rather, one must consider an ensemble of solvent molecules surrounding oxygen.  aPublisher supplied data 3amodels 3aoxygen 3aphosphorescence 3aphysical chemistry 3asinglet oxygen 3asolvents 3atemperature1 aHolmegaard, Lotte1 aOgilby, Peter R.0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2013 Dec. 19, v. 117, no. 50 p.16227-16235dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp410185n3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02262naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245005100154300001600205520119200221592002801413650001001441650001901451650001901470650001001489650001801499650000901517650001001526650001501536650001401551650001201565650002401577650001001601650001001611700001701621700002701638773011701665856007301782852000901855655001201864IND60519578520221120195034.0160505e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051957852DNAL7 a10.1111/mve.121652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBOXLER, B.10aHost finding of the pigeon tick Argas reflexus  ap. 193-199.  aThe medically and veterinary important feral pigeon tick Argas reflexus (Ixodida: Argasidae) Fabricius usually feeds on pigeons, but if its natural hosts are not available, it also enters dwellings to bite humans that can possibly react with severe allergic reactions. Argas reflexus is ecologically extremely successful as a result of some outstanding morphological, physiological, and ethological features. Yet, it is still unknown how the pigeon tick finds its hosts. Here, different host stimuli such as living nestlings as well as begging calls, body heat, smell, host breath and tick faeces, were tested under controlled laboratory conditions. Of all stimuli tested, only heat played a role in host‐finding. The heat stimulus was then tested under natural conditions within a pigeon loft. The results showed that A. reflexus is able to find a host over short distances of only a few centimetres. Furthermore, it finds its host by random movements and recognizes a host only right before direct contact is made. The findings are useful for the control of A. reflexus in infested apartments, both to diagnose an infestation and to perform a success monitoring after disinfestation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArgas 3adirect contact 3adisinfestation 3afeces 3aferal animals 3aheat 3ahosts 3amonitoring 3anestlings 3apigeons 3aresidential housing 3asmell 3aticks1 aODERMATT, P.1 aHAAG‐WACKERNAGEL, D.0 tMedical and veterinary entomology.g2016 June, v. 30, no. 2 p.193-199dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0269-283X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mve.121653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03258naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245011200176520174600288592002802034650005302062650001702115650001602132650002002148650000902168650001302177650002302190650001002213650001102223650002202234650003402256650003402290650002702324650002402351653005002375653002502425653001902450653001902469653001302488653001102501700002202512700002102534700002302555773010402578856008502682852000902767655001202776IND60688956820221119030157.0200804e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068895682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2020.1095182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScinicariello, Franco10aPerfluoroalkyl substances and anthropomorphic measures in children (ages 3–11 years), NHANES 2013–2014.  aPerfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) are man-made compounds that are persistent in the environment and highly bioaccumulative in the body. Humans are exposed to a mixture of these substances, and the effects of these mixtures may be different than the effects noted for individual compounds. Prenatal exposure to PFAAs has been associated with decreased birth weight. The objective of the present study is to evaluate concurrent serum PFAA levels, as single compounds and as mixtures, in relation to anthropomorphic measures in children.Using multivariate linear regression, we evaluated the association between single or PFAA mixtures and with height-for-age (HAZ), weight-for-age (WAZ), and BMI (BMIZ) z-scores in children (ages 3–11 years) participants of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2013–2014. Analyses were also stratified by sex. The PFAA mixture was based on relative potency factors express in terms of PFOA equivalency (CmixRPFi) or as molar sum of the PFAA congeners (∑molPFAA).There was a statistically significant association of PFHxS and PFOS with decreased HAZ in boys. The significantly decreased HAZ in boys was also found when the PFAAs were analyzed as mixtures: CmixRPFi (β = −0.33; 95%CI: 0.63, −0.04) or ΣmolPFAAs (β = −0.30; 95%CI: 0.56, −0.04). In boys, PFHxS was also associated with decreased WAZ and BMIZ. The only statistically significant association found in girls was between decreased HAZ and PFHxS.We found sex differences in the association between concurrent serum PFAA levels and anthropomorphic measures in children 3–11 years old. PFAA levels, as single congeners or as mixture concentrations were associated with decreased height-for-age z-score in boys.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3abirth weight 3ablood serum 3abody mass index 3aboys 3achildren 3agender differences 3agirls 3ahumans 3amaternal exposure 3aperfluorohexane sulfonic acid 3aperfluorooctane sulfonic acid 3aperfluorooctanoic acid 3aregression analysis 0aPerfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances 0aPerfluoroalkyl acids 0aHeight-for-age 0aWeight-for-age 0aChildren 0aNHANES1 aBuser, Melanie C.1 aAbadin, Henry G.1 aAttanasio, Roberta0 tEnvironmental research.g2020 July, v. 186 p.109518-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.1095183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02339naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245009400165300001600259520104900275592002801324650001501352650001101367650001801378650004401396650002501440650002501465650001801490650001601508653000901524653001801533653002001551653001501571653001101586700001701597700001401614700001901628700001701647700002101664773012701685856008401812852000901896655001201905IND60121836420221120085923.0150325e20140102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012183642DNAL7 a10.1080/10934529.2013.8247842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuo, Jimmy10aPicoplankton dynamics and picoeukaryote diversity in a hyper-eutrophic subtropical lagoon  ap. 116-124.  aPicoplankton (cells with a diameter of 0.2–3.0 μm) is the dominant contributor to both primary production and biomass in the ocean. Most of the previous studies on picoplankton have been conducted in the oligotrophic open sea with few in the eutrophic area. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of different groups of picoplankton and the diversity of picoeukaryote (based on 18S rDNA) in a hyper-eutrophic marine coastal lagoon. The results indicated that temperature and phosphate concentration were most responsible for the dynamics of different picoplankton groups. Examination of 135 clones revealed 27 different Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) patterns. At least 7 high-level taxonomic groups of picoeukaryote were recorded. The picoeukaryotic diversities included Alveolates, Stramenopiles, Haptophyceae, and Viridiplantae, with Stramenopiles being the most diverse group. Overall the results of this study indicated that picoplankton diversity was low relative to studies conducted in more oligotrophic waters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaptophyta 3aclones 3acoastal water 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3aenvironmental health 3aprimary productivity 3aribosomal DNA 3atemperature 0aDGGE 0aSynechococcus 0aProchlorococcus 0aDapeng Bay 0aTaiwan1 aTew, Kwee S.1 aYe, Yi X.1 aCheng, Jing O.1 aMeng, Pei J.1 aGlover, David C.0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2014 Jan. 2, v. 49, no. 1 p.116-124dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-41177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10934529.2013.8247843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03055naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100005900155245012100214300001600335520140300351592002801754650001301782650003101795650001701826650001201843650003501855650001201890650001101902650001101913650001101924650000901935650000901944650001201953650001401965650001201979650001101991650001802002650000902020650002602029650001202055650001202067650001302079650001302092650000902105653001402114653001702128653001102145653001702156700002302173700002202196700002102218700001902239700002002258773007702278856008902355852000902444655001202453IND60568550420221119153201.0170628e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056855042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.04.1402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiordani, Paolo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0087-731510aIs there a risk of trace element contamination in herbal preparations?

However, lichens lack cuticolar tissues and are exposed to several atmospheric contaminants, including trace elements. This work aims at exploring the potential toxicity of herbal preparations derived by the lichen Cetraria islandica due to trace element contamination, testing whether different concentrations may be observed, depending on the origin of the raw material. Fourteen samples of C. islandica, as cut dried thalli occurring on the European market, have been bought from different providers. For each sample, the concentrations of As, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, P, Pb, V and Zn were measured on comminuted herbal substance and on the corresponding decoction, using atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). The elemental concentrations in decoctions were significantly lower than those measured in raw materials, dropping down to levels of negligible health concern. Differences observed in raw materials were not observed anymore in the corresponding decoctions. Also, the elemental transfer rate from dried lichen to decoction was extremely element-specific, ranging from 2% for Cu to 95% for Zn.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCetraria 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantioxidants 3aarsenic 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acadmium 3acobalt 3acopper 3ahumans 3airon 3alead 3alichens 3amanganese 3amarkets 3anickel 3araw materials 3arisk 3asecondary metabolites 3athallus 3atissues 3atoxicity 3avanadium 3azinc 0aDecoction 0aIceland moss 0aMetals 0aPhytotherapy1 aMinganti, Vincenzo1 aBrignole, Daniele1 aMalaspina, Paola1 aCornara, Laura1 aDrava, Giuliana0 tChemosphere.g2017 Aug., v. 181 p.778-785dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.04.1403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01221naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245013100162300001800293520033800311592002800649650002600677650002300703700002400726773013400750856007400884852000900958655001200967IND60658902020221119134426.0190819e20110322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065890202DNAL7 a10.1039/c0cc05857b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMukherjee, Arijit10aSynthon polymorphism and pseudopolymorphism in co-crystals.

A.10aEffect of Impregnated Mosquito Bed Nets on the Prevalence of Malaria among Pregnant Women in Foumban Subdivision, West Region of Cameroon  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBackground. Malaria is one of the major public health problems in many tropical developing countries including Cameroon. Impregnated mosquito bed nets are one of the control measures put in place by the WHO and adopted by the Cameroon’s Ministry of Public Health to fight against malaria in pregnancy. This study was a population-based cross-sectional study that investigated the level of adherence, respondent’s knowledge, altitude, and practices toward malaria prevention and control. Methods. To investigate this, a sample size of 410 pregnant women who were inhabitants of Foumban Subdivision was examined. Data on net ownership versus usage, pregnancy status, and socioeconomic background were collected using a questionnaire. Parasitological tests for malaria parasites were carried out using peripheral blood samples obtained from finger pricks of the pregnant women for the preparation of thick blood smear and RDTs. Results. Two hundred and eighteen tested positive (53.4%) with the highest prevalence occurring during the first trimester (79.6%) and in primigravidae (68.8%). Participants believed that mosquito bed nets can protect them against malaria infection. The highest number (81.0%) of the women who had mosquito nets acquired them during antenatal visits. Among those who possessed nets, 42.7% adhered to sleeping under them and few (50%) experienced problems of sweating, discomfort, and heat. Also, the study revealed a high prevalence rate of 63.8% for those who did not use nets during pregnancy as compared to those who owned and used them. Conclusion. The findings indicated that increased access to impregnated mosquito bed nets is required to lower the risk of malaria infection amongst pregnant women. The Cameroon government should improve health education to families within the locality and pursue an integrated approach to fight against mosquitoes during the rainy season.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCulicidae 3aaltitude 3ablood 3across-sectional studies 3ahealth education 3aheat 3amalaria 3aownership 3aparasitology 3apregnancy 3apublic health 3aquestionnaires 3aresearch 3arisk 3asample size 3awet season 3aCameroon1 aPayne, Vincent Khan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2941-988X1 aCedric, Yamssi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7558-42961 aNadia, Noumedem A.

In particular, the effects of GNPs on the nitrification process in activated sludge systems should be addressed. This study aimed to estimate the influence of GNPs on the nitrification process in a short-term nitrification reactor with exposure to different light sources. The results indicated that GNPs could only improve the efficiency of photothermal transformation slightly in the activated sludge system because of its photothermal effects under the standard illuminant (imitating 1 × sun). However, even with better photothermal effects, the nitrification efficiency still decreased significantly with GNP dosing under the standard illuminant, which might result from stronger cytotoxic effects of GNPs on the nitrifying bacteria. The disappearance of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) around bacterial cells was observed, and the total quantity of viable bacteria decreased significantly after GNP exposuring. Variation in bacterial groups primarily occurred in nitrifying microbial communities, including Nitrosomonas sp., Nitrosospira sp., Comamonas sp. and Bradyrhizobiace sp. Nitrifiers significantly decreased, while the phyla Gammaproteobacteria, Deinocccus, and Bacteroidetes exhibited greater stability during GNP treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroidetes 3aComamonas 3aNitrosomonas 3aNitrosospira 3aactivated sludge 3acytotoxicity 3agamma-Proteobacteria 3agraphene 3amicrobial communities 3ananoparticles 3anitrification 3anitrifying bacteria 3atransportation 3awastewater treatment 0aGraphite nanoparticles 0aPMA-qPCR 0aPMA-Miseq sequencing 0aNitrification 0aPhotothermal effects1 aLiu, Yanchen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9431-69191 aShi, Hanchang1 aHuang, Xia0 tChemosphere.g2017 Sept., v. 182 p.231-237dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.04.1443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03524naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245009100168300001600259500001500275520180800290592002802098650001402126650003202140650002002172650002202192650001902214650001902233650002102252650001102273650003702284650002502321650002902346650001702375650001302392650003302405650000902438650001702447650001202464650001902476650001902495653000902514653001502523653001902538653001302557653001802570700001402588700002302602700001502625700002802640700002902668700001702697773012702714856008402841852000902925655001202934IND60121836520221120085825.0150325e20140102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012183652DNAL7 a10.1080/10934529.2013.8247892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAli, Zulfiqar10aSynthesis, characterization and photocatalytic activity of Al2O3-TiO2 based composites  ap. 125-134.  a2019-12-04  aThe synthesis, characterization and photocatalytic performance of non-traditional Al ₂O ₃-TiO ₂-based photocatalysts is reported. Al ₂O ₃-TiO ₂ support was loaded with various fractions of CuO and ZrO ₂. A sound agreement was observed between the bandgaps of synthesized powders measured by UV-Visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) in the solid phase and UV-Visible spectroscopy in the aqueous medium. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis revealed the composite nature of the catalysts with the retention of individual identity of each component. The average crystallite size of the individual component was found to be in the range of 20 to 40 nm. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis authenticated the presence of CuO and ZrO ₂ at the surface of Al ₂O ₃-TiO ₂ support, while Rutherford Back Scattering Spectroscopy (RBS) confirmed the quantity of the modifiers as per theoretical calculations. The composites showed an enhanced photocatalytic activity in sunlight compared to Al ₂O ₃-TiO ₂ for the degradation of dyes. Efforts were made to elucidate the enhanced sunlight response of the synthesized composite catalysts compared to Al ₂O ₃-TiO ₂. As monitored by ion chromatography (IC), the synthesized photocatalysts completely mineralized the dyes leaving behind inorganic ions in solution. The kinetics of photocatalytic degradation of dyes was evaluated for optimum correlation with the existing models. The stability of the photocatalysts against the photo-corrosion was monitored by analyzing the samples for respective metals in solution after sunlight exposure.

J.10aRole of Absorbed Solvent in Polymer Pen Lithography  ap. 16363-16368.  aWe report on the dynamic role of solvents in molecular printing and show that material transport can be mediated by both environmental solvent (i.e., humidity) and solvent absorbed in the pen. To explore the transport of materials in the absence of environmental solvent, a hydrophobic polymer was patterned using a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) pen array that had been soaked in undecane, a nonpolar solvent that readily absorbs into PDMS. We also explored the patterning of the hydrophilic polymer polyethylene glycol (PEG) and found that, even though PDMS only absorbs trace amounts of water, soaking a PDMS pen array in water enables PEG deposition in completely dry environments for over 2 h. We find that the length of time one can pattern in a dry environment is determined by the availability of absorbed solvent, a relationship that we elucidate by comparing the performance of pens with varying ability to absorb water. Furthermore, a calculation accounting for the dynamics of retained water captures these effects completely, allowing for generalization of this result to other solvents and providing a way to tune the desired solvent retention profile. Taken together, this work explores the subtle and dynamic role of solvent on molecular printing and provides an alternative to strict environmental humidity control for reliable molecular printing.  aPublisher supplied data 3adry environmental conditions 3ahumidity 3ahydrophobicity 3aphysical chemistry 3apolydimethylsiloxane 3apolyethylene glycol 3asoaking 3asolvents1 aBrown, Keith A.1 aWang, Mary X.1 aMirkin, Chad A.0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2013 Dec. 19, v. 117, no. 50 p.16363-16368dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp410494g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02997naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245013900168520157600307592002801883650003101911650002401942650002101966650001901987650001902006650001202025650001702037650001602054650001202070650001402082650001902096653001802115653002702133653001602160653003302176700001702209700001602226700001602242700001802258700001702276700001602293700002002309773010202329856008702431852000902518655001202527IND60768892320221120141532.0220706e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076889232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2022.1124282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yaxin10aOptimization of conditions for a surfactant-producing strain and application to petroleum hydrocarbon-contaminated soil bioremediation  aPetroleum hydrocarbon-contaminated sites have been mainly remediated through the surfactant-enhanced soil leaching method. However, the commonly used chemical surfactants have poor biocompatibility and are prone to form residues in fields. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to establish an effective system of biosurfactant remediation in the field and provide instructions for common bioremediation challenges. First, wild-type Bacillus amyloliquefaciens A3, which produced lipopeptide biosurfactant, was used to improve the production of biosurfactant by atmosphere and room temperature plasma (ARTP) mutagenesis. Second, the mutant 1–24 was selected from a total of 174 mutants due to the outstanding yield. Subsequently, 1–24 was applied in the soil column leaching experiments and removed 45.44% of petroleum hydrocarbons by changing the relevant enzyme activities. Biosurfactant addition and 1–24 inoculation effectively activated a portion of the petroleum hydrocarbons in the soil columns, and 1–24 presented potential as a desired candidate for bioremediation. This is the first report of using ARTP mutagenesis to improve the production of biosurfactants. Simultaneously, we first propose a theoretical system in which the yield of biosurfactant was increased using ARTP mutagenesis for strains and applied the mutants in situ soil bioremediation. This research indicated that the theoretical system was useful in soil columns to simulate field remediation conditions, providing practical references for the bioremediation of contaminated soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus amyloliquefaciens 3aambient temperature 3abiocompatibility 3abioremediation 3abiosurfactants 3aenzymes 3alipopeptides 3amutagenesis 3amutants 3apetroleum 3apolluted soils 0aBiosurfactant 0aPetroleum hydrocarbons 0aMutagenesis 0aSurfactant-enhanced leaching1 aWu, Shanghua1 aWang, Haoyu1 aDong, Yuzhu1 aLi, Xianglong1 aWang, Shijie1 aFan, Haonan1 aZhuang, Xuliang0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 May, v. 213 p.112428-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2022.1124283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03221naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002400144245007300168300001600241520153000257592002801787650001601815650001101831650001901842650003401861650001201895650002001907650001201927650001101939650001201950650000801962650003701970650001202007650001402019650001102033650002002044650002202064650002402086650002002110653001202130653000902142653001002151653001202161653001002173653002002183700002502203700002202228700002802250700002202278700002202300700002802322700002202350700002102372773013902393856007802532852000902610655001202619IND60548915920221119182901.0160905e20160505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054891592DNAL7 a10.1139/apnm-2016-01302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEdgett, Brittany A.14aThe impact of a 48-h fast on SIRT1 and GCN5 in human skeletal muscle  ap. 953-962.  aThe present study examined the impact of a 48 h fast on the expression and activation status of SIRT1 and GCN5, the relationship between SIRT1/GCN5 and the gene expression of PGC-1α, and the PGC-1α target PDK4 in the skeletal muscle of 10 lean healthy men (age, 22.0 ± 1.5 years; peak oxygen uptake, 47.2 ± 6.7 mL/(min·kg)). Muscle biopsies and blood samples were collected 1 h postprandial (Fed) and following 48 h of fasting (Fasted). Plasma insulin (Fed, 80.8 ± 47.9 pmol/L; Fasted, not detected) and glucose (Fed, 4.36 ± 0.86; Fasted, 3.74 ± 0.25 mmol/L, p = 0.08) decreased, confirming participant adherence to fasting. Gene expression of PGC-1α decreased (p < 0.05, –24%), while SIRT1 and PDK4 increased (p < 0.05, +11% and +1023%, respectively), and GCN5 remained unchanged. No changes were observed for whole-muscle protein expression of SIRT1, GCN5, PGC-1α, or COX IV. Phosphorylation of SIRT1, AMPKα, ACC, p38 MAPK, and PKA substrates as well as nuclear acetylation status was also unaltered. Additionally, nuclear SIRT1 activity, GCN5, and PGC-1α content remained unchanged. Preliminary findings derived from regression analysis demonstrate that changes in nuclear GCN5 and SIRT1 activity/phosphorylation may contribute to the control of PGC-1α, but not PDK4, messenger RNA expression following fasting. Collectively, and in contrast with previous animal studies, our data are inconsistent with the altered activation status of SIRT1 and GCN5 in response to 48 h of fasting in human skeletal muscle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylation 3abiopsy 3ablood sampling 3acAMP-dependent protein kinase 3afasting 3agene expression 3aglucose 3ahumans 3ainsulin 3amen 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amuscles 3anutrition 3aoxygen 3aphosphorylation 3aprotein synthesis 3aregression analysis 3askeletal muscle 0afasting 0aGCN5 0aKAT2A 0aPGC-1α 0aSIRT1 0askeletal muscle1 aScribbans, Trisha D.1 aRaleigh, James P.1 aMatusiak, Jennifer B.L.1 aBoonstra, Kristen1 aSimpson, Craig A.1 aPerry, Christopher G.R.1 aQuadrilatero, Joe1 aGurd, Brendon J.0 tApplied Physiology, Nutrition, and Metabolism.g2016 May 5, v. 41, no. 9 p.953-962dNRC Research PresswJournal:23115x1715-53207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/apnm-2016-01303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02357naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002300180245008200203300001600285506007600301520097700377592002801354506003701382650001801419650002301437650001101460650001001471650002201481650002401503650001601527650001301543650001901556650001201575700001901587700001801606700002601624700001601650700001601666700001801682773011701700856007301817852000901890655001201899IND60519578820221207084841.0160505e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051957882DNAL7 a10.1111/mve.121532doi7 aPMC48565402pmcid7 a267441742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGLORIA‐SORIA, A.10aTemporal genetic stability of Stegomyia aegypti (= Aedes aegypti) populations  ap. 235-240.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe mosquito Stegomyia aegypti (= Aedes aegypti) (Diptera: Culicidae) is the primary vector of viruses that cause yellow fever, dengue and Chikungunya fever. In the absence of effective vaccines, the reduction of these diseases relies on vector control strategies. The success of these strategies is tightly linked to the population dynamics of target populations. In the present study, 14 collections from St. aegypti populations separated by periods of 1–13 years were analysed to determine their temporal genetic stability. Although temporal structure is discernible in most populations, the degree of temporal differentiation is dependent on the population and does not obscure the geographic structure of the various populations. The results suggest that performing detailed studies in the years prior to and after population reduction‐ or modification‐based control interventions at each target field site may be useful in assessing the probability of success.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAedes aegypti 3aYellow fever virus 3adengue 3afever 3agenetic stability 3apopulation dynamics 3aprobability 3avaccines 3avector control 3aviruses1 aKELLNER, D.

Island invasive species eradications have well-documented benefits that clearly align with biodiversity conservation-related SDGs, yet the value of this conservation action for socioeconomic benefits is less clear. We examine the potential for island invasive vertebrate eradications to have ecological and socioeconomic benefits. Specifically, we examine: (1) how SDGs may have been achieved through past eradications; and (2) how planned future eradications align with SDGs and associated targets. We found invasive vertebrate eradication to align with 13 SDGs and 42 associated targets encompassing marine and terrestrial biodiversity conservation, promotion of local and global partnerships, economic development, climate change mitigation, human health and sanitation and sustainable production and consumption. Past eradications on 794 islands aligned with a median of 17 targets (range 13–38) by island. Potential future eradications on 292 highly biodiverse islands could align with a median of 25 SDG targets (range 15–39) by island. This analysis enables the global community to explicitly describe the contributions that invasive vertebrate management on islands can make towards implementing the global sustainable development agenda.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited Nations 3abiodiversity 3abiodiversity conservation 3aclimate change 3ahuman health 3ainvasive species 3aislands 3asanitation 3asustainable development 3avertebrates 0acarbon sequestration 0aecotourism 0ahealth 0ainvasive species management 0aUnited Nations Sustainable Development Goals1 aZilliacus, Kelly M1 aQuadri, Paulo1 aWill, David1 aGrima, Nelson1 aSpatz, Dena1 aHolmes, Nick1 aTershy, Bernie1 aHowald, Gregg R1 aCroll, Donald A0 tEnvironmental conservation.g2020 Sept., v. 47, no. 3 p.139-148dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl25024x1469-43877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S03768929200002113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01250naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245013600161300001800297520022500315592002800540650002300568650002300591650002300614650001500637650001200652700001600664700001900680700001900699773013400718856007500852852000900927655001200936IND60658902220221119134451.0190826e20110329xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065890222DNAL7 a10.1039/c0cc05866a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNagasawa, Fumika10aPolarization characteristics of surface-enhanced Raman scattering from a small number of molecules at the gap of a metal nano-dimer  ap. 4514-4516.  aPolarized SERS was measured at the substrate with an Ag nano-dimer array immersed in 4,4′-bipyridine solution.

The use of resistant cultivars is among the best management option for this pest, but the success of this strategy is influenced by the stability of the resistant genotype to the cowpea aphid biotypes present in the major cowpea growing areas in a country. This work, therefore, aimed at identifying cultivars/genotypes with stable resistance to aphid infestation across different cowpea growing ecologies in Ghana and estimating yield loss due to aphid infestation at the seedling stage. To ascertain the stability of aphid-resistant cultivars/genotypes, four cultivars/genotypes (SARC1-57-2, SARC1-91-1, IT97K-499-35, and Zaayura) and a susceptible check (Apagbaala) were tested across 18 locations in Ghana. An on-station experiment was used to quantify yield losses due to aphid attack at the seedling stage in the five cultivars/genotypes mentioned above together with 5 additional cultivars/genotypes [i.e., IT99K-573-3-2-1, IT99K-573-1-1, Padituya, Resistant BC₄F₃ (Zaayura//(Zaayura × SARC1-57-2)), and Susceptible BC₄F₃ (Zaayura//(Zaayura × SARC1-57-2))]. The results showed that SARC1-57-2 was stable in all ecologies, in terms of its resistance to aphids; it had high vigour score (3.8 ± 0.03) and low plant mortality (3.7 ± 0.22%) compared to the susceptible genotypes. The number of days to flowering and maturity were significantly higher in aphid-infested plants than in the uninfested ones. Grain yield loss was estimated to range between 3.8 and 32.8%. Except for SARC1-57-2, Resistant BC₄F₃, and Padituya, the remaining cultivars/genotypes sustained significant yield losses under aphid infestation. Thus, the aphid-resistance gene in SARC1-57-2 is stable against aphids. This resistance genotype can be incorporated into cowpea improvement programmes to breed for aphid-resistant cultivars. Also, the cultivation of such improved cultivars will reduce pesticide usage in cowpea production.  aPublisher supplied data  cKirkhouse Trust 3aAphis craccivora 3abiotypes 3acowpeas 3acultivars 3aflowering 3agenes 3agrain yield 3ainsect infestations 3amortality 3apesticide application 3apests 3aseedlings 3avegetative growth 3avigor 3aGhana1 aNboyine, Jerry A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3289-120X1 aAttamah, Patrick1 aAwuku, Justice F.1 aSugri, Issa1 aZakaria, Mukhtaru1 aLamini, Salim1 aMensah, Gloria1 aLarweh, Victoria1 aOwusu, Robert K.1 aAgyare, Richard Y.1 aYirzagla, Julius1 aAsante, Michael1 aLaary, Joseph K.0 tInternational journal of agronomy.g2020 July 15, v. 2020dHindawiwJournal:J000000090x1687-81677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2020/88693343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03475naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245013100183300001600314520171400330592002802044650002002072650002002092650002002112650002002132650001202152650002602164650004102190650002402231650000902255650001102264650001102275650001402286650001302300650001202313650002902325650002702354650004202381650002302423650002002446650003502466650004302501650005902544651001402603651001102617651002202628651001102650700001802661700002202679700002202701773011702723856004802840852000902888655001202897IND4465590220221118025400.0120727e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446559022DNAL7 a213364862pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-011-1893-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAksu, Abdullah10aToxic metal (Pb, Cd, As and Hg) and organochlorine residue levels in hake (Merluccius merluccius) from the Marmara Sea, Turkey  ap. 509-521.  aToxic metals (Pb, Cd, As and Hg) and organochlorine residue levels were measured in hake (Merluccius merluccius) from the Marmara Sea. Biota samples were collected by a trawling cruise of the R/V ARAR in August and December 2009. The concentrations of toxic metals varied between Pb, 3.23–14.4; Cd, <0.01–2.14; Hg, 0.01–0.18 and As, 0.01–0.21 [Formula: see text]g g − 1 dry wt. Pb levels in the Marmara Sea were found to be higher than the critical limits set by the both Turkish Ministry of Environment for Aquatic Products (1 [Formula: see text]g g − 1 wet wt.) and European countries (2.0 [Formula: see text]g g − 1, UNEP 1985). In contrast, As and Hg levels were found to be lower than the critical limits for two periods. Cd contents of fish from the Marmara Sea were also comparable to or slightly lower than contents of fish from the Southern Black Sea Shelf. The results of organochlorine residues ranged between total HCH, <0.05 and 99 ng g − 1; endrin, <0.001 and 381 ng g − 1; alpha-endosulphan, <0.05 and 90 ng g − 1; beta-endosulphan, <0.05 and 15.3 ng g − 1; o,p DDE, 3.5 and 52.4 ng g − 1; p,p DDE, 7.4 and 139 ng g − 1; o,p DDD, 1.5 and 90.2 ng g − 1 and p,p DDD, 2.7 and 86 ng g − 1 wet weight. The rivers for the distribution of organochlorine levels in the Marmara Sea ordered from highest to lowest as Dil R. > Susurluk R. > Biga R. > Gönen R. The high levels of o,p and p,p DDE, and o,p and p,p DDD compounds, which are metabolites of DDT, indicate its illegal use. Toxic metal and organochlorine residue levels of fish are significantly higher than levels from the Mediterranean Sea.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDDD (pesticide) 3aDDE (pesticide) 3aDDT (pesticide) 3aHCH (pesticide) 3aMarmara 3aMerluccius merluccius 3aUnited Nations Environment Programme 3aaquatic environment 3ahake 3ametals 3arivers 3asea level 3atoxicity 2aAnimals 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aGadiformesxmetabolism 2aHydrocarbons, Chlorinatedxmetabolism 2aMetalsxmetabolism 2aOceans and Seas 2aPesticide Residuesxmetabolism 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxmetabolism 2aWater Pollution, Chemicalxstatistics & numerical data 3aBlack Sea 3aEurope 3aMediterranean Sea 0aTurkey1 aBalkis, Nuray1 aTaşkin, Ömer S.1 aErşan, Mahmut S.0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2011 Nov., v. 182, no. 1-4 p.509-521dSpringer-Verlagx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-011-1893-1  aDNAL 7aarticle02631naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245013400157300001600291520119200307592002801499650002101527650001801548650002001566650001601586650002301602650002201625650002601647650001001673650001501683650001801698650002201716650001901738651001101757700001801768700002001786700002401806700001401830700001501844700001701859700001401876700001601890700001501906700001701921773011701938856007302055852000902128655001202137IND60519578920221120195050.0160505e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051957892DNAL7 a10.1111/mve.121642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBRUSTOLIN, M.10aCulex pipiens and Stegomyia albopicta (= Aedes albopictus) populations as vectors for lineage 1 and 2 West Nile virus in Europe  ap. 166-173.  aThe emerging disease West Nile fever is caused by West Nile virus (WNV), one of the most widespread arboviruses. This study represents the first test of the vectorial competence of European Culex pipiens Linnaeus 1758 and Stegomyia albopicta (= Aedes albopictus) (both: Diptera: Culicidae) populations for lineage 1 and 2 WNV isolated in Europe. Culex pipiens and S. albopicta populations were susceptible to WNV infection, had disseminated infection, and were capable of transmitting both WNV lineages. This is the first WNV competence assay to maintain mosquito specimens under environmental conditions mimicking the field (day/night) conditions associated with the period of maximum expected WNV activity. The importance of environmental conditions is discussed and the issue of how previous experiments conducted in fixed high temperatures may have overestimated WNV vector competence results with respect to natural environmental conditions is analysed. The information presented should be useful to policymakers and public health authorities for establishing effective WNV surveillance and vector control programmes. This would improve preparedness to prevent future outbreaks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAedes albopictus 3aCulex pipiens 3aWest Nile virus 3aarboviruses 3aat-risk population 3aemerging diseases 3aenvironmental factors 3afever 3amonitoring 3apublic health 3avector competence 3avector control 3aEurope1 aTalavera, S.,1 aSANTAMARÍA, C.1 aRivas, J.q(José),1 aPUJOL, N.1 aARANDA, C.1 aMARQUÈS, E.1 aVALLE, M.1 aVERDÚN, M.1 aPAGÈS, N.1 aBUSQUETS, N.0 tMedical and veterinary entomology.g2016 June, v. 30, no. 2 p.166-173dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0269-283X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mve.121643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03310naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245009900164300001600263500001500279520155800294592002801852650001601880650001001896650002001906650001301926650001501939650002801954650002001982650002802002650002502030650004302055650002502098650001502123650004902138650003102187650001302218650002202231650002502253650001302278650002102291653001102312653001702323653002002340653001702360653002102377653001902398700001302417700001702430700001702447700001802464700001702482773012802499856008402627852000902711655001202720IND60121836920221120085729.0150325e20140128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012183692DNAL7 a10.1080/10934529.2013.8388462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Ying10aPyrene-stimulated reactive oxygen species generation and oxidative damage in Carassius auratus  ap. 162-170.  a2019-12-04  aLaboratory experiments were carried out to understand the toxicology of pyrene in the goldfish Carassius auratus and investigate the potential oxidative stress induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) in vivo in a time-dependent manner. Pyrene bioaccumulation, induction of reactive oxygen species and the consequent biochemical responses in the liver of the fish were examined. Fish were exposed to 0.05 mg/L pyrene for different periods. The pyrene concentration in fish liver was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Free radicals were detected by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). The activities of antioxidant enzymes, contents of nonenzymatic antioxidants and malondialdehyde (MDA) in fish liver were also determined. Results indicated that the pyrene concentrations in fish liver reached a maximum level on day 1, and then declined to a low steady state level over 7 days. The free radical significantly increased at 6 h and reached a maximum on day 2, while the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and MDA content were induced, and the reduced glutathione (GSH) content was inhibited by day 2. The catalase (CAT) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities were significantly induced at 12 h. These results indicated that pyrene was rapidly bioaccumulated in fish resulting in redox cycling, and the production of free radical is an important mechanism of pyrene toxicity in C. auratus . The indicators of antioxidant system are sensitive and useful for the study of early biomarkers of pyrene exposure in fish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aglutathione 3aliver 3abioaccumulation 3acatalase 3abiomarkers 3aglutathione transferase 3amalondialdehyde 3areactive oxygen species 3asuperoxide dismutase 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aenvironmental health 3atoxicology 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3alaboratory experimentation 3atoxicity 3aCarassius auratus 3aantioxidant activity 3agoldfish 3aoxidative stress 0apyrene 0afree radical 0aearly biomarker 0aantioxidants 0aoxidative damage 0aTime-dependent1 aJia, Jun1 aGuo, Hong Y.1 aYang, Liu Y.1 aWang, Xiao R.1 aSun, Yuan Y.0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2014 Jan. 28, v. 49, no. 2 p.162-170dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-41177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10934529.2013.8388463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01454naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245009200155300001800247520035000265592002800615650002300643650002300666650002300689650002100712650001700733650002200750650000700772700001900779700001900798700002100817700001600838700002000854773013400874856007501008852000901083655001201092IND60658902520221119134653.0190826e20110628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065890252DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc00007a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Liang10aElectrochemically patterning sol–gel structures on conducting and insulating surfaces  ap. 6909-6911.  aA new approach for the local deposition of sol–gel films on conducting and insulating surfaces using scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) via the feedback and direct modes is presented.

Direct interactions with ion channels received much attention after it was found that anesthetics do not change the structure of homogeneous model membranes. However, it was recently found that halothane, a prototypical anesthetic, changes domain structure of a binary lipid membrane. The noble gas xenon is an excellent anesthetic and provides a pivotal test of the generality of this finding, extended to ternary lipid raft mixtures. We report that xenon and conventional anesthetics change the domain equilibrium in two canonical ternary lipid raft mixtures. These findings demonstrate a membrane-mediated mechanism whereby inhalation anesthetics can affect the lipid environment of transmembrane proteins.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abreathing 3ahalothane 3aion channels 3alipids 3amechanism of action 3amodels 3aphysical chemistry 3atransmembrane proteins 3axenon1 aWorcester, David L.0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2013 Dec. 19, v. 117, no. 50 p.16141-16147dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp411261g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03726naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245012600169300001200295520235300307592002802660650002402688650002502712650001202737650001102749650001602760650002202776650001602798650002202814650002102836650002302857650001702880650002302897650001002920650001502930653002102945653001902966653001202985653002302997653002603020700001703046773011103063856008503174852000903259655001203268IND60542579520221118142627.0190403e20150515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054257952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2015.02.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChandler, J.L.10aVariable effects of timber harvest on the survival, growth, and reproduction of American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L.)  ap. 1-9.  aTimber harvest is a recurrent, widespread canopy disturbance that has long-affected the eastern deciduous forest. Multi-dimensional shifts in forest dynamics occur following timbering, and while a great deal of research on tree response to timbering has been performed, far less focus has been placed on herbaceous understory response to timbering. American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L.) is a long-lived, economically valuable medicinal herb believed to be adapted to the dynamic light conditions of old-growth forests. The purpose of this study was to determine if timber harvests of varying intensity had positive, neutral, or negative effects on the survival, growth, and reproduction of wild American ginseng. Hemispherical images were used to calculate the canopy openness above ginseng plants. Population census data were used to obtain measurements of survival, relative growth rate, seed production, seed production efficiency, and new seedling emergence. Changes in survival and seed production in response to timbering were analyzed using log-likelihood analyses, and the responses of relative growth rate and seed production efficiency to timbering were analyzed using nested two-way ANOVAs. Initial ginseng survival varied among sites, with lowest survival at the more intensely timbered site. Additionally, long-term survival decreased following timbering. Relative growth rate of individuals increased following timbering in both short-term and long-term analyses, with relative growth rate being greatest at sites where more tree biomass was removed. While seed production decreased the year directly following timbering, seed production increased over the three years after timbering. Both short-term and long-term effects of timbering on seed production efficiency differed among populations. While seed production increases in the years after timbering, this stimulation may not be realized due to sub-optimal germination conditions. Due both to decreases in survival following timbering and the unlikely continued increases in growth and seed production as the canopy fills in, some of these often-used timbering strategies negatively impact ginseng performance. Silvicultural strategies that mimic old-growth forest structure may be better suited for the conservation of ginseng and other similar obligate understory species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanax quinquefolius 3aanalysis of variance 3abiomass 3acanopy 3acensus data 3adeciduous forests 3agermination 3along term effects 3amedicinal plants 3aold-growth forests 3areproduction 3aseedling emergence 3atrees 3aunderstory 0aAmerican ginseng 0aTimber harvest 0aLogging 0aCanopy disturbance 0aPanax quinquefolius L1 aMcGraw, J.B.0 tForest ecology and management.g2015 May 15, v. 344 p.1-9dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2015.02.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02642naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245006500156300001800221520164800239592002801887650002501915650002301940650002301963650001701986650002102003650002102024650002102045700001502066700001702081773013402098856007502232852000902307655001202316IND60658902620221119134552.0190826e20110628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065890262DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc00014d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEun Jun, Mi10a“Turn-on” fluorescent sensing with “reactive” probes  ap. 7583-7601.  aChemical probes are valuable tools for the investigation of biochemical processes, diagnosis of disease markers, detection of hazardous compounds, and other purposes. Therefore, the development of chemical probes continues to grow through various approaches with different disciplines and design strategies. Fluorescent probes have received much attention because they are sensitive and easy-to-operate, in general. To realize desired selectivity toward a given analyte, the recognition site of a fluorescent probe is designed in such a way to maximize the binding interactions, usually through weak molecular forces such as hydrogen bonding, toward the analyte over other competing ones. In addition to such a supramolecular approach, the development of fluorescent probes that sense analytes through chemical reactions has witnessed its usefulness for achieving high selectivity, in many cases, superior to that obtainable by the supramolecular approach. Creative incorporations of the reactive groups to latent fluorophores have provided novel chemical probes for various analytes. In this feature article, we overview the recent progress in the development of turn-on fluorescent probes that are operating through chemical reactions triggered by target analytes. Various chemical reactions have been implemented in the development of many reactive probes with very high selectivity and sensitivity toward target analytes. A major emphasis has been focused on the type of chemical reactions utilized, with the hope that further explorations can be made with new chemical reactions to develop reactive probes useful for various applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochemical pathways 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3ahydrogen bonding 3atoxic substances1 aRoy, Basab1 aHan Ahn, Kyo0 tChemical communications.g2011 June 28, v. 47, no. 27 p.7583-7601dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1cc00014d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02509naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002300169245013200192300001400324520104700338592002801385650001901413650002001432650002001452650001101472650001801483650002301501650001501524650000901539650002401548650001301572650001201585650002901597650004901626650002801675650003501703650000901738650004301747700001801790700002101808700003001829773008701859856008401946852000902030655001202039IND60086716520221118025117.0141102e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008671652DNAL7 a228925712pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2012.07.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŠmídová, Klára10aFate and bioavailability of ¹⁴C-pyrene and ¹⁴C-lindane in sterile natural and artificial soils and the influence of aging  ap. 93-98.  aSoil organic matter is used to extrapolate the toxicity and bioavailability of organic pollutants between different soils. However, it has been shown that other factors such as microbial activity are crucial. The aim of this study was to investigate if sterilization can reduce differences in the fate and bioavailability of organic pollutants between different soils. Three natural soils with increasing total organic carbon (TOC) content were collected and three artificial soils were prepared to obtain similar TOCs. Soils were sterilized and spiked with ¹⁴C-pyrene and ¹⁴C-lindane. Total ¹⁴C radioactivity, HPCD extractability, and bioaccumulation in Eisenia fetida were measured over 56 days. When compared to non-sterile soils, differences between the natural and artificial soils and the influence of soil-contaminant contact time were generally reduced in the sterile soils (especially with middle TOC). The results indicate the possibility of using sterile soils as “the worst case scenario” in soil ecotoxicity studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEisenia fetida 3abioaccumulation 3abioavailability 3acarbon 3aecotoxicology 3amicrobial activity 3apollutants 3asoil 3asoil organic matter 3atoxicity 2aAnimals 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aHexachlorocyclohexanexanalysisxmetabolism. 2aOligochaetaxmetabolism 2aPyrenesxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aSoil 2aSoil Pollutantsxanalysisxmetabolism.1 aHofman, Jakub1 aIte, Aniefiok E.1 aSemple, K.

The thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) redox system was inhibited by ebselen (10 μM), and then the bacterium was exposed to 4 kGy of ionizing radiation. The differentially expressed proteins were analyzed using label-free quantitative (LFQ) proteomics. The 4 kGy radiation treatment increases the expression of stress response proteins like osmotically inducible protein OsmC, catalase, and metallophosphoesterase compared to control. Ebselen plus radiation treatment augments oxidoreductases proteins in D. radiodurans. Further, the proteins involved in glycolysis, tricarboxylic acetic acid (TCA) and proteins like proteases, peptidase, and peptide transporters were significantly decreased in the ebselen plus radiation group compared to radiation treated group. Further, ebselen plus radiation treatment increases the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters involved in the efflux of toxic chemicals and nutrient uptake and the stress response related membrane protein like S-layer homology domain-containing protein in D. radiodurans. Thus, the results show that the altered redox status via inhibition of TrxR redox system significantly affects the expression of essential cellular proteins for the survival. The cellular content of D. radiodurans may be used to handle redox imbalances in the normal cells during cancer radiotherapy. Deinococcus radiodurans is a popular radioresistance organism with efficient antioxidant systems and DNA repair mechanisms. There are many antioxidant systems and small molecules that responsible for its resistance. The importance of thiol based antioxidant systems in its resistance property has not fully studied yet. Thioredoxin reductase is an important disulfide containing protein that involved in maintaining redox homeostasis. The TrxR inhibition affects the cell survival and synthesis of molecules against ionizing radiation. In this study we are reporting the effects of TrxR inhibitor on proteome of D. radiodurans upon ionizing radiation.

Quantification of the modification degree of the protein is crucial during the development and licensing phase and later in order to monitor the industrial production process and to match product specification. In this work, we describe an innovative way to measure directly the modification degree of polysialylated proteins using proton NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) spectroscopy. Following a calibration step, the modification degree can be easily deduced by the integration ratio of a separate signal from the polymer and selected signals from the protein. In fact, the upfield-shifted signals of methyl groups from Valine, Leucine and Isoleucine can be used as an internal calibration reference for the integration. In this paper recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) and recombinant factor IX (rFIX) proteins modified by polysialic acid (PSA) are used to illustrate the accuracy, reproducibility and ease of the method that may replace or complement wet-chemistry approaches.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive properties 3acalibration 3aisoleucine 3aleucine 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolymers 3atherapeutics 3avaline 3awater solubility 0aModification degree 0aQuantitative NMR 0aPolysialic acid 0aResorcinol assay1 aKosma, Paul1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5342-71610 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2021 Aug. 31, v. 185 p.1015-1021dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.06.1653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03079naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245014300164300002000307520158600327592002801913650004401941650001901985650001502004650001202019650001802031650001502049650001502064650001102079650001202090650001502102650001902117650001402136650002002150650001302170650002302183700003302206700002902239700002602268700001902294700006102313773015502374856008302529852000902612655001202621IND60754827420221122232236.0211024e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075482742DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-12609-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDave, Niyam10aEvaluation of seasonal variation and the optimization of reducing sugar extraction from Ulva prolifera biomass using thermochemical method  ap. 58857-58871.  aGreen macroalgae comprise significant amount of structural carbohydrates for their conversion to liquid biofuels. However, it generally relies on species characteristics and the variability in seasonal profile to determine its route for bioprocessing. Hence, this study was conducted to analyze the indigenous marine macroalgal strain (Ulva prolifera) with respect to periodic trend and reducing sugar extraction. Consequently, in our investigation, the monthly variation in sugar profile and bioethanol yield was assessed between the monsoon and post-monsoon seasons, of which relatively high reducing sugar and fermentative bioethanol yield of about 0.152 ± 0.009 g/gdw and 6.275 ± 0.161 g/L was obtained for the October-month isolate (MITM10). Thereafter, the biochemical profile of this collected biomass (MITM10) revealed carbohydrate 34.98 ± 3.30%, protein 12.45 ± 0.49%, and lipid 1.93 ± 0.07%, respectively, on dry weight basis. Of these, the total carbohydrate fraction yielded the maximum reducing sugar of 0.156 ± 0.005 g/gdw under optimal conditions (11.07% (w/v) dosage, 0.9 M H₂SO₄, 121°C for 50 min) for thermal-acid hydrolysis. Furthermore, the elimination of polysaccharides was confirmed using the characterization techniques scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Therefore, the present thermochemical treatment method provides a species-specific novel strategy to breakdown the macroalgal cell wall polysaccharides that enhances sugar extraction for its utilization as an efficient bioenergy resource.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aUlva prolifera 3abioethanol 3abiomass 3abioprocessing 3acell walls 3ahydrolysis 3alipids 3aliquids 3amacroalgae 3amonsoon season 3apollution 3apolysaccharides 3aresearch 3aseasonal variation1 aVaradavenkatesan, Thivaharan1 aSiṃha, Rāmaśaraṇa,1 aGiri, Balendu Shekher1 aSelvaraj, Raja1 aVinayagam, Ramesh1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1443-55260 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 Nov., v. 28, no. 42 p.58857-58871dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-12609-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02227naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002800155245013400183300001400317520088700331592002801218650002401246650002501270650001801295650001001313650001001323650001901333650001701352650001701369650001401386650001401400650001401414650001101428651001001439653002501449653002301474653001001497653002401507700002701531700002701558773009701585856009001682852000901772655001201781IND60532375520221116193403.0190318e20150701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053237552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2015.03.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarthikeyan, Velmurugan12aA novel report of fungal pathogen Aspergillus awamori causing black gill infection on Litopenaeus vannamei (pacific white shrimp)  ap. 36-40.  aLitopenaeus vannamei (pacific white shrimp) is the most cultured shrimp species which is also susceptible to microbial diseases like other shrimps.

Hence, preservative release with response to fruit requirement is desired. In this study, acid synthesized in the overripe fruits was envisaged to cleave acid labile hydrazone to release preservative salicylaldehyde from graphene oxide (GO). To maximize loading and to overcome the challenge of GO reduction by hydrazine, two-step activation with ethylenediamine and 4-nitrophenyl chloroformate respectively, are followed. The final composite shows efficient preservative release with the stimuli of the overripe fruit juice and improves the fruit shelf life. The composite shows less toxicity as compared to the free preservative along with the additional scope to reuse. The composite was vacuum-filtered through a 0.4 μm filter paper, to prepare a robust wrapper for the fruit storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3afood preservatives 3afood-packaging materials 3afruit juices 3afruits 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3ahydrazine 3ahydrazones 3ahydroxybenzaldehyde 3ashelf life 3atoxicity 0ananoagri 0asmart fruit pack 0anontoxic nanopreservative 0agraphene oxide1 aBiswal, Badal Kumar1 akumari, Divya1 aBindra, Pulkit1 aKumar, Satish1 aStobdan, Tsering1 aShanmugam, Vijayakumar1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7117-56310 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 May 03, v. 10, no. 22 p.18478-18488dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b020483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02880naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245007900157300001600236500002000252520169000272592002801962596005201990596001902042650002502061650002002086650001102106650001402117650001502131650001402146650002302160650001102183650001102194650001102205651001202216700002502228773014502253856007502398852000902473655001202482IND60786369320221121061631.0220803e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078636932DNAL7 a10.1002/tafs.101892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFox, Adam G.10aMovement and Out‐Migration of Juvenile Atlantic Sturgeon in Georgia, USA  ap. 952-962.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAtlantic Sturgeon Acipenser oxyrinchus, a federally endangered anadromous fish, persist along the East Coast of North America. Despite two decades of federal protection, many populations have yet to fully recover and major knowledge gaps remain, especially in the southern portion of the species’ range. The seasonal movement patterns of river‐resident juveniles (RRJs) are not well understood, and little is known about the transition from the RRJ life stage to the marine‐migratory juvenile (MMJ) life stage. During the summers of 2014–2016 we captured and acoustically tagged age‐1 RRJ Atlantic Sturgeon in the Ogeechee, Altamaha, and Satilla rivers, Georgia, to (1) describe and quantify seasonal movements of RRJ Atlantic Sturgeon in order to identify important estuarine nursery areas and (2) examined temporal patterns of out‐migration in order to better understand the critical transition from RRJ to MMJ in Georgia rivers. Movements of 79 fish were monitored using an array of stationary receivers deployed downstream from the heads of tide in each river system. During the summer months in each river, the fish congregated in upriver, freshwater reaches, but during the winter months they moved downriver and became more broadly distributed. Some fish (36.7%; n = 29) migrated back up their natal river in the spring and remained there as age‐2 RRJs. We observed the out‐migration of 30.4% (n = 24) of age‐2 MMJs only during December–March, based on detections outside their natal river. The results of this study support the assumption of the closure of age‐1 populations that underpins recent quantitative studies of Atlantic Sturgeon recruitment.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  cNOAA Fisheries 3aAcipenser oxyrinchus 3aanadromous fish 3acoasts 3aestuaries 3afreshwater 3ajuveniles 3amigratory behavior 3arivers 3aspring 3asummer 3aGeorgia1 aPeterson, Douglas L.0 tTransactions of the American Fisheries Society.g2019 Sept., v. 148, no. 5 p.952-962dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:19703x0002-84877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tafs.101893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03446naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002200155245018000177300001400357520203800371592002802409650001802437650001602455650001502471650001302486650001402499650001902513650001202532650001002544650002102554650001602575650002702591651001902618653001802637653002202655653002002677653001402697653002102711700002202732700002002754700001802774773009702792856009002889852000902979655001202988IND60532375620221116193405.0190318e20150701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053237562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2015.03.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSawusdee, Amonsak10aImprovements in the physiological performance of European flat oysters Ostrea edulis (Linnaeus, 1758) cultured on elevated reef structures: Implications for oyster restoration  ap. 41-48.  aThe precarious status of flat oyster Ostrea edulis stocks in Europe is widely acknowledged. To build a scientific basis for oyster restoration, an elevated experimental reef stocked with O. edulis was established within Poole Bay (Dorset, UK). Oysters were out planted on twenty four oyster reef modules (80cm above sea bed) and compared with oysters held on the sea bed close to each reef module to test the hypothesis that a reef habitat enhanced physiological performance. Filtration and respiration rates, condition index, haemolymph protein concentration, haemocyte counts and gonad maturation were measured as indicators of physiological performance. During the first 15months of oyster reef deployment, water samples were collected at regular intervals at the sea bed and at a height of 80cm from the sea bed to determine chlorophyll a concentration, total suspended solids and bacterial abundance. Total suspended solids were significantly higher at the sea bed than at 80cm above the sea bed at every sampling interval, while bacterial abundance adjacent to the sea bed was significantly higher than 80cm above the sea bed in August and November 2013 when temperature was 18°C and 15°C, respectively. The filtration rates of oysters varied with elevation (reef/sea bed) and months. Filtration rates of ‘reef oysters’ (oysters on elevated reefs) were significantly higher than ‘sea bed oysters’ (oysters held on the sea bed). Respiration rates varied among months but were not significantly affected by elevation (reef/sea bed). Elevation and month also affected the total number of haemocytes and the granulocyte population; reef oysters had significantly higher numbers of haemocytes than sea bed oysters. As current stocks of European flat oysters (O. edulis) in Europe have declined in both abundance and distribution, the results of this pilot study suggest that the culture of oysters on elevated reef structure represents at least a partial solution to improve O. edulis physiology for restoration in Europe.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOstrea edulis 3achlorophyll 3afiltration 3ahabitats 3ahemocytes 3aoyster culture 3aoysters 3areefs 3arespiratory rate 3atemperature 3atotal suspended solids 3aUnited Kingdom 0aOstrea edulis 0aOyster physiology 0aFiltration rate 0aHaemocyte 0aRespiration rate1 aJensen, Antony C.1 aCollins, Ken J.1 aHauton, Chris0 tAquaculture.g2015 July 01, v. 444 p.41-48dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2015.03.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03286naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002200092024001900114024003200133040001800165100002400183245007600207300001800283506007600301520159800377592002801975506003702003650002502040650001002065650001202075650001102087650001702098650002002115650003102135650001102166650001202177650001302189650001502202650001302217650001802230650003902248650003702287650003102324650005002355650001302405650001402418650003902432650002302471700001902494700002302513773012002536852000902656856007902665655001202744IND4462575820221207055756.0200426e20101101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446257582DNAL7 aPMC31152422pmcid7 a210519452pmid7 a10.4161/psb.5.11.133582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCvrčková, Fatima,10aComputational identification of root hair-specific genes in Arabidopsis  ap. 1407-1418.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aActivated cortical domains (ACDs) are regions of the plant cell cortex performing localized membrane turnover, delimited by concerted action of the cortical cytoskeleton and endomembrane compartments. Arabidopsis thaliana rhizodermis consists of two cell types differing by a single ACD (trichoblasts, carrying tip-growing root hairs, and hairless atrichoblasts), providing a model for the study of ACD determination. We compiled a set of genes specifically upregulated in root hairs from published transcriptome data, and compared it with a “virtual Arabidopsis root hair proteome”, i.e. a list of computationally identified homologs of proteins from the published soybean root hair proteome. Both data sets were enriched in genes and proteins associated with root hairs in functional studies, but there was little overlap between the transcriptome and the proteome: the former captured gene products specific to root hairs, while the latter selected those abundant in root hairs but not necessarily specific to them. Decisive steps in ACD specification may be performed by signaling proteins of high expression specifity and low abundance. Nevertheless, 73 genes specifically transcribed in Arabidopsis trichoblasts or root hairs encode homologs of abundant root hair proteins from soybean. Most of them encode "housekeeping" proteins required for rapid tip growth. However, among the "candidates" is also a generative actin isoform, ACT11. Preliminary characterization of an act11 mutant allele indeed suggests a hitherto unexpected role for this gene in root and root hair development.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aactin 3aalleles 3acortex 3acytoskeleton 3adata collection 3agene expression regulation 3amodels 3amutants 3aproteome 3aroot hairs 3asoybeans 3atranscriptome 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Profiling. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxphysiology 2aMutation 2aPhenotype 2aPlant Rootsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPollenxmetabolism1 aBezvoda, Radek1 aŽárský, Viktor,0 tPlant signaling & behavior.g2010 Nov. 1, v. 5, no. 11 p.1407-1418dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2184x1559-23247nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.4161/psb.5.11.133583Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02466naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245012100161300002000282500001900302520113600321592002801457650001501485650003001500650001501530650001101545650001301556650002001569650001201589650001101601650001401612650001901626650002201645650001301667700001701680700005301697700001501750700001701765773017301782856008001955852000902035655001202044IND60701211320221120074354.0200708e20200618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070121132DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.0c018822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Yingni10aMolecular Understanding of Heterogeneous Mercury Adsorption and Oxidation Mechanisms over the CuCl₂/TiO₂ Sorbent  ap. 12610-12616.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCuCl₂/TiO₂ has been regarded as a highly promising sorbent to remove elemental mercury (Hg⁰) from flue gas. The density functional theory and periodical model were used to demonstrate mercury adsorption, transformation, and desorption mechanisms over the CuCl₂/TiO₂ sorbent. The calculation results show that the chemisorption mechanism dominates Hg⁰, HgCl, and HgCl₂ adsorption processes. Hg⁰ adsorption on the CuCl₂/TiO₂ surface is exothermic by 45.51 kJ/mol. Hg⁰ is found to be adsorbed on the CuCl₂/TiO₂ surface via the strong interaction between Hg and Cu atoms. Electron accumulation and depletion play a crucial role in the strong interaction between the adsorbed Hg and CuCl₂/TiO₂ surface. The formation of HgCl₂ undergoes four elementary reaction steps: Hg⁰→Hg(ads)→HgCl(ads)→HgCl₂(ads)→HgCl₂. The energy barriers of HgCl(ads) and HgCl₂(ads) formation steps are approximately 108.08 and 22.88 kJ/mol, respectively. HgCl₂ desorption from the CuCl₂/TiO₂ surface is the rate-limiting step of the whole Hg transformation process and needs a reaction heat of 346.21 kJ/mol.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3adensity functional theory 3adesorption 3aenergy 3aflue gas 3aheat production 3amercury 3amodels 3aoxidation 3aprocess design 3areaction kinetics 3asorbents1 aYang, Yingju1 aLiu, Jing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6520-96121 aWang, Zhen1 aDing, Junyan0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2020 June 18, v. 59, no. 27 p.12610-12616dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.0c018823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03880naa a2200925 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245009100169300001400260520147000274592002801744650002101772650001401793650001501807650002401822650002301846650001901869650002701888650001901915650001701934650004301951650001901994650002102013650001202034650002102046650001102067650002802078650004302106650001702149650001302166650001702179653002002196653002102216653001702237653001702254653002402271653000802295653000802303653000802311653001002319653000902329653000702338653000802345653000702353653001702360653000902377653000802386653000802394653000902402653000902411653001002420653000802430653000802438653000802446653001202454653000902466653000802475653000802483653000902491653000902500653000702509653001002516700002502526700002802551700002302579700002102602700002102623700002202644700001902666700002102685700002302706773012202729856008202851852000902933655001202942IND60593276320221119111900.0190129e20180601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059327632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.abb.2018.02.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShahriyary, Leila10aEffect of glycated insulin on the blood-brain barrier permeability: An in vitro study  ap. 54-66.  aAltered blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability may contribute to pathogenesis of diabetes-related central nervous system disorders. Considering the presence of glycated insulin in plasma of type 2 diabetic patients, we hypothesized that glycated insulin could induce changes in paracellular permeability in BBB. Therefore, the authors decided to study the effect of glycated insulin on paracellular permeability in a BBB model and the change induced in insulin conformation upon glycation.In this study, the structural modification was examined by fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopies and dynamic light scattering. Cell proliferation and production of ROS in astrocytes and HUVEC cells were analyzed by MTT and spectrofluorometric assays, respectively. Apoptosis induction was determined and confirmed by flow cytometry and western blot analyses, respectively. The permeability was measured Lucifer yellow and FITC-Dextran.According to our results, glycated insulin presented altered conformation and more exposed hydrophobic patches than insulin. Formation of oligomeric species and advanced glycated end products (AGEs) were determined. Lower cell viability, higher apoptosis, and more ROS were detected upon treatment of cells with glycated insulin. Finally, glycated insulin led to increased Lucifer yellow and FITC-dextran transportation across the BBB model which could result from ROS producing and apoptosis-inducing activities of AGE-insulin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aapoptosis 3aastrocytes 3ablood-brain barrier 3acell proliferation 3acell viability 3acentral nervous system 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescence 3ahuman umbilical vein endothelial cells 3ahydrophobicity 3ain vitro studies 3ainsulin 3alight scattering 3amodels 3anervous system diseases 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apathogenesis 3apatients 3apermeability 0aType 2 diabetes 0aGlycated insulin 0aAGE products 0aPermeability 0aBlood-brain barrier 0aBBB 0aCNS 0aAGE 0aHUVEC 0aT2DM 0aAD 0aROS 0aLY 0aFITC-Dextran 0aDMEM 0aFBS 0aMTT 0aPapp 0aDMSO 0aAO/EB 0aSEM 0aANS 0aTFA 0aRP-HPLC 0aRAGE 0aPBS 0aPET 0aPVDF 0aPMSF 0aIR 0aIGF1R1 aRiazi, Gholamhossein1 aLornejad, Mohammad Reza1 aGhezlou, Mansoureh1 aBigdeli, Bahareh1 aDelavari, Behdad1 aMamashli, Fatemeh1 aAbbasi, Shayan1 aDavoodi, Jamshid1 aSaboury, Ali Akbar0 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g2018 June 01, v. 647 p.54-66dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11658x0003-98617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2018.02.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02771naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245012100163300002000284500001900304520164600323592002801969650003401997650001502031650001902046650001402065700005402079700001202133700001802145700002002163773017302183856008002356852000902436655001202445IND60701211420221120074324.0200708e20200616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070121142DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.0c020682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Haizhen10aThree-Fluid Sequential Micromixing-Assisted Nanoparticle Synthesis Utilizing Alternating Current Electrothermal Flow  ap. 12514-12524.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMultiple micromixing in a controlled sequence is an essential process for complex chemical synthesis of functional nanoparticles with desired physicochemical properties. Herein, we developed a unique sequential micromixing-assisted nanoparticle synthesis platform utilizing alternating current electrothermal flow (ACET). A two-fluid micromixer comprised with pairs of staggered asymmetric electrodes was first designed and characterized by joint numerical simulations and experiments to obtain the optimized electrode configuration within a straight channel. On this basis, an extra pair of symmetric electrodes was added at the main channel entrance to form a three-fluid sequential micromixer. The middle fluid would first mix with the side fluids through the symmetric ACET microvortex pair in the upstream region and then realize the side fluid mixing by the asymmetric ACET microvortex in the downstream region. Rapid and complete mixing in a short channel was observed for a relatively high flow velocity up to 7 mm/s at an AC signal of 27.5 V and 1 MHz. Sequential micromixing was achieved by flexibly adjusting the volume of each fluid and the AC voltage within the three-fluid mixer. Both the two-fluid mixing process and the three-fluid mixing process were applied to synthesize the Co–Fe Prussian blue analogue nanoparticles. In comparison with two-fluid mixing, three-fluid sequential mixing offers nanoparticles with higher dispersion, controlled particle morphology, and more regular shapes. Therefore, the ACET flow-based sequential micromixing strategy can be an alternative for complex chemical and biochemical reactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrodes 3aprocess design 3asynthesis1 aRen, Yukun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0167-12741 aTao, Ye1 aJiang, Tianyi1 aJiang, Hongyuan0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2020 June 16, v. 59, no. 27 p.12514-12524dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.0c020683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03508naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245013700159300001600296500002000312520205200332592002802384650001302412650002902425650001702454650001502471650002302486650001902509650001802528650001302546650002302559650002302582650001402605650001302619650001802632650001602650651001502666651001602681651001802697651002902715700002402744700006102768773012702829856007302956852000903029655001203038IND60636445920221119171609.0190408e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063644592DNAL7 a10.1111/ddi.128562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCasties, Isabel10aEnvironmental tolerance of three gammarid species with and without invasion record under current and future global warming scenarios  ap. 603-612.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: Numerous regions worldwide are highly impacted by anthropogenic activities and globalization, with climate change and species introductions being among the greatest stressors to biodiversity and ecosystems. A main donor region of non‐indigenous species (NIS) for numerous European water bodies, as well as in the North American Great Lakes is the Ponto‐Caspian region (i.e., Black, Azov and Caspian Seas), with some of those species having significant impact on local communities and ecosystem functioning. LOCATION: Northern European, Ponto‐Caspian and North American regions. METHODS: To determine environmental tolerance of native species and related NIS under current and future global warming scenarios of the Baltic Sea, we conducted common garden experiments to test temperature tolerance of three euryhaline gammarid species: one Baltic (Gammarus oceanicus), one Ponto‐Caspian (Pontogammarus maeoticus) and one North American species (Gammarus tigrinus) in two different salinities. RESULTS: Our results determined that mortality of P. maeoticus in all temperature treatments (i.e., increased, control, and decreased) at the end of both experiments (i.e., conducted in salinities of 10 and 16 g/kg) was lower when compared to mortality of G. oceanicus and (c) G. tigrinus. The highest mortality was observed for G. oceanicus, reaching 100% in both experiments in the increased temperature treatment. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Due to the high environmental tolerance of the Ponto‐Caspian species tested in this study, as well as the fact that Ponto‐Caspian species evolved in environmentally variable habitats and currently inhabit warmer waters than species from North America and Northern Europe, we suggest that species from the Ponto‐Caspian region may benefit from global warming when invading new areas. Those new invasions may, in the best case scenario, increase biodiversity of the Baltic Sea. However, if notorious invaders arrive, they may have a significant impact on local communities and ecosystem functioning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGammarus 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiodiversity 3aecosystems 3aeuryhaline species 3aglobal warming 3aglobalization 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3amortality 3asalinity 3asurface water 3atemperature 3aBaltic Sea 3aGreat Lakes 3aNorth America 3aNorthern European region1 aClemmesen, Catriona1 aBriski, Elizabeta1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1896-38600 tDiversity & distributions.g2019 Apr., v. 25, no. 4 p.603-612dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867071x1366-95167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ddi.128563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02590naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100002100159245012000180300001600300520100100316592002801317650001501345650001501360650002201375650001701397650002601414650001101440650001501451650002201466650002201488650001701510650001501527650001701542650001401559650001501573650002001588653002101608653001101629653002101640653001701661653002301678700005801701700002501759700002501784700005801809773011401867856009401981852000902075655001202084IND60626467620221120205747.0190214e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062646762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2018.12.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMizuno, Shunsuke10aCyclodextrin cross-linked polymer monolith for efficient removal of environmental pollutants by flow-through method  ap. 136-141.  aβ-cyclodextrin (β-CD) cross-linked polymer has been proved to be critical adsorbents for removal of many kinds of environmental pollutants from water resources. This study deals with the fabrication of β-CD cross-linked polymer monolith (CD monolith) through novel phase separation technique and effective removal of the pollutants by using prepared CD monolith columns. CD monoliths were prepared by the reaction of monochloro triazine group modified β-cyclodextrin derivative and polyethyleneimine in water. The obtained CD monoliths showed three dimensional interconnected porous structures, high surface area, and sufficient mechanical properties. The diameter of macroporous structures of CD monoliths was precisely controllable from micro-to nano-meters. This morphological control enables effective water flow based application with low pressure loss. We demonstrated that CD monolith showed high adsorption performance in the adsorption of model pollutants by flow-through experiment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3abeta-cyclodextrin 3acrosslinking 3amechanical properties 3amodels 3apollutants 3apollution control 3apolyethyleneimine 3aporous media 3aseparation 3asurface area 3atriazines 3awater flow 3awater resources 0aPolymer monolith 0aColumn 0aPhase separation 0aCyclodextrin 0aWater purification1 aAsoh, Taka-Aki1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9087-51741 aTakashima, Yoshinori1 aHarada, A.q(Akira),1 aUyama, Hiroshi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8587-25070 tPolymer degradation and stability.g2019 Feb., v. 160 p.136-141dElsevier LtdwJournal:12486x0141-39107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2018.12.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03230naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245015900169300001600328520147500344592002801819650002301847650001501870650001301885650003101898650001401929650001401943650002101957650001401978650002201992650001202014650002002026650001102046650002102057650003002078650001102108650002102119650001502140650002002155650001902175650001302194650001102207653001802218653001902236653002502255653001802280653002802298700001802326700001702344700001802361700001502379700001402394773013602408856008702544852000902631655001202640IND60694009020221120104850.0200516e20200901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069400902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.05.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yeqing14aThe homogenous polysaccharide SY01-23 purified from leaf of Morus alba L. has bioactivity on human gut Bacteroides ovatus and Bacteroides cellulosilyticus  ap. 698-707.  aFunction of mulberry leaf (Morus alba L.) polysaccharide has been reported on antitumor, immunostimulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. However, the bioactivity on human gut microbiota is unclear so far. Here, three homogenous polysaccharides named SY01-21, SY01-22, SY01-23 were isolated from mulberry leaf with molecular weight 57 kDa, 25 kDa and 7.2 kDa, respectively. The monosaccharide composition of SY01-21 contained rhamnose, galactose and arabinose in a molar ratio of 7.60:43.52:48.88. SY01-22 contained rhamnose, galacturonic acid, glucose, galactose, xylose and arabinose in a molar ratio of 14.61:9.06:1.35:34.65:2.99:37.34. SY01-23 contained rhamnose, glucuronic acid, galacturonic acid, glucose, galactose, xylose and arabinose in a molar ratio of 23.00:4.12:24.60:5.74:17.28:1.12:24.13. Bioactivity test showed SY01-21 promoted the growth of Bacteroides cellulosilyticus (BC) while SY01-22 benefited the growth of Bacteroides ovatus (BO). Interestingly, SY01-23 boosted the growth of both BO and BC. However, Bacteroides thetaiotamicron (BT) only grew on 5 mg/mL SY01-21. Intriguingly, the growth of co-culture of BT with BO or BC was better than monoculture. This suggested that cross-feeding might exist between them. Besides, we found BO and BC generated acetate and propionate by utilizing SY01-23. The above results suggested that SY01-23 might modify human gut microbiota by driving colonization of Bacteroides in the gut to improve wellness.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroides ovatus 3aMorus alba 3aacetates 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aarabinose 3acoculture 3adigestive system 3agalactose 3agalacturonic acid 3aglucose 3aglucuronic acid 3ahumans 3aimmunostimulants 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aleaves 3amolecular weight 3amulberries 3apolysaccharides 3apropionic acid 3arhamnose 3axylose 0aMorus alba L. 0aPolysaccharide 0aHuman gut microbiota 0aCross-feeding 0aShort-chain fatty acids1 aShao, Saicong1 aGuo, Ciliang1 aZhang, Shihai1 aLi, Meixia1 aDing, Kan0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2020 Sept. 01, v. 158 p.698-707dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.05.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03443naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006400139245007300203300001600276500002000292520194600312592002802258596001402286596004902300650001202349650001202361650001902373650002002392650001502412650001302427650001102440650001402451650001502465650002202480650001202502650002202514651001802536651001802554700002102572700006302593700001602656700002202672700002202694700002402716773012702740856007302867852000902940655001202949IND60636446020221119171140.0190408e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063644602DNAL7 a10.1111/ddi.128672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBecker, Elizabeth A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8858-122X10aPredicting cetacean abundance and distribution in a changing climate  ap. 626-643.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: Changes in abundance and shifts in distribution as a result of a warming climate have been documented for many marine species, but opportunities to test our ability to forecast such changes have been limited. This study evaluates the ability of habitat‐based density models to accurately forecast cetacean abundance and distribution during a novel year with unprecedented warm ocean temperatures caused by a sustained marine heatwave. LOCATION: California Current Ecosystem, USA. METHODS: We constructed generalized additive models based on cetacean sighting and environmental data from 1991 to 2009 for eight species with a diverse range of habitat associations. Models were built with three different sets of predictor variables to compare performance. Models were then used to forecast species abundance and distribution patterns during 2014, a year with anomalously warm ocean temperatures. Cetacean sighting data collected during 2014 were used to assess model forecasts. RESULTS: Ratios of model‐predicted abundance to observed abundance were close to 1:1 for all but one species and accurately captured changes in the number of animals in the study area during the anomalous year. Predicted distribution patterns also showed good concordance with the 2014 survey observations. Our results indicate that habitat relationships were captured sufficiently to predict both changes in abundance and shifts in distribution when conditions warmed, for both cool‐ and warm‐temperate species. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Models built with multidecadal datasets were able to forecast abundance and distribution in a novel warm year for a diverse set of cetacean species. Models with the best explanatory power did not necessarily have the best predictive power. Also, they revealed species‐specific responses to warming ocean waters. Results have implications for modelling effects of climate change on cetaceans and other marine predators.  aPublisher supplied data  cU.S. Navy  cNOAA/NMFS/Southwest Fisheries Science Center 3aCetacea 3aanimals 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3aecosystems 3ahabitats 3amodels 3apredators 3aprediction 3aspecies abundance 3asurveys 3awater temperature 3aPacific Ocean 3aUnited States1 aForney, Karin A.1 aRedfern, Jessica V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4042-36681 aBarlow, Jay1 aJacox, Michael G.1 aRoberts, Jason J.1 aPalacios, Daniel M.0 tDiversity & distributions.g2019 Apr., v. 25, no. 4 p.626-643dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867071x1366-95167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ddi.128673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03634naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003300150245013000183500001400313520195600327592002802283650001802311650002602329650003002355650001102385650001102396650002302407650001402430650001102444650001902455650001602474650001302490650001802503650001502521650002202536650000902558650001702567650001302584650001602597650001002613650001402623650001502637650001202652650001102664650001402675650003702689653002102726653001802747653002202765700002002787700002602807700002402833773009302857856008502950852000903035655001203044IND60696722020221119023148.0201025e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069672202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rhisph.2020.1002082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJosé de Almeida, Durinézio10aGrowth of chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla L.) and production of essential oil stimulated by arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis  aNAL-light  aThis study aimed to evaluate the influence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi on the growth and production of capitula and essential oil of chamomile plants, under different growth conditions. The symbiosis between fungi of the phylum Glomeromycota and plant roots may cause changes in secondary metabolism, including the synthesis of essential oils. Increasing biomass production associated with gains in oil content promoted by mycorrhization, makes soil biota management sustainable. Two assays were carried out in a greenhouse, in plastic pots (3 L), for 150 days after emergence of the seedlings. In the first assay, plants were inoculated with soil cultivated with organic chamomile, in three levels (0, 150 and 300 g), with pH adjusted at 6.5, for evaluating the influence of the quantity of inoculum on the growth and production of plants. In the second assay (factorial design with repetition at the central point), three levels of soil pH (6.5, 7.0, 7.5) and three levels of auxin (0; 10; 20 mg L⁻¹) were tested to identify the influence of pH and auxin on the production of chamomile capitula and essential oil. The arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi present as spores in the soil-inoculum were composed of 22 species. In the first assay, mycorrhization favored the growth and production of capitula and such benefits tended to be higher with the increase in concentration of inoculum. In the second assay, the production of capitula and essential oil was promoted by mycorrhization, with the highest content at neutral pH (0.7 mL oil in 30 g of capitula), in synergy with the highest amount of inoculum. It was concluded that the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in the soil is the most influential variable in the production of capitula and essential oil of chamomile, but subtle differences on soil pH influenced these parameters. The levels of auxin did not influence significantly plant growth and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlomeromycota 3aMatricaria chamomilla 3aadministrative management 3aassays 3aauxins 3abiomass production 3achamomile 3adesign 3aessential oils 3agreenhouses 3ainoculum 3alipid content 3ametabolism 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aoils 3aplant growth 3aplastics 3arhizosphere 3aroots 3aseedlings 3asoil biota 3asoil pH 3aspores 3asynthesis 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 0aMedicinal plants 0aAMF diversity 0aMetabolic changes1 aAlberton, Odair1 aOtênio, Joice Karina1 aCarrenho, Rosilaine0 tRhizosphere.g2020 Sept., v. 15 p.100208-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23357x2452-21987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rhisph.2020.1002083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02691naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245014400166300002000310520149100330592002801821650001801849650001501867650001401882650002301896650001601919650000701935650001301942651001901955651002201974700003301996700003102029700002102060700001902081773012702100856008102227852000902308655001202317IND60535877420170606000000.0160805e20151006xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053587742DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.5b030332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFajar, Noelia
M.10aSpectrophotometric Measurements of the Carbonate Ion Concentration: Aragonite Saturation States in the Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic Ocean  ap. 11679-11687.  aMeasurements of ocean pH, alkalinity, and carbonate ion concentrations ([CO₃²–]) during three cruises in the Atlantic Ocean and one in the Mediterranean Sea were used to assess the reliability of the recent spectrophotometric [CO₃²–] methodology and to determine aragonite saturation states. Measurements of [CO₃²–] along the Atlantic Ocean showed high consistency with the [CO₃²–] values calculated from pH and alkalinity, with negligible biases (0.4 ± 3.4 μmol·kg–¹). In the warm, salty, high alkalinity and high pH Mediterranean waters, the spectrophotometric [CO₃²–] methodology underestimates the measured [CO₃²–] (4.0 ± 5.0 μmol·kg–¹), with anomalies positively correlated to salinity. These waters also exhibited high in situ [CO₃²–] compared to the expected aragonite saturation. The very high buffering capacity allows the Mediterranean Sea waters to remain over the saturation level of aragonite for long periods of time. Conversely, the relatively thick layer of undersaturated waters between 500 and 1000 m depths in the Tropical Atlantic is expected to progress to even more negative undersaturation values. Moreover, the northern North Atlantic presents [CO₃²–] slightly above the level of aragonite saturation, and the expected anthropogenic acidification could result in reductions of the aragonite saturation levels during future decades, acting as a stressor for the large population of cold-water-coral communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3aalkalinity 3aaragonite 3abuffering capacity 3acorrelation 3apH 3asalinity 3aAtlantic Ocean 3aMediterranean Sea1 aGarcía-Ibáñez, Maribel I.1 aSanLeón-Bartolomé, Henar1 aÁlvarez, Marta,1 aPérez, Fiz F.0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2015 Oct. 06, v. 49, no. 19 p.11679-11687dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.est.5b030333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02201naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003200133040001800165100002500183245009700208300001800305506007600323520090200399592002801301506003701329650001901366650001301385650001701398650001601415650002101431650001301452650002401465650002601489650001201515650001901527650001601546700002101562773012001583852000901703856007901712655001201791IND4462576120221207052933.0200426e20101101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446257612DNAL7 a210519342pmid7 aPMC31152452pmcid7 a10.4161/psb.5.11.132942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrasad, Madhulika E.10aFurther analysis of XBAT32, an Arabidopsis RING E3 ligase, involved in ethylene biosynthesis  ap. 1425-1429.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe Arabidopsis RING E3 ligase, XBAT32, was previously characterized as a regulator of lateral root initiation. However, how XBAT32 function to modulate lateral root initiation was unknown. In our recent paper, we demonstrated that XBAT32 is involved in ethylene biosynthesis and it is through this function that XBAT32 is able to regulate lateral root production. Here we discuss a few other findings, observed in the ethylene overproducing mutant, xbat32, that reflect the effect of elevated ethylene levels on plant growth and development. Ethylene signaling also regulates plant responses to adverse environmental conditions such as high salinity. Consistent with ethylene’s role as a stress hormone, xbat32 exhibited increased sensitivity to salt stress during seed germination and postgerminative growth. Thus, XBAT32 may also play a role in ethylene mediated response to abiotic stresses.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3asalt tolerance 3aethylene 3aplant growth 3aArabidopsis 3aseed germination 3asalinity 3aethylene production 3aenvironmental factors 3amutants 3aplant response 3asalt stress1 aStone, Sophia L.0 tPlant signaling & behavior.g2010 Nov. 1, v. 5, no. 11 p.1425-1429dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2184x1559-23247nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.4161/psb.5.11.132943Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03295naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245014900170300001400319520139200333592002801725650002201753650002101775650004401796650002601840650003701866650001201903650003001915650002501945650002801970650001301998650001302011650001802024650001902042650001902061650001902080650001902099650003202118650001902150650001802169650001402187650002002201650001202221650001602233653002102249653001302270653001802283653002702301653001802328700001902346700001802365700001702383700001302400700001202413700001902425700001202444773010602456856008602562852000902648655001202657IND60552997720221116194435.0161021e20140201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055299772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2013.09.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLei, Jieqiong10aPlasma treated polyethylene terephthalate/polypropylene films assembled with chitosan and various preservatives for antimicrobial food packaging  ap. 60-66.  aIn this study, polyethylene terephthalate/polypropylene (PET/PP) films were treated via atmospheric pressure plasma, assembled with chitosan and various preservatives and applied for antimicrobial food packaging. Surface properties of these obtained films were studied by contact angle measurement, atomic force microscopy (ATM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and dynamic laser scattering (DLS). The above results showed that the surface hydrophilicity and roughness of the films increased after the plasma treatment. Besides, chitosan and the preservatives were successfully assembled onto the surface of the films. In addition, the antimicrobial activities of the films against three kinds of microorganisms (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli) were investigated and the results indicated that the inhibition ratios against B. subtilis and E. coli reached almost 100% while the inhibition ratios against S. aureus were lower than 85%. Moreover, the accumulative release profiles of the antimicrobial substances migrating from the assembled films into the release solutions revealed that their release speed increased with the increment of temperature and acidity, but decreased with enhancing the ionic strength regulated by sodium chloride or with lowering the ionic mobility regulated by sucrose.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aEscherichia coli 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aacidity 3aanti-infective properties 3aatmospheric pressure 3aatomic force microscopy 3achitosan 3acolloids 3acontact angle 3afood packaging 3ahydrophilicity 3aionic strength 3amicroorganisms 3apolyethylene terephthalates 3apolypropylenes 3apreservatives 3aroughness 3asodium chloride 3asucrose 3atemperature 0aPlasma treatment 0aChitosan 0aPreservatives 0aAntimicrobial activity 0aRelease speed1 aYang, Lingxiao1 aZhan, Yingfei1 aWang, Yuntao1 aYe, Ting1 aLi, Yan1 aDeng, Hongbing1 aLi, Bin0 tColloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces.g2014 Feb. 01, v. 114 p.60-66dElsevier B.V.x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2013.09.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02958naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002200092024001900114024003200133040001800165100001900183245009400202300001800296506007600314520134200390592002801732506003701760650002501797650001401822650002501836650003401861650001401895650001401909650003901923650004801962650001802010650005002028650002002078650004302098650005802141650002502199650003602224700003202260773012002292852000902412856007902421655001202500IND4462576220221207052934.0200426e20101101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446257622DNAL7 aPMC31152462pmcid7 a210631692pmid7 a10.4161/psb.5.11.133122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlbert, Markus10aChimeric receptors of the Arabidopsis thaliana pattern recognition receptors EFR and FLS2  ap. 1430-1432.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFLS2 and EFR are pattern recognition receptors in Arabidopsis thaliana perceiving the bacterial proteins flagellin and Elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu). Both receptors belong to the >200 membered protein family of Leucine-Rich Repeat Receptor Kinases (LRR-RKs) in Arabidopsis. FLS2 and EFR are engaged in the activation of a common intracellular signal output and they belong to the same subfamily of LRR-RKs, sharing structural features like the intracellular kinase domain and the ectodomain organized in LRRs. On the amino acid sequence level, however, they are only &lt;50 % identical even in their kinase domains. In our recently published paper1 we demonstrated that it is possible to create chimeric receptors of EFR and FLS2 which are fully functional in ligand binding and receptor activation. Chimeric receptors consisting of the complete EFR ectodomain and the FLS2 kinase domain proved to be sensitive to elf18, the minimal peptide required for EF-Tu recognition, similar to the native EFR. In chimeric receptors where parts of the FLS2 ectodomain were swapped into the EFR LRR-domain, the receptor function was strongly affected even in cases with only small fragments exchanged. In this addendum we want to address problems and limits but also possibilities and chances of studying receptor functions using a chimeric approach.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3achimerism 3aamino acid sequences 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3areceptors 3aflagellin 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBinding Sites 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxphysiology 2aProtein Binding 2aProtein Kinasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReceptors, Pattern Recognitionxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRecombinant Proteins 2aSignal Transductionxphysiology1 aFeigenwinter, Felix,d1939-0 tPlant signaling & behavior.g2010 Nov. 1, v. 5, no. 11 p.1430-1432dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2184x1559-23247nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.4161/psb.5.11.133123Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03142naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024004200113040001800155100001600173245013300189300001600322506017300338520141900511592002801930650002401958650001101982650001801993650002202011650002202033650001002055650001202065650001302077650001002090650001502100650001302115650001002128650001602138700001602154700001802170700001502188700002002203700001702223773013402240856011202374856005502486956011002541852000902651655001202660IND4463077520221119070801.0180419e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446307752DNAL7 a10113/552092hdl7 a10.1111/j.1365-2672.2012.05250.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVarel, V.H.10aEffect of anaerobic digestion temperature on odour, coliforms and chlortetracycline in swine manure or monensin in cattle manure  ap. 705-715.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aAims: This study evaluated the effect of anaerobic digestion at 22, 38 and 55°C on odour, coliforms and chlortetracycline (CTC) in swine manure or monensin (MON) in cattle manure. Methods and Results: Swine or cattle were fed the respective growth promotant, manure was collected, and 2‐l laboratory methane digesters were established at the various temperatures and sampled over 25 or 28 days. After 21 days, the concentration of CTC in the 22, 38 and 55°C swine digester slurries decreased 7, 80 and 98%, respectively. Coliforms in the 22°C digester slurries were still viable after 25 days; however, they were not detectable in the 38 and 55°C slurries after 3 and 1 days, respectively. After 28 days, the concentration of MON in the 22, 38 and 55°C cattle digester slurries decreased 3, 8 and 27%, respectively. Coliforms in the 22°C cattle digester slurries were still viable after 28 days; however, they were not detectable in the 38 and 55°C slurries after 14 and 1 days, respectively. Conclusions: These studies indicate that anaerobic digestion at 38 or 55°C may be an effective treatment to reduce coliforms and CTC; however, it is not an effective treatment to reduce MON. Significance and Impact of the Study: More studies are needed to determine which pharmaceuticals are susceptible to degradation by a specific manure treatment to prevent negative environmental consequences.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digestion 3acattle 3acattle manure 3achlortetracycline 3acoliform bacteria 3adrugs 3amethane 3amonensin 3aodors 3apig manure 3aslurries 3aswine 3atemperature1 aWells, J.E.1 aShelver, W.L.1 aRice, C.P.1 aArmstrong, D.L.1 aParker, D.B.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2012 Apr., v. 112, no. 4 p.705-715dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl54923x1364-50727nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/552093Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.2012.05250.x  aARIS submissionbhttp://parking.nal.usda.gov/shortterm/113480_2012_J_Appl_Microbiol_112_705_715_Varel.pdf  aDNAL 7aarticle03165naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006000152245015600212300001400368500001500382520149700397592002801894650000901922650002601931650001701957650001601974650002201990650002402012650001902036650002102055650001302076650000902089650002602098650001802124650000902142653002502151653001502176653000902191653004002200653002002240653002102260653002002281700002302301700002202324700001902346700002002365700002002385700002002405773010202425856008702527852000902614655001202623IND60608100220221121231809.0180904e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060810022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2015.11.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFushimi, Akihiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7635-134710aChemical composition and source of fine and nanoparticles from recent direct injection gasoline passenger cars: Effects of fuel and ambient temperature  ap. 77-84.  a2019-12-06  aParticle number, mass, and chemical compositions (i.e., elemental carbon (EC), organic carbon (OC), elements, ions, and organic species) of fine particles emitted from four of the recent direct injection spark ignition (DISI) gasoline passenger cars and a port fuel injection (PFI) gasoline passenger car were measured under Japanese official transient mode (JC08 mode). Total carbon (TC = EC + OC) dominated the particulate mass (90% on average). EC dominated the TC for both hot and cold start conditions. The EC/TC ratios were 0.72 for PFI and 0.88–1.0 (average = 0.92) for DISI vehicles. A size-resolved chemical analysis of a DISI car revealed that the major organic components were the C20–C28 hydrocarbons for both the accumulation-mode particles and nanoparticles. Contribution of engine oil was estimated to be 10–30% for organics and the sum of the measured elements. The remaining major fraction likely originated from gasoline fuel. Therefore, it is suggested that soot (EC) also mainly originated from the gasoline. In experiments using four fuels at three ambient temperatures, the emission factors of particulate mass were consistently higher with regular gasoline than with premium gasoline. This result suggest that the high content of less-volatile compounds in fuel increase particulate emissions. These results suggest that focusing on reducing fuel-derived EC in the production process of new cars would effectively reduce particulate emission from DISI cars.  aPublisher supplied data 3aions 3aatmospheric chemistry 3ahydrocarbons 3aautomobiles 3achemical analysis 3aambient temperature 3aorganic carbon 3aemissions factor 3agasoline 3aoils 3aparticulate emissions 3ananoparticles 3asoot 0achemical composition 0aEngine oil 0aSoot 0aDirect injection spark ignition car 0aEmission factor 0aElemental carbon 0aOrganic species1 aKondō, Yoshinori,1 aKobayashi, Shinji1 aFujitani, Yuji1 aSaitoh, Katsumi1 aTakami, Akinori1 aTanabe, Kiyoshi0 tAtmospheric environment.g2016 Jan., v. 124 p.77-84dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2015.11.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02645naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245008100175300001400256520114800270592002801418650001501446650001401461650001301475650001301488650001001501650000901511650001101520650001801531650001801549650001301567650001901580653000801599653000901607653001101616653000801627653001101635653001001646653001401656653000701670653001301677653005201690653001201742653001501754653001401769653004601783700002301829700001701852700002101869773010601890856008601996852000902082655001202091IND60552997920221116194836.0161021e20140201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055299792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2013.09.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeland, Hilde-Gunn10aStudies on surface coating of phospholipid vesicles with a non-ionic polymer  ap. 45-52.  aLiposomes coated with polymers may have a great potential in drug delivery. In this study, adsorption of the non-ionic hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) onto non-charged phospholipid vesicles was investigated. Both unmodified and hydrophobically modified (HM) HEC were included in the study. Possible interactions between the liposomes and the polymers were determined by changes in the size and the size distribution. Rheo-SALS measurements were carried out to verify the successfulness of the coating process. The stability was investigated by zeta potential measurements, UV-analysis and HPTLC. Mixing unmodified HEC (Mw 90,000 and 300,000) with the liposomes yielded no increase in the particle size. HM-HEC, however, was adsorbed onto both the fluid phase egg-PC liposomes and the gel phase DPPC liposomes. The Rheo-SALS measurements confirmed the successful coating of the liposomes. Complete coating resulted in increased chemical stability of the dispersion and in addition prevented aggregation. This study has shown that the non-ionic HM-HEC can be used to form polymer coated liposomes with neutral surface charge for enhanced stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acellulose 3acoatings 3acolloids 3adrugs 3agels 3amixing 3aparticle size 3aphospholipids 3apolymers 3azeta potential 0aDLS 0aDPPC 0aEgg-PC 0aHEC 0aHM-HEC 0aHPTLC 0aRheo-SALS 0aTc 0aLiposome 0aHydrophobically modified hydroxyethyl cellulose 0aCoating 0aAggregates 0aStability 0aRheology and small angle light scattering1 aRøv-Johnsen, Anne1 aSmistad, Gro1 aHiorth, Marianne0 tColloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces.g2014 Feb. 01, v. 114 p.45-52dElsevier B.V.x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2013.09.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01897naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245006600167300001600233520071100249592002800960650001600988650002401004650002301028650002201051650001301073650004401086650002201130700002201152700001601174700001601190700002401206700002401230700005901254773011801313856008301431852000901514655001201523IND60627226020190311000000.0190128e20181219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062722602DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.8b036602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAroua, Safwan10aLarger Substituents on Amide Cavitands Induce Bigger Cavities  ap. 201-205.  aA series of quinoxaline cavitands bearing pendant amide groups with various substituent sizes (Et, ⁱPr, ᵗBu) were synthesized, and their cavity size/structure were investigated by X-ray and NMR analyses.

We investigated cross-linking by peroxidasin embedded in extracellular matrix isolated from cultured epithelial cells and its sensitivity to alternative substrates and peroxidase inhibitors. Peroxidasin showed peroxidase activity as measured with hydrogen peroxide and Amplex red. Using a specific mass spectrometry assay that measures NADH bromohydrin, we showed definitively that the enzyme releases hypobromous acid (HOBr). Less than 1 μM of the added hydrogen peroxide was used by peroxidasin. The remainder was consumed by catalase activity that was associated with the matrix. Results from NADH bromohydrin measurements indicates that low micromolar HOBr generated by peroxidasin was sufficient for maximum sulfilimine cross-linking, whereas 100 μM reagent HOBr or taurine bromamine was less efficient. This implies selectivity for the enzymatic process. Physiological concentrations of thiocyanate and urate partially inhibited cross-link formation. 4-Aminobenzoic acid hydrazide, a commonly used myeloperoxidase inhibitor, also inhibited peroxidasin, whereas acetaminophen and a 2-thioxanthine were much less effective. In conclusion, HOBr is produced by peroxidasin in the extracellular matrix. It appears to be directed at the site of collagen IV sulfilimine formation but the released HOBr may also undergo other reactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetaminophen 3abromides 3acatalase 3acollagen 3acrosslinking 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aepithelial cells 3aextracellular matrix 3ahydrazides 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydroxylysine 3amass spectrometry 3amethionine 3amyeloperoxidase 3aoxidation 3aperoxidase 3athiocyanates 0aPeroxidasin 0aHeme peroxidases 0aCollagen IV cross-linking 0aSulfilimine cross-link 0aHypobromous acid 0aDMEM 0aECM 0aNCD 0aPHG 0aTX11 aTurner, Rufus1 aPaumann-Page, Martina1 aKettle, Anthony J.1 aWinterbourn, Christine C.0 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g2018 May 15, v. 646 p.120-127dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11658x0003-98617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2018.03.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02510naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245009400173300001600267520104800283592002801331650001501359650000801374650002601382650002001408650002301428650002201451650001701473650003701490651001901527653003101546653002301577653002201600653002301622653003701645653003401682700001701716700005901733700001601792700002501808700001901833773010401852856008701956852000902043655001202052IND60608100320221121231720.0180904e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060810032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2015.11.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBozek, Frantisek10aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon adsorption on selected solid particulate matter fractions  ap. 128-135.  aThis article is directed to evaluating the proportion of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) captured on particulate matter (PM) classified as PM2.5–10 and PM2.5, i.e. particulate matter of aerodynamic diameter 2.5–10 μm and 2.5 μm. During three week-long and one 2-day campaigns, 22 paired air samples were taken in parallel of PM10 and PM2.5 fractions inside the Mrázovka tunnel in Prague, Czech Republic. Following sample preparation, concentrations of individual PAHs were determined using gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry. Concentrations of individual pairs of each PAH were tested by the nonparametric method using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. At significance level p < 0.01, it was demonstrated that all individual PAHs, including their totals, were bound to the PM2.5 fraction. Exceptions were seen in the cases of acenaphthylene, acenaphthene, and indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene, the concentrations of which fluctuated around the detection limit, where increased measurement error can be expected.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aair 3aatmospheric chemistry 3adetection limit 3agas chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3aparticulates 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3aCzech Republic 0aConcentration distribution 0aGas chromatography 0aMass spectrometry 0aParticulate matter 0aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 0aSpearman's statistical method1 aHuzlik, Jiri1 aPawelczyk, Adam1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5025-61221 aHoza, Ignac1 aNaplavova, Magdalena1 aJedlicka, Jiri0 tAtmospheric environment.g2016 Feb., v. 126 p.128-135dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2015.11.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03144naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005100094040001800145100001600163245006800179300001600247500000900263520176200272592002802034650001302062650000902075650001402084650001302098650001602111650002102127650001402148650001202162650001502174650001502189650002602204650001402230650001102244650001502255650002002270650001402290650001002304650001102314650002002325651001102345700001902356700001702375700001802392773012102410856009802531852000902629655001202638IND60665362120221123002338.0191122e199003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066536212DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1990.0011183X003000020008x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRood, S.

Heterosis for plant growth was substantial at 25/15 °C (day/night), as hybrid seedlings emerged more rapidly, were taller, had heavier shoots, and larger leaf areas than the parental inbreds. Gibberellic acid (GA3) at 0.1, 0.5, or 1.0 mg per plant was pipetted into the leaf whorls of 14-d-old seedlings. The exogenous GA₃ promoted ligule and total height in all genotypes, but the inbreds were maximally influenced. Consequently, potence ratios, representing the overall degree of dominance, were reduced from an average of 7.7 to 1.7 following GA₃ application, indicating decreased heterosis. In an experiment at 15 °C, imbibition of seeds in GA₃ accelerated germination and seedling growth, particularly shoot elongation of the parental inbreds. Endogenous concentrations of GA₁ and GA₁₉ were determined by gas-chromatography-selected ion monitoring using [²H]GAs as quantitive internal standards. Highly significant regressions of height, leaf area, relative growth rate, and height increment versus the log of GA concentration were observed. These results are consistent with the theory that GA are one factor involved in the regulation of heterosis of shoot growth in maize, a theory that suggests that a partial deficiency in endogenous GA in maize inbreds limits their growth, and is a contributing cause of inbreeding depression.

In this work, the coral-like TeO₂ microwires synthesized by two-step thermal treatment can be revealed as excellent aluminum-ion battery cathodes. It delivers a capacity of 214.2 mAh g–¹ and a relatively high-voltage plateau of ∼1.3 V at 200 mA g–¹ and remains at 88.5 mAh g–¹ over 100 cycles. Moreover, the reaction mechanism of TeO₂ is verified as the insertion of Al³⁺ ions during discharging. More importantly, based on the design of acetylene black-modified separator, the higher reversible capacity of 152.0 mAh g–¹ can be achieved over 150 cycles at 200 mA g–¹ with a high Coulombic efficiency of 98.4%. At a higher current density of 500 mA g–¹, the battery can reach a stable capacity of 91.1 mAh g–¹ over 700 cycles, displaying the superior long-term cycling stability, high capacity, and good rate capability. The results indicate that the coral-like TeO₂ microwires and acetylene black-modified separator can open up a new opportunity and be of great significance for further development of high-capacity and high-stability aluminum-ion batteries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylene 3aaluminum 3abatteries 3acathodes 3aheat treatment 3aions 3areaction mechanisms 0aTeO2 microwires 0aAluminum-ion batteries 0aReaction mechanism 0aModified separator 0aEnergy storage1 aWang, Mingyong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5246-163X1 aLuo, Yiwa1 aJiao, Shuqiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9600-752X0 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2020 Jan. 31, v. 8, no. 6 p.2416-2422dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b061933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02799naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005100094040001800145100002300163245014300186300001600329500000900345520150100354592002801855650001601883650001401899650001201913650002001925650002101945650001301966650001601979650001901995650001402014650002202028650000902050650001102059650001102070650001202081650001302093650001902106650001202125773012102137856009802258852000902356655001202365IND60665362320221123005927.0191122e198401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066536232DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1984.0011183X002400010041x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerridge, David F.10aEffects of Nitrate and Plant Development on the Abundance of Nitrogenous Solutes in Root-Bleeding and Vacuum-Extracted Exudates of Soybean  ap. 173-179.  aepub  aIn the experiments reported, the relative contents of ureides [(ureide-N/ureide-N + nitrate N + a-amino-N) × 100] ofxylary exudates and the relative symbiotic dependence of nodulated soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr. ‘Bragg’] were compared using glasshouse-grown plants supplied with various concentrations of nitrate ranging from zero to 8.0 raM. Xylary exudates were sampled from the plants by vacuum extraction of detached shoots or as root-bleeding exudate. Symbiotic dependence for each of the NO⁻₃ treatments was calculated on the basis of total-plant N and time-integrated rates of nitrogenase (C₂H₂ reduction) activities. Analyses of all samples of the two exudates for ureides, NO⁻₃ and α-NH₂-N and of samples from R2 plants of individual amino compounds revealed only minor differences between the two exudates in the composition of these compounds. Amino acids and amides contributed slightly more and ureides and NO⁻₃ slightly less to total N of vacuum-extracted exudate relative to root-bleeding exudate. The photosynthetic amino acids, alanine and serine, were more evident in stem exudate. Effects of NO⁻₃ supply and plant age on the relative contents of ureides were similar for both exudates. These data were combined with the data on the effects of NO⁻₃ supply on N₂(C₂H₂) fixation to describe standard curve relationships between the symbiotic dependence of the plants and the relative contents of ureides for each of eight phases of growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3aacetylene 3aalanine 3aamino compounds 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrates 3anitrogenase 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant age 3aplant development 3arams 3aserine 3ashoots 3asolutes 3asoybeans 3atotal nitrogen 3aureides0 tCrop science.g1984 Jan., v. 24, no. 1 p.173-179dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci1984.0011183X002400010041x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03189naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245009800154300001800252500002000270520189200290592002802182650001702210650002302227650001702250650002602267650001102293650001502304650002102319650004402340650000702384650002402391650001902415650003702434700002402471700001602495700005102511773013402562856007402696852000902770655001202779IND60610290220221118002455.0180827e20180815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061029022DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.290622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Yu12aA new design of cleavable acetal‐containing amphiphilic block copolymers triggered by light  ap. 1815-1824.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe report a new design of photolabile acetal‐containing amphiphilic block copolymers. Acetals as protecting groups for carbonyls or diols can be hydrolyzed under acidic condition but very stable with respect to hydrolysis at pH > 7. When combining light‐capturing chromophores with acetals, the hydrolysis of acetals can be activated by light to design dual responsive acetal‐containing polymers. Using acetalization reaction of 2,3‐dihydroxypropyl methacrylate with benzaldehyde derivatives, two new acetal‐containing photolyzable monomers have been designed. Comparable to commonly used photolabile monomers containing nitrobenzyl esters, the two acetal‐containing monomers are easy to polymerize using atom transfer radical polymerization with excellent molecular weight and dispersity control. We studied the cleavage kinetics and mechanism of acetal groups in both monomers and polyethylene oxide (PEO)‐containing amphiphilic block copolymers using ¹H NMR and UV–vis spectroscopy. o‐Nitrobenzaldehyde acetal showed a Norrish Type II rearrangement to form benzoic ester; while, 2,5‐dimethoxy benzaldehyde acetal was photolabile to completely release 2,3‐dihydroxypropyl methacrylate. The photocleavage of acetals is a zero‐order reaction in regardless of molecular states of acetals; while, the acid‐cleavage of acetals proves to be a first‐order kinetics and the cleavage becomes much slower for polymers. The self‐assembly of acetal‐containing amphiphilic block copolymers and the acid‐/light‐controlled dissociation of their vesicles have been investigated. We demonstrate that those acetal‐containing polymers are potentially useful as smart drug delivery systems where the release kinetics of payloads is tunable using light and pH as triggers. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The extracellular domain of CLV1 was previously shown to bind the CLE peptide derived from CLV3, providing direct evidence that CLV3-CLV1 function as a ligand-receptor pair. How the other putative receptors function in the CLV pathway, however, remained unclear. We demonstrated in a recent Plant Journal article that the receptor-like protein CLV2 and the receptor-kinases BAM1 and BAM2 also bind to the CLV3 CLE peptide ligand with an affinity similar to that of CLV1. Critically, these ligand binding receptors form two distinct complexes in both transient expression in tobacco and in Arabidopsis meristem cells: a CLV2/CRN multimer and a CLV1/BAM multimer. Here we examine in detail the subcellular membrane partitioning for the receptor proteins in transient expression by two-phase partitioning and co-expression with known subcellular markers. All tested proteins measurably accumulate at the plasma membrane. While CLV1 primarily co-localizes with a plasma membrane marker, CLV2 shows greater co-localization with an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3ahomeostasis 3aplasma membrane 3areceptors 3ashoot meristems 3astem cells 3atobacco 3atransmembrane proteins 2aArabidopsisxcytologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxphysiology 2aMembrane Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMultigene Family 2aProtein Transport 2aSignal Transduction1 aClark, Steven E.0 tPlant signaling & behavior.g2010 Nov. 1, v. 5, no. 11 p.1442-1445dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2184x1559-23247nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.4161/psb.5.11.133593Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02586naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245013600164300002000300520140300320592002801723650001301751650001201764650001201776650001101788650001501799650001701814650001201831650001101843650002201854650001101876651001101887651001801898700002001916700001501936700002001951773012701971856008102098852000902179655001202188IND60535877920221120145516.0160805e20151006xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053587792DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.5b030812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarrett, T. E.10aSource Contributions to Wintertime Elemental and Organic Carbon in the Western Arctic Based on Radiocarbon and Tracer Apportionment  ap. 11631-11639.  aTo quantify the contributions of fossil and biomass sources to the wintertime Arctic aerosol burden source apportionment is reported for elemental (EC) and organic carbon (OC) fractions of six PM₁₀ samples collected during a wintertime (2012–2013) campaign in Barrow, AK. Radiocarbon apportionment of EC indicates that fossil sources contribute an average of 68 ± 9% (0.01–0.07 μg m–³) in midwinter decreasing to 49 ± 6% (0.02 μg m–³) in late winter. The mean contribution of fossil sources to OC for the campaign was stable at 38 ± 8% (0.04–0.32 μg m–³). Samples were also analyzed for organic tracers, including levoglucosan, for use in a chemical mass balance (CMB) source apportionment model. The CMB model was able to apportion 24–53% and 99% of the OC and EC burdens, respectively, during the campaign, with fossil OC contributions ranging from 25 to 74% (0.02–0.09 μg m–³) and fossil EC contributions ranging from 73 to 94% (0.03–0.07 μg m–³). Back trajectories identified two major wintertime source regions to Barrow: the Russian and North American Arctic. Atmospheric lifetimes of levoglucosan, ranging from 50 to 320 h, revealed variability in wintertime atmospheric processing of this biomass burning tracer. This study allows for unambiguous apportionment of EC to fossil fuel and biomass combustion sources and intercomparison with CMB modeling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3abiomass 3aburning 3acarbon 3acombustion 3afossil fuels 3afossils 3amodels 3atracer techniques 3awinter 3aAlaska 3aArctic region1 aRobinson, E.

The ABA triblock copolymers served as models to study the influence of pendant hydrogen bonding on polymer physical properties and morphology. The triblock copolymers consisted of a soft central block of poly(di(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate) (polyDEGMEMA, 58 kg/mol) and hard copolymer external blocks of poly(2‐(3‐hexylureido)ethyl methacrylate‐co‐2‐(3‐phenylureido)ethyl methacrylate) (polyUrMA, 18‐116 kg/mol). Copolymerization of 2‐(3‐hexylureido)ethyl methacrylate (HUrMA) and 2‐(3‐phenylureido)ethyl methacrylate (PhUrMA) imparted tunable hard block Tg's from 69 to 134 °C. Tunable hard block Tg's afforded versatile thermomechanical properties for diverse applications. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) of the triblock copolymers exhibited high modulus plateau regions (∼100 MPa) over a wide temperature range (−10 to 90 °C), which was indicative of microphase separation. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) confirmed surface microphase separation with various morphologies. Variable temperature FTIR (VT‐FTIR) revealed the presence of both monodentate and bidentate hydrogen bonding, and pendant hydrogen bonding remained as an ordered structure to higher than expected temperatures. This study presents a fundamental understanding of the influence of hydrogen bonding on polymer physical properties and reveals the response of pendant urea hydrogen bonding as a function of temperature as compared to main chain polyureas. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This is particularly relevant for firefighters who are prone to extensive dermal exposure to smoke despite using personalized protective equipment. Reliable methods are needed for the analysis of sensitive yet specific biomarkers reflecting occupational smoke exposure, given various background sources. This review focuses on biomarkers used for measuring acute smoke exposure after fire suppression activities, such as biotransformed hydroxylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and their isomers in urine. Major challenges include developing optimal sampling approaches to capture transient smoke exposures, evaluating genetic and lifestyle contributions that modify risk assessment, as well as integrating clinically relevant biomarkers associated with oxidative stress, inflammation, and/or genotoxicity. Herein, we focus on robust biomarkers of recent smoke exposures and future perspectives aimed at implementing effective mitigation strategies for workplace protection of firefighters.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3adermal exposure 3aenvironmental monitoring 3afire suppression 3agenotoxicity 3ahuman health 3ahydroxylation 3ainflammation 3alifestyle 3aoxidative stress 3arisk assessment 3asafety equipment 3asmoke 3aurine 3aworking conditions 0aSmoke exposures 0aBiomonitoring 0aFirefighters 0aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 0aChromatography 0aMass spectrometry1 aBritz-McKibbin, Philip1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9296-32230 tCurrent opinion in environmental science & health.g2020 June, v. 15 p.57-65dElsevier B.V.wJournal:26761x2468-58447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.coesh.2020.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03421naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001300149245012700162300001600289500000900305520164500314592002801959650001901987650001502006650002902021650001802050650002102068650001102089650001202100650002502112650001302137650002002150650003102170650001802201650001002219650001302229650001302242650002802255650001802283650001802301650001902319650002002338650001302358650001902371650002402390650002602414650002002440650002202460650001902482700001502501700001702516700001902533700001502552700001602567773013102583856008402714852000902798655001202807IND60665362520221123005855.0191122e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066536252DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2014.03.01742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yu10aTranscriptome Profiling of hrf2 Transgenic Rapeseed Revealed Genes Related to the Defense Responses and Signaling Pathways  ap. 800-810.  aepub  aEctopic expression of the HarpinXₒₒc–encoding gene hrf2 in rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) confers enhanced resistance to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and improved agronomic performance. To better understand the molecular mechanisms of harpin-mediated plant responses, we developed a 3’–tag digital gene expression (DGE) method to compare the mRNA expression patterns of transgenic T-4 rapeseed harboring hrf2 and untransformed Yangyou 4 (Y4) at the global level. Solexa Illumina sequencing yielded 5,645,091 and 6,007,037 clean tags, corresponding to 14,237 and 14,773 genes for Y4 and T-4, respectively. We identified 2114 differentially expressed genes (DEGs; log2 ratio ≥ 1, false discovery rate [FDR] ≤ 0.001) between transgenic T-4 and untransformed Y4 that assigned to seven Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways and 19 Gene Ontology categories. Numerous genes related to defense responses were differentially expressed in T-4, representing categories such as hypersensitive response, defense proteins, plant cell wall components, and phenylpropanoid metabolism pathway. Furthermore, expression was largely modified in T-4 in signaling pathways including G protein, Ca2⁺, ubiquitination, protein kinase, salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, abscisic acid, ethylene, and auxin hormones. We also identified numerous DEGs encoding transcription factors in T-4. This analysis shows the breadth of molecular mechanisms of harpin-mediated plant responses in genetically transformed plants. Furthermore, the DGE sequence resources identified in this study provide a platform for functional genomics studies of rapeseed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica napus 3aG-proteins 3aSclerotinia sclerotiorum 3aabscisic acid 3aagronomic traits 3aauxins 3acalcium 3acell wall components 3aethylene 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agene ontology 3agenes 3agenomics 3ahormones 3ahypersensitive response 3ajasmonic acid 3amessenger RNA 3aplant response 3aprotein kinases 3arapeseed 3asalicylic acid 3asignal transduction 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptomics 3atransgenic plants 3aubiquitination1 aWu, Huijun1 aWei, Guifang1 aZhang, Hongyue1 aZhang, Yan1 aGao, Xuewen0 tCrop science.g2015 Mar., v. 55, no. 2 p.800-810dThe Crop Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2014.03.01743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03056naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005100146245014500197300001800342500001900360520127600379592002801655650002501683650002901708650002801737650001701765650002601782650002101808650001701829650002601846650001901872650001501891650001201906650003801918653003901956653003901995653002402034653002202058700001702080700001502097700001702112700001802129700001802147700001802165700006302183700005502246773014802301856008002449852000902529655001202538IND60701212320221120100203.0200708e20200612xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070121232DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.0c000622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Bin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9423-169110aDesign, Synthesis, and Evaluation of the Antifungal Activity of Novel Pyrazole–Thiazole Carboxamides as Succinate Dehydrogenase Inhibitors  ap. 7093-7102.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSuccinate dehydrogenase (SDH) is regarded as a promising target for fungicide discovery. To continue our ongoing studies on the discovery of novel SDH inhibitors as fungicides, novel pyrazole–thiazole carboxamides were designed, synthesized, and evaluated for their antifungal activity. The results indicated that compounds 9ac, 9bf, and 9cb showed excellent in vitro activities against Rhizoctonia cerealis with EC₅₀ values from 1.1 to 4.9 mg/L, superior to that of the commercial fungicide thifluzamide (EC₅₀ = 23.1 mg/L). Compound 9cd (EC₅₀ = 0.8 mg/L) was far more active than thifluzamide (EC₅₀ = 4.9 mg/L) against Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. Compound 9ac exhibited promising in vivo activity against Rhizoctonia solani (90% at 10 mg/L), which was better than that of thifluzamide (80% at 10 mg/L). The field experiment showed that compound 9ac had 74.4% efficacy against Rhizoctonia solani on the 15th day after two consecutive sprayings at an application rate of 4.80 g a.i./667 m², which was close to that of thifluzamide (83.3%). Furthermore, molecular docking explained the possible binding mode of compound 9ac in the RcSDH active site. Our studies indicated that the pyrazole–thiazole carboxamide hybrid is a new scaffold of SDH inhibitors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhizoctonia cerealis 3aSclerotinia sclerotiorum 3aThanatephorus cucumeris 3aactive sites 3aantifungal properties 3aapplication rate 3acarboxamides 3afield experimentation 3afood chemistry 3afungicides 3ahybrids 3asuccinate dehydrogenase (quinone) 0asuccinate dehydrogenase inhibitors 0astructure−activity relationships 0afungicidal activity 0amolecular docking1 aZhou, Shuang1 aCao, Lixin1 aHao, Zesheng1 aYang, Dongyan1 aGuo, Xiaofeng1 aZhang, Nailou1 aBakulev, Vasiliy A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3312-77831 aFan, Zhijin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5565-09490 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2020 June 12, v. 68, no. 27 p.7093-7102dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.0c000623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02403naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003100149245005900180300001400239500001900253520110600272592002801378650001201406650001501418650001701433650002001450650001801470650001101488650002001499650001501519650002201534650001201556653001501568653001501583653001601598653002501614700002501639700002201664700003001686700002001716773012801736856008401864852000901948655001201957IND60696722720221119023127.0200824e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069672272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.coesh.2020.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAristizabal-Henao, Juan J.10aLipidomics and environmental toxicology: Recent trends  ap. 26-31.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe versatility of lipidomic applications has been increasingly recognized in environmental toxicology in recent years. The unmatched diversity and ubiquitous nature of lipids makes them exceptional candidates in the discovery of sensitive biomarkers for various diseases in animals and humans. In this short review, we highlight recent studies (since 2017) that implement lipidomics as a tool to examine the effects of environmental stress (e.g., exposure) using in vitro and in vivo models. Specifically, this includes lipidomic examinations of exposure to organic pollutants, such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances and bisphenols, and heavy metals, such as arsenic and mercury, among others, in cell culture, animal and human studies. Innovative developments in analyte separation technologies, mass spectrometry instrumentation, and advanced data acquisition strategies will continue to drive new developments in systems biology. Thus, it is important to recognize the importance of adopting lipidomics into multiple -omic investigations in this burgeoning field (environmental lipidomics).  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic 3abiomarkers 3acell culture 3adata collection 3aecotoxicology 3ahumans 3ainstrumentation 3alipidomics 3amass spectrometry 3amercury 0aExposomics 0aPollutants 0aEnvironment 0aAnalytical chemistry1 aAhmadireskety, Atiye1 aGriffin, Emily K.1 aFerreira Da Silva, Bianca1 aBowden, John A.0 tCurrent opinion in environmental science & health.g2020 June, v. 15 p.26-31dElsevier B.V.wJournal:26761x2468-58447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.coesh.2020.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03290naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001700188245014400205300001500349506007600364520124000440592002801680506003701708650001601745650002601761650002701787650001901814650001101833650001201844650001101856650001101867650001701878650001201895650003001907650001101937650002301948650001501971650002001986650001402006653001702020653002202037653001802059653001602077653000802093653000802101653000702109653000702116653000702123653000702130653000702137653000702144653000802151653000802159700002602167700001602193700001702209700001802226700002202244700002202266700001902288700001502307700002002322773012302342856008202465852000902547655001202556IND60593277120221207110933.0190129e20180601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059327712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.abb.2018.04.0062doi7 aPMC69193262pmcid7 a296530792pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWillis, W.T.10aDominant and sensitive control of oxidative flux by the ATP-ADP carrier in human skeletal muscle mitochondria: Effect of lysine acetylation  ap. 93-103.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) of the mitochondrial inner membrane exchanges ADP for ATP. Mitochondria were isolated from human vastus lateralis muscle (n = 9). Carboxyatractyloside titration of O2 consumption rate (Jo) at clamped [ADP] of 21 μM gave ANT abundance of 0.97 ± 0.14 nmol ANT/mg and a flux control coefficient of 82% ± 6%. Flux control fell to 1% ± 1% at saturating (2 mM) [ADP]. The KmADP for Jo was 32.4 ± 1.8 μM. In terms of the free (−3) ADP anion this KmADP was 12.0 ± 0.7 μM. A novel luciferase-based assay for ATP production gave KmADP of 13.1 ± 1.9 μM in the absence of ATP competition. The free anion KmADP in this case was 2.0 ± 0.3 μM. Targeted proteomic analyses showed significant acetylation of ANT Lysine23 and that ANT1 was the most abundant isoform. Acetylation of Lysine23 correlated positively with KmADP, r = 0.74, P = 0.022. The findings underscore the central role played by ANT in the control of oxidative phosphorylation, particularly at the energy phosphate levels associated with low ATP demand. As predicted by molecular dynamic modeling, ANT Lysine23 acetylation decreased the apparent affinity of ADP for ANT binding.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacetylation 3aadenosine diphosphate 3aadenosine triphosphate 3adynamic models 3aenergy 3aenzymes 3ahumans 3alysine 3amitochondria 3amuscles 3aoxidative phosphorylation 3aoxygen 3aoxygen consumption 3aphosphates 3askeletal muscle 3atitration 0aFlux control 0aEnergy metabolism 0aBioenergetics 0aAcetylation 0aANT 0aCAT 0aCK 0aCr 0aJo 0aJp 0aMM 0anH 0aNET 0aPCr1 aMiranda-Grandjean, D.1 aHudgens, J.1 aWillis, E.A.1 aFinlayson, J.1 aDe Filippis, E.A.1 aZapata Bustos, R.1 aLanglais, P.R.1 aMielke, C.1 aMandarino, L.J.0 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g2018 June 01, v. 647 p.93-103dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11658x0003-98617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2018.04.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02576naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245016300160300001800323500002000341520131600361592002801677650002801705650002301733650002701756650002601783650001501809650003301824650001601857650001901873700002001892700002201912700006301934773013401997856007402131852000902205655001202214IND60610290520221118002406.0180827e20180815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061029052DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.290652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiyane, Satoshi10aSynthesis of block copolymers comprised of poly(3‐hexylthiophene) segment with trisiloxane side chains and their application to organic thin film transistor  ap. 1787-1794.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe demand of stretchability for a semiconducting polymer has increased to realize wearable devices and sensors. However, studies involving intrinsically stretchable π‐conjugated polymers are still limited. Here, we develop a soft‐polythiophene derivative, P3SiHT, with a trisiloxane unit in the side chains via a hexylene spacer unit. In addition, diblock (P3HT‐b‐P3SiHT) and triblock (P3HT‐b‐P3SiHT‐b‐P3HT) copolymers could be synthesized based on Kumada catalyst‐transfer polycondensation. The results of atomic force microscopy and grazing incidence small‐angle X‐ray scattering indicate that the block copolymer thin films form a phase‐separated structure between the P3HT and P3SiHT domains. The organic thin film transistor devices were prepared to assess the electrical properties of the block polymers. As a result, the block copolymers showed comparable or even higher hole mobility than that of P3HT homopolymer, thus due to the enhanced phase‐separation and thereby charge transportation. The mechanical test of the bulk films indicates that P3HT‐b‐P3SiHT‐b‐P3HT shows lower tensile modulus and longer elongation at break than P3HT homopolymer and other diblock copolymers. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

An assay approach that measures proteins could be more technologically feasible than chromatography, thus enabling more frequent carotenoid status assessment. We explored associations between proteomic biomarkers and concentrations of 6 common dietary carotenoids (α-carotene, β-carotene, lutein/zeaxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin, and lycopene) in plasma from 500 6–8 year old Nepalese children. Samples were depleted of 6 high-abundance proteins. Plasma proteins were quantified using tandem mass spectrometry and expressed as relative abundance. Linear mixed effects models were used to determine the carotenoid:protein associations, accepting a false discovery rate of q < 0.10. We quantified 982 plasma proteins in >10% of all child samples. Among these, relative abundance of 4 were associated with β-carotene, 11 with lutein/zeaxanthin and 51 with β-cryptoxanthin. Carotenoid-associated proteins are notably involved in lipid and vitamin A transport, antioxidant function and anti-inflammatory processes. No protein biomarkers met criteria for association with α-carotene or lycopene. Plasma proteomics may offer an approach to assess functional biomarkers of carotenoid status, intake and biological function for public health application.Original maternal micronutrient trial from which data were derived as a follow-up activity was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00115271.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalpha-carotene 3aanti-inflammatory agents 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abeta-carotene 3abeta-cryptoxanthin 3abiomarkers 3ablood proteins 3achromatography 3afruit consumption 3alipids 3alutein 3alycopene 3amodels 3anutrition assessment 3aproteomics 3aschool children 3atandem mass spectrometry 3avegetables 3avitamin A 3azeaxanthin 3aNepal 0aProteomics 0aPlasma proteins 0aβ-cryptoxanthin 0aAntioxidants 0aCarotenoids 0aNepal1 aSchulze, Kerry J.1 aYager, James1 aCole, Robert N.1 aChristian, Parul1 aNonyane, Bareng A.S.1 aLee, Sun Eun1 aWu, Lee S.F.1 aKhatry, Subarna1 aGroopman, John1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4690-21331 aWest, Keith P.0 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g2018 May 15, v. 646 p.153-160dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11658x0003-98617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2018.03.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03981naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002600155245010100181300001600282500001500298520205900313592002802372650001202400650002002412650003002432650001402462650002502476650001402501650001802515650002102533650001102554650001202565650002302577650002102600650002902621650002402650650002002674650002102694650001602715650001502731650001402746650001602760650000902776650001202785650002302797650001002820653001902830653001602849653002402865653001102889653001902900653002302919653003802942700002902980700002503009700001703034700002003051700001803071700002003089773009903109856009003208852000903298655001203307IND60532376720221116193331.0190318e20150701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053237672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2015.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStiller, Kevin Torben14aThe effect of carbon dioxide on growth and metabolism in juvenile turbot Scophthalmus maximus L.  ap. 143-150.  a2019-12-06  aLand-based aquaculture is an increasingly important method of fish production, and fish grown in such systems may be exposed to substantially higher carbon dioxide concentrations than fish in the wild. Chronic exposure to elevated CO2 levels in recirculated aquaculture systems can correlate with lower growth and condition indices for many fish species, however, the physiological basis behind this loss of performance is largely unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the growth, condition and protein catabolism rates of juvenile turbot (55–176g) reared for 8weeks at three different dissolved carbon dioxide concentrations: 5, 26, and 42mgl−1 (~3000, 15000, 25000μatm; pH7.37, 6.66, 6.44). A commercial diet was administered once per day until satiation, and uneaten food was collected from a solids collector. Oxygen consumption and ammonia excretion were measured weekly using high precision automated methods in a recirculating aquaculture respirometer system. Increased CO2 levels were associated with reduced condition factor, feed intake and weight gain. Compared to the low CO2 treatment, the specific growth rates under the medium and high treatments were reduced by 21% and 58%, respectively. Feed conversion ratios were similar between treatments. The oxygen consumption rates broadly followed a dose–response pattern, where fish in the low CO2 treatment exhibited the highest respiration rates. Comparison of ammonia quotients over time and at comparable feed intake showed the rates of protein catabolism correlated with CO2 exposure levels. By the end of the 8week trial fish from the high CO2 treatment exhibited up to 3 times the protein catabolism rates observed in the low treatment, and the medium treatment was approximately intermediate between the two. The conclusion from the study was that the loss of growth and condition of turbot reared at elevated CO2 concentrations (relevant to land-based aquaculture systems) can be traced to decreased feed intake and an increased reliance on protein as a fuel source.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3afish production 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3awild fish 3aScophthalmus maximus 3ajuveniles 3adose response 3arespiratory rate 3aturbot 3asatiety 3aprotein metabolism 3achronic exposure 3adissolved carbon dioxide 3aaquaculture systems 3afeed conversion 3acondition factor 3afeed intake 3afood waste 3aexcretion 3aweight gain 3adiet 3arearing 3aoxygen consumption 3afuels 0aCarbon dioxide 0aFish growth 0aChronic hypercapnia 0aTurbot 0acarbon dioxide 0aProtein metabolism 0aRecirculating respirometer system1 aVanselow, Klaus Heinrich1 aMoran, D.q(Damian),1 aBojens, Gero1 aVoigt, Wolfgang1 aMeyer, Stefan1 aSchulz, Carsten0 tAquaculture.g2015 July 01, v. 444 p.143-150dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2015.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01522naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245009500159300001600254500001400270520041000284592002800694650002100722650002600743650001800769650002500787650001800812650001000830650002100840653001700861653001200878653001700890773018200907856007401089852000901163655001201172IND60691872120221118044521.0200502e20000101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069187212DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.64.4282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMOMMA, Mitsuru10aCloning and Sequencing of the Maltohexaose-producing Amylase Gene of Klebsiella pneumoniae  ap. 428-431.  aNAL-light  aThe molecular characterization of the maltohexaose-producing amylase gene of Klebsiella pneumoniae revealed an open reading frame in which 2,031 base pairs encode a protein of 677 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 75,921.

It employs a novel multivariate approach for the histomorphometric analysis of biopsy samples and directly compares the prognostic value of such a quantitative approach against that of a semi-quantitative visual scoring system.This study provides evidence that most of the quantitative indices selected, perform equally well when compared to analogous semi-quantitative descriptive parameters normally used to assess soya bean-induced enteritis seen in Atlantic salmon. The high reproducibility and accuracy of this approach indicate that image analysis can provide a useful and reliable method for the quantification of SB-induced enteritis and by extension, for other facets of gut plasticity/histopathology. Other characteristics of this approach, such as rapidity, simplicity and adaptability similarly favour the use of image analysis, and are particularly useful where less experienced interpreters are performing the analysis. The quantitative assessment system outlined here, clearly identifies soya bean-associated enteropathy in experimental fish, and may thus be recommended for evaluation of related variations in salmon intestinal histomorphology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmo salar 3abiopsy 3adigestive system 3aenteritis 3ahistopathology 3aimage analysis 3asalmon 3asoybeans 0aQuantitative histology 0aImage analysis 0aEnteritis 0aSalmo salar 0aAquaculture1 aMcGurk, Charles1 aKnudsen, David L.1 aAdams, Sandraq(Alexandra),1 aThompson, Kim D.1 aBron, James E.0 tAquaculture.g2015 Aug. 01, v. 445 p.42-56dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2015.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03088naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005800145245015300203300001600356500002000372520176700392592002802159596003202187596006402219650001102283650000902294650001502303650001502318650002002333650001302353650002202366650001302388651001402401651001602415700002102431700001702452773013302469856007902602852000902681655001202690IND60636447020221119171453.0190408e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063644702DNAL7 a10.1111/1747-0080.124432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLambert, Kelly1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5935-732810aQualitative exploration of the experiences of renal dietitians and how they help patients with end stage kidney disease to understand the renal diet  ap. 126-134.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: Dietary modification is integral to the management of end stage kidney disease. However, adherence to the renal diet is poor. Few studies have explored the perspectives of renal dietitians and how they work with patients to facilitate dietary change. The objectives of this study were to explore the experiences of renal dietitians about educating patients with end stage kidney disease; and to describe the strategies perceived to help patients understand the renal diet. METHODS: Semi‐structured interviews based on Sensemaking theory were conducted with renal dietitians (n = 27) working in Australia and New Zealand from a range of metropolitan, regional and remote areas. RESULTS: Five major themes across two categories were derived from the data. The renal dietitians in this study experienced feelings of frustration, frequently worked in practice environments with limited or inadequate resources and perceived that establishing trust and demonstrating empathy were important to sense making. Renal dietitians helped patients make sense of and understand the diet by clarifying ambiguities and conflicting information; and simplifying complexity by using simple explanations, individualised advice and practical support. These strategies were considered critical to the renal diet sense making process. CONCLUSIONS: The experience of providing renal diet advice to adults with end stage kidney disease was emotionally and professionally challenging. Alternative approaches to patient education may help dietitians to empower patients to better understand the renal diet. Further research exploring the experiences of learning about the renal diet from the patient and carer perspective would also help to inform future alternative approaches.  aPublisher supplied data  cKing and Amy O'Malley Trust  cAustralian Government Research Training Program Scholarship 3aadults 3adiet 3adietitians 3ainterviews 3akidney diseases 3alearning 3apatient education 3apatients 3aAustralia 3aNew Zealand1 aMansfield, Kylie1 aMullan, Judy0 tNutrition & dietetics.g2019 Apr., v. 76, no. 2 p.126-134dJohn Wiley & Sons Australia, LtdwJournal:jnl3613350x1446-63687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1747-0080.124433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02474naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005100094040001800145100001900163245004100182300001600223500000900239520131100248592002801559650002201587650002101609650002601630650002201656650001301678650002601691650001301717650001701730650002201747650002701769650001301796650001401809650001001823700001601833773012001849856009801969852000902067655001202076IND60665363020221123005740.0191122e196803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066536302DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1968.0011183X000800020027x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLebsock, K.

Thell, grown for resistance to sawfly have been less productive than hollow-stemmed varieties. Parent, F₁, F₂, F₃, and F₄ populations from two wheat crosses, P.I. 56219-12 × ‘Conley’ and Conley × ‘Rescue’, were evaluated in replicated field trials to determine if stem-solidness was associated with agronomic and quality traits and with reactions to black chaff and stem rust infections. Variation in stem-solidness was independent of variation in almost all other traits in both crosses. Statistically significant negative associations occurred, but they were weak and generally would be of little consequence in a breeding scheme. Rescue (solid-stemmed) was a poorer combiner for yielding ability than P.I. 56219-12 (solid-stemmed) when crossed with Conley (hollow-stemmed). Rescue has been the major source of stem-solidness in breeding programs, and usually it has been crossed with locally adapted, high-quality varieties. Heritability values for stem-solidness ranged from 60% to 95%. Indirect selection for sawfly-resistance using solidness as an indicator should be effective in any environment where solidness is expressed. Heritability values, and phenotyplc correlation coefficients for traits other than solidness are presented.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aagronomic traits 3abacterial leaf streak 3abreeding programs 3acrossing 3afield experimentation 3afirmness 3aheritability 3ainsect resistance 3aplant-insect relations 3asawflies 3astem rust 3awheat1 aKoch, E.

However, the digestibility of prey items is also crucial as it directly affects the accessibility of the nutrients inside the prey item. Harpacticoid copepods, as well as nematodes, are considered as potential live feed for fish larvae but their digestibility has not yet been identified. Therefore, a comparative in-vitro evaluation of the digestibility of several prey organisms for larval fish was conducted under specific consideration of the efficiency of the proteolytic enzyme trypsin. This endoprotease plays a major role in the digestion process in the early stages of marine species. Common (Artemia sp., Brachionus plicatilis) and candidate prey organisms for commercial larval rearing (Acartia tonsa (Calanoida), Tachidius discipes, Tisbe sp. (both Harpacticoida), Panagrolaimus sp. (Nematoda)) were exposed to a trypsin solution. Photos of trypsin-treated prey organisms were taken and compared with controls to quantify the effect of trypsin on the inner body disintegration. Additionally, the effects of the larval ring muscles in the gut and the pharyngeal teeth were imitated by mechanical treatment. While Artemia sp. showed the highest digestibility, Panagrolaimus sp. was the opposite with very low degradation. The calanoid copepod A. tonsa and the harpacticoid copepod Tisbe sp. were more digestible than T. discipes and the nematode Panagrolaimus sp.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcartia tonsa 3aArtemia 3aBrachionus plicatilis 3aPanagrolaimus 3aTisbe 3adigestibility 3adigestion 3afish culture 3afish feeds 3afish larvae 3alive feeds 3amuscles 3anutrients 3anutritive value 3apharynx 3aproteolysis 3arearing 3ateeth 3atrypsin 0aTrypsin 0aDigestibility 0aHarpacticoid copepods 0aNematode 0aBrachionus 0aArtemia1 aSommer, Ulrich1 aUeberschär, Bernd0 tAquaculture.g2015 Sept. 01, v. 446 p.12-16dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2015.03.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03422naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006600140245015800206300001800364500002000382520212900402592002802531650003502559650002702594650001102621650001402632650002702646650001702673650002702690650002302717650002402740650001102764700002002775700002302795773014602818856007502964852000903039655001203048IND60786370720221123002044.0220803e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078637072DNAL7 a10.1002/tafs.102012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl‐Chokhachy, Robert1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2136-509810aNew Insights into the Ecology of Adfluvial Bull Trout and the Population Response to the Endangered Species Act in the North Fork Lewis River, Washington  ap. 1102-1116.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aLike many other salmonids, Bull Trout Salvelinus confluentus migratory life history expressions are becoming increasingly rare. A critical step in effectively refining management and conservation strategies is a robust assessment of the effectiveness of such strategies and key biological information used in monitoring and recovery planning. To address this need, we integrated long‐term monitoring data to evaluate how the demographics (abundance) and vital rates (survival) of a Bull Trout population shifted in response to their listing under the Endangered Species Act (1998). In addition, we employed mark–recapture data to investigate Bull Trout population dynamics and assessed the life history characteristics (aging, growth, spawning migrations, and iteroparity) to improve our understanding of Bull Trout ecology and diversity. Our abundance and survival data, which extends to the early 1990s, illustrated positive responses in survival and abundance following the protection of Bull Trout under the Endangered Species Act. Over this period, we found high interannual variability in both survival and abundance, and adult survival (average = 0.45; SE = 0.04) was surprisingly lower than that of subadult individuals (average = 0.66; SE = 0.04), suggesting limitations at this important life stage. Our mark–recapture data also suggested that the attributes driving the Bull Trout population trend (i.e., recruitment to the adult stage or adult survival) has varied through time, with declining trends in the relative contribution of recruitment. Bull Trout spawning migrations varied with body size, and a considerable portion of smaller adults (<650 mm) did not spawn each year. Additionally, most spawning individuals made only one spawning migration, while <13% made three or more spawning migrations. Our results provide important insights into the effectiveness of the Endangered Species Act listing and new information regarding the life history patterns of adfluvial Bull Trout and can serve as a template to consider factors potentially limiting this and other native salmonid populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEndangered Species Act of 1973 3aSalvelinus confluentus 3aadults 3abody size 3ademographic statistics 3alife history 3amark-recapture studies 3amigratory behavior 3apopulation dynamics 3arivers1 aDoyle, Jeremiah1 aLamperth, James S.0 tTransactions of the American Fisheries Society.g2019 Nov., v. 148, no. 6 p.1102-1116dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:19703x0002-84877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tafs.102013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02973naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005500151245014500206300001800351520112900369592002801498650002001526650002301546650002701569650001401596650001101610650001901621650002201640650000901662650001101671650002901682650001601711650002001727650001701747650001501764650002101779650002201800650001501822650003001837650002501867650001801892650003701910653002901947653000801976653002301984653001802007653002402025700001702049700001802066700005702084700001702141773014302158856008502301852000902386655001202395IND60684297920221121135334.0200217e20200127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068429792DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b067482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Run,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1104-671X10aHydrogen Sulfide Improves Lipid Accumulation in Nannochloropsis oceanica through Metabolic Regulation of Carbon Allocation and Energy Supply  ap. 2481-2489.  aTo utilize CO₂ in syngas from coal gasification with H₂S impurity for microalgal biodiesel production, metabolic regulation stimulated by NaHS (an H₂S donor) of carbon allocation and energy supply in Nannochloropsis oceanica were investigated to improve lipid accumulation.

Additionally, H₂S transformed the main ATP synthesis pathway from oxidative phosphorylation to photophosphorylation and substrate phosphorylation, facilitating efficient energy supply during lipid accumulation. Raman spectra and transmission electron microscopy showed that the peak rate of lipid accumulation increased by 60.2–62.2% in N. oceanica cells exposed to 0.5 mM NaHS. This markedly increased the yields of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) and short-chain FAMEs (C12:0 and C14:0) from N. oceanica cells by 77.0 and 144.4%, respectively, and decreased the unsaturated lipid composition in total FAMEs by 44.8%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNannochloropsis 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aadenosine triphosphate 3abiodiesel 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon metabolism 3acoal 3aenergy 3afatty acid methyl esters 3afatty acids 3afuel production 3agasification 3aglycolysis 3ahydrogen sulfide 3alipid composition 3amicroalgae 3aoxidative phosphorylation 3aphotophosphorylation 3asynthesis gas 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aNannochloropsis oceanica 0aH2S 0alipid accumulation 0aenergy supply 0aunsaturation degree1 aWang, Zhenyi1 aLu, Hongxiang1 aYang, Weijuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4820-73021 aFan, Zhentao0 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2020 Jan. 27, v. 8, no. 6 p.2481-2489dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b067483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02799naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245010900176300001600285520147900301592002801780650001601808650001201824650002201836650001901858650000901877650001101886650001701897653001801914653002101932653002901953653002301982653002302005700002402028700002402052700002402076700002302100700002302123773013502146856008702281852000902368655001202377IND60743690420221121065622.0210926e20210801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074369042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.06.1292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOyeyinka, Samson A.10aInfrared heating under optimized conditions enhanced the pasting and swelling behaviour of cowpea starch  ap. 678-688.  aNative starches are not suitable for industrial use and must be modified for improved functionality. In this study, the effect of moisture preconditioning and infrared heating time on physicochemical properties of cowpea starch was investigated using a two-factor central composite rotatable design. Factors (moisture levels:10–40 g/100 g starch and infrared heating time:10–60 min) with their corresponding α mid-point values resulted in 13 experimental runs. Selected functional and pasting properties were determined as response variables. Starch samples produced under optimized conditions were compared with corn starch and their physicochemical properties determined. Except for pasting temperature, cowpea starch prepared using the optimal conditions (moisture: 46.21 g/100 g starch, dry basis and heating time of 32.88 min) had higher functional and pasting properties compared with the native cowpea starch. Infrared heating significantly reduced the gelatinization temperatures of cowpea starch but did not significantly change that of the corn starch. The crystallinity and double-helical order structure of moisture conditioned cowpea starch also reduced after modification. Cowpea starch showed a bigger granule size, higher swelling power but lower water absorption capacities and pasting properties compared with the control. The infrared heating process is a novel and promising modification method for improving the swelling properties of starch.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorn starch 3acowpeas 3acrystal structure 3agelatinization 3aheat 3astarch 3awater uptake 0aCowpea starch 0aInfrared heating 0aMoisture preconditioning 0aThermal properties 0aPasting properties1 aOyedeji, Ajibola B.1 aOgundele, Opeolu M.1 aAdebo, Oluwafemi A.1 aNjobeh, Patrick B.1 aKayitesi, Eugénie0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2021 Aug. 01, v. 184 p.678-688dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.06.1293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02754naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245011300177300001600290520136100306592002801667650002301695650002801718650001201746650003201758650002201790650001001812650001701822650000801839650000901847650001901856650001401875650001001889651001201899653002001911653002201931653002101953653001601974700001801990700002002008700002202028700001902050773012102069856008502190852000902275655001202284IND60548913320221119183109.0160905e20160702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054891332DNAL7 a10.1080/21551197.2016.12091462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpringstroh, Kelly A.10aEvaluation of Handgrip Strength and Nutritional Risk of Congregate Nutrition Program Participants in Florida  ap. 193-208.  aThe aim of this study was to determine if handgrip strength (HGS) is a predictor of nutritional risk in community-dwelling older adults. A cross-sectional study was carried out to determine the relationship between HGS and nutritional risk using SCREEN 1. The setting was Congregate Nutrition program meal sites (n = 10) in North Central Florida and included community-dwelling older adults participating in the Congregate Nutrition program. Older adults (n = 136; 77.1 ± 8.9 y; 45 M, 91 F) participated in the study. Nutritional risk was identified in 68% of participants, with 10% exhibiting clinically relevant weakness (men, HGS < 26 kg; women, HGS < 16 kg), suggesting a vulnerable population. HGS was weakly associated with nutritional risk as assessed by SCREEN 1 (AUC = 0.59), but alternate cutpoints, 33 kg for men (mean of both hands) and 22 kg for women (highest of either hand), provided the best comparison to nutritional risk. In community-dwelling older adults, HGS was weakly associated with nutritional risk assessed using traditional screening. However, as existing research supports the inclusion of HGS in malnutrition screening in acute care, further research into the usefulness of HGS and possibly other measures of functional status in nutrition risk screening of community-dwelling older adults may be warranted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aat-risk population 3across-sectional studies 3aelderly 3afood and nutrition programs 3afunctional status 3ahands 3amalnutrition 3amen 3arisk 3arisk screening 3ascreening 3awomen 3aFlorida 0aCongregate meal 0ahandgrip strength 0anutritional risk 0aolder adult1 aGal, Nancy J.1 aFord, Amanda L.1 aWhiting, Susan J.1 aDahl, Wendy J.0 tJournal of nutrition in gerontology and geriatrics.g2016 July 2, v. 35, no. 3 p.193-208dRoutledgex2155-12007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21551197.2016.12091463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02790naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006100150245013200211300001600343520139300359592002801752650001501780650001901795650001801814650002001832650002101852650001801873650001601891650001401907650001501921650002101936653001701957653001301974653001801987653002102005653001602026653001802042700006402060700002002124700002302144773008402167856008402251852000902335655001202344IND60568548320221120082928.0170709e20170915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056854832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2017.05.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantoro, Domenico1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9561-489410aDetailed modeling of oxalic acid degradation by UV-TiO2 nanoparticles: Importance of light scattering and photoreactor scale-up  ap. 361-373.  aA detailed computational fluid dynamics model is presented that integrates reactor hydrodynamics with advanced light models and UV-TiO2 advanced oxidation kinetics to yield the degradation of oxalic acid in a dispersed-phase photoreactor. Model predictions were first compared against experimental data obtained from the literature and subsequently used in a parametric study for investigating scale-up effects associated with both process and photoreactor variables. Investigated variables included: TiO2 concentration (5–400 mg L−1), initial oxalic acid concentration (0.9–32 mg L−1), lamp irradiance (100–10,000 W m−2), background fluid absorbance (0-30 m−1), reactor size (1/4-4 as relative scaling factor), lamp orientation (0-360°) and flowrate (2.5–10 m3 h−1). The analysis revealed that an optimum in oxalic acid degradation is observed when the TiO2 concentration was controlled in the 20–40 mg L−1 range (depending on lamp irradiance). While lamp orientation showed minimal impact, reactor size and flowrate emerged as key variables for photoreactor design. Moreover, an increase in initial oxalic acid concentration substantially reduced oxalic acid degradation performance observed at high loadings. Also, TiO2 activation and photoreactor degradation performance were impacted negatively by light competition with background fluid absorbance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3adynamic models 3ahydrodynamics 3alight intensity 3alight scattering 3ananoparticles 3aoxalic acid 3aoxidation 3aprediction 3atitanium dioxide 0aCFD modeling 0aUV- TiO2 0aScale effects 0aLight scattering 0aOxalic acid 0aPhotoreactors1 aCrapulli, Ferdinando1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1489-17671 aTurolla, Andrea1 aAntonelli, Manuela0 tWater research.g2017 Sept. 15, v. 121 p.361-373dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2017.05.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02762naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245012400171300001600295520129500311592002801606650002301634650002501657650002001682650002401702650001601726650001301742650001201755650001601767650001101783650002301794650001401817650003301831650001501864650001801879650001701897650001401914653002301928653002501951653002301976653001801999653001702017700001602034700002302050773010202073856008402175852000902259655001202268IND60121834220221120085856.0150325e20150125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012183422DNAL7 a10.1080/07373937.2014.9388142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAziz Qureshi, A.10aSodium Humate as a Promising Coating Material for Microencapsulation of Beauveria bassiana Conidia Through Spray Drying  ap. 162-168.  aMicroencapsulation of Beauveria bassiana (Bb) conidia with sodium humate (SH) was undertaken successfully through spray drying at a high inlet air temperature of 175°C with corresponding outlet air temperature of 86.5 ± 1.3°C using 0.2% SH. The obtained product was a free-flowing, dark-brown powder containing microcapsules of Bb conidia coated with sodium humate (Bb-SH). These microcapsules measured 2.47–3.57 µm and possessed an uneven, fluffy surface. The colony-forming units (CFU) of Bb-SH microcapsules spray-dried at 175°C were 21.54 L CFUg ⁻¹, on par with 21.59 L CFUg ⁻¹ for Bb conidial powder not subjected to spray drying. Bb-SH microcapsules resulted in a high mortality of 93.0% against six-day-old Helicoverpa armigera larvae within five days after treatment. Bb-SH microcapsules readily dispersed in water, releasing sodium humate from the conidial surface. Germination of conidia was not affected by sodium humate as visualized by scanning electron microscopy of the cuticular surface of treated larvae. Bb-SH microcapsules showed good viability (21.11 L CFUg ⁻¹) at the end of six months of storage at room temperature (∼30°). Thus, sodium humate is a promising biopolymer for encapsulation of Bb conidia for extended shelf-life at room temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeauveria bassiana 3aHelicoverpa armigera 3aair temperature 3aambient temperature 3abiopolymers 3acoatings 3aconidia 3agermination 3alarvae 3amicroencapsulation 3amortality 3ascanning electron microscopy 3ashelf life 3asodium humate 3aspray drying 3aviability 0aBeauveria bassiana 0aHelicoverpa armigera 0aMicroencapsulation 0aSodium humate 0aSpray drying1 aVineela, V.1 aVimala Devi, P.

However, road extraction from historical maps is challenging due to their dissatisfying quality, the difficulty in distinguishing road symbols from those of other features (e.g., isolines, streams), etc. Recently, although deep learning, especially deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been successfully applied to extract roads from remote sensing images, road extraction from historical maps with deep learning is rarely seen in existing studies. Apart from this, it is time-consuming and laborious to manually label large amounts of training data. To bridge these gaps, this paper proposes a novel and efficient methodology to automatically generate training data through symbol reconstruction for road extraction. The proposed methodology is validated by implementing and comparing four training scenarios using the Swiss Siegfried map. The experiments show that imitation maps generated by symbol reconstruction are especially useful in two cases. First, if little manually labelled training data are available, models trained on imitation maps alone can already provide satisfactory road extraction results. Second, when training data from imitation maps are mixed with real training data, the resulting models even outperform the models trained on real data alone for some metrics, thus indicating that imitation maps can be a highly valuable addition. This research provides a new insight for fast and effective road extraction from historical maps using deep learning.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aevolution 3aisogenic lines 3aspatial data 3aurbanization 0aCartography 0aHistorical maps 0aRoad extraction 0aGeoAI 0aDeep learning 0aData synthesis1 aHeitzler, Magnus1 aHurni, Lorenz0 tInternational journal of applied earth observation and geoinformation.g2022 Sept., v. 113 p.102980-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21448x1569-84327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2022.1029803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03138naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245015000175300001400325520152400339592002801863650002901891650002301920650001901943650001701962650001201979650002201991650001202013650002002025650001502045650001302060650002002073650001802093650001302111650001402124650002202138650001402160650001502174650001302189650000902202650001502211651001102226653001102237653001202248653001202260653000902272653000902281653000902290700003702299700002802336773011402364856008502478852000902563655001202572IND60542577020221118150744.0190403e20150415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054257702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2015.01.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoiola, Priscilla P.14aThe role of environmental filters and functional traits in predicting the root biomass and productivity in savannas and tropical seasonal forests  ap. 49-55.  aAccurate measures of plant biomass and productivity are important to predict the impacts caused by current anthropogenic changes in the carbon pool. Changes in the carbon pool may be decisive whether plant communities act as sinks or sources for carbon dioxide. However, there are not accurate assessments of savanna and seasonal forest biomass, particularly belowground, which is essential to evaluate their carbon stock. We tested whether we could use soil variables, fire frequency, topography, and functional traits to build simple models to predict the belowground system in savanna and seasonal forest. In central Brazil, we collected root biomass up to 100cm deep and annual fine root productivity in the top 40cm of soil with an ingrowth donut, in 100 plots in savanna and 20 plots in seasonal forest. We used increasing complexity general linear modeling to find the models predicting the root biomass and productivity. We found significant models in all cases, even though the explanatory power for the savanna was low. The main ecological forces related to the root biomass and productivity were soils poor in nutrients, foraging for potassium in the savanna and for nitrogen in the forest, drought, resistance to disturbance, and niche complementarity. Reliable estimates of root biomass might be used to replace direct but laborious excavation methods. The carbon stock of savanna and seasonal forest are large and should not be neglected when estimating the impacts caused by climate and land-use changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiomass production 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sinks 3aclimate 3adeciduous forests 3adrought 3aedaphic factors 3afine roots 3aforaging 3aland use change 3alinear models 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3aplant communities 3apotassium 3aprediction 3asavannas 3asoil 3atopography 3aBrazil 0aCarbon 0aCerrado 0aDrought 0aFire 0aSoil 0aRoot1 aScherer-Lorenzen, M.q(Michael),1 aBatalha, Marco Antônio0 tForest ecology and management.g2015 Apr. 15, v. 342 p.49-55dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2015.01.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01910naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245012600169300001600295520066700311592002800978650002201006650001501028650001801043650003301061650001401094650002001108653001301128653003001141653002101171700001901192700001301211700001501224700001301239700001801252700001801270700001701288773010201305856008401407852000901491655001201500IND60121834320221120085744.0150325e20150125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012183432DNAL7 a10.1080/07373937.2014.9429122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Guang Yue14aThe Effect of Glass Transition Temperature on the Procedure of Microwave–Freeze Drying of Mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus)  ap. 169-175.  aFreeze drying (FD) yields the best quality of dried mushroom but at the cost of a long drying time and high overall cost. Air drying (AD) gives an unacceptably poor quality product. To achieve faster drying along with a high-quality product, a microwave–freeze drying (MFD) technique was developed to dry mushrooms. The relationship between dried mushroom quality and the glass transition temperature during the MFD process was studied to optimize the MFD process. According to the change tendency of the glass transition temperature of mushroom during MFD, a step-down microwave loading scheme for the MFD process was developed to obtain good product quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgaricus bisporus 3aair drying 3afreeze drying 3aglass transition temperature 3amushrooms 3aproduct quality 0aMushroom 0aMicrowave–freeze drying 0aGlass transition1 aZeng, Fan Lian1 aDuan, Xu1 aLiu, Lili,1 aDuan, Bo1 aWang, Mei Mei1 aLiu, Yun Hong1 aZhu, Wen Xue0 tDrying technology.g2015 Jan. 25, v. 33, no. 2 p.169-175dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-23007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07373937.2014.9429123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02384naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245009000164300002000254500001900274520122400293592002801517650001501545650003001560650001701590700001801607700001601625700005701641700001401698700005201712700005501764773013801819856008001957852000902037655001202046IND60707113120221119084524.0200813e20200715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070711312DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c044712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Shanshan10aInsight into Intermolecular Charge Transfer Determined by Two Packing Mode Cocrystals  ap. 17744-17751.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCocrystal molecules obtained through simple self-assembly of small organic molecules often have unique properties that monomolecular crystals do not have. However, it is not easy to purposefully construct a series of cocrystals with specific functions. Moreover, the structures and dynamics of cocrystals are still riddles on account of the initial stage of cocrystal development. In this work, two electron donors (hexamethylbenzene and 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene) are selected to govern the degree of charge transfer (CT) between the donor and acceptor (pyromellitic dianhydride), which may help obtain two light-emitting materials. In comparison with the monocomponent crystals, the emitting wavelengths of these cocrystals redshift from the ultraviolet range to visible region. It is worth noting that the intermolecular CT of these cocrystal materials is probed by femtosecond transient absorption (fs-TA) spectrometry. The relationship between the characteristics of emission and the stacking patterns of two specific cocrystals has been explored by fs-TA and density functional theory simulation. This work established the foundation to trace the excited-state evolution channels of the organic cocrystal materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3adensity functional theory 3aspectroscopy1 aPang, Junhong1 aNi, Shaofei1 aZhang, Guohui1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1159-592X1 aXu, Liang1 aDang, Li1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2666-76071 aLi, Ming-De1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7568-83000 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2020 July 15, v. 124, no. 32 p.17744-17751dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c044713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03154naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013300170300001400303520166400317592002801981650001402009650001902023650001902042650001002061650001402071650002602085650001902111650001302130650001502143650001402158650001402172650002402186650001302210650001402223650001102237650000902248650001402257651001502271653001402286653001702300653001402317653003202331653001902363700002202382700002402404773011402428856008502542852000902627655001202636IND60542577120221118150728.0190403e20150415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054257712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2015.01.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaher, Colin T.10aShelter provided by wood, facilitation, and density-dependent herbivory influence Great Basin bristlecone pine seedling survival  ap. 76-83.  aMicrosites created by live plants and non-living structures can be important for plant establishment where abiotic stress is high. The activity of herbivores and resulting pattern of seedling survival also affects plant distributions. We investigated factors thought to influence survival of bristlecone pine (Pinus longaeva Bailey) seedlings in the White Mountains, California, USA, with two field experiments in which microsite and exposure to herbivory were manipulated. In the microsite experiment, we planted seedlings underneath wooden shade structures, underneath sagebrush plants, and in exposed locations. In the herbivory experiment, we tested the effects of herbivore exclusion in three different habitat types. We planted seedlings in full wire cages (herbivores excluded), in half cages (herbivores allowed while enabling assessment of possible non-herbivore effects of cages on seedling survival), or with no cage (herbivores allowed), and repeated these treatments in three habitats: below, within, and above a bristlecone woodland. Over three growing seasons, seedlings planted under wooden shade structures had higher survival (28.9%) than seedlings growing under sagebrush (10%) or in exposed areas (3.3%). We found a significant treatment by habitat interaction in the herbivory experiment (χ2=12.056, P=0.017), driven by a clear pattern of high herbivory inside the bristlecone woodland, but not above or below it. Our results suggest that biologically-derived microsites (shelter from dead wood and live shrubs), as well as herbivore-mediated density-dependent mortality, are important determinants of bristlecone pine seedling survival.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemisia 3aPinus longaeva 3aabiotic stress 3acages 3adead wood 3afield experimentation 3agrowing season 3ahabitats 3aherbivores 3amortality 3amountains 3aplant establishment 3aplanting 3aseedlings 3ashrubs 3awood 3awoodlands 3aCalifornia 0aMicrosite 0aFacilitation 0aHerbivory 0aDensity-dependent mortality 0aPinus longaeva1 aBarber, Adelia L.1 aAffleck, David L.R.0 tForest ecology and management.g2015 Apr. 15, v. 342 p.76-83dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2015.01.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02846naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245012200164300001600286520158700302592002801889650001601917650002001933650000901953650002201962650001301984650001901997650001002016650001802026651001002044700001902054700002202073700002102095700002002116700002102136700002102157700001802178700002502196773011702221856007702338852000902415655001202424IND60548913520221119182954.0161110e20161201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054891352DNAL7 a10.1089/chi.2016.01352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNishimura, Rimei10aChanges in the Composition of Adiponectin Fractions over a 3-Year Period in Children: A Population-Based Cohort Study  ap. 440-445.  aBackground: Little information is available regarding changes in adiponectin fractions. The objective of this study was to examine changes in the composition of differing adiponectin fractions using a population-based, prospective pediatric cohort.Methods: A total of 358 fourth graders (9–10 years old) from Ina town in Saitama, Japan, were followed up for 3 years. BMI and total adiponectin (TAD), high–molecular weight adiponectin (HAD), medium–molecular weight adiponectin, and low–molecular weight adiponectin levels were measured in these subjects at baseline and at the end of the follow-up.Results: Of the fourth graders participating in the study, 326 (172 boys and 154 girls; follow-up rate, 91.1%) became available for follow-up. No significant changes were observed in TAD values after 3 years. HAD values were significantly decreased in both the boys (2.4 to 2.2 μg/mL: p < 0.001) and girls (3.1 to 2.7 μg/mL: p = 0.005). All values in the parameters examined at baseline and after 3 years were significantly correlated. A negative correlation was found between the ratios of follow-up compared to baseline values for BMI and those for TAD (boys, r = −0.322, p < 0.001; girls, r = −0.433, p < 0.001) as well as those for HAD (boys, r = −0.353, p < 0.001; girls, r = −0.351, p < 0.001).Conclusions: HAD had the most robust correlation between its values at baseline and those after 3 years in both boys and girls. The changes in HAD also had the most robust correlation between the changes in BMI in 3 years.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadiponectin 3abody mass index 3aboys 3achildhood obesity 3achildren 3acohort studies 3agirls 3anormal values 3aJapan1 aSano, Hironari1 aShirasawa, Takako1 aMatsudaira, Toru1 aMiyashita, Yumi1 aOchiai, Hirotaka1 aKokaze, Akatsuki1 aTajima, Naoko1 aUtsunomiya, Kazunori0 tChildhood obesity.g2016 Dec. 01, v. 12, no. 6 p.440-445dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:23081x2153-21767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089/chi.2016.01353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02050naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003000148245011100178300001800289520092700307592002801234650002501262650002001287650002601307650001801333650001501351650001701366650002401383650001101407700001501418700006301433773012501496856008201621852000901703655001201712IND60675104820200213000000.0191104e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067510482DNAL7 a10.1007/s00299-019-02457-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiménez-Gόngora, Tamara10aTransient overexpression of E2Fb triggers cell divisions in pavement cells of Nicotiana benthamiana leaves  ap. 1465-1471.  aKEY MESSAGE: Agrobacterium-mediated transient overexpression of E2Fb triggers new cell divisions in pavement cells of Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Transient transformation in Nicotiana benthamiana enables the study of multiple biological processes in a simple and fast manner. Here, we describe that, upon A. tumefaciens-mediated transient overexpression of the cell cycle regulator E2Fb from either Arabidopsis thaliana or N. benthamiana, cell divisions occur in epidermal pavement cells in N. benthamiana leaves, following a sequence of events that encompasses the nucleus taking a central position and being surrounded by chloroplasts, nuclear division, and formation of a new wall that divides the initial cell in two. Our results indicate that transient expression in N. benthamiana can be used to study cell division in plants, from DNA replication to cell wall formation, in a simple, controlled, and rapid manner.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aDNA replication 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3acell division 3acell walls 3achloroplasts 3agene overexpression 3aleaves1 aTan, Huang1 aLozano-Durán, Rosa1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7348-88420 tPlant cell reports.g2019 Dec., v. 38, no. 12 p.1465-1471dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl33565x0721-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00299-019-02457-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02868naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245010500161506011700266506007600383520137600459592002801835506003701863650000901900650001701909650001201926650002401938650001701962651001001979653003701989653001502026653003002041653002302071653002202094700001502116700001402131700001402145700001502159700001702174773015202191856008202343852000902425655001202434IND60790594120221207063349.0220921e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079059412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jag.2022.1029842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Dixu10aFlat voxel-based modelling, assessment and visualization of urban underground space resource quality  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe voxel-based data processing, spatial modeling and 3D visualization of urban geo-environment has played a crucial role in urban underground space resources (UUSR) management and quality assessment, which is a fundamental work of urban geo-informatics to support future city construction and integral urban planning. In this paper, the voxel-based geo-environmental data processing which consists of geographic coordinate conversion, flat voxel generation, spatial interpolation of attribute values, and the assessment and visualization of UUSR quality are presented supported with 3D-Mine and ArcGIS. Furthermore, the basic methodologies of UUSR quality assessment including the grey relational analysis method, the entropy weight method, and the interval continuous mathematical model are introduced and programed within MATLAB. Taking a particular area in Jiangbei New District of Nanjing, China as a case study, we demonstrate the data processing, spatial modelling, mathematic computation and synergic visualization of UUSR quality with flat voxels of size 30 × 30 × 1 m³. The assessment results exhibit an overall polarized distribution of obvious zoning characteristics of USSR quality in the study area, whose values are mainly fall into [0.22, 0.48] and [0.55, 0.80]. This research demonstrates a new application of flexible voxel in urban informatics.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aUSSR 3acase studies 3aentropy 3amathematical models 3aspatial data 3aChina 0aUrban underground space resource 0aFlat voxel 0aVoxel-based visualization 0aQuality assessment 0aUrban informatics1 aPeng, Boqi1 aWu, Lixin1 aWang, Rui1 aYang, Yang1 aXie, Busheng0 tInternational journal of applied earth observation and geoinformation.g2022 Sept., v. 113 p.102984-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21448x1569-84327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2022.1029843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03043naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100009000148245011100238300002000349500001100369520130600380592002801686596009601714650001501810650001001825650001301835650001901848650000901867650001801876650001101894650001601905650001401921650001301935650002201948650001601970651001201986651001301998651001002011651001202021651000902033651001102042651001602053651001002069651001302079700002202092700002302114700001802137700002902155700001802184700002802202773015502230856008302385852000902468655001202477IND60754823320221122095109.0211024e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075482332DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-16136-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFakhri,

The order of mycotoxin according to concentration of mycotoxin was Deoxynivalenol (20.083 μg/kg) > Zearalenone (2.065 μg/kg) > Enniatin (1.120 μg/kg) > Total aflatoxin (0.371 μg/kg) > Beauvericin (0.223 μg/kg) > Ochratoxins (0.087 μg/kg) > Citrinin (0.010 μg/kg). Further, the mycotoxins’ concentration in the yolk part (2.070 μg/kg) was higher than the mixed eggs (0.283 μg/kg). The rank order of mycotoxin based on country was China (14.990 μg/kg) > Cameroon (7.594 μg/kg) > Thailand (1.870 μg/kg) > Finland (0.920 μg/kg) > Iran (0.312 μg/kg) > Jordan (0.202 μg/kg) > Belgium (0.183 μg/kg) > Spain (<Lod μg/kg) > South Korea (<Lod μg/kg). The rank order of mycotoxins based on prevalence was BEA (99.73%) > DON (85.00%) > AFT (20.15%) > OT (16.00%). The overall prevalence of mycotoxin was equal to 29.65%. Also, the concentration of mycotoxins in China and Cameroon was higher than in other countries. Therefore, the monitoring programs to reduce mycotoxins in bird eggs consumed in some countries such as China and Cameroon should be considered.  aPublisher supplied data  aIR.HUMS.REC.1399.176cFood Health Research Center, Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences 3aaflatoxins 3abirds 3acitrinin 3adeoxynivalenol 3aeggs 3ameta-analysis 3amodels 3aochratoxins 3apollution 3aresearch 3asystematic review 3azearalenone 3aBelgium 3aCameroon 3aChina 3aFinland 3aIran 3aJordan 3aSouth Korea 3aSpain 3aThailand1 aSarafraz, Mansour1 aNematollahi, Amene1 aRanaei, Vahid1 aSoleimani-Ahmadi, Moussa1 aThai, Van Nam1 aMousavi Khaneghah, Amin0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 Nov., v. 28, no. 42 p.59542-59550dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-16136-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03506naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245012600166300001800292520170900310592002802019596006202047596012602109596008302235650003502318650000902353650001602362650001502378650001602393650001402409650001602423650001402439650001102453650002002464650001002484650001102494650001102505650001602516650002602532650001602558650001602574650001602590700001602606700001802622700001302640700001802653700001802671700005902689773012502748856008202873852000902955655001202964IND60675104920221118183409.0191104e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067510492DNAL7 a10.1007/s00299-019-02466-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLyu, Xiaolong10aCharacterization of watermelon anther and its programmed cell death-associated events during dehiscence under cold stress  ap. 1551-1561.  aKEY MESSAGE: The ‘neglected’ thermophile fruit crop of watermelon was first used as a model crop to study the PCD associated with anther dehiscence in cold-exposed condition during anther development. Anther dehiscence ensures normal pollen release and successful fertilization at fruit-setting stages in flowering plants. However, most researches pertinent to anther dehiscence are centered on model plant and/or major field crops under optimal growth condition. Due to anther indehiscence in cold condition, crop plants of thermophile tropical or subtropical fruit crops fail to accomplish timely pollination and fertilization, resulting in a great yield loss annually. Herein, we developed an ideal model crop for studying the programmed cell death (PCD) associated with anther dehiscence under low-temperature stress using the S-shaped spiral anther in watermelon as instead. Our results revealed that, including the tapetal cell layers, both cells of the interlocular septum and the stomium were blocked in PCD associated with anther dehiscence at 15 °C. Likewise, TUNEL assays visualized the evidence that low temperature at 15 °C interferes with not only the PCD of tapetal cells, but also the PCD of interlocular septum and stomium. Furthermore, the expressions of genes correlated with PCD of tapetum and stomium were significantly inhibited at 15 °C, suggesting that low temperature affects anther dehiscence by inhibiting PCD of sporophytic tissue-related gene expressions. The findings of the current research provide mechanistic insights into anther indehiscence leading to poor fruit-setting for thermophile fruit crop such as watermelon under adverse cold condition in flowering.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo.31672175cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2016C02051-4-1cKey Science and Technology Program for Agricultural (Vegetable) New Variety Breeding of Zhejiang Province  aCARS-26-17cEarmarked Fund for Modern Agro-industry Technology Research System 3aCitrullus lanatus var. lanatus 3acold 3acold stress 3adehiscence 3afield crops 3aflowering 3afruit crops 3afruit set 3afruits 3agene expression 3agenes 3amodels 3apollen 3apollination 3aprogrammed cell death 3asporophytes 3atemperature 3awatermelons1 aChen, Shuna1 aLiao, Nanqiao1 aLiu, Jie1 aHu, Zhongyuan1 aYang, Jinghua1 aZhang, Mingfang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9248-07120 tPlant cell reports.g2019 Dec., v. 38, no. 12 p.1551-1561dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl33565x0721-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00299-019-02466-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02555naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001200150245009800162300001300260520124200273592002801515650002201543650002101565650001301586650001601599650002101615650002801636650001101664650001901675650001101694650001101705650000901716650002001725653002301745653001601768653002101784653001601805653002201821700001201843700001601855700001801871700002201889773008101911856008401992852000902076655001202085IND60568548620221120035528.0170709e20170915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056854862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2017.05.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Dan10aInfluence of Bisphenol A on the transport and deposition behaviors of bacteria in quartz sand  ap. 1-10.  aThe influence of Bisphenol A (BPA) on the transport and deposition behaviors of bacteria in quartz sand was examined in both NaCl (10 and 25 mM) and CaCl2 solutions (1.2 and 5 mM) by comparing the breakthrough curves and retained profiles of cell with BPA in suspensions versus those without BPA. Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis were employed as model cells in the present study. The extended Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek interaction energy calculation revealed that the presence of BPA in cell suspensions led to a lower repulsive interaction between the cells and the quartz sand. This suggests that, theoretically, increased cell deposition on quartz sand would be expected in the presence of BPA. However, under all examined solution conditions, the presence of BPA in cell suspensions increased transport and decreased deposition of bacteria in porous media regardless of cell type, ionic strength, ion valence, the presence or absence of extracellular polymeric substances. We found that competition by BPA through hydrophobicity for deposition sites on the quartz sand surfaces was the sole contributor to the enhanced transport and decreased deposition of bacteria in the presence of BPA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aEscherichia coli 3abacteria 3abisphenol A 3acalcium chloride 3acell suspension culture 3aenergy 3ahydrophobicity 3amodels 3aquartz 3asand 3asodium chloride 0aBacteria transport 0aBisphenol A 0aSite competition 0aQuartz sand 0aInteraction force1 aHe, Lei1 aSun, Ruonan1 aTong, Meiping1 aKim, Hyŏn-jŏng,0 tWater research.g2017 Sept. 15, v. 121 p.1-10dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2017.05.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02367naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001700169245012500186300001600311520095900327592002801286650001301314650002001327650001301347650001601360650001601376650001301392650001501405650002201420650002401442650002001466650003801486650002701524650002301551650002301574650001901597650004101616651001001657651001001667700001801677700002001695773008901715856008401804852000901888655001201897IND60086714720221118025032.0141102e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008671472DNAL7 a229402752pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2012.07.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Lijuan10aIntegrated assessment on groundwater nitrate by unsaturated zone probing and aquifer sampling with environmental tracers  ap. 226-233.  aBy employing chemical and isotopic tracers (¹⁵N and ¹⁸O in NO₃ ⁻), we investigated the main processes controlling nitrate distribution in the unsaturated zone and aquifer. Soil water was extracted from two soil cores drilled in a typical agricultural cropping area of the North China Plain (NCP), where groundwater was also sampled. The results indicate that evaporation and denitrification are the two major causes of the distribution of nitrate in soil water extracts in the unsaturated zone. Evaporation from unsaturated zone is evidenced by a positive correlation between chloride and nitrate, and denitrification by a strong linear relationship between [Formula: see text] and ln(NO₃ ⁻/Cl). The latter is estimated to account for up to 50% of the nitrate loss from soil drainage. In the saturated zone, nitrate is reduced at varying extents (100 mg/L and 10 mg/L at two sites, respectively), largely by dilution of the aquifer water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3adenitrification 3adrainage 3aevaporation 3agroundwater 3anitrates 3asoil water 3atracer techniques 2aChloridesxanalysis 2aDenitrification 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aGroundwaterxchemistry 2aIsotopesxanalysis 2aNitratesxanalysis 2aNitrogen Cycle 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 3aChina 0aChina1 aPang, Zhonghe1 aHuang, Tianming0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2012 Dec., v. 171 p.226-233dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2012.07.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle
