VAT provides a range of methods for the analysis of plant pathosystems. The techniques are applicable to other binary data sets that are organized in large two-way tables, e.g., molecular marker data. The main features are data entry, descriptive tools, and inference statistics by resampling. About 50 well-established or newly developed indices allow a detailed diversity analysis of sexually and asexually reproducing populations. VAT facilitates a comprehensive, effective, and logically consistent evaluation and presentation of virulence and resistance data. A translation option simplifies the comparison of results from differently coded pathotypes.

The model was calibrated for a 105‐year period (1900 to 2005). An analysis with the model suggests that well‐field withdrawals were the dominant cause of salt water intrusion near the well field, and that historical sea‐level rise, which is similar to lower‐bound projections of future sea‐level rise, exacerbated the extent of salt water intrusion. Average 2005 hydrologic conditions were used for 100‐year sensitivity simulations aimed at quantifying the effect of projected rises in sea level on fresh coastal groundwater resources near the well field. Use of average 2005 hydrologic conditions and a constant sea level result in total dissolved solids (TDS) concentration of the well field exceeding drinking water standards after 70 years. When sea‐level rise is included in the simulations, drinking water standards are exceeded 10 to 21 years earlier, depending on the specified rate of sea‐level rise.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrinking water 3agroundwater 3agroundwater flow 3amodels 3asalts 3asaltwater intrusion 3asea level 3asolutes 3atotal dissolved solids 2aComputer Simulation 2aModels, Theoretical 2aOceans and Seas 2aSeawater 2aWater Wells 3aFlorida 0aFlorida1 aZygnerski, Michael0 tGround water.g2013 Sept., v. 51, no. 5 p.781-803dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0017-467X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6584.2012.01008.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02236naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002500152245010900177300001600286520099600302592002801298650002501326650002001351650000901371650002601380650001601406650001201422650002401434650001001458650003301468650001101501650001801512650001801530650001601548651001601564700001601580700001601596700002401612773011401636856005501750852000901805655001201814IND4481456820221118015648.0120418e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448145682DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0434.2012.01890.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKwon, JinâHyeuk10aFirst Report of Anthracnose Disease on Jatropha curcas Caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides in Korea  ap. 255-257.  aIn the summers of 2010 and 2011, an anthracnose disease was observed on the Jatropha curcas L. grown at the research field of Gyeongsangnamâdo Agricultural Research and Extension Services, South Korea. The symptoms included the appearance of dark brown spots on the leaf and fruit and the mummification of the fruit. The causal fungus formed grey to dark grey colony on potato dextrose agar. Conidia were single celled, ovoid or oblong, and 8â15âÃâ3â5âÎ¼m in size while seta was dark brown, coneâshaped and 25â46âÃâ2â6âÎ¼m in size. The optimum temperature for growth was approximately 30Â°C. On the basis of mycological characteristics, pathogenicity test and molecular identification using internal transcribed spacer rDNA sequence, the fungus was identified as Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an anthracnose caused by C.Â gloeosporioides on J.Â curcas plant in Korea.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlomerella cingulata 3aJatropha curcas 3aagar 3aagricultural research 3aanthracnose 3aconidia 3aextension education 3afungi 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aleaves 3apathogenicity 3aribosomal DNA 3atemperature 3aSouth Korea1 aChoi, Okhee1 aKim, Jinwoo1 aKwak, YounâSig0 tPhytopathologische Zeitschrift.g2012 May, v. 160, no. 5 p.255-257dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-17857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0434.2012.01890.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03112naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245016200169300001600331500001500347520178800362592002802150650001302178650001102191650002602202650001002228650003302238650001002271650002202281650001702303650002202320650002102342650001302363650001102376650001202387651001002399653001502409700002702424700002302451773011402474856008102588852000902669655001202678IND60523479820221116234352.0160619e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052347982DNAL7 a10.1007/s11676-016-0231-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMajumdar, Koushik10aChanges of woody species diversity, horizontal and vertical distribution of stems across interior to outside within a primate rich habitat of Northeast India  ap. 787-798.  a2019-12-06  aThe interior forest of protected area (PA) recover quickly in terms of greater diversity and structural complexity than peripheral and outsides, which may be due to high plant-frugivore interactions in the interior forest than the disturbed outsides. To describe the structural and functional differences in tree communities from interior to outside forests with in small PA, we quantitatively analyzed the vegetation of Trishna Wildlife Sanctuary, a rich primate habitat of Northeast India. Vegetation was sampled at ≥10 cm girth at breast height by 10 m × 500 m sized 20 line transects (10 ha) laid in the interior (N = 7), peripheral (N = 7) and outside (N = 6) zones of this sanctuary. All transects were ordinated by Principal Component Analysis based on correlation between diversity and existing disturbance indices. We found significant differences (P < 0.05) in taxonomic richness and diversity indices between the habitat. Van diagram confirmed greater unique species richness in the interior zone (64) than peripheral (28) and outside (6) zones. Overall density (ha⁻¹) did not differed across the zones, but basal area (m² ha⁻¹) was significantly (P < 0.01) high in peripheral zone. Vertical distribution of stem density was linearly declined across zones ([Formula: see text] > 0.70; P < 0.01) with increase in the canopy height. Horizontal distribution of adult stems showed significant inverse quadratic relationship ([Formula: see text] > 0.80; P < 0.001), which suggests very low density of canopy forming voluminous trees in the interior zone. Immediate protection, restoration and management of interior regions are required to preserve local plant genetic diversity and also to maintain suitable habitat for threatened wildlife.  aPublisher supplied data 3awildlife 3acanopy 3aquantitative analysis 3astems 3aprincipal component analysis 3atrees 3aspecies diversity 3awoody plants 3agenetic variation 3astand basal area 3ahabitats 3aadults 3aforests 3aIndia 0abasal area1 aChoudhary, Bal Krishan1 aDatta, Badal Kumar0 tJournal of forestry research.g2016 Aug., v. 27, no. 4 p.787-798dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1007-662X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11676-016-0231-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02334naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245012500170520112200295592002801417650002801445650001001473650001301483650001001496650001301506650001401519650003701533650001301570650001401583651001201597653001001609653000901619653000901628700002001637700002001657700001901677700001901696773011501715856008501830852000901915655001201924IND60745892520221120163117.0210911e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074589252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2021.1050142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhodor, Ragheed10aDetection and genomic characterization of mcr-9 in Enterobacter hormaechei recovered from a pediatric patient in Lebanon  aThe emergence and spread of mobilized colistin resistance (mcr) genes are a global health concern.In this study, we report the detection and genomic characterization of mcr-9 in a colistin-susceptible Enterobacter hormaechei (EH23) recovered from a pediatric patient in Lebanon.EH23 was susceptible to colistin with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.25 mg/L. Studying the mcr-9 genetic environment revealed that it was chromosomal and was bracketed by IS903 and IS26. QseCB, a two-component regulatory system, mediating the inducible expression of mcr-9 gene was not detected within the mcr-9 cassette but elsewhere on the genome. EH23 was 99.96% similar based on average nucleotide identity (ANI) to another mcr-negative E. hormaechei OIPH-N069 isolate recovered from Japan. wgSNP-based phylogenetic analysis divided all mcr-9 positive E. hormaechei isolates into five clades (I to V), with isolates from the same ST being clustered together.The silent spread of mcr-9, particularly in the globally successful ST-78 Enterobacter lineage, is worrisome and requires close monitoring in humans and animals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterobacter hormaechei 3aJapan 3acolistin 3agenes 3agenomics 3ainfection 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3apatients 3aphylogeny 3aLebanon 0amcr-9 0aqseB 0aqseC1 aSalloum, Tamara1 aEl Jisr, Tamima1 aEl Chaar, Mira1 aTokajian, Sima0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2021 Oct., v. 94 p.105014-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2021.1050143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02091naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245010600168300001600274520100300290592002801293650002201321650001901343650001901362650001101381650002201392650001101414650001601425650002401441650002101465700002101486700001701507700001601524773009501540856008501635852000901720655001201729IND60087790820221119182836.0141102e20110101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008779082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2010.07.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSin, Lee Tin10aDetermination of thermal stability and activation energy of polyvinyl alcohol–cassava starch blends  ap. 303-305.  aThe thermal degradation and activation energy of polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH) blends with cassava starch (CSV) were investigated by thermogravimetry method. Neat PVOH, CSV and PVOH–CSV specimens were prepared by solution casting method. Thermogravimetry is able to provide a clear description about the thermal resistance of PVOH–starch by comparing the onset degradation temperatures and activation energies of neat PVOH, CSV and PVOH–CSV blends (20–50wt.% of PVOH). The results showed that neat CSV has better thermal resistance than neat PVOH. This is probably due to the presence of cyclic hemiacetal structure in starch is sustainable to thermal attacks. PVOH–CSV blend exhibits enhancement in thermal stability at 40–50wt.% of PVOH. The activation energies of 40 and 50wt.% of PVOH loading in CSV are 149.64 and 175.49kJ/mol, which are 5.47% and 23.69% higher than CSV, respectively. In short, blending of cassava starch with PVOH significantly improved the thermal stability of PVOH.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3acassava starch 3aheat stability 3amixing 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3astarch 3atemperature 3athermal degradation 3athermogravimetry1 aRahman, W.A.W.A.1 aRahmat, A.R.1 aMokhtar, M.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2011 Jan. 1, v. 83, no. 1 p.303-305dElsevier Ltdx0144-86177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2010.07.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03158naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010200166300001600268500001400284520172300298592002802021650002202049650002002071650003002091650001602121650001102137650001202148650001502160650002402175650002602199650001002225650001502235650001302250650001902263650002502282650002202307650001002329650001102339651001002350653003302360700001902393700001902412700001502431773012802446856008102574852000902655655001202664IND60677716120221121173758.0191213e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067771612DNAL7 a10.1017/S00144797180004792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAcheampong, K.10aImproving field establishment of cacao (Theobroma cacao) through mulching, irrigation and shading  ap. 898-912.  aNAL-light  aEstablishment of young cacao trees in West Africa can be severely impeded by the onset of the dry season. To address this issue, a field experiment was conducted in Ghana to examine whether different mulch treatments and irrigation applied during the dry season combined with overhead shade could improve survival, early growth and yield of cacao. The mulch treatments used were polyethylene film and coffee husks placed around the young plants. Irrigation was used as a positive control, and no mulching or irrigation was a negative control. Three shade regimes were provided through different arrangements of Gliricidia sepium and plantains. Four different cacao clones were used in the study in a replicated split-plot design. Early growth of cacao was stimulated under the irrigation and plastic mulch treatments. Higher rates of photosynthesis during the dry season appeared to underlie these increases. Significantly higher early yields were also observed under the irrigation and coffee mulch treatments compared with the control. Plant survival varied significantly between treatments; irrigation was associated with the highest plant survival (94%), followed by the plastic mulch treatment (91%), coffee husk (82%) and the control (70%). There was also an increase in survival when more intense shading was used. Under zero mulch conditions, differences in survival were observed between clones. The clones P 30 [POS] and SCA 6 were more sensitive to drought (in terms of survival) than PA 150 and T 79/501. It is concluded that relatively simple mulching techniques or controlled irrigation in conjunction with appropriate shade management can significantly improve early establishment and cropping of cacao.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGliricidia sepium 3aTheobroma cacao 3aadministrative management 3aagriculture 3aclones 3adrought 3adry season 3aexperimental design 3afield experimentation 3ahulls 3airrigation 3amulching 3aphotosynthesis 3aplastic film mulches 3apolyethylene film 3ashade 3ayields 3aGhana 0aField establishment of cacao1 aDaymond, A.

We used 10 microsatellite (SSR) loci to investigate genetic diversity and differentiation in 16 natural populations. Genetic diversity was high at the species level (H E = 0.9427, h = 0.9410, I = 3.0213) and low at the population level (H E = 0.4441, h = 0.4307, I = 0.6822). Pronounced genetic differentiation was detected among populations (G ST = 0.5428, F ST = 0.5524), in line with the limited among-population gene flow (N m = 0.21). The significant isolation-by-distance pattern revealed by a Mantel test (r = 0.311, P = 0.001) suggested a clear geographic tendency in the distribution of genetic variability. Bayesian assignment and principal coordinates analyses supported the clustering of 16 populations into three groups. The present SSR results were also compared with previously published ISSR results. These results have significant implications for conservation of the species.  aPublisher supplied data 3agene flow 3agenetic variation 3aindigenous species 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aperennials 2aAristolochiaceaexgenetics 2aBayes Theorem 2aEmbryophytaxgenetics 2aExpressed Sequence Tags 2aGenetic Structures 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenetics, Population 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 2aPhylogeography 3aChina 0aChina1 aDong, Shan-Shan1 aLi, Shan1 aZhao, Gui-Fang0 tBiochemical genetics.g2012 Feb., v. 50, no. 1-2 p.146-158dSpringer-Verlagx0006-29287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10528-011-9488-7  aDNAL 7aarticle03461naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003500133040001800168100002100186245014000207300001600347506007600363520130700439592002801746506003701774650002801811650001401839650001201853650000901865650002201874650001201896650001001908650002001918650002101938650001201959650001301971650000901984650001201993650002802005650001602033650002902049650003002078650006002108650002402168650001902192650003902211650001102250650002502261650003002286650004902316650004802365650003202413650002902445650001702474650002102491700002502512700002202537700003702559700002302596773011102619856004802730852000902778655001202787IND4486593620221207101955.0121003e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448659362DNAL7 a221248632pmid7 aPMC33626962pmcid7 a10.1007/s12011-011-9279-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalińska, Aneta10aCombined Effect of Dietary Cadmium and Benzo(a)pyrene on Metallothionein Induction and Apoptosis in the Liver and Kidneys of Bank Voles  ap. 189-194.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBank voles free living in a contaminated environment have been shown to be more sensitive to cadmium (Cd) toxicity than the rodents exposed to Cd under laboratory conditions. The objective of this study was to find out whether benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), a common environmental co-contaminant, increases Cd toxicity through inhibition of metallothionein (MT) synthesis—a low molecular weight protein that is considered to be primary intracellular component of the protective mechanism. For 6 weeks, the female bank voles were provided with diet containing Cd [less than 0.1 μg/g (control) and 60 μg/g dry wt.] and BaP (0, 5, and 10 μg/g dry wt.) alone or in combination. At the end of exposure period, apoptosis and analyses of MT, Cd, and zinc (Zn) in the liver and kidneys were carried out. Dietary BaP 5 μg/g did not affect but BaP 10 μg/g potentiated rather than inhibited induction of hepatic and renal MT by Cd, and diminished Cd-induced apoptosis in both organs. The hepatic and renal Zn followed a pattern similar to that of MT, attaining the highest level in the Cd + BaP 10-μg/g group. These data indicate that dietary BaP attenuates rather than exacerbates Cd toxicity in bank voles, probably by potentiating MT synthesis and increasing Zn concentration in the liver and kidneys.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aClethrionomys glareolus 3aapoptosis 3acadmium 3adiet 3aexposure duration 3akidneys 3aliver 3ametallothionein 3amolecular weight 3arodents 3atoxicity 3azinc 2aAnimals 2aApoptosisxdrug effects 2aArvicolinae 2aBenzo(a)pyrenextoxicity 2aBody Weightxdrug effects 2aCadmiumxadministration & dosagexmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aDietary Supplements 2aDrug Synergism 2aEnvironmental Pollutantsxtoxicity 2aFemale 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aIn Situ Nick-End Labeling 2aKidneyxdrug effectsxmetabolismxpathology. 2aLiverxdrug effectsxmetabolismxpathology. 2aMetallothioneinxmetabolism 2aOrgan Sizexdrug effects 2aTime Factors 2aZincxmetabolism1 aWłostowski, Tadeusz1 aMaciak, Sebastian1 aŁaszkiewicz-Tiszczenko, Barbara1 aKozłowski, Paweł0 tBiological trace element research.g2012 June, v. 147, no. 1-3 p.189-194dSpringer-Verlagx0163-49847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-011-9279-3  aDNAL 7aarticle03008naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245008700175300001300262520178600275592002802061650001502089650001702104650001302121650001502134650003502149650002302184650001802207653001502225653001402240653002402254653001602278653002302294653001602317700002202333700001902355700002602374773010402400856008502504852000902589655001202598IND60536110820221120235048.0190215e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053611082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2014.12.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPierson, Jennifer C.10aCan habitat surrogates predict the response of target species to landscape change?  ap. 1-10.  aSurrogates are commonly used for monitoring biodiversity under a wide range of scenarios. However, surrogates are not often evaluated under diverse ecological conditions, and this hinders the identification of spatial and temporal boundaries of a surrogate’s relationship with its biodiversity metric, including whether a surrogate can predict biodiversity responses to environmental change. We adapted a causal framework from the medical literature and applied this framework to investigate the consistency of a well-established habitat surrogate of arboreal marsupials: hollow-bearing trees. We tested the consistency of the relationship between hollow-bearing trees and arboreal marsupials across four long-term studies (>10years) covering different habitat types and environmental disturbance. We also tested the ability of the change in hollow-bearing trees over time to predict the change in arboreal marsupials over time. We found a somewhat consistent relationship between hollow-bearing trees and relative abundance of arboreal marsupials, but the mechanistic details of this relationship varied both by location and by species of arboreal marsupial. Similarly, the surrogate approach was not able to predict trends over time, a result likely due to differences in natural temporal variation between the surrogate and target species of interest. Our investigation demonstrates that habitat surrogates can be very useful for certain aspects of monitoring programs, but that serious limitations prevail when trying to monitor changes over time, or if information on species-specific responses is required. Our new framework can be readily applied to any biodiversity surrogate with an established mechanistic link between the surrogate and biodiversity metric of interest.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMetatheria 3abiodiversity 3ahabitats 3amonitoring 3anatural resources conservation 3atemporal variation 3atree cavities 0aMonitoring 0aSurrogate 0aAdaptive management 0aTree hollow 0aArboreal marsupial 0aCavity nest1 aBarton, Philip S.1 aLane, Peter W.1 aLindenmayer, David B.0 tBiological conservation.g2015 Apr., v. 184 p.1-10dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2014.12.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02492naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002700140245023900167300001800406500002000424520107800444592002801522650002501550650002601575650001701601650001001618650002001628650001001648650002201658650001301680650002001693650000801713651001101721700002101732700002201753700002401775700002601799700002701825773013501852856007401987852000902061655001202070IND60572114020221118011714.0170712e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057211402DNAL7 a10.1111/ijfs.132272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarabagias, Ioannis K.10aInvestigating the impact of botanical origin and harvesting period on carbon stable isotope ratio values (13C/12C) and different parameter analysis of Greek unifloral honeys: A chemometric approach for correct botanical discrimination  ap. 2460-2467.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe aim of this study was to investigate the impact of botanical origin and harvesting period on carbon stable isotope ratio (¹³C/¹²C), colour intensity (CI), radical scavenging activity (%RSA), P and Sn content of Greek unifloral honeys. Thus, twenty‐four honey samples were collected during harvesting periods 2011–2012 and 2012–2013, from four different regions in Greece. ¹³C/¹²C ratios and minerals were determined using isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) and inductively coupled plasma optical–emission spectroscopy (ICP‐OES), respectively. CI and %RSA were measured using spectrophotometric assays. Results showed that only ¹³C/¹²C values and %RSA were affected by both botanical origin and harvesting period (P < 0.05). Applying then chemometric analyses to the collected data set, honeys were correctly classified according to honey type (correct classification rate 87.5% and 79.2% using the original and cross‐validation method, respectively). The use of different origin parameters has the potential to aid in honey authentication.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3abotanical composition 3achemometrics 3acolor 3adata collection 3ahoney 3amass spectrometry 3aminerals 3astable isotopes 3atin 3aGreece1 aCasiello, Grazia1 aKontakos, Stavros1 aLouppis, Artemis P.1 aLongobardi, Francesco1 aKontominas, Michael G.0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2016 Nov., v. 51, no. 11 p.2460-2467dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0950-54237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ijfs.132273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02755naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245016200167300002000329520141500349592002801764650001601792650001701808650001701825650001701842650002101859650002201880650001501902650001401917650002001931650002001951650001301971650001501984650001801999650001102017700001702028700002102045700001902066700002802085773011302113856008602226852000902312655001202321IND60558460120221122223358.0161115e20161115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055846012DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.6b026582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Lorrain10aTargeted Mass Spectrometry-Based Approach for Protein–Ligand Binding Analyses in Complex Biological Mixtures Using a Phenacyl Bromide Modification Strategy  ap. 10987-10993.  aThe characterization of protein folding stability changes on the proteomic scale is useful for protein-target discovery and for the characterization of biological states. The Stability of Proteins from Rates of Oxidation (SPROX) technique is one of several mass spectrometry-based techniques recently established for the making proteome-wide measurements of protein folding and stability. A critical part of proteome-wide applications of SPROX is the identification and quantitation of methionine-containing peptides. Demonstrated here is a targeted mass spectrometry-based proteomics strategy for the detection and quantitation of methionine-containing peptides in SPROX experiments. The strategy involves the use of phenacyl bromide (PAB) for the targeted detection and quantitation of methionine-containing peptides in SPROX using selective reaction monitoring (SRM) on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (QQQ-MS). As proof-of-principle, the known binding interaction of Cyclosporine A with cyclophilin A protein in a yeast cell lysate is successfully detected and quantified using a targeted SRM workflow. Advantages of the described workflow over other SPROX protocols include a 20-fold reduction in the amount of total protein needed for analysis and the ability to work with the endogenous proteins in a given sample (e.g., stabile isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture is not necessary).  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3acell culture 3acyclophilins 3acyclosporine 3aisotope labeling 3amass spectrometry 3amonitoring 3aoxidation 3aprotein content 3aprotein folding 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3aspectrometers 3ayeasts1 aWang, Dongyu1 aGooden, David M.1 aBall, Carol H.1 aFitzGerald, Michael C.,0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2016 Nov. 15, v. 88, no. 22 p.10987-10993dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.analchem.6b026583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02396naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245008400169300001600253520098500269592002801254650002401282650002301306650003001329650001001359650002301369650000701392650002301399650001501422650001301437650002201450650002301472650001401495650002701509650001101536653001101547653001501558653002401573653002601597700001201623700001801635700001801653700001701671700001601688773010201704856008701806852000901893655001201902IND60112499820221122035843.0190408e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011249982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2013.06.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Hongjuan10aPotential use of Lactobacillus casei AST18 as a bioprotective culture in yogurt  ap. 675-680.  aThis study investigated the inhibitory effects of Lactobacillus casei AST18 as a biocontrol agent on fungi spoilage in yogurt. In a yogurt preservation period experiment and mould-proof accelerated testing at 4 °C, the addition of 2% (v/v) L. casei AST18 in yogurt completely inhibited mould growth; mould growth was significantly delayed and spore germination was inhibited at 30 °C. The addition of L. casei AST18 improved the quantity of Lactobacillus, but the number of Streptococcus lactis in 2% AST18-added yogurt decreased by 1.0 Log (cfu/mL) compared with that in the blank group. L. casei AST18 exerted no significant influence on viscosity, water holding capacity, sensory quality, pH and titratable acidity. The post-acidification effect of L. casei AST18 was low. L. casei AST18 conspicuously inhibited the growth of filamentous fungi. Therefore, L. casei AST18 can be used as a bioprotective culture in yogurt to prevent fungal growth and extend shelf life.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus casei 3aLactococcus lactis 3abiological control agents 3afungi 3agrowth retardation 3apH 3asensory properties 3ashelf life 3aspoilage 3aspore germination 3atitratable acidity 3aviscosity 3awater holding capacity 3ayogurt 0aYogurt 0aAntifungal 0aLactobacillus casei 0aBioprotective culture1 aLiu, Lu1 aZhang, Shuwen1 aUluko, Hankie1 aCui, Wenming1 aLv, Jiaping0 tFood control.g2013 Dec., v. 34, no. 2 p.675-680dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2013.06.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02278naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003200149245008900181300001500270520097000285592002801255650001101283650002601294650002901320650002101349650002201370650001101392650001401403650002901417653000801446653000801454653000801462653000801470653002301478653002201501653003201523653002801555700003201583700002501615700002201640773007801662856008301740852000901823655001201832IND60560413720221121045301.0170320e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056041372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2016.11.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÁlvarez-Herránz, Agustín10aEnergy Innovations-GHG Emissions Nexus: Fresh Empirical Evidence from OECD Countries  ap. 90-100.  aThis study explores the impact of improvements in energy research development (ERD) on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions using environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis for 28 OECD countries over the period of 1990–2014.

This model considers that energy innovation accumulates in time and presents empirical evidence, how energy innovation contributes in reducing energy intensity and environmental pollution as well.Our results indicate that energy innovation measures require lapses of time to reach their full effect i.e. innovation applied to measures for environmental correction does not reach its whole effect immediately, requiring instead a certain amount of time to pass.

Co-doped cryptomelane was synthesized by refluxing at ambient pressure and characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, and its performances for removal of Pb2+ and Cr3+ from aqueous solutions were investigated. Co doping has a negligible effect on the structure and morphology of cryptomelane but increases the specific surface area and Mn average oxidation state. Mn and Co K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS) analysis shows that Co barely affects the atomic coordination environments of Mn, and distances of edge- and corner-sharing Co–Me (MeCo, Mn) pairs are shorter than those of the corresponding Mn–Me pairs, implying the replacement of framework Mn(III) by Co(III). These Co-doped cryptomelanes can quickly oxidize Cr3+ to be HCrO4− and remove 45%–66% of the total Cr in the reaction systems by adsorption and fixation, and they have enhanced Pb2+ adsorption capacities. Thus these materials are promising adsorbents for heavy metal remediation. The results demonstrate the design and modification of environmental friendly Mn oxide materials and can help us understand the interaction mechanisms of transition metals with Mn oxides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3achromium 3acobalt 3aheavy metals 3alead 3amanganese 3amanganese oxides 3aoxidation 3aremediation 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asurface area 3awastewater 0aCryptomelane 0aCo doping 0aEXAFS 0aPb2+ adsorption 0aCr3+ oxidation1 aLiu, Fan1 aZhu, Mengqiang1 aFeng, Xionghan1 aZhang, Jing1 aYin, Hui0 tJournal of Environmental Sciences.g2015 Aug. 01, v. 34 p.77-85dElsevier B.V.x1001-07427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2015.02.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04112naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003600151245014100187520191500328592002802243650002302271650003002294650001802324650002502342650001102367650000902378650002402387650001902411650002102430650001502451650001502466650001802481650002802499650002102527650001802548650001402566650001502580650002102595650002502616650002302641650002102664650001902685650001502704650001402719650002002733650002502753653002302778653002502801653002502826653001402851653002602865700002802891700001902919700001802938700003002956700003702986700003003023700004003053700003203093700001903125700002203144700003003166773011103196856008603307852000903393655001203402IND60720071220221122095544.0220606e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072007122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2020.1099702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade la Luz Cádiz-Gurrea, María10aBioactivity assays, chemical characterization, ADMET predictions and network analysis of Khaya senegalensis A. Juss (Meliaceae) extracts  aKhaya senegalensis A. Juss (Meliaceae) is a popular medicinal plant, widely used in the management of various ailments in the African traditional medicine. This study attempts to investigate into the different extraction methods (homogenizer-assisted extraction (HAE), maceration (MAC), infusion and Soxhlet (SE) extraction) on the pharmacological properties and chemical profiles of K. senegalensis. Antioxidant properties and inhibitory potential against key enzymes were assessed and bioinformatics analysis was conducted on selected limonoids to predict putative pharmacokinetics and protein targets underlying the pharmacological effects. Overall, the leaf extracts showed notable flavonoid (20.59–104.43 mg RE/g) content and the stem barks extracts displayed the highest total phenolic (87.69–46.28 mg GAE/g), phenolic acid (62.96–107.22 mg CE/g), flavanol (3.60–135.40 mg CAE/g) contents. All extracts showed remarkable antioxidant activities, with the MAC-Water leaf extract being most active in all the assays. Regarding stem bark, the MAC-MeOH extract exerted the highest free radical scavenging abilities, while HAE and MAC extracts were better sources of reducing agent and metal chelators. The HAE-MeOH, MAC-Water, and SE extracts showed noteworthy inhibitory activity against AChE, BChE (only stem barks), tyrosinase and α-glucosidase (only stem barks). All extracts displayed moderate inhibitory activities against α-amylase. The bioinformatics approach showed that khayanoside A and C interacted with multiple isoforms of metalloproteinase, while humilin B and khayanone interacted with opioid receptors. To sum up, the chemical profiles and biological activities of K. senegalensis were closely dependent on the extraction methods. Results amassed from this study showed that K. senegalensis is a potent source of bioactive compounds which could be explored as a functional food.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKhaya senegalensis 3aadministrative management 3aalpha-amylase 3aantioxidant activity 3aassays 3abark 3abioactive compounds 3abioinformatics 3achelating agents 3aextraction 3aflavonoids 3afood research 3afree radical scavengers 3afunctional foods 3aleaf extracts 3alimonoids 3amaceration 3amedicinal plants 3amedicinal properties 3ametalloproteinases 3apharmacokinetics 3aphenolic acids 3aprediction 3areceptors 3areducing agents 3atraditional medicine 0aKhaya senegalensis 0aChemical composition 0aNetwork pharmacology 0aLimonoids 0aNovel pharmaceuticals1 aSinan, Kouadio Ibrahime1 aZengin, Gokhan1 aBene, Kouadio1 aEtienne, Ouattara Katinan1 aLeyva-Jiménez, Francisco Javier1 aFernández-Ochoa, Álvaro1 adel Carmen Villegas-Aguilar, María1 aMahomoodally, Mohamad Fawzi1 aLobine, Devina1 aFerrante, Claudio1 aSegura-Carretero, Antonio0 tFood research international.g2021 Jan., v. 139 p.109970-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2020.1099703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02052naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245017900168300001800347520057900365592002800944650001600972650002200988650001301010650001301023650002301036650002301059650001701082650002101099650001101120650003201131650001101163650001901174650002201193700001501215700001801230700001601248700001801264700001901282700001401301700001801315700002001333700001701353773010601370856008501476852000901561655001201570IND60579458420221120133102.0170818e20170818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057945842DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.7b019552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Lan-Jun10aFour Hybrid Flavan–Chalcones, Caesalpinnone A Possessing a 10,11-Dioxatricyclic [5.3.3.01,6]Tridecane-Bridged System and Caesalpinflavans A–C from Caesalpinia enneaphylla  ap. 4315-4318.  aCaesalpinnone A (1), an unprecedented hybrid of flavan and chalcone, possessing a 10,11-dioxatricyclic [5.3.3.0¹,⁶]tridecane-bridged system, and caesalpinflavans A–C (2–4), three new hybrid flavan–chalcones, were isolated from the twigs and leaves of Caesalpinia enneaphylla.

However, with increasing drug availability through donation, the World Health Organisation has set a goal of increasing coverage to 75 % of at-risk children in endemic countries and elimination in some regions. In this paper, we assess the impact on schistosomiasis of the WHO goals in terms of control and elimination. METHODS: We use an age-structured deterministic model of schistosome transmission in a human community and the effect of mass drug administration. The model is fitted to baseline data from a longitudinal re-infection study in Kenya and validated against the subsequent re-infection data. We examine the impact on host worm burden of the current treatment trend, extrapolated to meet the WHO goals, and its sensitivity to uncertainty in important parameters. We assess the feasibility of achieving elimination. RESULTS: Model results show that the current treatment trend, extrapolated to the WHO goals, is able to greatly reduce host worm burdens. If coverage is continued at the same level beyond 2020, elimination is possible for low to moderate transmission settings, where transmission intensity is defined by the basic reproduction number, R₀. Low levels of adult coverage have a significant impact on worm burden in all settings. Model validation against the re-infection survey demonstrates that the age-structured model is able to match post-treatment data well in terms of egg output, but that some details of re-infection among school children and young adults are not currently well represented. CONCLUSIONS: Our work suggests that the current WHO treatment goals should be successful in bringing about a major reduction in schistosome infection in treated communities. If continued over a 15 year period, they are likely to result in elimination, at least in areas with lower transmission.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aWorld Health Organization 3abasic reproduction number 3adrugs 3aeggs 3ahelminths 3ahuman communities 3amodel validation 3amodels 3aschistosomiasis 3aschool children 3asurveys 3auncertainty 3ayoung adults 3aKenya1 aTurner, HC1 aFarrell, SH1 aYang, Jie1 aTruscott, JE0 tParasites & vectors.g2015 Dec., v. 8, no. 1 p.553-553dBioMed Centralx1756-33057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-015-1157-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03100naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245011700162300001800279500001400297520182800311592002802139650001402167650001402181650001102195650002002206650001502226650002102241650001102262650001502273650002502288650001002313650002702323700002802350700001702378700003002395700002202425700002302447773012502470856007402595852000902669655001202678IND60733918320221122055415.0210414e20210413xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073391832DNAL7 a10.1039/d0fo02976a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeerup, Christine10aEffects of recombinant human gastric lipase and pancreatin during in vitro pediatric gastro-intestinal digestion  ap. 2938-2949.  aNAL-light  aThe aim of the study was to implement a gastric digestion step using recombinant human gastric lipase (rHGL) in an in vitro pediatric gastro-intestinal digestion model to achieve a physiologically relevant gastric contribution to total gastro-intestinal lipid digestion. A commercial infant formula (NAN Comfort stage 1 (NAN1)) with 3.4% lipid and an in-lab prepared oil-in-water emulsion, emulsified with soy phosphatidylcholine (SPCemul), with 3.5% lipid (oil-blend containing Akonino NS, MEG-3 and ARASCO oils) were subjected to in vitro gastro-intestinal digestion. To achieve a physiologically relevant level of gastric digestion, 50 min of in vitro gastric digestion, using either 0, 3.75 or 7.5 TBU mL⁻¹ rHGL, was followed by 90 min of in vitro intestinal digestion, using either 0 or 26.5 TBU mL⁻¹ pancreatic triglyceride lipase (PTL) from porcine pancreatin. The digestion of the substrates was assessed using titration-based quantification supported by HPLC-ELSD analysis. In vitro gastric digestion of NAN1 and SPCemul with either 3.75 or 7.5 TBU mL⁻¹ rHGL contributed with 10–27% of the total gastro-intestinal digestion, corresponding to the reported contribution in human infants. At the end of the gastro-intestinal digestion (t = 140 min), the combined lipolytic effect of rHGL and PTL was additive during digestion of SPCemul, but not for the digestion of NAN1, as all lipase activity combinations resulted in a similar degree of NAN1 digestion. The effect of gastric digestion with rHGL on total digestion therefore appeared to be substrate dependent. To conclude, a gastric digestion step using rHGL resulting in physiologically relevant gastric contribution to the observed gastro-intestinal digestion was successfully implemented into an in vitro pediatric gastro-intestinal digestion model.  aPublisher supplied data 3adigestion 3aemulsions 3ahumans 3ainfant formulas 3aintestines 3alipid metabolism 3amodels 3apancreatin 3aphosphatidylcholines 3aswine 3atriacylglycerol lipase1 aEbbesen, Morten Frendø1 aGeng, Xiaolu1 aMadsen, Sofie Falkenløve1 aBerthelsen, Ragna1 aMüllertz, Anette,0 tFood & function.g2021 Apr. 13, v. 12, no. 7 p.2938-2949dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0fo02976a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03265naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245007300204300002000277506007600297520167800373592002802051506003702079650000902116650001502125650001402140650001102154650001402165650001102179650001302190650001302203650001202216650001202228650001402240650001202254650001802266650001502284651002302299651001802322700002402340700001602364700001802380700002402398700001902422700002602441773017602467856008302643852000902726655001202735IND4487045120221207101951.0120502e20111227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448704512DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11123811082doi7 aPMC32485252pmcid7 a221606762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLindberg, T.

The waste rock from these surface mines is disposed of in the adjacent river valleys, leading to a burial of headwater streams and dramatic increases in salinity and trace metal concentrations immediately downstream. In this synoptic study we document the cumulative impact of more than 100 mining discharge outlets and approximately 28Â km2 of active and reclaimed surface coal mines on the Upper Mud River of West Virginia. We measured the concentrations of major and trace elements within the tributaries and the mainstem and found that upstream of the mines water quality was equivalent to state reference sites. However, as eight separate mining-impacted tributaries contributed their flow, conductivity and the concentrations of selenium, sulfate, magnesium, and other inorganic solutes increased at a rate directly proportional to the upstream areal extent of mining. We found strong linear correlations between the concentrations of these contaminants in the river and the proportion of the contributing watershed in surface mines. All tributaries draining mountaintop-mining-impacted catchments were characterized by high conductivity and increased sulfate concentration, while concentrations of some solutes such as Se, Sr, and N were lower in the two tributaries draining reclaimed mines. Our results demonstrate the cumulative impact of multiple mines within a single catchment and provide evidence that mines reclaimed nearly two decades ago continue to contribute significantly to water quality degradation within this watershed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acoal 3aland cover 3amagnesium 3amining 3amountains 3arivers 3asalinity 3aselenium 3asolutes 3astreams 3astrontium 3avalleys 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3aAppalachian region 3aWest Virginia1 aBernhardt, Emily S.1 aBier, Raven1 aHelton, A.

On the other hand, exploring polymer solar cells (PSCs) processed from nonhalogenated solvents is necessary toward their large-scale applications. In this contribution, we develop a HH-type bithiophene analogue (TIPS-T2) by strategically applying the triisopropylsilylethynyl (TIPS) scaffold as the side chain. TIPS can serve to narrow optical band gaps, lower the highest occupied molecular orbital level, reduce intrachain steric hindrance, and guarantee sufficient solubility of the involving polymers. Upon alternating with difluorobenzotriazole (FTAZ) or benzodithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD) acceptor units, two polymers named PT4Si-FTAZ and PT4Si-BDD are synthesized. Encouragingly, non-fullerene PSCs incorporating PT4Si-FTAZ yield a power conversion efficiency of 6.79% when processed from an environment-friendly solvent of trimethylbenzene because of its promoted backbone planarity, as demonstrated by density functional theory, higher hole mobility, and superior film morphology. The results indicate that TIPS-T2 is a promising building block for constructing photovoltaic polymers, and our findings offer an avenue for the ingenious use of TIPS as functional side chains.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3adensity functional theory 3asemiconductors 3asolar cells 3asolubility 3asolvents 3atriazoles 0ahead-to-head 0abithiophene 0atrialkylsilylethynyl 0apolymer solar cells 0anon-chlorinated solvent1 aLiu, Haifen1 aYang, Shaopeng1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8073-81061 aFu, Chaochao1 aLi, Yun1 aLi, Qiaohong1 aHuai, Zhaoxiang0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Feb. 28, v. 10, no. 8 p.7271-7280dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b186373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02700naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245011600159300001800275500001400293520123900307592002801546650002001574650001901594650001301613650001401626650001601640650001901656650001401675650001301689650001701702650002601719650001501745650002101760650001501781650001901796650002001815650001501835650001301850650000901863700001601872700001901888700001701907700001601924700001701940700001701957773012501974856007402099852000902173655001202182IND60733918420221122055441.0210414e20210413xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073391842DNAL7 a10.1039/d0fo03000g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiu, Changyang10aBiosafety evaluation of Nannochloropsis oculata and Schizochytrium sp. oils as novel human milk fat substitutes  ap. 2972-2984.  aNAL-light  aThe biosafety assessment of novel human milk fat substitutes (HMFs) from microalgae oils of Nannochloropsis oculata and Schizochytrium sp. was evaluated by testing the cytotoxic activity using IEC-6 cells, and by conducting a sub-chronic 28-day dietary study using Sprague–Dawley (SD) suckling rats in this study. The results of the cytotoxic activity of IEC-6 cells treated with HMFs showed no apparent effect on cell viability at the tested concentrations (0–1000 μg mL⁻¹). For the 28-day sub-chronic study, five rat dietary feeds with 7.5% fat were designed to have the DHA content in the range from 0 to 2.0% using corn oil as a basal oil. After the 28-day treatment, SD rats fed HMFs did not show toxicity signs and adverse effects, based on the results of clinical observation, body weight, food consumption, behavior, hematology, clinical chemistry, and necropsy findings. These results could lead to the conclusion that the inclusion of the new synthesized HMFs into the pre-weaning SD rat diet was acceptable for SD rats and did not exhibit toxic characteristics and adverse features, indicating that the HMFs from microalgal oils were safe and had the potential to be used as a promising feedstock in infant formula.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNannochloropsis 3aSchizochytrium 3abehavior 3abiosafety 3abody weight 3acell viability 3achemistry 3acorn oil 3acytotoxicity 3adiet study techniques 3afeedstocks 3afood consumption 3ahematology 3ahuman milk fat 3ainfant formulas 3amicroalgae 3anecropsy 3arats1 aHe, Yongjin1 aHuang, Zicheng1 aQiu, Weisang1 aHuang, Jian1 aWang, Mingzi1 aChen, Bilian0 tFood & function.g2021 Apr. 13, v. 12, no. 7 p.2972-2984dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0fo03000g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02474naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245011000159300001800269520130800287592002801595650004401623650002201667650001001689650001601699650002101715650001101736650004401747650001301791650001301804700001801817700002601835700001801861700001701879773012001896856007502016852000902091655001202100IND60559462420170927000000.0161216e20140306xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055946242DNAL7 a10.1021/jp41216732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSiodłak, Dawid10aConformational Properties of Oxazole-Amino Acids: Effect of the Intramolecular N–H···N Hydrogen Bond  ap. 2340-2350.  aOxazole ring occurs in numerous natural peptides, but conformational properties of the amino acid residue containing the oxazole ring in place of the C-terminal amide bond are poorly recognized. A series of model compounds constituted by the oxazole-amino acids occurring in nature, that is, oxazole-alanine (l-Ala-Ozl), oxazole-dehydroalanine (ΔAla-Ozl), and oxazole-dehydrobutyrine ((Z)-ΔAbu-Ozl), was investigated using theoretical calculations supported by FTIR and NMR spectra and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. It was found that the main feature of the studied oxazole-amino acids is the stable conformation β2 with the torsion angles φ and ψ of −150°, −10° for l-Ala-Ozl, −180°, 0° for ΔAla-Ozl, and −120°, 0° for (Z)-ΔAbu-Ozl, respectively. The conformation β2 is stabilized by the intramolecular N–H···N hydrogen bond and predominates in the low polar environment. In the case of the oxazole-dehydroamino acids, the π-electron conjugation that is spread on the oxazole ring and CᵅCᵝ double bond is an additional stabilizing interaction. The tendency to adopt the conformation β2 clearly decreases with increasing the polarity of environment, but still the oxazole-dehydroamino acids are considered to be more rigid and resistant to conformational changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacids 3aamino acids 3ahydrogen bonding 3amodels 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoxazoles 3apeptides1 aStaś, Monika1 aBroda, Małgorzata

Seven Picual‐variety olive samples from two consecutive seasons, with different maturity index, were used. Results show that temperature and malaxation time exert a positive influence in olive yield, with optimal values ranging from 20.1 to 32.2 °C and from 73.3 to 90 min. Oil quality decreased slightly as temperature and time of malaxation were increased. Top quality oils were obtained below 30 °C and shorter mixing time.

The present work reports a simple and fast electrochemical method for direct analysis of antioxidants in fruit juices by modulating the permeability of mesochannels on the electrode surface. This goal was achieved by growing vertical silica mesochannel array (SMA) with a channel diameter of 2–3 nm on the indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode surface using the cylindrical micelles (CMs) as the template. As-prepared electrodes, designed as CM@SMA/ITO, are only permeable to lipophilic antioxidants, e.g., retinol, with the hydrophobic hydrocarbon cores of CMs. After excluding CMs from silica mesochannels, the ITO electrode modified with bare SMA, namely SMA/ITO, possesses a high density of silanol groups on the channel wall and thus is only permeable to hydrophilic antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid (AA). Two types of sensors allowed the selective analyses of retinol and AA in buffer solutions and demonstrated a wide linear range for retinol (1–60 μM) and AA (10–2000 μM), respectively, and a low detection limit (0.65 μM for retinol and 0.52 μM for AA). Moreover, the SMA/ITO electrode can selectively determine the concentration of AA in orange juice. The CM@SMA/ITO electrode can measure the sum activity of lipophilic antioxidants, such as retinol, α-tocopherol, and others possibly coexisting, in carrot juice. In addition, the ultrasmall mesochannels and CMs could effectively exclude the access of large substances, rendering an excellent antifouling and anti-interference ability for direct analysis of antioxidants in fruit juices without sample pretreatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpha-tocopherol 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3acarrot juice 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aindium tin oxide 3amicelles 3aorange juice 3apermeability 3asilica 3avitamin A1 aSu, Bin0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2016 Nov. 15, v. 88, no. 22 p.11001-11006dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.analchem.6b028233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02611naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245015600172300001600328500001400344520108900358592002801447650002201475650001601497650001301513650001601526650001401542650002101556650004301577650001401620650001301634650001301647650001901660650000801679650003001687650001101717651001301728653002201741653001701763653001501780700002201795700006501817700002901882773012801911856008102039852000902120655001202129IND60677716520221121173730.0191213e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067771652DNAL7 a10.1017/S001447971900005X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGómez, Manuel Iván10aNormalized difference vegetation index, ${\bf N} - {\bf NO}_3^ - $ and K⁺ in stem sap of potato plants (Group Andigenum) as affected by fertilization  ap. 945-955.  aNAL-light  aRemote sensors permit forecasting the nutrient status and yields in crops of economic importance in Colombia.

For Capiro, significant differences in NDVI readings (0.84–0.88) were found between phenological stages. In both cultivars, NDVI correlated positively with yield and K⁺ concentrations in stem sap during tuber filling and maturation, while in Capiro no correlation was established between NDVI values and ${\rm {N - NO}}_3^ - $ concentrations in stem sap. The NDVI readings could be used to forecast productivity and K status in potato Group Andigenum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aagriculture 3abehavior 3acorrelation 3acultivars 3afertilizer rates 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aphenology 3aplanting 3apotatoes 3aremote sensing 3asap 3atrace element fertilizers 3ayields 3aColombia 0aReflectance index 0aSap analysis 0aSolanaceae1 aBarragán, Andrea1 aMagnitskiy, Stanislav1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3715-19321 aRodríguez, Luis Ernesto0 tExperimental agriculture.g2019 Dec., v. 55, no. 6 p.945-955dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl46155x1469-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S001447971900005X3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03573naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006200146245012700208300001600335520175300351592002802104650003602132650002102168650001102189650001602200650002102216650001602237650001002253650001602263650001802279650001202297650001102309650004302320650001402363650001402377650001502391650001002406650002502416650001602441650001602457651001102473653002202484653002202506653000902528653005402537653001902591700006202610700002302672700003302695700002302728773016602751856008102917852000902998655001203007IND60544572820221122133951.0190417e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054457282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cj.2015.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVergara-Diaz, Omar1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7074-077410aGrain yield losses in yellow-rusted durum wheat estimated using digital and conventional parameters under field conditions  ap. 200-210.  aThe biotrophic fungus Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici is the causal agent of the yellow rust in wheat. Between the years 2010–2013 a new strain of this pathogen (Warrior/Ambition), against which the present cultivated wheat varieties have no resistance, appeared and spread rapidly. It threatens cereal production in most of Europe. The search for sources of resistance to this strain is proposed as the most efficient and safe solution to ensure high grain production. This will be helped by the development of high performance and low cost techniques for field phenotyping. In this study we analyzed vegetation indices in the Red, Green, Blue (RGB) images of crop canopies under field conditions. We evaluated their accuracy in predicting grain yield and assessing disease severity in comparison to other field measurements including the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), leaf chlorophyll content, stomatal conductance, and canopy temperature. We also discuss yield components and agronomic parameters in relation to grain yield and disease severity. RGB-based indices proved to be accurate predictors of grain yield and grain yield losses associated with yellow rust (R2=0.581 and R2=0.536, respectively), far surpassing the predictive ability of NDVI (R2=0.118 and R2=0.128, respectively). In comparison to potential yield, we found the presence of disease to be correlated with reductions in the number of grains per spike, grains per square meter, kernel weight and harvest index. Grain yield losses in the presence of yellow rust were also greater in later heading varieties. The combination of RGB-based indices and days to heading together explained 70.9% of the variability in grain yield and 62.7% of the yield losses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPuccinia striiformis f. tritici 3aagronomic traits 3acanopy 3achlorophyll 3adisease severity 3adurum wheat 3afungi 3agrain yield 3aharvest index 3aheading 3aleaves 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3apathogens 3aphenotype 3aprediction 3aseeds 3astomatal conductance 3astripe rust 3atemperature 3aEurope 0aWheat yellow rust 0aField phenotyping 0aNDVI 0aPhenology, Puccinia striiformis RGB-based indices 0aTriticum durum1 aKefauver, Shawn C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1687-19651 aElazab, Abdelhalim1 aNieto-Taladriz, Maria Teresa1 aAraus, José Luis,0 tcrop journal.g2015 June, v. 3, no. 3 p.200-210dElsevier B.V.aCrop Science Society of China and Institute of Crop Science, CAASwJournal:23202x2214-51417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cj.2015.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02249naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245004100167300001600208520112400224592002801348650001201376650001601388650001101404650001201415650002201427650002101449650001201470650000901482650001501491651001301506653002001519653001601539653001601555653002901571700002201600700004601622773007901668856008301747852000901830655001201839IND60560414020221121060412.0170124e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056041402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2016.11.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeña, Ivonne10aLessons from wind policy in Portugal  ap. 193-202.  aWind capacity and generation grew rapidly in several European countries, such as Portugal. Wind power adoption in Portugal began in the early 2000s, incentivized by a continuous feed-in tariff policy mechanism, coupled with public tenders for connection licenses in 2001, 2002, and 2005. These policies led to an enormous success in terms of having a large share of renewables providing electricity services: wind alone accounts today for ~23.5% of electricity demand in Portugal. We explain the reasons wind power became a key part of Portugal’s strategy to comply with European Commission climate and energy goals, and provide a detailed review of the wind feed-in tariff mechanism. We describe the actors involved in wind power production growth. We estimate the environmental and energy dependency gains achieved through wind power generation, and highlight the correlation between wind electricity generation and electricity exports. Finally, we compare the Portuguese wind policies with others countries’ policy designs and discuss the relevance of a feed-in tariff reform for subsequent wind power additions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aexports 3aissues and policy 3apower generation 3atariffs 3awind 3awind power 3aPortugal 0aFeed-in tariffs 0aWind energy 0aWind policy 0aPortuguese energy policy1 aL.

Although primary infection occurs in many plant species, secondary infection only continues to completion in susceptible hosts. As part of a larger study of clubroot pathogenesis, secondary zoospores collected from infected root hairs of canola and ryegrass were inoculated onto healthy roots of both plant species. The treatments consisted of all possible combinations of the two plant species and the two sources of inoculum. At 5 days after inoculation, levels of root hair infection were similar and in a range of 50–68% on roots in all of the treatments. Secondary infection was also observed from all of the treatments, with approximately 50% on canola and 40% on ryegrass. The proportion of secondary infection and the number of secondary plasmodia were higher in canola inoculated with zoospores from canola than in ryegrass inoculated with zoospores from ryegrass, with the other combinations intermediate. At 35 days after inoculation, typical clubs developed on 14% of the canola plants inoculated with secondary zoospores from canola, and tiny clubs developed on 16% of the canola plants inoculated with zoospores from ryegrass. Secondary infection occurred in about one-third of ryegrass plants but no clubs developed, regardless of inoculum source. These results indicate that resistance to secondary infection in ryegrass is induced during primary infection. This is the first report that secondary zoospores produced on a nonhost can infect a host and reconfirms that secondary infection can occur in a nonhost.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLolium 3aPlasmodiophora brassicae 3acanola 3ahosts 3apathogenesis 3aroot hairs 3azoospores1 aXiao, Qiang1 aHwang, Sheau-Fang1 aStrelkov, Stephen E.1 aGossen, Bruce D.0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2012 Mar., v. 132, no. 3 p.309-315dSpringer-Verlagx0929-18737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-011-9875-2  aDNAL 7aarticle03565naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245011800173520199000291592002802281650002202309650001402331650001802345650001402363650002602377650001002403650001402413650003002427650001702457650003002474650001502504650001302519650001402532650001102546650001602557651002802573651001902601653001502620653002002635653001402655653001202669653001802681653002402699653001302723700001702736700002402753700002202777700002702799773010302826856008502929852000903014655001203023IND60745893220221120150434.0210904e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074589322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoinf.2021.1013752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŠevčík, Richard14aThe effect of environmental variables on owl distribution in Central Europe: A case study from the Czech Republic  aSpecies distributional data from atlas projects collected by volunteers and professionals play an essential role in ecology and biodiversity conservation. Atlas data primarily allow evaluating longitudinal and latitudinal gradients in species distribution. However, the effects of additional factors such as elevation and associated climatic conditions and landscape structure are rarely assessed. We used the original data from the Atlas of birds breeding in the Czech Republic in terms of the presence and absence (0/1) of breeding occurrence of seven owl species in 604 mapping quadrates (each quadrate 12.0 × 11.1 km in size) to assess the effect of elevation (reaching from 100 to 1100 m a.s.l.) and temperature on the distributional patterns of the owls. Using a multivariate spatial analysis with latitude and longitude as space predictors and landscape structure as covariates, we found that elevation and temperature significantly affected owl distribution; the model explained 94.8% of the variability (p = 0.002). Only the boreal owl (Aegolius funereus) showed a clear preference for the highest elevation, and simultaneously, boreal and pygmy (Glaucidium passerinum) owls preferred the coldest environments. Eagle owl (Bubo bubo) and tawny owl (Strix aluco) most often occupied low and middle elevation of moderate temperatures. Barn owl (Tyto alba) and long-eared owl (Asio otus) inhabited the warmest areas in low elevations. Finally, little owl (Athene noctua) most often occurred in the lowest elevations of intermediate temperatures. We have documented that the elevation and associated climate conditions can work as an effective predictor to assess distributional preferences of owl species based on atlas data. The findings can be helpful when the management of owls' habitats is considered and implemented. For example, the results of our case study suggest that the boreal owl can be susceptible to global warming and intensive logging at high elevations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAegolius funereus 3aAsio otus 3aAthene noctua 3aBubo bubo 3aGlaucidium passerinum 3aStrix 3aTyto alba 3abiodiversity conservation 3acase studies 3ageographical distribution 3alandscapes 3alatitude 3alongitude 3amodels 3atemperature 3aCentral European region 3aCzech Republic 0aAtlas data 0aCitizen science 0aElevation 0aClimate 0aBirds of prey 0aHabitat preferences 0aAltitude1 aRiegert, Jan1 aŠt̕astný, Karel,1 aZárybnický, Jan1 aZárybnická, Markéta0 tEcological informatics.g2021 Sept., v. 64 p.101375-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2190x1574-95417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2021.1013753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01484naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245009000158300001800248520058500266592002800851650002600879650001500905650001200920650001500932650001200947700002000959773013100979856007501110852000901185655001201194IND60538531720221122233445.0160815e20120516xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053853172DNAL7 a10.1021/ja300095j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Feng-Rong10aModular Assembly of Metal–Organic Supercontainers Incorporating Sulfonylcalixarenes  ap. 8002-8005.  aA new strategy for the design of container molecules is presented. Sulfonylcalix[4]arenes, which are synthetic macrocyclic containers, are used as building blocks that are combined with various metal ions and tricarboxylate ligands to construct metal–organic “supercontainers” (MOSCs). These MOSCs possess both endo and exo cavities and thus mimic the structure of viruses. The synthesis of MOSCs is highly modular, robust, and predictable. The unique features of MOSCs are expected to provide exciting new opportunities for the exploration of their functional applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaromatic hydrocarbons 3acontainers 3aligands 3ametal ions 3aviruses1 aWang, Zhenqiang0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2012 May 16, v. 134, no. 19 p.8002-8005dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja300095j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03243naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245010900168300001300277520188700290592002802177650001102205650002302216650001102239650002302250650001502273650001302288650001302301650002102314650001502335650001702350650001102367650001902378650000902397650001602406650001102422650001402433650001102447650001602458650001802474700002202492700003802514773013002552856008202682852000902764655001202773IND50067121120221119074254.0220206e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006712112DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-013-1581-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, Robert A.10aAnalysis of Consecutive Events for Nutrient and Sediment Treatment in Field-Monitored Bioretention Cells  ap. 1581.  aPrevious research demonstrated that nutrient treatment in conventionally drained bioretention cells is dependent upon temperature and varying wetting and drying regimes in the media. This study examines the influence that previous events have on outflow concentrations by analyzing flow-weighted composite samples from four to six consecutive events during three different seasons for two sets of field-monitored bioretention cells in Nashville, NC. The bioretention cells had different media depths (0.6-m versus 0.9-m). As a means to analyze performance from consecutive events, the evolution of cumulative pollutant loads was presented by plotting cumulative load versus cumulative volume. This method of presenting water quality data allows for the direct analysis of event mean concentrations, load reduction, and volume reduction with one graph, as well as describing the seasonal impacts and impacts from consecutive events. Runoff and outflow concentrations were also correlated to media temperature and rainfall characteristics. The overall results of this study showed that conventionally drained bioretention cells mainly convert organic nitrogen, the predominant source of nitrogen in runoff, into nitrate in the aerobic environment present in the media. Nitrate is then exported from the media during subsequent events. The greatest export occurred during the warmer months because higher media temperatures increased microbial activity. Pollen and leaf litter were identified as organic nitrogen and total phosphorus sources because of elevated runoff concentrations that occurred in the spring and autumn. Based on these results, future bioretention studies should strongly consider monitoring consecutive events and this method of data analysis, as they reveal internal processes and allow researchers to draw conclusions that independent event monitoring could not.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautumn 3abioretention areas 3adrying 3amicrobial activity 3amonitoring 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aphosphorus 3aplant litter 3apollen 3apollution load 3arain 3aresearchers 3arunoff 3asediments 3aspring 3atemperature 3awater quality1 aBirgand, Francois1 aHunt, W.

Because microbial processes, and their extracellular enzyme production, are dependent on the size of soil aggregates, we hypothesized that the effect of pesticides on enzyme activities is aggregate-size specific. We performed three experiments using an Andisol to test the interaction between carboxylesterase (CbE) activity and the organophosphate (OP) chlorpyrifos. First, we compared esterase activity among aggregates of different size spiked with chlorpyrifos (10mgkg−1 wet soil). Next, we examined the inhibition of CbE activity by chlorpyrifos and its metabolite chlorpyrifos-oxon in vitro to explore the aggregate size-dependent affinity of the pesticides for the active site of the enzyme. Lastly, we assessed the capability of CbEs to alleviate chlorpyrifos toxicity upon soil microorganisms. Our principal findings were: 1) CbE activity was significantly inhibited (30–67% of controls) in the microaggregates (< 0.25 mm size) and smallest macroaggregates (<1.0 – 0.25 mm), but did not change in the largest macroaggregates (>1.0 mm) compared with the corresponding controls (i.e., pesticide-free aggregates), 2) chlorpyrifos-oxon was a more potent CbE inhibitor than chlorpyrifos; however, no significant differences in the CbE inhibition were found between micro- and macroaggregates, and 3) dose-response relationships between CbE activity and chlorpyrifos concentrations revealed the capability of the enzyme to bind chlorpyrifos-oxon, which was dependent on the time of exposure. This chemical interaction resulted in a safeguarding mechanism against chlorpyrifos-oxon toxicity on soil microbial activity, as evidenced by the unchanged activity of dehydrogenase and related extracellular enzymes in the pesticide-treated aggregates. Taken together, these results suggest that environmental risk assessments of OP-polluted soils should consider the fractionation of soil in aggregates of different size to measure the CbE activity, and other potential soil enzyme activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAndisols 3acarboxylesterase 3achlorpyrifos 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenzyme activity 3afractionation 3amicroaggregates 3amicrobial activity 3arisk assessment 3asoil enzymes 3asoil microorganisms 3atoxicity 0aEsterase inhibition 0aDetoxification 0aOrganophosphorus 0aSoil aggregates 0aAndisol 0aED501 aSandoval, Marco0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2017, dElsevier Inc.x0147-65137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2017.04.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03550naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002000188245009100208300001100299506007600310520204900386592002802435506003702463650002202500650002402522650001202546650001202558650001502570650001002585650001302595650002302608650001402631650001702645650002202662650001102684650001402695700002002709700002202729700001902751700002302770700001802793700001902811700002002830773010402850856008102954852000903035655001203044IND60664399820221207084059.0190910e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066439982DNAL7 a10.1186/s12896-015-0146-82doi7 aPMC44722442pmcid7 a260845772pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDroste, Patrick10aStructural differences of amyloid-β fibrils revealed by antibodies from phage display  ap. 57.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Beside neurofibrillary tangles, amyloid plaques are the major histological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) being composed of aggregated fibrils of β-amyloid (Aβ). During the underlying fibrillogenic pathway, starting from a surplus of soluble Aβ and leading to mature fibrils, multiple conformations of this peptide appear, including oligomers of various shapes and sizes. To further investigate the fibrillization of β-amyloid and to have tools at hand to monitor the distribution of aggregates in the brain or even act as disease modulators, it is essential to develop highly sensitive antibodies that can discriminate between diverse aggregates of Aβ. RESULTS: Here we report the generation and characterization of a variety of amyloid-β specific human and human-like antibodies. Distinct fractions of monomers and oligomers of various sizes were separated by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) from Aβ42 peptides. These antigens were used for the generation of two Aβ42 specific immune scFv phage display libraries from macaque (Macaca fascicularis). Screening of these libraries as well as two naïve human phage display libraries resulted in multiple unique binders specific for amyloid-β. Three of the obtained antibodies target the N-terminal part of Aβ42 although with varying epitopes, while another scFv binds to the α-helical central region of the peptide. The affinities of the antibodies to various Aβ42 aggregates as well as their ability to interfere with fibril formation and disaggregation of preformed fibrils were determined. Most significantly, one of the scFv is fibril-specific and can discriminate between two different fibril forms resulting from variations in the acidity of the milieu during fibrillogenesis. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that the approach of animal immunization and subsequent phage display based antibody selection is applicable to generate highly specific anti β-amyloid scFvs that are capable of accurately discriminating between minute conformational differences.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAlzheimer disease 3aMacaca fascicularis 3aacidity 3aamyloid 3aantibodies 3abrain 3aepitopes 3agel chromatography 3ahistology 3aimmunization 3apeptide libraries 3aphages 3ascreening1 aFrenzel, André1 aSteinwand, Miriam1 aPelat, Thibaut1 aThullier, Philippe1 aHust, Michael1 aLashuel, Hilal1 aDübel, Stefan,0 tBMC biotechnology.g2015 Dec., v. 15, no. 1 p.57-57dBioMed CentralwJournal:19124x1472-67507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12896-015-0146-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01795naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245013100168300001800299520066600317592002800983650002501011650001101036650001901047650001801066650002301084650002301107650002701130650001401157700001401171700001601185700001501201700001701216773010601233856008501339852000901424655001201433IND60579458920221122194940.0170818e20170818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057945892DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.7b019892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Bingbing10aPalladium-Catalyzed Multicomponent Reactions of o-Alkynylanilines, Aryl Iodides, and CO2 toward 3,3-Diaryl 2,4-Quinolinediones  ap. 4319-4322.  aPalladium-catalyzed multicomponent reactions (MCRs) between o-alkynylanlines, aryl iodides, and atmospheric pressure of CO₂ are developed, affording a series of 3,3-diaryl 2,4-quinolinediones bearing a newly constructed quaternary carbon center in moderate to excellent yields.

We used citizen science data to assess the distribution and habitat usage of an irruptive migrant outside its core area of occurrence. We curated 50 years of citizen science data on Red crossbills (Loxia curvirostra) in Arkansas and field observations to 1) assess their distribution and habitat use outside their core area of occurrence, 2) determine if Red crossbills breed in Arkansas, 3) characterize the occurrence and abundance of Red crossbills in Arkansas, and 4) identify “call types” or ecotypes of Red crossbills present in Arkansas during 2017–18 irruption. We constructed a sample bias-corrected species distribution model using elevation, land cover type, and monthly temperature and precipitation as predictors for MaxEnt algorithm. The most significant predictors of Red crossbill distribution were land cover type, elevation, and precipitation of October. The probability of Red Crossbill occurrence was high in developed areas, areas with large water bodies, open areas, and evergreen forests. Red crossbills were found to breed in Arkansas based on field observations and historical records. The time-series captures the major irruption years within last 50 years in Arkansas. It also depicts months when the probability of finding Crossbills in Arkansas is highest. In addition, we documented four “call types” or ecotypes of Red crossbills in Arkansas, including type 1 and 4 that were previously unreported. Our study illustrates utility of citizen science observations for understanding the occurrence, distribution, and habitat use of difficult to study nomadic species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLoxia curvirostra 3aalgorithms 3acitizen science 3aecotypes 3ageographical distribution 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3aland cover 3amodels 3aprobability 3asurveys 3atemperature 3atime series analysis 3aArkansas 0aRed crossbill 0aEcotype 0aVocalization 0aNomadic species 0aMaxEnt1 aPanwar, Pooja1 aNeal, Joseph C.1 aYoung, Matthew A.0 tEcological informatics.g2021 Sept., v. 64 p.101377-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2190x1574-95417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2021.1013773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03598naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245016100187300001600348520167600364592002802040650002002068650001802088650003502106650001102141650001602152650002002168650003402188650002102222650001202243650002502255650001902280650001902299650001702318650001202335650002302347650002302370650002102393650001502414650001402429650005302443650002002496650002002516650002002536650000902556650001602565653001702581653001802598653001802616653002302634700002002657700002402677700002002701700002502721773013602746856008102882852000902963655001202972IND60650375720221120090930.0190710e20180128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065037572DNAL7 a292688002pmid7 a10.1017/S000711451700321X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliva, María E.10aDietary soya protein improves intra-myocardial lipid deposition and altered glucose metabolism in a hypertensive, dyslipidaemic, insulin-resistant rat model  ap. 131-142.  aThis study investigates the effects of replacing dietary casein by soya protein on the underlying mechanisms involved in the impaired metabolic fate of glucose and lipid metabolisms in the heart of dyslipidaemic rats chronically fed (8 months) a sucrose-rich (62·5 %) diet (SRD). To test this hypothesis, Wistar rats were fed an SRD for 4 months. From months 4 to 8, half the animals continued with the SRD and the other half were fed an SRD in which casein was substituted by soya. The control group received a diet with maize starch as the carbohydrate source. Compared with the SRD-fed group, the following results were obtained. First, soya protein significantly (P<0·001) reduced the plasma NEFA levels and normalised dyslipidaemia and glucose homoeostasis, improving insulin resistance. The protein levels of fatty acid translocase at basal state and under insulin stimulation and the protein levels and activity of muscle-type carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 were normalised. Second, a significant (P<0·001) reduction of TAG, long-chain acyl CoA and diacylglycerol levels was observed in the heart muscle. Third, soya protein significantly increased (P<0·01) GLUT4 protein level under insulin stimulation and normalised glucose phosphorylation and oxidation. A reduction of phosphorylated AMP protein kinase protein level was recorded without changes in uncoupling protein 2 and PPARα. Fourth, hydroxyproline concentration decreased in the left ventricle and hypertension was normalised. The new information provided shows the beneficial effects of soya protein upon the altered pathways of glucose and lipid metabolism in the heart muscle of this rat model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacyl coenzyme A 3aanimal models 3acarnitine palmitoyltransferase 3acasein 3acorn starch 3adiacylglycerols 3afatty acid transport proteins 3afree fatty acids 3aglucose 3aglucose transporters 3ahydroxyproline 3ahyperlipidemia 3ahypertension 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3alaboratory animals 3alipid metabolism 3amyocardium 3aoxidation 3aperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha 3aphosphorylation 3aprotein content 3aprotein kinases 3arats 3asoy protein 0aSoya protein 0aHeart muscles 0aDyslipidaemia 0aSucrose-rich diets1 aCreus, Agustina1 aFerreira, María R.1 aChicco, Adriana1 aLombardo, Yolanda B.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2018 Jan. 28, v. 119, no. 2 p.131-142dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45200x1475-26627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S000711451700321X3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03212naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001800192245009500210500001900305506007600324520161200400592002802012506003702040650003602077650001502113650002402128650001402152650001502166650001002181650001402191650001802205650001302223650003002236650001802266650001002284650001302294653002302307653001702330700005802347700002002405700002502425700001902450700001602469700002102485773009302506856008602599852000902685655001202694IND60690767720221207090252.0200508e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069076772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2018.e006162doi7 aPMC59681682pmcid7 a298623732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aToma, Claudia10aLeptospiral 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase as an early urinary biomarker of leptospirosis  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLeptospirosis, caused by spirochetes of the genus Leptospira, is a globally widespread, neglected and emerging zoonotic disease. The currently used diagnostic tests are time-consuming, require technical expertise or require the use of sophisticated equipment. Clinicians have pointed out the urgent need to develop a rapid test for the diagnosis of acute leptospirosis with a non-invasive and easy sampling method. In this study, we have focused on a leptospiral enzyme, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (3-HADH), as a urinary biomarker of acute leptospirosis. A specific antiserum for pathogenic Leptospira spp. was produced, targeting a peptide corresponding to amino acids 410 to 424 of 3-HADH. The antiserum was used to investigate whether 3-HADH is excreted in the urine by Western blotting. Among 70 suspected leptospirosis patients, 40 were laboratory confirmed by microscopic agglutination test (MAT) using paired sera samples and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In the acute phase of the laboratory-confirmed leptospirosis cases, sensitivity for 3-HADH, blood PCR and urine PCR were 52.5%, 57.5% and 12%, respectively. 3-HADH was detected from 2 days post-onset of illness (p.o) and could be detected at least until 9 days p.o. The combination of PCR and 3-HADH detection increased sensitivity of diagnosis to 100% in samples collected between 1 and 3 days p.o., and to 82% in samples collected between 4 and 9 days p.o. Our results suggested that the detection of 3-HADH can support a clinical diagnosis of leptospirosis, especially when serological methods are negative during the acute phase.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3a3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase 3aLeptospira 3aagglutination tests 3aantiserum 3abiomarkers 3ablood 3aequipment 3aleptospirosis 3apeptides 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arapid methods 3aurine 3azoonoses 0aInfectious disease 0aMicrobiology1 aKoizumi, Nobuo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5733-535X1 aKakita, Tetsuya1 aYamaguchi, Takayoshi1 aHermawan, Idam1 aHiga, Naomi1 aYamashiro, Tetsu0 tHeliyon.g2018 Apr., v. 4, no. 4 p.e00616-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2018.e006163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02227naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245007800161300002000239520108000259592002801339650002301367650002201390650002601412650001301438650000901451650002001460650001701480650002101497650001601518700001301534700001801547700002001565700002001585700001601605773012901621856008201750852000901832655001201841IND60576439920221118052058.0170804e20170713xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057643992DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b024752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Jiwei10aPressure and Temperature Study on the Structural Stability of GdNbO4:Eu3+  ap. 14787-14794.  aLanthanide niobate is an excellent nonlinear optical and high dielectric constant material. However, development and application of these novel properties depend on an understanding of its structural stability. In this work, Raman and luminescence spectra of GdNbO₄ with different Eu³⁺ ions doping concentrations under high pressure and low temperature were obtained. The evolution of Raman spectra indicated that an irreversible structural phase transition of GdNbO₄ from monoclinic phase to M′-fergusonite phase occurred at 6.2 GPa, and the phase transition was completed at about 13.1 GPa. An obvious discontinuity on Eu³⁺ ions luminescence intensity ratio between the ⁵D₀ → ⁷F₂ and the ⁵D₀ → ⁷F₁ transition lines was observed with increasing pressure. The results indicated that the site symmetry of Eu³⁺ ions in GdNbO₄:Eu³⁺ was changed, which was in agreement with high-pressure Raman spectra data. Meanwhile, Raman and luminescence spectra showed that the crystal structure remained stable in the temperature range of 20–300 K.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3acrystal structure 3adielectric properties 3aeuropium 3aions 3alight intensity 3aluminescence 3aphase transition 3atemperature1 aZhou, Ru1 aZhang, Jianwu1 aWang, Zhongping1 aZhang, Zengming1 aDing, Zejun0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2017 July 13, v. 121, no. 27 p.14787-14794dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.7b024753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02879naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002600142245010500168300002000273520147000293592002801763650002201791650001201813650002301825650001201848650001101860650002101871650001401892650001401906650001101920700002301931700006201954700002202016700006202038700002102100700005702121700005602178773014902234856007702383852000902460655001202469IND60754970220220218000000.0211027e20211018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075497022DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.1c086452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrinkmeier, Alexander10aModulation of a μ-1,2-Peroxo Dicopper(II) Intermediate by Strong Interaction with Alkali Metal Ions  ap. 17751-17760.  aThe properties of metal/dioxygen species, which are key intermediates in oxidation catalysis, can be modulated by interaction with redox-inactive Lewis acids, but structural information about these adducts is scarce. Here we demonstrate that even mildly Lewis acidic alkali metal ions, which are typically viewed as innocent “spectators”, bind strongly to a reactive cis-peroxo dicopper(II) intermediate. Unprecedented structural insight has now been obtained from X-ray crystallographic characterization of the “bare” Cuᴵᴵ₂(μ-η¹:η¹-O₂) motif and its Li⁺, Na⁺, and K⁺ complexes. UV–vis, Raman, and electrochemical studies show that the binding persists in MeCN solution, growing stronger in proportion to the cation’s Lewis acidity. The affinity for Li⁺ is surprisingly high (∼70 × 10⁴ M–¹), leading to Li⁺ extraction from its crown ether complex. Computational analysis indicates that the alkali ions influence the entire Cu-OO-Cu core, modulating the degree of charge transfer from copper to dioxygen. This induces significant changes in the electronic, magnetic, and electrochemical signatures of the Cu₂O₂ species. These findings have far-reaching implications for analyses of transient metal/dioxygen intermediates, which are often studied in situ, and they may be relevant to many (bio)chemical oxidation processes when considering the widespread presence of alkali cations in synthetic and natural environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacidity 3acatalytic activity 3acations 3acopper 3aelectrochemistry 3amagnetism 3aoxidation 3aoxygen1 aDalle, Kristian E.1 aD’Amore, Lorenzo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2245-19561 aSchulz, Roland A.1 aDechert, Sebastian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2864-24491 aDemeshko, Serhiy1 aSwart, Marcel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8174-84881 aMeyer, Franc1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8613-78620 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2021 Oct. 18, v. 143, no. 42 p.17751-17760dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c086453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04046naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005300153245011400206520245600320592002802776650001602804650002102820650001702841650001502858650001402873650002302887650000902910650001702919650001702936650001002953650002402963651001002987653002202997653001703019653001903036653002203055653001603077653002103093653001003114700001903124700001703143700001503160700001803175700005803193700001803251700001903269700001703288773011403305856008803419852000903507655001203516IND60731395420221118191706.0220606e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073139542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.prevetmed.2021.1053282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Hao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3932-401610aValue chain analysis of yellow broiler industry in Guangxi, China to inform H7N9 influenza control strategies  aYellow broilers are the primary source of poultry consumption in China and the predominant trade of live poultry. However, knowledge of the value chain is limited, which is vital evidence for the effective control of H7N9 and other zoonotic avian influenzas. The aim of the study was to map the yellow broiler value chain in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China and investigate its governance structure and practices relevant to the risk of H7N9 transmission. A value chain analysis was conducted in five areas of Guangxi from May to August 2018. To map the value chain, three focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted and stakeholders, products and premises involved and their interactions were identified. Then, 55 key informant interviews (KIIs) collected qualitative data on stakeholders’ profile, practices and interactions with other stakeholders and rules/norms that exist along the value chain. On-site observations were also carried out at different types of premises along the value chain to complement and validate findings of KIIs and FGDs. Participants were also asked to provide proportional estimates of each component in the value chain where possible. The qualitative data from FGDs, KIIs and on-site observations were analysed to create stakeholder profiles and a diagram of product flows and stakeholders’ interactions. Thematic analysis was used to identify the governance structure of the value chains and practices relevant to the risk of H7N9 transmission. The stakeholders and premises involved in Guangxi yellow broiler production, wholesale and retail were described, as well as their interactions. Contract farming is extensively adopted in Guangxi; consequently yellow broiler grower companies are the dominant stakeholders. The trading platform was identified as a key premise linking farms and live bird markets. The thematic analysis highlighted poor biosecurity practices in different premises along the value chain, which was supported by on-site observations. The operation of trading platforms reported in this study presents a disease risk but is not considered in the current H7N9 control programs. The study suggested that biosecurity management gaps need to be addressed through government-industry partnerships that require engagement with private stakeholders in the planning and implementation of H7N9 control strategies incentivising participation of grower companies, wholesalers and retailers.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosecurity 3achicken industry 3afocus groups 3agovernance 3ainfluenza 3apoultry production 3arisk 3astakeholders 3asupply chain 3atrade 3aveterinary medicine 3aChina 0aInfluenza A virus 0aH7N9 subtype 0aYellow broiler 0aLive bird markets 0aValue chain 0aControl strategy 0aChina1 aShen, Chaojian1 aZou, Lianbin1 aCai, Chang1 aEdwards, John1 aBruce, Mieghan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3176-20941 aWang, Youming1 aRobertson, Ian1 aHuang, Baoxu0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2021 May, v. 190 p.105328-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34182x0167-58777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2021.1053283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02216naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245010900163300001600272520113500288592002801423650001201451650001901463650001901482650001601501650001201517650001701529650001401546650001301560650001201573651001001585700001701595700002401612700002001636773009601656856008101752852000901833655001201842IND60583302420221120022952.0171010e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058330242DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-016-1695-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yong10a500-yr. precipitation variability in Southern Taihang Mountains, China, and its linkages to ENSO and PDO  ap. 419-432.  aAn annually resolved and absolutely dated ring-width chronology spanning 657 yrs. is constructed with Whitebark pine (Pinus bungeana Zucc.) samples from the southern Taihang Mountains, Eastern China. On the basis of a significant correlation between the tree-ring width index and observed instrumental data, precipitation in current May is reconstructed for the region since AD 1510, with predictor variables accounting for 37.9 % of the variance in precipitation data. In agreement with other drought reconstructions, notable dry spells occur in the 1630s–1650s, 1680s–1700s, and 1770s–1800s, whereas wet periods prevail in the 1530s–1570s, 1840s–1870s, and 1950s-present. Wavelet analysis reveals clear 2–8, 20–40, and 80–130 yrs cycles at the 95 % confidence level for the reconstructed series over the past 500 yrs, suggesting possible linkages with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Correlation analysis between the tree-ring series, ENSO, and PDO index further demonstrates that precipitation is negatively correlated with PDO and ENSO in the long term.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3aPinus bungeana 3aclimate change 3acorrelation 3adrought 3agrowth rings 3amountains 3avariance 3awavelet 3aChina1 aTian, Qinhua1 aGuillet, Sébastien1 aStoffel, Markus0 tClimatic change.g2017 Oct., v. 144, no. 3 p.419-432dSpringer Netherlandsx0165-00097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-016-1695-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02468naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012300164300001400287520119900301592002801500650001601528650001201544650001601556650001701572650001501589650001601604650001101620650002001631650001901651650001301670650002001683650001801703650001401721650002001735650001801755650001101773700001701784700001601801700001701817773009801834856008101932852000902013655001202022IND60085433620221122231439.0141101e20120415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008543362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bej.2011.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSikder, Jaya10aTechno-economic analysis of a membrane-integrated bioreactor system for production of lactic acid from sugarcane juice  ap. 81-87.  aEconomic evaluation of a membrane-integrated bioreactor system for lactic acid production from sugarcane juice was performed. The production process consisted of sterilization, fermentation, microfiltration, nanofiltration and final concentration by vacuum evaporation. Membrane recycle fermentor operating at a cell concentration of 22g/L resulted in a productivity of 53g/Lh with a lactic acid concentration of 106g/L and a yield of 0.96. The membrane units (cross-flow microfiltration and nanofiltration) and pump contribute about 2% to the total fixed capital cost whereas fermentation unit along with holding tank contribute about 36% to the total fixed capital cost. The two largest cost components were raw material and yeast extract costs contributing about 6% and 87% respectively to the total operating cost. Total product cost stood at 3.15 US $/kg of 80% (w/w) concentrated and 95% pure lactic acid. The study reveals that operating cost could be reduced further by using a cheaper nitrogen source like silk worm larvae or yeast autolysate and installing the lactic acid plant in the sugarcane-growing areas or by optimizing the recycle of nanofiltration retentate to the fermentor.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioreactors 3acapital 3aevaporation 3afermentation 3afermenters 3alactic acid 3alarvae 3amicrofiltration 3ananofiltration 3anitrogen 3aoperating costs 3araw materials 3asilkworms 3asugarcane juice 3ayeast extract 3ayeasts1 aRoy, Mousumi1 aDey, Pinaki1 aPal, Parimal0 tBiochemical engineering journal.g2012 Apr. 15, v. 63 p.81-87dElsevier B.V.x1369-703X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bej.2011.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01219naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245002200158300001800180520028500198592002800483650002300511650002800534650002200562650002200584650002200606700002300628700002700651700002500678773011800703856007500821852000900896655001200905IND60550338620221121225302.0160910e20140404xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055033862DNAL7 a10.1021/jo500458y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFallon, Thomas10aFuranodendralenes  ap. 3185-3193.  aAn examination of Diels–Alder reactions of furan-containing analogues of dendralenes has revealed complex and fascinating reaction sequences, which chart the inherent site and stereoselectivity of these processes and give rapid access to structures of high molecular complexity.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical structure 3acycloaddition reactions 3aorganic chemistry 3aorganic compounds 3astereoselectivity1 aWillis, Anthony

To support the degradation hypothesis, a microcosm experiment was conducted where a mixture of naturally weathered plastic pieces was incubated with an indigenous pelagic community. A series of analyses were employed in order to describe the alteration of the physicochemical characteristics of the polymer (FTIR, SEC and GPC, sinking velocity) as well as the biofilm community (NGS). At the end of phase II, the fraction of double bonds in the surface of microbially treated PE films increased while changes were also observed in the profile of the PS films. The molecular weight of PE pieces increased with incubation time reaching the molecular weight of the virgin pieces (230,000 g mol−1) at month 5 but the buoyancy displayed no difference throughout the experimental period. The number-average molecular weight of PS pieces decreased (33% and 27% in INDG and BIOG treatment respectively), implying chain scission; accelerated (by more than 30%) sinking velocities compared to the initial weathered pieces were also measured for PS films with biofilm on their surface. The orders Rhodobacterales, Oceanospirillales and Burkholderiales dominated the distinct platisphere communities and the genera Bacillus and Pseudonocardia discriminate these assemblages from the planktonic counterpart. The functional analysis predicts overrepresentation of adhesive cells carrying xenobiotic and hydrocarbon degradation genes. Taking these into account, we can suggest that tailored marine consortia have the ability to thrive in the presence of mixtures of plastics and participate in their degradation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBurkholderiales 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aOceanospirillales 3aPseudonocardia 3aRhodobacterales 3abiodegradation 3abiofilm 3achemical bonding 3acleavage (chemistry) 3agenes 3amolecular weight 3aplankton 3aplastic film 3aplastics 3axenobiotics 0aPlastic 0aBiodegradation 0aMarine community 0aPolyethylene (PE) 0aPolystyrene (PS)1 aKarkanorachaki, Katerina1 aAmorotti, Filippo1 aAvgeropoulos, Apostolos1 aKolvenbach, Boris1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3491-90261 aZhou, Ning-Yi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5830-04901 aFava, Fabio1 aCorvini, Philippe F.-X.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2991-50311 aKalogerakis, Nicolas1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7033-03020 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2019 Aug. 05, v. 375 p.33-42dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.04.0783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02083naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245007000164300001400234500001400248520112200262592002801384650001301412650001401425650003201439650002301471650001401494650001201508650001301520650001601533700001801549773009201567856007701659852000901736655001201745IND60689954020221117231412.0200424e20100101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068995402DNAL7 a10.4161/fly.4.1.106522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKünnapuu, Jaana10aEvolutional imprints on the sequences of BMP2/4/DPP type proteins  ap. 21-23.  aNAL-light  aDecapentaplegic (DPP) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) -2 and -4 type ligands form a branch of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily. They play prominent roles in metazoan developmental processes as diverse as cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation and cell-fate determination. Maturation of the BMP2/4/DPP type proteins requires proteolytic cleavage of their proproteins by furin-type proprotein convertases (PCs). Even though cleavage of the prodomain is critical for signaling, much less attention has been paid to the role of proteolytic processing. Our studies suggest that the cleavage sites of BMP2/4/DPP type proteins have been diversified and can be categorized into at least four different types. These findings indicate that the cleavage sites in BMP2/4/DPP prodomains are tolerant to mutations acquired through evolution and have adapted to diversified environments among species. These results provide insights for further studies of evolution and molecular diversity. In this Extra View we discuss the evolutional variation seen in the sequences of BMP2/4/DPP type proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnimalia 3aapoptosis 3abone morphogenetic proteins 3acell proliferation 3aevolution 3aligands 3amutation 3aproteolysis1 aShimmi, Osamu0 tFly.g2010 Jan. 1, v. 4, no. 1 p.21-23dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2251x1933-69427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/fly.4.1.106523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03031naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245009900169300001600268520192000284592002802204650001202232650002302244650002102267650001102288650001602299650001302315700001802328700002202346700002302368700001802391700002102409700002002430700001902450773009802469856008102567852000902648655001202657IND60572554520221119210538.0171116e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057255452DNAL7 a10.1007/s13595-016-0590-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaarela, Svetlana10aHierarchical model-based inference for forest inventory utilizing three sources of information  ap. 895-910.  a∙ KEY MESSAGE : The study presents novel model-based estimators for growing stock volume and its uncertainty estimation, combining a sparse sample of field plots, a sample of laser data, and wall-to-wall Landsat data. On the basis of our detailed simulation, we show that when the uncertainty of estimating mean growing stock volume on the basis of an intermediate ALS model is not accounted for, the estimated variance of the estimator can be biased by as much as a factor of three or more, depending on the sample size at the various stages of the design. ∙ CONTEXT : This study concerns model-based inference for estimating growing stock volume in large-area forest inventories, combining wall-to-wall Landsat data, a sample of laser data, and a sparse subsample of field data. ∙ AIMS : We develop and evaluate novel estimators and variance estimators for the population mean volume, taking into account the uncertainty in two model steps. ∙ METHODS : Estimators and variance estimators were derived for two main methodological approaches and evaluated through Monte Carlo simulation. The first approach is known as two-stage least squares regression, where Landsat data were used to predict laser predictor variables, thus emulating the use of wall-to-wall laser data. In the second approach laser data were used to predict field-recorded volumes, which were subsequently used as response variables in modeling the relationship between Landsat and field data. RESULTS : ∙ The estimators and variance estimators are shown to be at least approximately unbiased. Under certain assumptions the two methods provide identical results with regard to estimators and similar results with regard to estimated variances. ∙ CONCLUSION : We show that ignoring the uncertainty due to one of the models leads to substantial underestimation of the variance, when two models are involved in the estimation procedure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aMonte Carlo method 3aforest inventory 3amodels 3auncertainty 3avariance1 aHolm, Søren,1 aGrafström, Anton1 aSchnell, Sebastian1 aNæsset, Erik1 aGregoire, T.

Outbreaks of the disease were recently reported in Canada, causing serious concerns to the grape/wine industry. Reliable, sensitive and timely detection is key to the control of the disease. However, information on their seasonal dynamics and tissue distribution under cool climate conditions has been rather limited. We conducted a two-year comprehensive study to elucidate the temporal variation and spatial distribution of both viruses through symptom monitoring, Western blotting and RT-qPCR. Sampling was done monthly from commercial Cabernet Franc and Chardonnay vines from May to October in 2015 and 2016. Both viral RNA and capsid protein levels in leaves remained low during May and June, steadily increased from late July, and peaked in September or October. Interestingly, young berries collected in June contained high levels of viral RNA for both viruses. As expected, the viral RNA levels of GLRaV-2 detected by RT-qPCR using primers targeting the CP region were much higher than those by using primers targeting the genomic RNA. Surprisingly, virtually the same levels of viral RNA were detected for GLRaV-3 regardless of the targeted genomic regions. To ensure accurate detection of both viruses, we recommend using young berries early in the season and leaves and cambial scrapings from late July to harvest. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the seasonal dynamics and tissue distribution of two major grapevine viruses in Canada.  aPublisher supplied data  aDiscovery and Engage grant programscNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada 3aGrapevine leafroll-associated virus 2 3aRNA 3aVitis 3acambium 3aclimatic factors 3acoat proteins 3agenomics 3agrapes 3aplant pathology 3atemporal variation 3atissue distribution 3awine industry 3aCanada1 aXiao, Huogen1 aMeng, Baozhong0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2020 Dec., v. 158, no. 4 p.1017-1031dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl51791x0929-18737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-020-02137-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04031naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002200186245008500208300001600293500002000309506007600329520229700405592002802702506003702730650004202767650003802809650001302847650001102860650001202871650001002883650001402893650001802907650001302925650001402938650001602952650003102968650001102999650001403010650001203024650000903036650000903045650000803054650001003062700002303072700003103095700002103126700001803147700002103165700001803186700001503204700002203219773010003241856007903341852000903420655001203429IND60571790820221207100250.0170712e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057179082DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2435.127602doi7 aPMC53245412pmcid7 a282863542pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPreece, Catherine10aHow did the domestication of Fertile Crescent grain crops increase their yields?  ap. 387-397.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe origins of agriculture, 10 000 years ago, led to profound changes in the biology of plants exploited as grain crops, through the process of domestication. This special case of evolution under cultivation led to domesticated cereals and pulses requiring humans for their dispersal, but the accompanying mechanisms causing higher productivity in these plants remain unknown. The classical view of crop domestication is narrow, focusing on reproductive and seed traits including the dispersal, dormancy and size of seeds, without considering whole‐plant characteristics. However, the effects of initial domestication events can be inferred from consistent differences between traditional landraces and their wild progenitors. We studied how domestication increased the yields of Fertile Crescent cereals and pulses using a greenhouse experiment to compare landraces with wild progenitors. We grew eight crops: barley, einkorn and emmer wheat, oat, rye, chickpea, lentil and pea. In each case, comparison of multiple landraces with their wild progenitors enabled us to quantify the effects of domestication rather than subsequent crop diversification. To reveal the mechanisms underpinning domestication‐linked yield increases, we measured traits beyond those classically associated with domestication, including the rate and duration of growth, reproductive allocation, plant size and also seed mass and number. Cereal and pulse crops had on average 50% higher yields than their wild progenitors, resulting from a 40% greater final plant size, 90% greater individual seed mass and 38% less chaff or pod material, although this varied between species. Cereal crops also had a higher seed number per spike compared with their wild ancestors. However, there were no differences in growth rate, total seed number, proportion of reproductive biomass or the duration of growth. The domestication of Fertile Crescent crops resulted in larger seed size leading to a larger plant size, and also a reduction in chaff, with no decrease in seed number per individual, which proved a powerful package of traits for increasing yield. We propose that the important steps in the domestication process should be reconsidered, and the domestication syndrome broadened to include a wider range of traits.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aTriticum monococcum subsp. monococcum 3aTriticum turgidum subsp. dicoccon 3aancestry 3abarley 3abiomass 3achaff 3achickpeas 3adomestication 3adormancy 3aevolution 3agrain crops 3agreenhouse experimentation 3ahumans 3alandraces 3alentils 3aoats 3apeas 3arye 3aseeds1 aLivarda, Alexandra1 aChristin, Pascal‐Antoine1 aWallace, Michael1 aMartin, Gemma1 aCharles, Michael1 aJones, Glynis1 aRees, Mark1 aOsborne, Colin P.0 tFunctional ecology.g2017 Feb., v. 31, no. 2 p.387-397dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0269-84637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.127603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03873naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006600151245011500217520213700332592002802469650001702497650001602514650001102530650001502541650000902556650001902565650001502584651001802599651001202617653001602629653002502645653001902670653001402689653002202703653002102725653002602746653002302772700006402795700001802859700002002877700002402897700005602921700002102977700002302998700001903021700001903040700002703059700001703086700002003103773010103123856008603224852000903310655001203319IND60717698620221121000834.0210708e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071769862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.1071512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUrbina-Barreto, Isabel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2592-840910aQuantifying the shelter capacity of coral reefs using photogrammetric 3D modeling: From colonies to reefscapes  aStructural complexity plays a key role in the functioning of coral reef ecosystems. Reef-building corals are major contributors to this complexity, providing shelter and food for numerous invertebrates and fish species. Both structural complexity and shelter capacity of reefscapes are determined by several components such as spurs and grooves, slope, caves and holes, vegetation and coral colonies. Quantifying the shelter capacity from coral colonies to reefscapes is a fundamental step to estimating ecosystem potential to support biodiversity. Here, we applied underwater photogrammetry to quantify shelter volumes provided by individual coral colonies. Overall, 120 3D models of coral colonies from branching, massive, columnar and tabular growth forms were studied. Three reefscapes were also 3D modeled. The study encompasses three Indo-Pacific Islands: Reunion, Europa and New Caledonia. At the colony level, measurements of diameter, planar area, surface and shelter volume were computed. At the reefscape, the diameter and planar area of each colony were extracted from orthomosaics and then used to estimate shelter capacity. Linear models had high accuracy for predicting shelter volume (a 3D metric) from 2D metrics: the diameter= 83.1%, R²= 0.95; the planar area= 87.5%, R²= 0.95 and the colony surface= 87.3%, R²= 0.96. The surface complexity and the shelter volume of the colonies allowed inferring the size of shelters provided by coral growth forms. Quantitative descriptors (i.e. relative percentage of shelter by growth form, the abundance of coral colonies, “Shannon-Shelter Index”) revealed reefscape-scale shelter differences.Our major finding is that planar area and diameter of coral colonies are satisfactory proxies for estimating shelter volume. These new proxies allow 2D metrics to quantify 3D shelter provision, which can support scientists and managers in conservation actions since such metrics are widely used in monitoring programs. Future investigations on the relationships between shelter provision and reef biodiversity will improve the understanding of these complex ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3acoral reefs 3acorals 3aecosystems 3afish 3aphotogrammetry 3avegetation 3aNew Caledonia 3aReunion 0aCoral reefs 0aReef-building corals 0aPhotogrammetry 0a3D models 0aPredictive models 0aShelter capacity 0aStructural complexity 0aCoral growth forms1 aChiroleu, Frédéric1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4874-53571 aPinel, Romain1 aFréchon, Louis1 aMahamadaly, Vincent1 aElise, Simon1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4697-44981 aKulbicki, Michel1 aQuod, Jean Pascal,1 aDutrieux, Eric1 aGarnier, Rémi1 aHenrich Bruggemann, J.1 aPenin, Lucie1 aAdjeroud, Mehdi0 tEcological indicators.g2021 Feb., v. 121 p.107151-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.1071513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02234naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245009900165300001400264500001400278520118700292592002801479650001501507650001101522650001001533650001101543650003001554650001001584650001201594650001501606650001401621650001001635650001601645700002101661773009201682856007701774852000901851655001201860IND60689954120221117231402.0200424e20100101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068995412DNAL7 a10.4161/fly.4.1.107202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Celis, Jose F.12aA cautionary tale on genetic screens based on a gain-of-expression approach: The case of LanB1  ap. 24-29.  aNAL-light  aGain of function screens have being frequently used to search for genes affecting a particular adult character or developmental process. These experiments are made possible by the adoption of the Gal4/UAS system to flies, and by the design of P elements bearing UAS sequences. We recently published two screens in which a large number of newly generated P-UAS insertions were crossed with Gal4 drivers expressed in the pupal veins and in the central region of the wing disc. From the data obtained in these and other screens, it seems that a gain-of-function phenotype is a rare occurrence observed only for about 5–8% of insertion sites. Insertions affecting the expression of signaling molecules were particularly enriched in the screens. In contrast, gain-of-function phenotypes due to insertions not belonging to this class appear to be caused by multiple protein-specific mechanisms that could only be unraveled after extensive analysis. We present some data concerning the overexpression of LamB1, a gene encoding the B subunit of Laminin trimers in Drosophila, and show that Notch protein subcellular localization and signaling is compromised in cells overexpressing LanB1.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila 3aadults 3acells 3adesign 3again-of-function mutation 3agenes 3alaminin 3aoccurrence 3aphenotype 3apupae 3atransposons1 aMolnar, Cristina0 tFly.g2010 Jan. 1, v. 4, no. 1 p.24-29dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2251x1933-69427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/fly.4.1.107203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03387naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245011400167300001600281520190700297592002802204650002302232650001602255650001102271650001602282650002802298650001302326650001002339650001802349650001502367650001302382650001702395650000902412650002502421650002602446651001402472653002702486653001302513653001402526653001702540653002002557700002002577700001702597700001502614700001702629700002302646773010902669856008202778852000902860655001202869IND60621908520221120164516.0181121e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062190852DNAL7 a10.1177/1564826514035002022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHtet, Min Kyaw10aHepcidin Profile of Anemic Adolescent Schoolgirls in Indonesia at the End of 12 Weeks of Iron Supplementation  ap. 160-166.  aIron deficiency is still the major nutritional problem in the developing world, and iron supplementation remains one of the most effective intervention strategies. Hepcidin, a newly discovered iron regulatory hormone, is an acute phase protein, and its role in iron supplementation has not been well explored. To investigate the hepcidin profiles of anemic adolescent girls who had received weekly iron supplementation. A cross-sectional study was conducted at the end of iron supplementation among adolescent schoolgirls (n = 83) in Pramuka Island, Indonesia. All the girls were anemic at the beginning and received 60 mg of elemental iron twice weekly for 12 weeks. Hemoglobin, hepcidin, serum ferritin, and red cell parameters were measured, together with inflammation markers. At the end of the 12-week supplementation, 65.1% (n=64) of the girls were no longer anemic, but 43.4% (n = 36) were still iron deficient. The rate of sub-clinical inflammation, measured by C-reactive protein (CRP) and α-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP), was 38.6% (n = 32). Hepcidin was not correlated with either ferritin or red cell parameters. There was no association between hepcidin and the inflammatory markers CRP and AGP. The mean hepcidin concentration was 42.9 ± 17.9 ng/mL and was not significantly different between anemic and nonanemic girls (44.2 ± 14.9 and 42.3 ± 19.2 ng/mL, respectively; p = .708). However, hepcidin concentration was slightly higher in the iron replete-group than in the iron-deficient group (45.2 ± 20.0 and 39.3 ± 13.5 ng/mL, respectively), a suggestive trend that did not reach statistical significance (p = .218). Hepcidin concentrations tended to be higher among the subset of girls who responded poorly to iron supplementation as a consequence of increased subclinical inflammation. A longitudinal study should be conducted to explore the role of hepcidin in iron supplementation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC-reactive protein 3aadolescents 3aanemia 3ablood serum 3across-sectional studies 3aferritin 3agirls 3aglycoproteins 3ahemoglobin 3ahepcidin 3ainflammation 3airon 3alongitudinal studies 3anutrient deficiencies 3aIndonesia 0aAdolescent schoolgirls 0ahepcidin 0aIndonesia 0ainflammation 0airon deficiency1 aDillon, Drupadi1 aRosida, Azma1 aTiman, Ina1 aFahmida, Umi1 aThurnham, David I.0 tFood and nutrition bulletin.g, v. 35, no. 2 p.160-166dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2034x0379-57217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1564826514035002023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03880naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245012000174520253400294592002802828650002602856650001702882650001502899650003002914650003202944650001302976651001002989651002102999651001003020651001003030653002203040653002003062653001103082653002303093653001803116653002403134700001903158700002203177700002203199700001703221773010103238856008603339852000903425655001203434IND60717698720221121011356.0210708e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071769872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.1071522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKandel, Pratikshya10aEcosystem services research trends in the water tower of Asia: A bibliometric analysis from the Hindu Kush Himalaya  aThe study presents the first comprehensive overview of ecosystem services (ES) research from the Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH), a region often referred to as the ‘water tower of Asia’. Through a systematic literature search, we consolidated 439 peer-reviewed journal articles related to ecosystem services in the HKH. A bibliometric analysis was carried out to examine the temporal trend, geographical distribution, journal coverage, keywords used, authorship patterns, and collaboration networks in ES research on the region. The results showed an increasing trend in the publication of ecosystem services research on the HKH, with nearly 62 per cent of the journal articles being published in just the last five years. Most of the research has been carried out in China, followed by Nepal and India. Among the 166 scholarly journals publishing ecosystem services research on the HKH, Ecosystem Services and Sustainability are the most-used, followed by Science of the Total Environment. The keywords analysis identified a total of 1,460 keywords used in the articles on ES. Among them, ‘ecosystem services’ is the most commonly used, followed by ‘China’, ‘Nepal’, conservation’, and ‘biodiversity.’ The authorship analysis revealed that of the total of 1,386 authors, 1,000 co-authored ES publications. The top publishing authors are from the region; however, they are either affiliated with an international organization or based in developed countries. Research institutions from 56 countries have networked to conduct collaborative ES research in the HKH, so far. Although China has the highest number of publications, Nepal was identified as a principal collaborator with the widest country network. The existing research focuses on biophysical elements of ecosystem services, with very few published studies covering its social and political aspects and the management of ecosystem services. As the HKH is a contiguous ecosystem shared by eight countries, there is a need for regional analyses of ecosystem services. Our study concludes that ecosystem services being a multidisciplinary concept, research into it requires regional collaboration between multiple actors from varied disciplines, with a greater emphasis on social and political science, together with the biophysical sciences, for a more holistic understanding. Furthermore, it is important that ES research include the local context and issues to avoid the dominance of international perspectives and the marginalization of local concerns.  aPublisher supplied data 3abibliometric analysis 3abiodiversity 3aecosystems 3ageographical distribution 3ainternational organizations 3apolitics 3aChina 3aHimalayan region 3aIndia 3aNepal 0aSystematic review 0aResearch trends 0aScopus 0aEcosystem services 0aResearch gaps 0aHindu Kush Himalaya1 aChettri, Nakul1 aChaudhary, Sunita1 aSharma, Prashanti1 aKabir Uddin,0 tEcological indicators.g2021 Feb., v. 121 p.107152-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.1071523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01555naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245011400165520031000279592002800589650001000617650001500627650001900642650001800661653002100679653001500700653001000715653003600725700001700761700001400778700001600792700001900808700001400827700001600841700001800857700001500875700001900890700001700909773011400926856008401040852000901124655001201133IND60731395620221118191732.0210423e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073139562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mimet.2021.1062022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhen, Biao,10aRapid detection of fungi from blood samples of patients with candidemia using modified calcofluor white stain  aWe reported a modified CFW assay for rapid detection of fungi in blood samples and evaluated its efficacy in vivo and in vitro.

In order to lead surface-initiated polymerization and introduce structural similarity between a SiO₂ surface and polymer, the surface of the SiO₂ nanoparticles are modified with [3-(methacryloyloxy)propyl]trimethoxysilane. The modified SiO₂ nanoparticle dispersed in trimethylolpropane triacrylate (TPT) is converted to a SiO₂–PTPT nanocomposite under UV irradiation. Because SiO₂ incorporated in a polymer generates a tortuous path and absorbs a water molecule, the SiO₂–PTPT nanocomposite shows a considerably lower water vapor transmission rate than PTPT. All of the nanocomposite films are highly transparent (over 98%) in the visible region before and after humidity aging tests. Furthermore, a light-emitting diode encapsulated by a 20 wt % SiO₂–PTPT nanocomposite exhibits a considerably longer lifetime in the accelerated aging condition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccelerated aging 3aencapsulation 3aengineering 3ahumidity 3alight emitting diodes 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3asilica 3aultraviolet radiation 3awater vapor1 aKo, Jieun1 aYin, Zhenxing1 aKim, Young-Jae1 aKim, Youn Sang0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2016 Sept. 07, v. 55, no. 35 p.9433-9439dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.iecr.6b014703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02391naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002600149245012500175300001600300506007600316520075200392592002801144506003701172650003001209650001101239650001801250650001301268650002001281650001801301650001701319650003301336650001201369653001701381653002501398653002401423653002501447653002201472700001801494700002101512700002301533700001801556700002901574700002301603700002301626700001901649773008901668856008401757990002301841852000901864655001201873IND60697565820221207073302.0220902e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069756582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virol.2018.06.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPíchalová, Růžena10aConserved cysteines in Mason–Pfizer monkey virus capsid protein are essential for infectious mature particle formation  ap. 108-117.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRetrovirus assembly is driven mostly by Gag polyprotein oligomerization, which is mediated by inter and intra protein–protein interactions among its capsid (CA) domains. Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (M-PMV) CA contains three cysteines (C82, C193 and C213), where the latter two are highly conserved among most retroviruses. To determine the importance of these cysteines, we introduced mutations of these residues in both bacterial and proviral vectors and studied their impact on the M-PMV life cycle. These studies revealed that the presence of both conserved cysteines of M-PMV CA is necessary for both proper assembly and virus infectivity. Our findings suggest a crucial role of these cysteines in the formation of infectious mature particles.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMason-Pfizer monkey virus 3acapsid 3acoat proteins 3amutation 3aoligomerization 3apathogenicity 3apolyproteins 3aprotein-protein interactions 3aviruses 0aM-PMV capsid 0aCysteine mutagenesis 0aRetrovirus assembly 0aVirus core stability 0aM-PMV infectivity1 aFüzik, Tibor1 aVokatá, Barbora1 aRumlová, Michaela1 aLlano, Manuel1 aDostálková, Alžběta,1 aKřížová, Ivana1 aRuml, T.q(Tomas),1 aUlbrich, Pavel0 tVirology.g2018 Aug., v. 521 p.108-117dElsevier Inc.wJournal:2802x0042-68227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2018.06.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02695naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001500180245016800195300001600363506007600379520141500455592002801870506003701898650001601935650001701951650004601968650003502014650001302049700002002062700002402082700001902106773012602125856007302251852000902324655001202333IND60529617820221207094216.0160717e20140107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052961782DNAL7 a10.1021/ac40332142doi7 aPMC39087712pmcid7 a243138062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Huilin10aNative Top-Down Electrospray Ionization-Mass Spectrometry of 158 kDa Protein Complex by High-Resolution Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry  ap. 317-320.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR MS) delivers high resolving power, mass measurement accuracy, and the capabilities for unambiguously sequencing by a top-down MS approach. Here, we report isotopic resolution of a 158 kDa protein complex, tetrameric aldolase with an average absolute deviation of 0.36 ppm and an average resolving power of ∼520 000 at m/z 6033 for the 26+ charge state in magnitude mode. Phase correction further improves the resolving power and average absolute deviation by 1.3-fold. Furthermore, native top-down electron capture dissociation (ECD) enables the sequencing of 168 C-terminal amino acid (AA) residues out of 463 total AAs. Combining the data from top-down MS of native and denatured aldolase complexes, a total of 56% of the total backbone bonds were cleaved. The observation of complementary product ion pairs confirms the correctness of the sequence and also the accuracy of the mass fitting of the isotopic distribution of the aldolase tetramer. Top-down MS of the native protein provides complementary sequence information to top-down ECD and collisonally activated dissociation (CAD) MS of the denatured protein. Moreover, native top-down ECD of aldolase tetramer reveals that ECD fragmentation is not limited only to the flexible regions of protein complexes and that regions located on the surface topology are prone to ECD cleavage.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aamino acids 3adissociation 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3afructose-bisphosphate aldolase 3atopology1 aWolff, JeremyJ.1 aVan Orden, Steve L.1 aLoo, Joseph A.0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2014 Jan. 07, v. 86, no. 1 p.317-320dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ac40332143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02572naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009000169300001600259520136900275592002801644650001601672650002401688650001701712650002001729650001801749650002301767650001301790650001501803650001401818650002201832700001501854700001401869700001501883700001801898700001801916700001701934773011701951856008502068852000902153655001202162IND60696130220221120212124.0200522e20200817xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069613022DNAL7 a10.1080/01635581.2019.16615012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiao, Weizhou10aPrognostic Value of Prealbumin in Liver Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis  ap. 909-916.  aAccumulated studies have reported the prognostic significance of prealbumin in liver cancer, but the results were not conclusive. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between pretreatment serum prealbumin and clinical outcome of liver cancer patients through a meta-analysis. We comprehensively searched EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science and the Cochrane library to identify eligible studies. The pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were utilized to evaluate the prognostic value of pretreatment serum prealbumin in overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) of liver cancer patients. A total of 3470 patients from 10 eligible studies were finally included for analysis. The combined effects of prealbumin on liver cancer patients’ OS and RFS were HR = 1.83, 95% CI: 1.46–2.30, P < 0.001 and HR = 1.47, 95% CI: 1.01–2.14, P = 0.045, respectively. Sensitivity and subgroup analysis showed that the pooled HR of prealbumin on liver cancer patients’ OS was stable. Since potential publication bias was identified in the OS studies, the trim-and-fill method therefore was performed to explore publication bias, and the results showed reliability. This meta-analysis shows that low pretreatment serum prealbumin is significantly associated with poor prognosis of liver cancer patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3aconfidence interval 3ahazard ratio 3aliver neoplasms 3ameta-analysis 3anutritional status 3apatients 3aprealbumin 3aprognosis 3asystematic review1 aLeng, Feng1 aLiu, Tong1 aWang, Xuan1 aWang, Yueying1 aChen, Dongjie1 aWei, Jinlong0 tNutrition and cancer.g2020 Aug. 17, v. 72, no. 6 p.909-916dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl11654x1532-79147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01635581.2019.16615013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03028naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245009700160300001600257520167900273592002801952650002501980650002302005650001302028650002102041650001702062650002302079650002202102650001102124650001902135650002802154650001402182650001202196650001102208650002002219650001302239653001502252653001902267653001802286700001902304700002102323773014302344856007402487852000902561655001202570IND60687113220221120175145.0200325e20191005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068711322DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/toz2612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDelgarm, Najmeh10aEnhanced-Efficacy Iranian Diatomaceous Earth for Controlling Two Stored-Product Insect Pests  ap. 504-510.  aThe present study was conducted to evaluate the insecticidal activity of three diatomaceous earth (DE) products, SilicoSec (Biofa GmbH, Munsingen, Germany), Protect-It (Hedley Technologies Inc., Canada), and Mamaghan. The silica aerogel was mixed to enhance the efficacy of Mamaghan DE with 10, 15, and 20% rates. The DE products were applied at treatment rates of 100, 200, and 400 ppm against adults of Tribolium confusum Jacquelin du Val. (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) and Rhyzopertha dominica (F.) (Coleoptera: Bostrichidae). In the second experiment, 0.1 and 0.5% deltamethrin was added to Mamaghan DE–10% silica aerogel to enhance the activity of the DE. Adult mortality was recorded 2, 5, 7, 10, and 14 d after exposure. Parental adults were removed after 14-d exposure time and progeny developed was evaluated after 65 d. Mamaghan–15 and 20% silica aerogel caused the highest mortality (>97%) against T. confusum after 10 d of exposure at the highest dose of 400 ppm which exceeded to 100% mortality after 14 d. However, the toxicity of Mamaghan DE against R. dominica was lower than that of the two commercial formulations at all dose rates. The presence of 0.1% deltamethrin increased the insecticidal activity of Mamaghan DE and significantly suppressed progeny production of both species. Even at the lowest dose of Mamaghan–10% + 0.1% deltamethrin, progeny production of both species was very low (four or less individuals per vial). However, no progeny was recorded in Mamaghan–10% + 0.5% deltamethrin. Thus, adding low rates of silica aerogel and deltamethrin considerably enhanced the efficacy of Mamaghan DE in controlling T. confusum and R. dominica.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhyzopertha dominica 3aTribolium confusum 3aaerogels 3aapplication rate 3adeltamethrin 3adiatomaceous earth 3aexposure duration 3aimagos 3ainsect control 3ainsecticidal properties 3amortality 3aprogeny 3asilica 3astorage insects 3atoxicity 0aprotection 0asilica aerogel 0astored beetle1 aZiaee, Masumeh1 aMcLaughlin, Alan0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2019 Oct. 5, v. 113, no. 1 p.504-510dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/toz2613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03099naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245007600160300001600236520182100252592002802073650002802101650001302129650001602142650002502158650002202183650001202205650001702217650002202234650002402256650003002280650002502310650003502335700001202370700001602382700001402398700001502412700001102427700001102438773012602449856008102575852000902656655001202665IND60644654020221118054903.0190518e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064465402DNAL7 a10.1134/S10227954190300372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, M.10aGenetic Diversity of atp6 and cox3 Gene in Wild Drosophila melanogaster  ap. 360-367.  aMitochondria are the energy factory in cells, and more than 95% of the energy in cells is produced by the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Therefore, mitochondria likely plays an important role in the process of high-altitude adaptation. Wild Drosophila melanogaster population structure provides a good precondition to detect positive selection on mitochondrial genes related to environmental or climatic variation, specifically hypoxia and high altitudes. In this paper, we sequenced atp6 (ATPase synthase 6) from 27 individuals and cox3 (cytochrome c oxidase III) from 26 individuals of wild Drosophila melanogaster. The percent G+C content of atp6 and cox3 genes has a value of 24 and 29.3%, respectively, exhibiting an extreme bias in base composition. 5 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected and 2 nonsynonymous substitutions (m.555T > A and m.577A > G) were detected in atp6, only one SNP (m.126C > T) was found from highland Drosophila melanogaster. 6 SNPs were detected in cox3, we found 2 nonsynonymous substitutions (m.745G > A and m.427G > A) of only one highland strain from Yun Nan province. Substitution rates and dN/dS ratios were relatively high for cox3 (ω = 0.34851) compared to atp6 (ω = 0.07329), both of them inferring is purifying selection by using PAML. Only one amino acid site 255I (p < 0.01) of the cox3 gene was found in one fly from low altitude Drosophila sample, which was generated by SNPs (m.763A > G and m.764T > C). From these analyses we conclude that selection may not have played a role in shaping Drosophila melanogaster regional mtDNA variation, the changes in selection is very likely due to some environmental stressors other than hypoxia and high altitudes, and more broadly, our results add to an emerging body of research in Drosophila.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aaltitude 3aamino acids 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3agenetic variation 3ahypoxia 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial DNA 3amitochondrial genes 3aoxidative phosphorylation 3apopulation structure 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism1 aYin, H.1 aGu, Huanan,1 aZhang, L.1 aXu, Zh.

The ion mobility results show that at least two conformers are populated, with the dominant conformer at 75–90% relative abundance. The vibrational NH stretching signatures are sensitive to the tetrapyrrole structure, and they indicate that the tetrapyrrole system is in a helical conformation, consistent with simulated ion mobility collision cross sections. The vibrational spectrum in the fingerprint region of this singly deprotonated species shows that the two propionate groups share the remaining acidic proton. The S₁ band of the electronic spectrum in vacuo is broad, despite ion trap temperatures of 20 K during ion preparation, with a congested Franck–Condon envelope showing partially resolved vibrational features. The vertical transition exhibits a small solvatochromic red shift (−320 cm–¹) in aqueous solution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3adensity functional theory 3apropionic acid 3aspectroscopy1 aDodson, Leah G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5960-056X1 aWeis, Patrick1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7006-67591 aSchneider, Erik K.1 aKappes, Manfred M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1199-17301 aWeber, J.

Typically, DNA barcode primers were designed based on comparing existing myxomycetes sequences and targeting the conserved regions. However, the extreme genetic diversity within major myxomycetes groups and the frequent occurrence of group I introns have made the development of universal DNA barcode a severe challenge. The emergence of next-generation sequencing provides an opportunity to address this problem. We sequenced the mixed genomic DNA of 81 myxomycetes and extracted the SSU gene's reads using next-generation sequencing. After alignment and assembly, we designed a set of SSU primers that matched all potential SNPs, avoided all known group I intron insertion sites, and were highly conserved between major myxomycetes orders. This set of SSU primers has the potential to become one of the universal primer combinations. Due to the high genetic divergence caused by long and complicated evolutionary histories, the lack of universal barcode primers is common in protists. Our research provides a new method to solve this problem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA barcoding 3agenetic variation 3aintrons 3aprotists 0aMyxomycetes 0aBarcode 0aSSU 0aNext-generation sequencing 0aProtists1 aWang, Wei1 aWei, Shuwei1 aHuang, Wei1 aQi, Bao1 aWang, Qi1 aLi, Yu0 tJournal of microbiological methods.g2021 May, v. 184 p.106203-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6372x0167-70127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mimet.2021.1062033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02541naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245010900178300001400287520151700301592002801818650001201846650001201858650001401870650001301884650001101897650002101908650001401929650001401943650001801957651001501975700001701990773008902007856008602096852000902182655001202191IND60084260820221122035612.0141101e20111101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008426082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geomorph.2011.02.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCalaforra, Jose-Maria10aNew peculiar cave ceiling forms from Carlsbad Caverns (New Mexico, USA): The zenithal ceiling tube-holes  ap. 43-48.  aDuring a trip to the Hall of the White Giant, Carlsbad Caverns (NM, USA) cigar-shaped vertically upward developing holes were observed on the ceiling at different heights of the passages. They have a circular cross-section with diameters of 1 to some centimetres and taper out towards their upper end. Their walls are smooth and their bottom edges are sharp, while their length can reach several decimetres. Sometimes gypsum can be found inside. They often occur randomly distributed in groups and their development is not necessarily controlled by fractures or other bedrock structures. We name these peculiar karren-like cave microforms “zenithal ceiling tube-holes” because of their origin by H₂S environment corrosion processes and their vertical (zenithal) upward growth in ceilings. A comparison is made between zenithal ceiling tube-holes and other karstic or non karstic similar forms such as bell holes, oxidation vents, snailholes, Korrosionskolke (mixture-solution hollows) or pockets, röhrenkarren, light-oriented photokarren, borings of (often marine) organisms and negative stalactites. Zenithal ceiling tube-holes are created by the corrosive effect of sulphuric acid. H₂S(g) dissolves in water giving rise to widespread sulphuric acid corrosion. When H₂S bubbles are trapped underneath overhanging surfaces or ceilings and water level rises steadily the corrosive effect is concentrated vertically upwards, drilling vertical holes that can also completely pass overhanging rock ledges.  aPublisher supplied data 3abedrock 3abubbles 3acorrosion 3adrilling 3agypsum 3ahydrogen sulfide 3aorganisms 3aoxidation 3asulfuric acid 3aNew Mexico1 aDe Waele, Jo0 tGeomorphology.g2011 Nov. 1, v. 134, no. 1-2 p.43-48dElsevier B.V.x0169-555X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2011.02.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02932naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245011500153300001400268520149100282592002801773650002201801650002801823650001001851650003101861650001901892650001801911650001701929650001201946650001401958650002001972650001001992650001002002650001602012650001402028653002302042653002002065653001602085700002702101700001702128700001602145700001802161700001802179700001602197773014202213856007402355852000902429655001202438IND60687113320221120175152.0200325e20191011xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068711332DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/toz2622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Xun10aEfficacy of Entomopathogenic Nematodes Against the Tobacco Cutworm, Spodoptera litura (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)  ap. 64-72.  aSpodoptera litura (F.) is an obnoxious cosmopolitan pest that causes serious damage to different economic crops. Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN) have the potential to control the S. litura larvae. Fifteen EPN isolates were screened, and Steinernema sp. 64-2, four isolates of S. carpocapsae (Weiser), S. longicaudum (Shen & Wang) X-7, and two isolates of H. indica (Poinar, Karunaka & David) were found to cause higher mortality of the second, third, and fourth instars of S. litura than the other tested isolates, with larval mortality rates > 90% after 48 h of exposure. An exposure rate of 12.5 infective juveniles per larva was enough for S. carpocapsae A24, All, and G-R3a-2 and S. longicaudum X-7 to cause 100% mortality of the second instar, and for S. longicaudum X-7 and H. indica 212-2 to cause 100% mortality of the third instar. Five EPN isolates were tested on their virulence at different temperatures and found that all the five EPN isolates performed well against the S. litura larvae at 25 and 30°C, but were not active at 10 and 15°C. Two S. carpocapsae isolates (All and Mex) were virulent against the S. litura larvae at lower temperatures. The five tested EPN isolates were also found to have the ability to infect and kill the pupae of S. litura in the laboratory. The present study further proves that EPN are effective at controlling S. litura, which may partially substitute the use of chemical insecticides, thus reduce the overuse of chemical insecticides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSpodoptera litura 3aSteinernema carpocapsae 3acrops 3aentomopathogenic nematodes 3ainsect control 3ainsect larvae 3ainsecticides 3ainstars 3amortality 3anematode larvae 3apests 3apupae 3atemperature 3avirulence 0abiological control 0aHeterorhabditis 0aSteinernema1 aArain, Muhammad Shahid1 aLin, Yinying1 aGu, Xinghui1 aZhang, Limeng1 aLi, Jiangzhou1 aHan, Richou0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2019 Oct. 11, v. 113, no. 1 p.64-72dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/toz2623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01744naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100001900161245008400180300001800264500000900282500001500291520069500306592002801001650001201029650002401041650002401065650002001089650001201109650002201121653002201143653001101165773012301176852000901299856009801308655001201406IND9201475920221117223644.0191122e199107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920147592DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1991.0011183X003100040047x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDhillon, B.

The objective of this study is to propose recurrent selfed-plant mass (SPM) selection, derive its expected genetic gain (ΔGS), and to compare ΔGS with that of mass selection (ΔGM). In SPM selection, S₁ plants are evaluated and recombined, and a cycle is completed in a year if an off-season nursery is available. The ΔGS per cycle was 18 to 34% higher than ΔGM for degree of dominance ranging from none to complete dominance and the frequency of favourable alleles from low to intermediate (0.1–0.5). The SPM selection has another advantage, in that deleterious recessive alleles are exposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3agenetic improvement 3arecurrent selection 3arecessive genes 3aselfing 3across pollination 0aselection methods 0aplants0 tCrop science.g1991 July, v. 31, no. 4 p.1075-1077dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci1991.0011183X003100040047x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02642naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245011000163520137200273592002801645650001901673650001201692650001401704650001401718650001501732650001301747650001901760650001501779650001701794650001701811650001101828700001901839700002301858700002601881700002101907700002301928700002501951700002501976773013202001856007802133852000902211655001202220IND60768525820221116181211.0220225e20220207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076852582DNAL7 a10.3390/vetsci90200722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPinello, Katia 10aVet-OncoNet: Developing a Network of Veterinary Oncology and Reporting a Pioneering Portuguese Experience  aVet-OncoNet is a replicable tripartite animal cancer database with the scientific and academic purposes of collecting data and producing evidence-based knowledge for cancer science in general. Inspired by the One Health vision, Vet-OncoNet uses business intelligence tools to optimize the process of capturing, treating, and reporting animal cancer data to a national level in three interfaces: ACR (animal cancer registry, pathology-based), COR (clinical oncology registry, vet practice-based) and RFR (risk factor registry, owner-based). The first results show that skin and mammary gland are by far the most affected systems. Mast cell tumors and complex adenoma of the mammary gland are the most frequent histologic type in dogs, while in cats they are squamous cell carcinomas, tubular adenocarcinoma of the mammary gland and lymphomas. Regarding COR, it provides valuable information on the landscape of veterinary oncology practices, therapeutics options, outcomes and owners’ drivers’ adherence towards therapies, which range from 30% up to 80% upon vet practices. Furthermore, being aware of the role of animals within the family and as possible sentinels of environmental risks to cancer in humans, the network built an interface (Pet-OncoNet) dedicated to owners and a database (RFR) that receives information regarding pets and owners’ daily habits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenocarcinoma 3aadenoma 3adatabases 3ahistology 3alandscapes 3alymphoma 3amammary glands 3amast cells 3arisk factors 3atherapeutics 3avision1 aPires, Isabel 1 aCastro, Ana Filipa1 aCarvalho, Paulo Tiago1 aSantos, Andreia 1 ade Matos, Augusto 1 aQueiroga, Felisbina 1 aNiza-Ribeiro, João 0 tVeterinary sciences.g2022 Feb. 07, v. 9, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27139x2306-73817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/vetsci90200723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02230naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006100151245006800212300001800280520091600298592002801214650000801242650002401250650001501274650001501289650001801304650001201322650002201334653002901356653002301385653001701408653001601425653002501441653001801466700007501484700006201559773011601621856008601737852000901823655001201832IND60731395820221118191702.0211017e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073139582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tibtech.2021.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchoenit, Andreas1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3714-563610aFunctionalization of Cellular Membranes with DNA Nanotechnology  ap. 1208-1220.  aDue to its versatility and programmability, DNA nanotechnology has greatly expanded the experimental toolbox for biomedical research.

Selection of the best method of emergency mass depopulation involves maximizing human health and safety while minimizing disease spread and animal welfare concerns. Proper selection must ensure that the method is compatible with the species, age, housing type, and disposal options. No one single method is appropriate for all situations. Gassing is one of the accepted methods for euthanatizing poultry. Whole-house, partial-house, or containerized gassing procedures are currently used. The use of water-based foam was developed for emergency mass depopulation and was conditionally approved by the United States Department of Agriculture in 2006. Research has been done comparing these different methods; parameters such as time to brain death, consistency of time to brain death, and pretreatment and posttreatment corticosterone stress levels were considered. In Europe, the use of foam with carbon dioxide is preferred over conventional water-based foam. A recent experiment comparing CO2 gas, foam with CO2 gas, and foam without CO2 gas depopulation methods was conducted with the use of electroencephalometry results. Foam was as consistent as CO2 gassing and more consistent than argon-CO2 gassing. There were no statistically significant differences between foam methods. 3agases 3acorticosterone 3aculling (animals) 3aanimal age 3ainterspecific variation 3acarbon dioxide 3apublic health 3apoultry housing 3aargon (noble gases) 3aelectroencephalography 3avertebrate viruses 3adecontamination 3aanimal welfare 3adisease control 3aquarantine 3apoultry 3avirus transmission 3afood animals 3aInfluenza A virus 3acarcass disposal 3afoams 3aEurope 0aspecies differences 0amethodology 0adepopulation 0anew methods1 aRankin, M.K.1 aJohnson, K.J.1 aBenson, E.R.0 tAvian diseases.g2010 Mar., v. 54, no. 1 p.757-762dAmerican Association of Avian Pathologistsx0005-20867nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1637/8764-033109-Reg.13Available from publisher's Web site  a20100807b20100903c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/07/13  aOther US 7aarticle02280naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245009200170300002000262520098200282592002801264650001101292650004901303650002801352650001201380650002401392650001401416650002301430650003701453650001401490700002001504700002001524700002101544700002101565700002101586700001801607700002501625773012901650856008201779852000901861655001201870IND60576440320180712000000.0170804e20170713xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057644032DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b027632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŠtefančič, Aleš10aTriphenylide-Based Molecular SolidA New Candidate for a Quantum Spin-Liquid Compound  ap. 14864-14871.  aThe reduction of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with alkali metals results in solids having intriguing magnetic properties the understanding of which has been hitherto severely hampered by the lack of single-phase samples. Here, we report on the successful reduction of triphenylene with stoichiometric amount of potassium in 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) solution. Comprehensive diffraction measurements of the obtained K₂(C₁₈H₁₂)₂(DME) solid demonstrate the importance of cation-π interactions as responsible for the characteristic stacking of the triphenylide molecular ions. Electron paramagnetic resonance and magnetization measurements reveal K₂(C₁₈H₁₂)₂(DME) is a Mott insulator with strikingly strong nearest neighbor antiferromagnetic interactions between S = 1/2 spins of (C₁₈H₁₂)•– radical anions. Low dimensionality hinders long-range magnetic ordering and establishes a spin state that resembles gapped quantum spin liquid state.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanions 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aferrimagnetic materials 3aliquids 3amagnetic properties 3amagnetism 3aphysical chemistry 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3apotassium1 aKlupp, Gyöngyi1 aKnaflič, Tilen1 aYufit, Dmitry S.1 aTavčar, Gašper1 aPotočnik, Anton1 aBeeby, A.

We developed a model simulating N availability for rice plants associated with soil N kinetics and rice plant N uptake and combined it with the existing rice growth model SIMRIW to construct SIMRIWₖ. The model parameters were determined from rice plant growth and soil N experimental data obtained over 25 years under four soil management regimes. SIMRIWₖ successfully simulated the annual changes and upward trend observed during the 25 years in all treatments. The relationship between measured yields and SIMRIWₖ calculations in all treatments over the 25 years formed one aggregation defined by the regression equation y = 1.00x and showed a significant correlation (r² = 0.894). According to SIMRIWₖ, increasing temperature in the cold season increases the formation of easily decomposable organic N produced under dry conditions and N mineralization during the next warm season, suggesting that rice growth is influenced by both warm-season and cold-season temperatures. We forecast rice yield and soil N kinetics from 2016 to 2100 using SIMRIWₖ and climate change predictions based on the IPCC’s climate change scenario RCP8.5. Atmospheric warming, a rise in CO₂ partial pressure, and increased soil N mineralization caused by soil warming will increase rice plant growth, but the decreased radiation absorbed owing to the shortened growing season and high-temperature sterility will prevent any significant change in yield. Furthermore, the acceleration of soil organic N decomposition will decrease soil organic N concentrations. Understanding the influences of climate change on soil organic matter kinetics is absolutely critical for predicting the future soil production capacity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAndisols 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3acold 3acold season 3aequations 3agrain yield 3agrowing season 3agrowth models 3amineralization 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3apaddies 3aplant growth 3aprediction 3arice 3asimulation models 3asoil heating 3asoil organic nitrogen 3atemperature 3awarm season 0aRice plant 0aglobal warming 0anitrogen kinetics 0asimulation 0aeasily decomposable organic nitrogen1 aYoshizawa, Chieko0 tSoil science and plant nutrition.g2018 Nov. 2, v. 64, no. 6 p.752-766dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl19123x1747-07657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00380768.2018.15172793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02015naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245007400167300001400241500001400255520094800269592002801217650001501245650001301260650002701273650001601300650001601316650002001332650001101352650001501363650001701378650001201395650001201407650001101419700002101430773009201451856007701543852000901620655001201629IND60689954520221117231410.0200424e20100101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068995452DNAL7 a10.4161/fly.4.1.108812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMenon, Debashish U.10aGerm line imprinting in Drosophila: Epigenetics in search of function  ap. 48-52.  aNAL-light  aGerm line imprinting produces parent-specific differences in the behavior of chromosomes or expression of genes. Epigenetic marks, placed on chromosomes in the parental germ line, govern classical imprinted effects such as chromosomal inactivation, chromosome elimination and mono-allelic expression. Germ line imprinting occurs in insects, plants and mammals. Several Drosophila systems display imprinted effects. In spite of this, many aspects of imprinting in flies, including the normal function of this process, remain mysterious. Transgenerational inheritance of epigenetic marks is a powerful force in genome regulation. Elucidation of the mechanism of imprint establishment and maintenance in a model organism, such as Drosophila, is thus of great interest. In this review we summarize the primary systems that have been used to study imprinting in flies and speculate on the origin and biological function of imprinting in Drosophila.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila 3abehavior 3achromosome elimination 3achromosomes 3aepigenetics 3agene expression 3agenome 3agerm cells 3ainactivation 3ainsects 3amammals 3amodels1 aMeller, Victoria0 tFly.g2010 Jan. 1, v. 4, no. 1 p.48-52dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2251x1933-69427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/fly.4.1.108813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03266naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010000167300001600267520180800283592002802091650001502119650001202134650001902146650001902165650001302184650001702197650001902214650002202233650001802255650000902273650001602282650000802298650001302306650000902319650002202328700002302350700002102373700002202394700002102416700002502437700002002462700001802482700001902500700002502519773012602544856008102670852000902751655001202760IND60644654220221118054854.0190518e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064465422DNAL7 a10.1134/S10227954190301652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYusupova, L.

The analysis of associations of allelic variants of cytokine genes in the process of tumorous transformation of the gastric mucosa is an urgent problem. Its solution could make it possible to identify the features of production of inflammatory mediators by the immunocompetent cells during gastric carcinogenesis. The frequencies of alleles and genotypes of the rs1143634 and rs16944 loci of the IL1β gene, rs71941886 of the IL1RN gene, rs4073 of the IL8 gene, and rs1800872 of the IL10 gene were analyzed in 221 patients with established diagnosis of gastric cancer, as well as in 279 unrelated healthy individuals from the Republic of Bashkortostan. We discovered an association of the allele С and genotype C/C of the rs1143634 locus of the IL1β gene with a risk of development of malignant tumors of the stomach in men. We identified statistically significant differences in between patients and the control group in the distribution of frequencies of alleles and genotypes of the polymorphic variants: rs16944 of the IL1β gene and rs1800872 of the IL10 gene. Dependence of the associations with clinical features of the disease was also shown. Application of the APSampler algorithm revealed the combinations of alleles and genotypes associated with reduced and increased risk of the development of gastric cancer. The most significant were IL1β (rs1143634)*T + IL1β (rs16944)*T/T, IL8*A + IL10*A + IL1β (rs1143634)*T + IL1β (rs16944)*T, and IL10*A + IL1RN*2/2. The obtained results confirm the influence of the investigated allelic variants of cytokine genes on the risk of developing gastric cancer and play an important role in understanding the genetic structure of the studied pathology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aalleles 3acarcinogenesis 3agastric mucosa 3agenotype 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-8 3aloci 3alymphocytes 3amen 3apatients 3arisk 3astomach neoplasms1 aNurgalieva, A.

Although the main forcing factors for sedimentation are known, much less is known about the characteristic sizes of this spatial patterning. Such patterning gives information on the spatial component of salt-marsh formation and on the uncertainty in measured accretion rates. We used variograms (geostatistics) to study the size of spatial patterns in the thickness of salt-marsh deposits, based on a database of over 10,000 soil cores. These were taken at various spatial scales ranging from metres to kilometres, along a chronosequence representing 10–150years of salt-marsh formation at three barrier islands in the Wadden Sea (south-eastern North Sea). The general complexity of salt-marsh accretion was reflected in the observed patterns of the thickness of the marsh deposits. The patterns were nested and ranged in horizontal size from 3m on sites with micro-topography, to 900m at the scale of the entire marsh. Their structure and size changed with salt-marsh age and there was no characteristic pattern size. Although the pre-marsh topography is an important large-scale control, during salt-marsh development independent spatial patterns are superimposed. When scaling up data on salt-marsh sedimentation, the presence of spatial patterning adds uncertainty to the prediction. The consequence of the complexity of these patterns is that the spatial uncertainty is a (not necessarily linear) function of the area under consideration, which can only be quantified if it is explicitly measured. Our findings therefore pose a cautionary note to studies of salt-marsh resilience to sea-level rise: reliable estimates can only be derived if they are based on measurements that take into account the entire salt marsh.  aPublisher supplied data 3achronosequences 3adatabases 3ageostatistics 3aislands 3aprediction 3asalt marshes 3asea level 3asoil 3atopography 3auncertainty 3aNorth Sea1 aVeeneklaas, Roos M.1 aKuijper, Dries P.J.1 aBakker, Jan P.0 tGeomorphology.g2011 Nov. 15, v. 134, no. 3-4 p.280-296dElsevier B.V.x0169-555X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2011.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02037naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001800180245018800198300001800386506007600404520068900480592002801169506003701197650000801234650002301242650002301265650002301288650002501311650002201336650002201358700001901380700002401399700002601423773011801449856007501567852000901642655001201651IND60550339120221207120746.0160910e20140418xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055033912DNAL7 a10.1021/jo40283742doi7 aPMC42034072pmcid7 a246352162pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Nan-Sheng10aSynthesis and Incorporation of the Phosphoramidite Derivative of 2′-O-Photocaged 3′-S-Thioguanosine into Oligoribonucleotides: Substrate for Probing the Mechanism of RNA Catalysis  ap. 3647-3652.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOligoribonucleotides containing 3′-S-phosphorothiolate linkages possess properties that can reveal deep mechanistic insights into ribozyme-catalyzed reactions. “Photocaged” 3′-S- RNAs could provide a strategy to stall reactions at the chemical stage and release them after assembly steps have occurred.

Adults and first instars of five strains (Queensland, Kuala Lumpur, Bukit Mertajam, Saujana, and Krystal Point) were evaluated using the surface contact method and compared with a susceptible strain (Monheim) of the common bed bug Cimex lectularius L. The insecticide formulations were used at their label rates in this study: Tandem (thiamethoxam [11.6%], lambda-cyhalothrin [3.5%]) at 183.96 mg/m²;Temprid SC (imidacloprid [21%], beta-cyfluthrin [10.5%]) at 106.13 mg/m²; Sumithion 20CS (fenitrothion [20%]) at 250 mg/m²; Pesguard FG161 (d-tetramethrin [4.4%], cyphenothrin [13.2%]) at 110 mg/m²; and Sumithrin 10SEC (d-phenothrin [10%]) at 100 mg/m². Results showed a very high level of resistance to Pesguard FG161 (388.3 to >605.0 times) and Sumithrin (302.9 to >365.5 times) in all adults of the strains tested, whereas low to high levels of resistance were registered for Tandem (1.4–4.7 times),Temprid (7.3–16.7 times), and Sumithion (1.2–14.6 times) for adults of all bed bug strains. For first instars, resistance to the former two formulations were high to very high (31.4–118.1 times). In contrast, they showed lower resistance to Tandem, Temprid, and Sumithion (1.0–10.2 times).

In present work, a nicotine surface-imprinted monolith (MIM) was used for the selective removal of nicotine from smoke. First, the retention capacity and selectivity for this MIM was tested by using it as the stationary phase in gas chromatography and chromatographic conditions optimized. Then, the gas phase adsorption isotherms of MIM were constructed and the adsorption thermodynamics explored. At last, the applicability for MIM in the removal of nicotine in smoke was explored. Results indicated a stronger retention capacity and a higher selectivity of MIM toward the template vapor, with a capacity factor (87.88) and a selectivity factor (10.15) under the optimized conditions. A higher standard adsorption enthalpy change for this MIM toward the template (ΔHa0 = 65.53 kJ mol⁻¹) than that for the non-imprinted monolith (NIM) column (ΔHa0 = 47.46 kJ mol⁻¹) was observed. The adsorption isotherm for MIM appears the BET type II shape, while that for the NIM was approximately linear. When this MIM was used as the adsorbent, it exhibited a high performance in the selective removal of nicotine from the main stream smoke, with an adsorption percentage of 99.43%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aenthalpy 3agas chromatography 3anicotine 3apolymers 3asmoke 3asorption isotherms 3atoxic substances 3avapors 0aMolecularly imprinted polymer 0aSurface-imprinted monolith 0aNicotine 0aSelective removal 0aAdsorption1 aSong, J.J.1 aLi, H.1 aGong, M.T.1 aZhang, Y.0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2019 Mar. 05, v. 365 p.53-63dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2018.10.1013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02112naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002500148245006300173300001400236500001500250520122300265592002801488650002301516650001501539650002501554653001701579700002101596700001401617773008601631856008401717852000901801655001201810IND4476761320221119140007.0141110e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447676132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecocom.2012.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarnsworth, Keith D.10aFunctional complexity: The source of value in biodiversity  ap. 46-52.  a2019-12-06  aBiodiversity may be seen as a scientific measure of the complexity of a biological system, implying an information basis. Complexity cannot be directly valued, so economists have tried to define the services it provides, though often just valuing the services of ‘key’ species. Here we provide a new definition of biodiversity as a measure of functional information, arguing that complexity embodies meaningful information as Gregory Bateson defined it. We argue that functional information content (FIC) is the potentially valuable component of total (algorithmic) information content (AIC), as it alone determines biological fitness and supports ecosystem services. Inspired by recent extensions to the Noah's Ark problem, we show how FIC/AIC can be calculated to measure the degree of substitutability within an ecological community. Establishing substitutability is an essential foundation for valuation. From it, we derive a way to rank whole communities by Indirect Use Value, through quantifying the relation between system complexity and the production rate of ecosystem services. Understanding biodiversity as information evidently serves as a practical interface between economics and ecological science.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystem services 3aeconomists 3afunctional diversity 0abiodiversity1 aLyashevska, Olga1 aFung, Tak0 tEcological complexity.g2012 Sept., v. 11 p.46-52dElsevier B.V.x1476-945X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecocom.2012.02.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01941naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245008100176300001400257520077100271592002801042650002301070650002201093650002001115650002301135650001101158653000801169653000801177653000801185653000801193653002701201653002901228653004101257700002701298700002401325773011101349856008601460852000901546655001201555IND60637984320221121034702.0190822e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063798432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jeconom.2019.04.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndreasen, Martin M.10aTerm Structure Analysis with Big Data: One-Step Estimation Using Bond Prices  ap. 26-46.  aNearly all studies that analyze the term structure of interest rates take a two-step approach. First, actual bond prices are summarized by interpolated synthetic zero-coupon yields, and second, some of these yields are used as the source data for further empirical examination. In contrast, we consider the advantages of a one-step approach that directly analyzes the universe of bond prices. To illustrate the feasibility and desirability of the one-step approach, we compare arbitrage-free dynamic term structure models estimated using both approaches. We also provide a simulation study showing that a one-step approach can extract the information in large panels of bond prices and avoid any arbitrary noise introduced from a first-stage interpolation of yields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconometric models 3aeconomic analysis 3aeconomic theory 3ainterest (finance) 3aprices 0aC55 0aC58 0aG12 0aG17 0aExtended Kalman filter 0aFixed-coupon bond prices 0aArbitrage-free Nelson–Siegel model1 aChristensen, Jens H.E.1 aRudebusch, Glenn D.0 tJournal of econometrics.g2019 Sept., v. 212, no. 1 p.26-46dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11871x0304-40767nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2019.04.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02416naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245006300167300001800230520111700248592002801365650001801393650001901411650002001430650001001450650003501460650002301495650001301518650001101531650002501542650002101567650001201588650001901600650002501619650000901644700002301653700002001676700001501696700001801711700002001729773013001749856008201879852000901961655001201970IND60089514620221116144639.0141102e20120120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008951462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.12.0992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFujii, Satoshi10aRAS oncogenic signal upregulates EZH2 in pancreatic cancer  ap. 1074-1079.  aThe neoplastic transformation by mutant RAS is thought to require remodeling of expression of an entire set of genes. However, the underlying mechanism for initiation of gene expression remodeling in tumorigenesis remains elusive. This study was aimed to define the oncogenic role of EZH2, a histone modifier protein that is induced by oncogenic mutant RAS, using pancreatic cancers of transgenic rats exogenously expressing human mutant RAS. Immunohistochemical observation of preneoplastic or cancerous lesions in the animal model suggested that upregulation of Ezh2 protein is an initiating event in pancreatic carcinogenesis. MEK-inhibition or Elk-1-knockdown downregulated EZH2, and MEK-inhibition or EZH2-knockdown restored expression of a tumor suppressor, RUNX3 in human and rat pancreatic cancer cells activated by the oncogenic RAS. Furthermore, Elk-1- or EZH2-knockdown inhibited growth of the cancer cells. These results strongly suggested that the oncogenic RAS upregulates EZH2 through MEK-ERK signaling, resulted in downregulation of tumor suppressors including RUNX3 in pancreatic carcinogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3acarcinogenesis 3agene expression 3agenes 3agenetically modified organisms 3agrowth retardation 3ahistones 3ahumans 3aimmunohistochemistry 3alesions (animal) 3amutants 3aneoplasm cells 3apancreatic neoplasms 3arats1 aFukamachi, Katsumi1 aTsuda, Hiroyuki1 aIto, Kosei1 aIto, Yoshiaki1 aOchiai, Atsushi0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2012 Jan. 20, v. 417, no. 3 p.1074-1079dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.12.0993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03536naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245008800170300001600258520201100274592002802285650001602313650001702329650001502346650002302361650002602384650002202410650001302432650001802445650001402463650003502477650001302512650000902525650001002534650001502544650001102559650002302570650001302593650001102606651001202617653001402629653001702643653000802660653002002668653002302688653001302711653001102724700002202735700002402757773010702781856008502888852000902973655001202982IND60536110120221120225109.0190215e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053611012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2014.12.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenson, John F.10aResource selection by wolves at dens and rendezvous sites in Algonquin park, Canada  ap. 223-232.  aEastern wolves (Canis lycaon) are a species of special concern in Canada and their geographic range appears to be restricted mainly to Algonquin Provincial Park (APP) in Ontario, Canada. Previous work showed pup survival was relatively low throughout portions of APP which may limit the extent to which this protected area can act as a source of dispersing individuals to adjacent areas. We modeled resource selection by wolves at dens and rendezvous sites to identify environmental variables that were selected and avoided in APP during pup-rearing. We also quantified differences in resource selection between den and rendezvous sites and investigated links between home-site selection and pup survival. Wolves selected dens closer to wetlands and water, farther from secondary roads, and on steeper slopes relative to rendezvous sites. When we modeled den and rendezvous sites separately, wolves selected wetlands, water, conifer forests and tertiary roads at dens, whereas they selected wetlands and conifer forests at rendezvous sites. Packs that lost pups to starvation and intraspecific strife avoided water and selected wetlands and mixed forests at home-sites more than packs that did not lose pups to these mortality agents. Previous research showed that pup starvation occurred for packs in APP with lower beaver density in their territories, and our results indicate that these packs selected habitats at dens and rendezvous sites associated with alternative prey (moose). Moose are likely more difficult prey than beavers to kill during summer which may contribute to the higher nutrition-related mortality of pups in packs with decreased access to beavers. Our results inform eastern wolf conservation efforts and should be considered during forest management and park planning activities in APP. More broadly, our research provides novel insight into temporal differences in home-site selection across the pup-rearing season and the relationship between resource selection and pup mortality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlces alces 3aCanis lycaon 3aCastoridae 3aconiferous forests 3aenvironmental factors 3aforest management 3ahabitats 3amixed forests 3amortality 3anatural resources conservation 3aplanning 3apups 3aroads 3astarvation 3asummer 3atemporal variation 3awetlands 3awolves 3aOntario 0aAlgonquin 0aCanis lycaon 0aDen 0aRendezvous-site 0aResource selection 0aSurvival 0aWolves1 aMills, Kenneth J.1 aPatterson, Brent R.0 tBiological conservation.g2015 Feb., v. 182 p.223-232dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2014.12.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02609naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010400166300001600270500001100286520096400297592002801261596005901289596005901348596005901407596007801466650002301544650002201567650000901589650002101598650001401619650001201633650001601645650002801661650002301689650000901712650001101721651001001732700001701742700001801759700001501777700001701792700001401809700005801823773014301881856008202024852000902106655001202115IND60645171720221116181654.0190523e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064517172DNAL7 a10.1007/s00128-019-02586-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yongmin12aA Review of Studies on the Biogeochemical Behaviors of Mercury in the Three Gorges Reservoir, China  ap. 686-694.  aReview  aThe Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) is a relatively large reservoir, and its water level management actions produce a widespread water level fluctuation zone (WLFZ), which has characteristics of both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Here, an integrated overview of current knowledge on Hg behaviors in the TGR, especially the WLFZ, as well as exposure risk to local residents was presented. Hg levels in the TGR were comparable with other natural aquatic systems. WLFZ in the TGR was confirmed to be an environment favorable for Hg methylation by enhancing microbial activity, promoting sulfur cycling and increasing the level of low-molecular-weight organic matters. However, elevated fish Hg concentrations did not follow the impoundment of TGR, indicating no obvious reservoir effect, while it is still noteworthy that frequently consuming fish is likely to be a methylmercury (MeHg) exposure pathway for specific populations e.g. fishermen around the TGR.  aPublisher supplied data  a41603103cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41877384cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41373113cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aXDJK2017B035cthe Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities 3aaquatic ecosystems 3aexposure pathways 3afish 3afish consumption 3afishermen 3amercury 3amethylation 3amethylmercury compounds 3amicrobial activity 3arisk 3asulfur 3aChina1 aYin, Deliang1 aXiang, Yuping1 aXu, Qinqin1 aZhang, Cheng1 aXie, Qing1 aWang, Dingyong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1157-76170 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2019 May, v. 102, no. 5 p.686-694dSpringer USwJournal:jnl46145x0007-48617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-019-02586-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02402naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245011100207300001600318520091900334592002801253650002301281650002201304650003101326650001001357650003201367650002401399650001301423650001701436650004401453650002201497650003701519700001801556700001801574700001401592700001301606700001601619700005601635700001301691773017101704856008401875852000901959655001201968IND60638241720221118232845.0190426e20190328xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063824172DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jnatprod.8b010292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Panpan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0081-732010aAnti-inflammatory Mono- and Dimeric Sorbicillinoids from the Marine-Derived Fungus Trichoderma reesei 4670  ap. 947-957.  aEight new dimeric sorbicillinoids (1–3, 5–9) and 12 new monomeric sorbicillinoids (10–20, 25), along with five known analogues (4 and 21–24), were isolated from the marine-derived fungus Trichoderma reesei 4670. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of extensive spectroscopic analyses (1D and 2D NMR, HR-ESIMS, and ECD) and X-ray crystallography. Compound 1, containing a pyrrolidin-2-one moiety, is reported for the first time in the sorbicillinoid family. Compounds 8 and 9 are the first examples of bisorbicillinoids possessing a benzofuro[2,3-h]chromene scaffold from a natural source. Compounds 3–11, 13–16, 18, 21, 22, 24, and 25 exhibited potent anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting the production of NO in RAW264.7 cells activated by lipopolysaccharide with IC₅₀ values in the range from 0.94 to 38 μM.

Polyuria and polydipsia are the most frustrating adverse effects noted by owners. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether administration of desmopressin ameliorates polyuria and polydipsia associated with prednisolone administration. ANIMALS: Seven healthy adult Walker Hounds. METHODS: Prospective hypothesis testing study. Daily water intake and urine specific gravity (USG) were measured in dogs under 4 separate sequential conditions: no medications (C), prednisolone only (P), prednisolone and desmopressin (PD), and prednisolone after discontinuation of desmopressin (PAD). RESULTS: When compared to baseline, 6 of 7 dogs became polydipsic after administration of prednisolone (0.5 mg/kg PO q12h). When desmopressin (5 μg/dog SC q12h) was administered to dogs receiving prednisolone, significant decreases in water intake and serum sodium concentration occurred, and USG increased significantly. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Administration of desmopressin to dogs receiving prednisolone significantly decreased water intake and serum sodium concentration, and increased USG. Our results suggest that, in some dogs, desmopressin ameliorates the most important adverse effect of prednisolone noted by owners, but that hyponatremia is an important complication associated with desmopressin use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aadults 3aadverse effects 3ablood serum 3aglucocorticoids 3ahyponatremia 3aprednisolone 3asodium 3aspecific gravity 3aurine 3aveterinary medicine1 aArcher, Todd1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2395-08101 aJolly, Robyn1 aSullivant, Alyssa1 aWills, Robert1 aLathan, Patty0 tJournal of veterinary internal medicine.g2021 Sept., v. 35, no. 5 p.2271-2276dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl43440x0891-66407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jvim.162503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02681naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245010500168300001600273520125400289592002801543650002101571650002601592650002901618650001601647650001301663650001401676650001701690650001801707650001601725650003701741650001901778650001401797653001901811653001401830653002701844653001201871653002001883700001601903700001601919700001601935700001401951700002201965773011601987856008702103852000902190655001202199IND60112498820221122040059.0190408e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011249882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2013.05.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Haiqing10aSynergistic interactions of cinnamaldehyde in combination with carvacrol against food-borne bacteria  ap. 619-623.  aIn order to select effective and safe natural antibacterial ingredients, more than 30 kinds of plant extracts were selected for their suitability as antibacterial agents. A standard broth microdilution method was used to evaluate their antimicrobial activity, a cytotoxicity test was used to detect their safety, and a synergy assay was used to determine which combinations have a synergistic effect. Then time-kill curves were used to further verify their bactericidal capacity. As a result of these tests, cinnamaldehyde and carvacrol were identified first, then subsequently verified to be the most effective and safe natural active substances. It was found that all of the tested bacteria strains were sensitive to cinnamaldehyde and carvacrol. The combination of cinnamaldehyde with carvacrol also showed good synergistic antibacterial effect against 7 of the 11 tested bacterial strains. The time-kill assay verified synergism for the cinnamaldehyde/carvacrol combination toward Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. These results indicated that the combination of cinnamaldehyde and carvacrol may serve as a promising naturally sourced food preservative with excellent bactericidal activity against common food spoilage microorganisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotics 3abacteria 3acarvacrol 3acytotoxicity 3afood spoilage 3aingredients 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3aplant extracts 3asynergism 0aCinnamaldehyde 0aCarvacrol 0aAntibacterial activity 0aSynergy 0aTime-kill assay1 aShen, Suxia1 aXu, Jingyue1 aLin, Songyi1 aYuanyuan,1 aJones, Gregory S.0 tFood control.g2013 Dec., v. 34, no. 2 p.619-623dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2013.05.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02334naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245008300158300001800241500002000259520105100279592002801330650003401358650001201392650002601404650001701430650001801447650001301465650001301478650001301491650002001504650001501524650001401539650000901553650001501562650002501577700001501602700001901617700001701636700001701653773013501670856007401805852000901879655001201888IND60572113220221118011742.0170712e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057211322DNAL7 a10.1111/ijfs.131932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ruilin10aAntioxidant and hypoglycaemic effects of tilapia skin collagen peptide in mice  ap. 2157-2163.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn this study, tilapia collagen peptide (TCP) was prepared by alcalase hydrolysis of tilapia skin, and the antioxidant and hypoglycaemic effects of TCP were investigated. The results showed that TCP possessed DPPH and ABTS+ free radicals‐scavenging activities. In diabetic mice in which diabetes was induced by injection of alloxan (50 mg kg⁻¹ bw), high‐dose TCP (1.7 g kg⁻¹ bw) and the drug metformin (1.0 g kg⁻¹ bw) were found to reduce 31.8% and 30.3% of blood glucose levels in 25 days, respectively. Moreover, in diabetic mice receiving high‐dose TCP, antioxidant enzymes SOD and CAT were increased by 23% and 59.2%, respectively, and MDA was decreased by 39.1%. Comparing the treated high‐dose TCP group with the metformin group, there were similar SOD (61.5 U mg⁻¹ vs. 60.2 U mg⁻¹) and MDA (1.4 nmol mg⁻¹ vs. 1.3 nmol mg⁻¹), but more (~7%) CAT (359.8 U g⁻¹ vs. 336.1 U g⁻¹). Together, the present data, for the first time, demonstrated that TCP possessed hypoglycaemic effects in mice.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aalloxan 3aanimal disease models 3aantioxidants 3ablood glucose 3acatalase 3acollagen 3adiabetes 3aglycemic effect 3ahydrolysis 3ametformin 3amice 3asubtilisin 3asuperoxide dismutase1 aChen, Jian1 aJiang, Xiongwu1 aYin, Lasheng1 aZhang, Xuewu0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2016 Oct., v. 51, no. 10 p.2157-2163dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0950-54237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ijfs.131933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02879naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245015300161300001800314520134600332592002801678650001701706650002001723650002501743650001201768650002001780650001001800650001601810650001601826650001701842650001901859650001601878650001501894650001301909650002401922650001501946650002901961650003101990650002002021700003002041700002102071700002002092700001902112700002202131700002502153773011102178856007502289852000902364655001202373IND60529854620170413000000.0160720e20141007xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052985462DNAL7 a10.1021/ac502401j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValdés, Alberto,10aComprehensive Foodomics Study on the Mechanisms Operating at Various Molecular Levels in Cancer Cells in Response to Individual Rosemary Polyphenols  ap. 9807-9815.  aIn this work, the contribution of carnosic acid (CA) and carnosol (CS), two major compounds present in rosemary, against colon cancer HT-29 cells proliferation is investigated using a comprehensive Foodomics approach. The Foodomics study reveals that CA induces transcriptional activation of genes that encode detoxifying enzymes and altered the expression of genes linked to transport and biosynthesis of terpenoids in the colon cancer cell line. Functional analysis highlighted the activation of the ROS metabolism and alteration of several genes involved in pathways describing oxidative degradation of relevant endogenous metabolites, providing new evidence about the transcriptional change induced by CA in HT-29 cells. Metabolomics analysis showed that the treatment with CA affected the intracellular levels of glutathione. Elevated levels of GSH provided additional evidence to transcriptomic results regarding chemopreventive response of cells to CA treatment. Moreover, the Foodomics approach was useful to establish the links between decreased levels of N-acetylputrescine and its degradation pathway at the gene level. The findings from this work and the predictions based on microarray data will help explore novel metabolic processes and potential signaling pathways to further elucidate the effect of CA in colon cancer cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosynthesis 3achemoprevention 3acolorectal neoplasms 3aenzymes 3agene expression 3agenes 3aglutathione 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3aneoplasm cells 3apolyphenols 3aprediction 3arosemary 3asignal transduction 3aterpenoids 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptional activation 3atranscriptomics1 aGarcía-Cañas, Virginia,1 aSimó, Carolina,1 aIbáñez, Clara1 aMicol, Vicente1 aFerragut, Jose A.1 aCifuentes, Alejandro0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2014 Oct. 07, v. 86, no. 19 p.9807-9815dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac502401j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02781naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100002300157245013100180500002200311520144800333592002801781650002601809650001601835650000901851650001201860650001501872653002201887653002701909653001101936653002301947653002801970700001801998700006202016700005502078700002402133700002502157773010002182856009202282852000902374655001202383IND60745891520221120130937.0210729e20210709xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074589152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2021.07.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarbaresi, Alberto12aA method for the validation of measurements collected by different monitoring systems applied to aquaculture processing plants  aPre-press version  aIn recent years, the agricultural sector has taken advantage of real time monitoring, particularly in delicate systems such aquaculture plants. In this context there is a need to develop integrated systems for sustainable production of both vegetable crops and fish. Since a monitoring system able to collect all the involved metrics is not available on the market, a specific monitoring system called ISMaCS (Integrated Smart Monitoring and Control System) has been designed and developed to collect and analyse relevant data. A method is proposed for the validation of the measurements collected by ISMaCS based on comparisons between the data series collected by investigated and reference sensors. Firstly, experiments has been carried out recording with sensors, parameters and an indicator, called Distance between Measurements (DbM) that has been defined and calculated. DbM has been compared to two thresholds to test the sensor reliability. The first, the Identical Reference Value (IRV) was based on the characteristics of the reference sensor, whilst the second, the Acceptability Reference Value (ARV), was selected on the basis of the precision required by the application. Specifically, DbM showed that if the precision of the investigated sensor was suitable for a specific application, it quantifies the reliability of the measurements and can be used as a tool to compare and rank different sensors measuring the same metrics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural industry 3aaquaculture 3afish 3amarkets 3avegetables 0aMonitoring system 0aMeasurement validation 0aSensor 0aAquaculture system 0aMeasurement reliability1 aAgrusti, Miki1 aCeccarelli, Mattia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5438-93011 aBovo, Marco1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5757-85141 aTassinari, Patrizia1 aTorreggiani, Daniele0 tBiosystems engineering.g2021 July 09, dElsevier LtdaIAgrEwJournal:jnl70639x1537-51107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2021.07.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03946naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245010100174300001600275520242600291592002802717650001202745650001202757650001102769650002302780650001302803650001202816650001502828650001602843650001002859650001002869650003002879650001302909651001402922653002102936653002102957653001902978653002602997653001403023653002403037700001703061700002203078700002703100700002103127700002403148700001903172700002403191773010703215856008503322852000903407655001203416IND60536110220221120225131.0190215e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053611022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2014.12.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKelaher, Brendan P.10aFur seal activity moderates the effects of an Australian marine sanctuary on temperate reef fish  ap. 205-214.  aOffshore islands are often preferentially selected for marine sanctuaries (no take areas) over inshore reefs on populated coasts because they support relatively unique marine communities and critical habitat for protected marine wildlife and are often less accessible to people. To evaluate whether marine sanctuaries around an offshore island with a large fur seal colony performed differently to inshore areas, we compared fish assemblages at 36 reef sites within marine sanctuaries and fished areas around an offshore Island and within inshore areas of the Batemans Marine Park in temperate southeastern Australia. In each site, we quantified fish assemblage structure using 3–4 replicate baited remote underwater video deployments. We also evaluated the role of fur seal activity, sea surface temperature and wave exposure in structuring fish assemblages on reefs inside and outside marine sanctuaries. Of these variables, only fur seal activity on shallow island reefs (∼10m deep) was significantly related to fish assemblage structure with a negative relationship to fish richness and abundance. The fish assemblages in marine sanctuaries differed significantly from fished areas on deep reefs around Montague Island (30–40m deep) and on shallow inshore reefs (∼10m deep), with 119% and 45% more fish and 49% and 19% more species of fishes in marine sanctuaries in the two areas, respectively. There were also significantly more kyphosids, labrids, southern maori wrasse (Ophthalmolepis lineolatus) and silver sweep (Scorpis lineolata) in marine sanctuaries than in fished areas on deep reefs around Montague Island. Although there was, on average, 34% more fish on shallow reefs inside than outside marine sanctuaries around Montague Island, there were no significant differences in fish assemblages when the influence of fur seal activity was taken into account. Given that fur seals numbers are increasing and they eat reef fishes, marine sanctuaries on shallow reefs adjacent to seal colonies may not achieve some of the positive benefits associated with increased fish biomass (e.g. increased kelp cover) to same level as sanctuaries more distantly located. We suggest, therefore, that careful consideration of long-term conservation goals (e.g. conservation of fur seals or local enhancement of fish diversity) is needed before preferentially locating marine sanctuaries adjacent to fur seal colonies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScorpis 3abiomass 3acoasts 3aconservation areas 3ahabitats 3aislands 3amacroalgae 3amarine fish 3areefs 3aseals 3asurface water temperature 3awildlife 3aAustralia 0aFish assemblages 0aMarine sanctuary 0aMarine reserve 0aMarine protected area 0aFur seals 0aMarine conservation1 aTan, Melissa1 aFigueira, Will F.1 aGillanders, Bronwyn M.1 aConnell, Sean D.1 aGoldsworthy, S.

During the spawning season, reproductive activities of fish species and their daily entry to rivers are influenced by environment. Number of Rutilus frisii kutum entered a river discharging to Caspian Sea was analyzed to investigate the association between timing of river entry and day–night changes in environmental variables. Four thousand five hundred and sixty seven ascending adult kutum were collected in Khoshkrood River between March and May 2012. Physicochemical parameters were recorded and Melatonin levels were measured in a hundred migratory kutum over day and night during the spawning period. A significant effect of daytime on river entry was observed, as more fish entered the river at night. Melatonin levels decreased to the minimum level during peak days of migration, suggesting variations in melatonin levels can help to harmonize the daily rhythm in kutum migration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRutilus kutum 3aadults 3abiological rhythms 3aenvironmental factors 3afish 3amelatonin 3amigratory behavior 3aphysicochemical properties 3aprogeny 3areproduction 3arivers 3aspawning 3aCaspian Sea 0aMelatonin 0aRutilus frisii kutum 0acircadian 0aphotoperiod 0amovement1 aBani, Ali0 tBiological rhythm research.g2017 Nov. 2, v. 48, no. 6 p.951-962dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12260x1744-41797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09291016.2017.13245593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01936naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245016400156300001800320520078900338592002801127650002601155650002101181650001401202650001701216650001901233650001501252650001701267650001801284700002401302700002001326700002501346773013101371856007501502852000901577655001201586IND60538530620221123004557.0160815e20120509xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053853062DNAL7 a10.1021/ja302482k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJana, Avijit10aPerylene-3-ylmethanol: Fluorescent Organic Nanoparticles as a Single-Component Photoresponsive Nanocarrier with Real-Time Monitoring of Anticancer Drug Release  ap. 7656-7659.  aWe report for the first time the use of perylene-3-ylmethanol fluorescent organic nanoparticles as a drug delivery system.

In vitro biological studies revealed that the newly developed perylene-3-ylmethanol nanoparticles exhibit good biocompatibility and cellular uptake as well as efficient photoregulated anticancer drug release ability.

To enhance the endo-/lysosomal escape and increase the efficacy of protein delivery, current strategies mainly focus on destroying endo-/lysosomes by employing modified nanoparticles, such as pH-sensitive polyplexes, cell-penetrating peptides, and photosensitive molecules. Herein, we hypothesize that pretreatment with empty nanocarriers might make endo-/lysosomes occupied and affect the endo/lysosomal escape of protein subsequently delivery by nanocarriers. We first treated breast carcinoma MDA-MB-231 cells with a high concentration of empty nanocarriers, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN), to occupy the endo-/lysosome. After 2 h, we treated the cells with a lower concentration of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled MSN (MSN–FITC) and investigated the intracellular spatial and temporal distribution of MSN–FITC and their colocalization with endo-/lysosomes. We discovered the preoccupation of endo-/lysosomes by the empty nanocarriers did exist, mainly through changing the spatial distribution of the subsequently introduced nanocarriers. Furthermore, for the protein delivery, we observed reduced MSN–saporin delivery after endo-/lysosome preoccupation by MSN empty carriers. A similar result is observed for the delivery of cytochrome C by MSN but not for the small-molecule anticancer drug doxorubicin. The results show that the empty nanocarriers inhibit the endo-/lysosome intracellular trafficking process and decrease the endo-/lysosome escape of proteins subsequently delivered by the nanocarriers. This new discovered phenomenon of declined endo-/lysosome escape after endo-/lysosome preoccupation indicates that repeated treatment by nanomaterials with low protein-loading capacity may not yield a good cancer therapeutic effect. Therefore, it provides a new insightful perspective on the role of nanomaterial carriers in intracellular protein delivery.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreast neoplasms 3adoxorubicin 3afluorescein 3ananocarriers 3ananoparticles 3apeptides 3aphotosensitivity 3aphysiological transport 3aporous media 3aproteins 3asilica 0amesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN) 0aendo-/lysosome escape 0asaporin 0aprotein delivery 0apreoccupation1 aSun, Li-Ping1 aXia, Yiqiu1 aHao, Sijie1 aCheng, Gong1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2217-64081 aWang, Zhigang1 aWan, Yuan1 aZhu, Chuandong1 aHe, Hongzhang1 aZheng, Si-Yang1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0616-030X0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Feb. 14, v. 10, no. 6 p.5340-5347dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b185773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02279naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100001700161245006500178300001600243500000900259520143600268592002801704650001601732650001501748700002201763773012101785852000901906856009801915655001202013IND8402872320221117233312.0191122e198401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND840287232DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1984.0011183X002400010034x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSadanaga, K.10aLocating the w1 Locus on the Satellite Chromosome in Soybean  ap. 147-151.  aepub  aF₂ data of field-grown plants of a cross between translocation 172-11-3 (purple flower, W₁) and type collection line T93A (white flower, w₁) of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] revealed a significant deviation from the expected ratio of 3 purple: 1 white. To determine the cause(s) of the abnormal ratio, the chromosome number and constitution of the F₂ progenies of another cross involving 172-11-3 and T161 (white flower) were determined. Translocation 172-11-3 has cytologically recognizable interchange chromosomes, and the short interchange chromosome was present as a univalent in 46% of the pollen mother cells (PMCs) in interchange heterozygotes. Sixty-five percent of the F₂ progeny were disomics of the N/N, N/T, and T/T types, 18% were trisomics, 16% were 40-chromosome plants with a duplication-deficiency gamete, and 1% were 42-chromosome plants. Assuming that the univalent was lost in the cytoplasm 50% of the time, the observed number of N/N and N/T plants fit the expected, but the number of T/T did not. A recombination frequency of 1.9% between w₁ and the breakpoint was calculated. The F₂ data of duplex trisomic hybrids indicated that the w₁ locus was on the satellite chromosome. The breakpoint on the long arm of the satellite chromosome is distal to the w₁ locus.

However, current forestry practices would benefit tremendously from the knowledge of tree coordinates, particularly when the information used to position them is acquired with inexpensive sensors. Therefore, the objective of our study is to geo-reference trees using point clouds created from the images acquired below canopy. We developed a procedure that uses the coordinates of the trees seen from above canopy to position the same trees seen below canopy. To geo-reference the trees from above canopy we captured images with an unmanned aerial vehicle. We reconstructed the trunk with photogrammetric point clouds built with a structure&ndash;from&ndash;motion procedure from images recorded in a circular pattern at multiple locations throughout the stand. We matched the trees segmented from below canopy with the trees extracted from above canopy using a non-rigid point-matching algorithm. To ensure accuracy, we reduced the number of matching trees by dividing the trees segmented from above using a grid with 50 m cells. Our procedure was implemented on a 7.1 ha Douglas-fir stand from Oregon USA. The proposed procedure is relatively fast, as approximately 600 trees were mapped in approximately 1 min. The procedure is sensitive to the point density, directly impacting tree location, as differences larger than 2 m between the coordinates of the tree top and the bottom part of the stem could lead to matching errors larger than 1 m. Furthermore, the larger the number of trees to be matched the higher the accuracy is, which could allow for misalignment errors larger than 2 m between the locations of the trees segmented from above and below.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPseudotsuga menziesii 3aalgorithms 3acanopy 3adata collection 3ageoreferencing 3aphotogrammetry 3aremote sensing 3asilvicultural practices 3atree crown 3atrees 3aunmanned aerial vehicles 3aOregon1 aQi, Chu 1 aSessions, John 0 tRemote Sensing.g2019 Aug. 11, v. 11, no. 16dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs111618773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02443naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002100188245011100209300001200320500001100332506007600343520119400419592002801613506003701641650002801678650001001706650001101716650002001727650002001747650001401767650000901781700002401790700002001814700002901834773009201863856008101955852000902036655001202045IND60555541720221207101954.0161029e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055554172DNAL7 a10.1186/s13071-015-1167-92doi7 aPMC46178902pmcid7 a264823512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVaumourin, Elise14aThe importance of multiparasitism: examining the consequences of co-infections for human and animal health  ap. 545.  aReview  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMost parasites co-occur with other parasites, although the importance of such multiparasitism has only recently been recognised. Co-infections may result when hosts are independently infected by different parasites at the same time or when interactions among parasite species facilitate co-occurrence. Such interactions can have important repercussions on human or animal health because they can alter host susceptibility, infection duration, transmission risks, and clinical symptoms. These interactions may be synergistic or antagonistic and thus produce diverse effects in infected humans and animals. Interactions among parasites strongly influence parasite dynamics and therefore play a major role in structuring parasite populations (both within and among hosts) as well as host populations. However, several methodological challenges remain when it comes to detecting parasite interactions. The goal of this review is to summarise current knowledge on the causes and consequences of multiparasitism and to discuss the different methods and tools that researchers have developed to study the factors that lead to multiparasitism. It also identifies new research directions to pursue.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal and human health 3ahosts 3ahumans 3amixed infection 3amultiparasitism 3aparasites 3arisk1 aVourc’h, Gwenaël1 aGasqui, Patrick1 aVayssier-Taussat, Muriel0 tParasites & vectors.g2015 Dec., v. 8, no. 1 p.545-545dBioMed Centralx1756-33057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-015-1167-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01884naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245004000157300001800197520093300215592002801148650001301176650002201189650000901211650002101220650000701241650001101248650002501259700001701284700001801301700002301319773012001342856007501462852000901537655001201546IND60559461320221118054230.0161216e20140306xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055946132DNAL7 a10.1021/jp410367v2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbe, Hidekazu10aAdhesion of Gels by Silica Particle  ap. 2518-2522.  aIn this study, a method for achieving adhesion between two positively charged gels with high mechanical strength was developed. By utilizing a silica particle dispersion as a binder, the gels easily adhered to each other and remained stable for up to 11 days when immersed in aqueous solution. The adhesion force between the two positively charged semi-interpenetrating network gels with the silica particle was measured to be up to approximately 20 kPa, which is around 10 times larger than that with a charged polymer-rich liquid as a cross-linker (approximately 1.5 kPa). It was demonstrated that the adhesion force was a result of two types of interactions: an electrostatic attractive force between the cationic gel surface and hydrogen bonding among the silica particles. In addition, it was shown that the adhesion force was dependent on solution pH, which was attributed to changes in the charge of the silica particles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aaqueous solutions 3agels 3ahydrogen bonding 3apH 3asilica 3astrength (mechanics)1 aHara, Yusuke1 aMaeda, Shingo1 aHashimoto, Shūji,0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2014 Mar. 06, v. 118, no. 9 p.2518-2522dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp410367v3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01838naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245014700172300001800319520086800337592002801205650003201233650002301265650001701288650001801305650001801323700002601341773011701367856005501484852000901539655001201548IND4510600220221121012353.0150730e200008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451060022DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1432-1327.2000.01530.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWerner, Susanne10aHomodimeric reverse transcriptases from Rous sarcoma virus mutated within the polymerase or RNaseâH active site of one subunit are active  ap. 4740-4744.  aHeterodimeric reverse transcriptase (RT) Î±Î² from Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) possesses an asymmetric subunit organization with the polymerase and RNaseâH active sites localized in the Î±âsubunit.

Digital records of species occurrences are increasingly available and have been used in a number of conservation applications, such as species distribution models and conservation prioritization efforts. However, our knowledge of species distributions is still affected by several shortfalls which limit our capacity for effective action if not properly scrutinized. Ignorance scores have been recently proposed as an intuitive and straightforward indicator of biodiversity knowledge availability, but to date their usefulness in assessing biases in species occurrence data has been poorly explored in the scientific literature. We used ignorance scores to characterize and identify the factors driving the availability of recent species occurrence records in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) for multiple taxa in the Caatinga ecoregion, the largest seasonally dry tropical forest in the world. Specifically, we calculated ignorance scores based on species records within 10 × 10 km cells covering the Caatinga region and modelled the relationship between ignorance scores and a set of socio-geographical variables using generalized additive models for location, scale and shape (gamlss). Most studied taxa had high ignorance scores across the Caatinga, indicating a low availability of recent species records in GBIF for this region. Our results also suggest that factors associated with accessibility and convenience are the main correlates of species recording effort in this region. Ignorance scores were lower at intermediate values of road and human population density, indicating that observers tend to avoid urban and inaccessible areas. We also found evidence of increased recording effort in areas close to universities and protected areas while vegetation cover seemingly had little effect on ignorance scores. Overall, our results suggest that efforts to compile and digitize recent species occurrence records should be encouraged in order to improve our knowledge of this regions’ unique biodiversity and the efforts to preserve it. Furthermore, ignorance scores are a useful indicator of the availability and distribution of species occurrence records in the Caatinga. We discuss a range of potential extensions to this indicator that could expand its scope for future applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3acaatinga 3aconservation areas 3aecoregions 3aenvironmental indicators 3ageographical distribution 3ahuman population 3amodels 3apopulation density 3aprioritization 3atropical forests 3auniversities 3avegetation cover 0aDigital biodiversity information 0aIgnorance scores 0aMaps of ignorance 0aRecording biases 0aSeasonally dry tropical forest1 aRuete, Alejandro1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7182-0936 https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7182-0936 https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7182-09361 aStropp, Juliana1 aMalhado, Ana C.M.1 ados Santos, Janisson W.1 aLessa, Thainá1 aAlves, José A.1 aLadle, Richard J.0 tEcological indicators.g2019 Nov., v. 106 p.105539-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.1055393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02696naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245010500155300001600260520171000276592002801986653001402014653001402028653001102042653001702053653001602070653001702086700002002103700003402123700002202157773010702179856007502286852000902361655001202370IND60126420220221120140627.0151107e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012642022DNAL7 a10.1651/07-2964.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoi, Wataru10aGrowth and reproduction of the portunid crab Charybdis bimaculata (Decapoda: Brachyura) in Tokyo Bay  ap. 641-651.  aThe abundance, sex ratio, growth, sexual maturity, morphological sex dimorphism, and reproduction of the portunid crab Charybdis bimaculata was studied in Tokyo Bay, Japan, between November 2002 and October 2003. Relative abundance [[inferred from catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE)]] was higher and lower during summer and winter months, respectively. The proportion of males varied between 0.2-0.5 throughout the year and the overall sex ratio was greatly biased toward females. The population had a unimodal size frequency distribution and the life-span was estimated to be about one year. Growth was not depressed in winter and was adequately described by the von Bertalanffy growth equation. The puberty molt in males brought about changes in the relative size of the chelipeds and gonopods and was estimated to occur within a carapace length (CL) range of 12.50-16.00 mm. Puberty in females was evidenced by a sharp increase in the pleon width and was estimated to occur at CLs between 11.34 and 16.74 mm. Morphological sexual dimorphism was observed in all features which showed secondary sexual development (cheliped dimensions, carapace and pleon width, and body weight). Ovarian development was uniformly arrested only during winter but began developing in early spring, and mating (insemination) increased in frequency between spring and summer. Ovigerous females were found in all seasons except for winter, but were more common during the warmer months. Batch fecundity ranged from 8,300 to 38,400 eggs per female and was positively correlated with body size. C. bimaculata displays the typical reproductive features and spawning pattern of temperate portunid crabs in spite of its short life-span.  aPublisher supplied data 0aBrachyura 0aCharybdis 0agrowth 0alife history 0amorphometry 0areproduction1 aYokota, Masashi1 aStrüüssmann, Carlos Augusto1 aWatanabe, Seiichi0 tJournal of crustacean biology.g2008 Nov., v. 28, no. 4 p.641-651dCrustacean Societyx0278-03727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1651%2F07-2964.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03212naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001600169245015500185300001600340520148500356592002801841650002001869650004401889650001301933650001001946650001101956650001901967650000901986650001401995650003102009650001402040650001302054650001202067650003302079650001102112650002302123650004602146650005802192650005302250650002602303653002502329653001102354653002402365653001202389700002102401700001602422700001902438773011902457856008502576852000902661655001202670IND50060477520221120113743.0200106e20130323xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006047752DNAL7 a230845052pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2012.09.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHansson, I.14aThe clinical significance of Nicoletella semolina in horses with respiratory disorders and a screening of the bacterial flora in the airways of horses  ap. 695-699.  aNicoletella semolina, a member of the family Pasteurellaceae, can be isolated from the airways of horses with respiratory disorders. However, its role as a potential or opportunistic pathogen is not clear nor is its presence as part of the normal flora. We therefore investigated the presence and bacterial load of N. semolina in healthy and diseased horses. Samples from a healthy control group were compared with samples from the routine analysis of horses with a clinical history of respiratory disorders. A total of 1770 nose swabs and 1132 tracheal aspirate samples were analysed and subjected to conventional bacteriological examination.N. semolina was isolated from 12 (6%) of 207 nose samples from the healthy control group and from 42 (3%) of 1563 samples from horses with respiratory disorders. In tracheal aspirate, N. semolina was isolated from 7 (3%) of 211 samples from the control group and 49 (5%) of 921 samples from horses with respiratory disorders. Other bacteria were also isolated in laboratory analyses, the most commonly isolated bacterium in both the control group and the respiratory disorders group being Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus. It was isolated in 21% of tracheal aspirate from the control group and 33% of those from horses with respiratory disorders.In conclusion, N. semolina is not a primary pathogenic bacterium, as it was isolated at similar frequencies in horses with respiratory disorders and those in the healthy control group.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPasteurellaceae 3aStreptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus 3abacteria 3aflora 3ahorses 3amicrobial load 3anose 3apathogens 3arespiratory tract diseases 3ascreening 3asemolina 2aAnimals 2aHorse Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aHorses 2aNosexmicrobiology 2aPasteurellaceaexisolation & purification 2aPasteurellaceae Infectionsxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aRespiration Disordersxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aTracheaxmicrobiology 0aNicoletella semolina 0aEquine 0aBacterial infection 0aAirways1 aJohansson, K.-E.1 aPersson, M.1 aRiihimäki, M.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2013 Mar. 23, v. 162, no. 2-4 p.695-699dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2012.09.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03135naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245013000207300001800337500001900355520174600374592002802120650001002148650001002158650001002168650001302178650001002191650001502201650001502216650001402231650001302245650000902258650001402267650001302281650001202294650001602306653001002322653001702332653001302349653001502362700001602377700001202393700001302405700001802418773011502436856008102551852000902632655001202641IND60712138120221117224458.0201009e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071213812DNAL7 a10.1017/S17517311200013662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRobertson, S.

Haemorrhage on the surface of the brain has been used as a field diagnostic tool to allocate lambs to a cause of death category, but the usefulness of this method was unclear. This study aimed to evaluate whether gross pathology was related to neuronal death and whether haemorrhage of the central nervous system (CNS) was distinct between differing causes of death, enabling indicators to be used in field diagnoses. Lambs dying from natural causes (n = 64) and from euthanasia (n = 7) underwent postmortem examination, then the brain and spinal cord were extracted and examined histologically. Histological changes consistent with neuronal death were not detected in any lamb. Haemorrhage of the meninges and/or parenchyma of the CNS occurred in all lambs. The age of the haemorrhage indicated that it occurred near the time of death in most lambs. Dilation of blood vessels varied in severity but appeared to be unrelated to causal diagnosis, severity of subcutaneous oedema, breathing or milk status. Moderate or severe dilation of blood vessels and haemorrhage of the CNS did not occur in all lambs with alternative clear indicators of dystocia and occurred in all death classifications, so it could not be used as diagnostic indicators for classification of cause of death. Dilation and haemorrhage were unrelated to neuronal damage and may have been artefactual. In conclusion, haemorrhage of the CNS was not indicative of neuronal damage and could not be used to distinguish between lambs with clear indicators of differing causes of death, so it is not recommended as a field diagnostic tool.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3abrain 3adeath 3adystocia 3aedema 3aeuthanasia 3ahemorrhage 3ahistology 3ameninges 3amilk 3amortality 3anecropsy 3aneurons 3aspinal cord 0asheep 0areproduction 0asurvival 0amanagement1 aBoulton, J.1 aXie, G.1 aNeef, A.1 aFriend, M.

P.10aLarge‐scale bleaching of corals on the Great Barrier Reef  ap. 501.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn 2015–2016, record temperatures triggered a pan‐tropical episode of coral bleaching. In the southern hemisphere summer of March–April 2016, we used aerial surveys to measure the level of bleaching on 1,156 individual reefs throughout the 2,300 km length of the Great Barrier Reef, the world's largest coral reef system. The accuracy of the aerial scores was ground‐truthed with detailed underwater surveys of bleaching at 260 sites (104 reefs), allowing us to compare aerial and underwater bleaching data with satellite‐derived temperatures and with associated model predictions of bleaching. The severity of bleaching on individual reefs in 2016 was tightly correlated with the level of local heat exposure: the southernmost region of the Great Barrier Reef escaped with only minor bleaching because summer temperatures there were close to average. Gradients in nutrients and turbidity from inshore to offshore across the Great Barrier Reef had minimal effect on the severity of bleaching. Similarly, bleaching was equally severe on reefs that are open or closed to fishing, once the level of satellite‐derived heat exposure was accounted for. The level of post‐bleaching mortality, measured underwater after 7–8 months, was tightly correlated with the aerial scores measured at the peak of bleaching. Similarly, reefs with a high aerial bleaching score also experienced major shifts in species composition due to extensive mortality of heat‐sensitive species. Reefs with low bleaching scores did not change in composition, and some showed minor increases in coral cover. Two earlier mass bleaching events occurred on the Great Barrier Reef in 1998 and 2002, that were less severe than 2016. In 2016, <9% of scored reefs had no bleaching, compared to 42% in 2002 and 44% in 1998. Conversely, the proportion of reefs that were severely bleached (>60% of corals affected) was four times higher in 2016. The geographic footprint of each of the three events is distinctive, and matches satellite‐derived sea surface temperature patterns. Our aerial surveys indicate that past exposure to bleaching in 1998 and 2002 did not lessen the severity of bleaching in 2016. This data set of aerial bleaching scores provides a historical baseline for comparison with future bleaching events.

It is commercially important as a target species mainly for small-scale bottom seiners and trawlers in Japan, Korea, China, and Taiwan. In Kagoshima Bay, southern Japan, this species is one of the most dominant species in the benthic community. The reproductive biology of T. curvirostris including ovarian maturation, size at sexual maturity, and spawning season was investigated in Kagoshima Bay. A total of 5,681 female specimens were collected during June 2002 through December 2005. Ovarian maturity stages were divided into three categories (undeveloped, developing, and early ripe or ripe) based on the visual observation of ovaries fixed with 10%% formalin and oööcyte diameter. The size at sexual maturity was estimated to be 17.3 mm in carapace length. The gonadosomatic index (GSI) showed a significant increase with progressing ovarian maturity stage and most of the females with GSI ≥≥ 6%% were found to be matured. Percentage occurrence of mature females and inseminated females showed similar seasonal trends and the spawning season was estimated to last from May to November, with a peak during June and July.  aPublisher supplied data 0aovarian maturation 0aPenaeidae 0asize at sexual maturity 0aspawning season 0aTrachysalambria curvirostris1 aOhtomi, Jun0 tJournal of crustacean biology.g2008 Nov., v. 28, no. 4 p.607-612dCrustacean Societyx0278-03727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1651%2F07-2970.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02912naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245009200163300001600255500000900271520174700280592002802027650001502055650001402070650001502084650001602099650001802115650001702133650001502150650002502165650003902190650001802229700001602247700001902263700002002282773013602302856007902438852000902517655001202526IND60667862520221119180847.0191228e200205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066786252DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj2002.74402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoulsen, T. G.10aThree-region Campbell Model for Unsaturated Hydraulic Conductivity in Undisturbed Soils  ap. 744-752.  aepub  aA three-region Campbell (TRC) type model for predicting undisturbed soil unsaturated hydraulic conductivity from water retention is presented. The model assumes that hydraulic conductivity follows separate Campbell functions within the macropore (matric head ψ > −10 cm H₂O), the mesopore (−10 ≥ ψ > −350 cm H₂O), and the micropore (ψ ≤ −350 cm H₂O) regions, and that soil water retention and two reference-point values of hydraulic conductivity are known. Conductivity and retention data for 100 undisturbed soils from the UNSODA database and 68 soils from a Danish database were used for model development. Conductivity for both highly structured (three-region) and weakly structured (two-region) soils mostly followed a piecewise linear function (with slope β) in a Log(conductivity) −Log(water content) plot, supporting the TRC model concept. A unique relationship between the Campbell soil-water retention parameter, b, and the unsaturated conductivity parameter, β, was found valid for both meso- and micropore regions. It was shown that the values of b in the mesopore and micropore regions are not correlated, making the use of single-region expressions (e.g., the Mualem–van Genuchten type models) questionable and suggests that a multiregion model with noncorrelated retention parameters between pore regions, such as the TRC model, may provide a conceptually more correct description of hydraulic conductivity. The TRC model yielded improved conductivity predictions in loamy and clayey soils whereas predictions for sandy soils were comparable to the single-region Campbell and van Genuchten models. TRC model predictions compared well with independent data for three differently textured soil profiles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclay soils 3adatabases 3aprediction 3asandy soils 3asoil profiles 3asoil texture 3asoil water 3asoil water retention 3aunsaturated hydraulic conductivity 3awater content1 aMoldrup, P.1 aIversen, B.

The reproductive period is markedly seasonal and takes place from May (austral mid-autumn) to August (late winter). Ovigerous females appear quite abruptly in the population by May, and this condition is observed in all adult females sampled regardless of their size. The average size at the onset of functional maturity in females, at which 50%% of the females sampled during the reproductive period were considered adults, was 12.75 mm CL. The smallest post-ovigerous female measured 12.06 mm carapace length (CL). Mean fecundity (±±S.D.) from 41 females bearing early and intermediate eggs was 129.1 ±± 32.2 and corresponded to a mean female CL of 14.11 mm. The elliptical-shaped eggs exhibited significant increase in size along the development stages. The third pair of pleopods bore higher number of eggs than the others. Compiled information regarding the reproductive period reported for aeglids revealed an increase in the breeding period length with latitude. The reproductive period tends to be shorter in localities under larger rainfall variation and smaller temperature variability than in sites with opposite climate conditions. Eggs tend to be fewer in number and larger in size towards lower latitudes. We present an hypothesis that stream water velocity might act as a major selective pressure during the early life history of fluvial aeglids with direct effect on the reproductive pattern.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAegla franca 0areproduction 0afunctional maturity1 aShimizu, Roberto Munehisa0 tJournal of crustacean biology.g2008 Nov., v. 28, no. 4 p.652-662dCrustacean Societyx0278-03727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1651%2F07-2974.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02321naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245007300173300001600246520119100262592002801453650001301481650002001494650002401514650001001538650001301548650001501561650001801576653002301594653002001617653001301637700002801650700002301678700002801701773012501729856008401854852000901938655001201947IND60519012220221121221041.0160420e20160425xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051901222DNAL7 a10.1080/10408398.2012.7338942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHomayoni Rad, Aziz14aThe Comparison of Food and Supplement as Probiotic Delivery Vehicles  ap. 896-909.  aProbiotics are live bacteria which have frequently been reported to be beneficial in preventing a wide range of diseases as well as playing a major role in treating the existing ailments. Thus far, a variety of probiotic products have been developed which can be categorized into two groups: probiotic foods and supplements. Both foods and supplements have been able to confer the health benefits claimed for them. However, it is not known which one can be clinically more efficient, and to the best of our knowledge, until now no research has been conducted to investigate this issue. The present review aims to discuss this matter, based on the evidence available in the literature. To do so, articles indexed in PubMed and ScienceDirect between 2000 and 2011 were reviewed. The articles included the clinical trials in which either foods or supplements were used to administer the probiotics to either patients suffering from different diseases or healthy subjects. Although both foods and supplements seem to have been efficient carriers for the beneficial bacteria, to generally promote public health in communities, probiotic foods appear to be preferred to probiotic supplements.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3aclinical trials 3adietary supplements 3afoods 3apatients 3aprobiotics 3apublic health 0aProbiotic products 0ahealth benefits 0aefficacy1 aVaghef Mehrabany, Elnaz1 aAlipoor, Beitullah1 aVaghef Mehrabany, Leila0 tCritical reviews in food science and nutrition.g2016 Apr. 25, v. 56, no. 6 p.896-909dTaylor & Francisx1549-78527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2012.7338943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03333naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002900144245011100173520193800284592002802222650001902250650001202269650001702281650001702298650001002315650001402325650002002339650001302359650002002372650001802392650001502410650001702425650001602442650001002458650001602468650000902484650001502493651001002508700002702518700002302545700002502568700002702593700002402620773012002644856007802764852000902842655001202851IND60745583220221121233344.0210723e20210624xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074558322DNAL7 a10.3390/plants100712852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbou El-Nasr, Mohamed K.10aUsing Zinc Oxide Nanoparticles to Improve the Color and Berry Quality of Table Grapes Cv. Crimson Seedless  aProducing high-quality table grapes is becoming a challenge in the warmer area of the world due to the global increase in temperature, which negatively affects anthocyanin biosynthesis and other fruit quality attributes. Nanotechnology is a growing field that can be a very useful tool to improve crop productivity and sustainability. The red color is one of the major fruit quality parameters that determine table grape marketability. This study aimed to investigate the role of the zinc element in improving the marketable characteristics of Crimson seedless (Vitis vinifera L.) table grape berries i.e., color, firmness, total soluble solids and sugars; besides its role in activating PAL and SOD enzymatic systems. Additionally, this paper investigated the additive advantages of zinc when applied in nanometric form. Five concentrations of zinc oxide nanoparticles, ZnO NPs (0, 25, 50, 100 and 250 ppm), were compared to zinc oxide in mineral form at a concentration of 250 ppm to investigate their effects on the marketable characteristics of Crimson seedless grape cultivar. The treatments were applied as foliar spray on three-year-old Crimson seedless vines grafted on Richter 110 rootstock grown in one of the major table grape production area in Egypt. The experiment was arranged in completely randomized block design and each vine was sprayed with five letters of the solution. The use of the lowest concentration (25 ppm) of ZnO NPs achieved the highest significant enzyme activity (PAL and SOD). Moreover, the T.S.S, sugars and anthocyanin content in berries increased significantly in association of decreasing acidity. On the other hand, the use of a 50 ppm concentration led to an increase in fruit firmness. Collectively, our data showed that 25 ppm of zinc nanoparticles improved PAL and SOD enzymes activity, improved red coloration in table grape and was more effective than the 250 ppm zinc oxide mineral form.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVitis vinifera 3aacidity 3aanthocyanins 3abiosynthesis 3acolor 3acultivars 3aenzyme activity 3afirmness 3afoliar spraying 3afruit quality 3arootstocks 3atable grapes 3atemperature 3avines 3aviticulture 3azinc 3azinc oxide 3aEgypt1 aEl-Hennawy, Hussein M.1 aSamaan, Mina S.

The total, soluble, insoluble dietary fiber, beta‐glucan, resistant starch, and total starch contents were evaluated through enzymatic assays. The processing parameters affected the content of all constituents of the flour mixture, except for beta‐glucan. The total starch content, insoluble dietary fiber, and resistant starch were significantly decreased with increasing temperature and screw speed (until 13, 12, and 97%, respectively). The extrusion parameters had a positive effect on total dietary fiber content (increased this parameter up to 29%) when compared with the raw material, that is, oat and rice blend, causing changes from the insoluble to soluble dietary fibers. In the electron microscopic analysis, the structure of all extrudates showed to be homogeneous and compact with irregular surfaces. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The processing of oats by using extrusion‐cooking technique is challenging due to the high lipid and fiber content. For this reason, expansion agents such as rice or corn flours are commonly mixed to the oats before processing. In addition to changing rheological, physical and chemical properties of the raw materials, the extrusion operating conditions may lead to loss of food nutritional properties. In this study, we used the response surface methodology to understand which processing conditions maximize the food nutritional value. The selection of an optimum operating condition in terms of energy efficiency and thermal quality represent a relevant requirement for the current food industry. The content of β‐glucan was preserved regardless of the processing condition while the insoluble and soluble fiber ratio was significantly affected by screw speed. Once low temperatures could be used for preparing fiber‐rich oat flour, a reduction in energy consumption from the process is expected.  aPublisher supplied data  cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior  cCAPES/MEC  cCNPq/MCTI 3abeta-glucans 3acorn flour 3adietary fiber 3aelectron microscopy 3aenergy efficiency 3aextrusion 3afood industry 3alipids 3anutritive value 3aoat flour 3aoats 3aphysicochemical properties 3araw materials 3aresistant starch 3aresponse surface methodology 3arice 3asoluble fiber 3atemperature1 aMejía, Sandra Milena Vasquez1 aCaon, Thiago1 ade Francisco, Alicia0 tJournal of food process engineering.g2019 Feb., v. 42, no. 1 p.e12943-dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl8651x0145-88767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpe.129433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01614naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001900154245005200173300001600225520075000241592002800991650002401019650001201043650001201055650003101067650002601098773008001124856008801204990002301292852000901315655001201324IND60096326520221118040658.0141104e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009632652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cryogenics.2012.01.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDang, Haizheng10a40K single-stage coaxial pulse tube cryocoolers  ap. 216-220.  aSeveral 40K single-stage coaxial high frequency pulse tube cryocoolers (PTCs) have been developed to provide reliable and low-noise cooling for GaAs/AlGaAs Quantum-Well infrared photodetectors (QWIPs).

In the studied forest ecosystems, the taxonomic structure of gamasids was represented by 11 families (Epicriidae, Parasitidae, Veigaiidae, Ameroseiidae, Aceosejidae, Rhodacaridae, Macrochelidae, Pachylaelapidae, Laelapidae, Eviphididae and Zerconidae), with 39 genera and 97 species. The maximum number of species was recorded in the ecosystem with Abies alba (80), followed by the ecosystem with Fagus sylvatica (73), while the minimum in the ecosystem with Picea abies (68). 2,016 samples, 97 species with 23,441 individuals were analysed. In order to show similarities between predator mite populations from these areas, the vegetation and some abiotic parameters of the soil (temperature, humidity, pH) were analysed and described. Similarities between gamasid mite populations from the investigated ecosystems were analysed using the Jaccard index (q). The highest similarity index (q = 0.706) was recorded between gamasids identified in Picea abies and Abies alba forests, at soil level, in comparison with those from Abies alba and Fagus sylvatica forests (q = 0.656). Based on the similarity index, it is discussed that the gamasid population structure was influenced by the type of soil, the specific composition of the herbaceous, shrub and tree layers, the microclimatic factors, all characteristic for each studied ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbies alba 3aAmeroseiidae 3aFagus sylvatica 3aLaelapidae 3aMacrochelidae 3aParasitidae 3aPicea abies 3aRhodacaridae 3aVeigaiidae 3aforest ecosystems 3aforests 3ahumidity 3amicroclimate 3amites 3apopulation structure 3ashrubs 3asoil types 3atemperature 3atrees 3aRomania 0agamasid mites 0aecosystems 0asoil 0amicroclimate 0asimilarity 0aRomania0 tBiologia.g2012 Feb. 22, v. 67, no. 2 p.390-396dVersitax1336-95637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11756-012-0019-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03544naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245010900164520199400273592002802267650001702295650001402312650001302326650001202339650001102351650001902362650001202381650001702393650001102410650001602421650001102437650001302448650001202461650001302473650002602486650001802512650001702530700002502547700001802572700001802590700001802608700002402626700002502650700001902675700003002694700002602724700002702750700001802777773012002795856007802915852000902993655001203002IND60745583320221121233316.0210723e20210624xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074558332DNAL7 a10.3390/plants100712862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahmood, Tahir 10aEffect of Drought Stress on Capsaicin and Antioxidant Contents in Pepper Genotypes at Reproductive Stage  aPepper is one of the most important vegetables and spices in the world. Principal pungency is contributed by secondary metabolites called capsaicinoids, mainly synthesized in the placenta of pepper fruit. Various factors, including drought, limit pepper production. Flowering is one of the most sensitive stages affected by drought stress. The current study was conducted to determine the effect of drought on different pepper genotypes at the flowering and pod formation stages. Hot pepper (Pusajuala and Ghotki) and Bell pepper (Green Wonder and PPE-311) genotypes were subjected to drought (35% field capacity) at two different stages (flowering (DF) and pod formation (DP) stage). In comparison, control plants were maintained at 65% field capacity. The data regarding flowering survival rates, antioxidant protein activity, and proline content, were collected. Results indicated that parameters like flower survival percentage, number of fruits per plant, and fruit weight had significant differences among the genotypes in both treatments. A high proline level was observed in Green Wonder at the pod formation stage compared to other genotypes. Capsaicin contents of hot pepper genotypes were affected at the pod formation stage. Antioxidants like GPX were highly active (190 units) in Ghotki at pod formation. Bell pepper genotypes had a high APX activity, highly observed (100 units) in PPE-311 at pod formation, and significantly differ from hot pepper genotypes. In the catalase case, all the genotypes had the highest values in DP compared to control and DF, but Pusajuala (91 units) and Green Wonder (83 units) performed best compared to other genotypes. Overall, the results indicate that drought stress decreased reproductive growth parameters and pungency of pepper fruit as most of the plant energy was consumed in defense molecules (antioxidants). Therefore, water availability at the flowering and pod formation stage is critical to ensure good yield and pepper quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3acapsaicin 3acatalase 3adrought 3aenergy 3afield capacity 3aflowers 3afruit weight 3afruits 3ahot peppers 3apepper 3aplacenta 3aproline 3aproteins 3asecondary metabolites 3asweet peppers 3awater stress1 aRana, Rashid Mehmood1 aAhmar, Sunny 1 aSaeed, Saima 1 aGulzar, Asma 1 aKhan, Muhammad Azam1 aWattoo, Fahad Masoud1 aWang, Xiukang 1 aBranca, F.q(Ferdinando),1 aMora-Poblete, Freddy 1 aMafra, Gabrielle Sousa1 aDu, Xionming 0 tPlants.g2021 June 24, v. 10, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants100712863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01517naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001900154245004800173300001600221520063700237592002800874650001200902650001600914650001100930650001100941650001600952700001600968700001900984773008001003856008801083990002301171852000901194655001201203IND60096326620221118040704.0141104e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009632662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cryogenics.2012.02.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDang, Haizheng10a10W/90K single-stage pulse tube cryocoolers  ap. 221-225.  aA single-stage 10W/90K coaxial pulse tube cryocooler has been developed for space-borne optics cooling.

The reject temperature dependence experiments on the EM show a smaller slope of 10.2W/10K and indicate a good adaptability to the reject temperature range from 290K to 333K.  aPublisher supplied data 3acooling 3aengineering 3amodels 3aoptics 3atemperature1 aWang, Libao1 aYang, Kaixiang0 tCryogenics.g2012 , v. 52, no. 4-6 p.221-225dElsevier Ltdx0011-22757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cryogenics.2012.02.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03867naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006200147245019500209300001400404520192000418592002802338596006102366596007502427596006402502596006402566596017202630650002202802650002402824650001702848650002302865650002002888650002002908650001502928650001102943650002002954650002302974650004302997651001003040700002303050700001603073700002103089700001803110700001703128700002303145773011403168856008203282852000903364655001203373IND60627817020221120192946.0190314e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062781702DNAL7 a10.1007/s11625-018-0626-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHashimoto, Shizuka1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4423-937410aScenario analysis of land-use and ecosystem services of social-ecological landscapes: implications of alternative development pathways under declining population in the Noto Peninsula, Japan  ap. 53-75.  aPopulation-decline and subsequent underuse of social-ecological landscapes are increasingly being recognized as one of the crucial drivers behind the loss and deterioration of biodiversity and ecosystem services. In line with this, the study aimed to explore how alternative development pathways influence future land-use patterns, biodiversity and ecosystem services against a rapidly declining population in the Noto peninsula of Japan. By combining land-use simulation and evaluation of ecosystem services, the study formulated four exploratory scenarios for 2050, assuming a contrasting level of the society’s reliance on domestic natural capital and different demographic patterns. At first, we analyzeds historical land-use changes between 1997 and 2007 and thereby simulated four plausible alternative scenarios using the Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network model. These scenarios were further used to quantify ecosystem services and landscape heterogeneity (as biodiversity indicator). The scenario analysis demonstrated that future land-use pattern could vary drastically depending on how the society utilize local natural capital even under the severe depopulation trend, whereas demographic patterns, in general, did not make discernible differences in land-use, biodiversity and ecosystem services. Nevertheless, a land-use change made considerable differences in the level of ecosystem services and landscape heterogeneity with varying degrees. Our analysis suggested that ecosystem services such as food production and nitrogen retention as well as landscape heterogeneity would decrease considerably by 2050 under the scenarios where the utilization of local natural capital decline and a significant amount of farmland are abandoned. Our findings highlight the vital role of land-use and agricultural policy in shaping the future availability of ecosystem services and biodiversity in this area.  aPublisher supplied data  aEnvironment ResearchcMinistry of the Environment, Japan  aTechnology Development Fund (S-15)cMinistry of the Environment, Japan  a17KT0076cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science London  aResearchcResearch Institute for Humanity and Nature, Japan  aSocial Implementation of Ecosystem-based Disaster Risk Reduction as Climate Change Adaptation in Shrinking SocietiescResearch Institute for Humanity and Nature, Japan 3aagricultural land 3aagricultural policy 3abiodiversity 3aecosystem services 3afood production 3aland use change 3alandscapes 3amodels 3anatural capital 3anitrogen retention 3asustainability science and engineering 3aJapan1 aDasGupta, Rajarshi1 aKabaya, Kei1 aMatsui, Takanori1 aHaga, Chihiro1 aSaito, Osamu1 aTakeuchi, Kazuhiko0 tSustainability science.g2019 Jan., v. 14, no. 1 p.53-75dSpringer JapanwJournal:J000001136x1862-40657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11625-018-0626-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02667naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245018200163520132900345592002801674650001701702650001801719650001701737650001301754650001401767650001301781650001101794650001701805650001201822650001401834650002901848700002601877700001901903700002101922700002101943700002101964700002501985700002802010773012002038856007802158852000902236655001202245IND60745583420221121225517.0210723e20210624xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074558342DNAL7 a10.3390/plants100712912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaruso, Paola 12aA Transcriptional Analysis of the Genes Involved in the Ascorbic Acid Pathways Based on a Comparison of the Juice and Leaves of Navel and Anthocyanin-Rich Sweet Orange Varieties  aSweet oranges are an important source of ascorbic acid (AsA). In this study, the content of AsA in the juice and leaves of four orange clonal selections, different in terms of maturity time and the presence/absence of anthocyanins, was correlated with the transcription levels of the main genes involved in the biosynthesis, recycling, and degradation pathways. Within each variety, differences in the above pathways and the AsA amount were found between the analysed tissues. Variations were also observed at different stages of fruit development and maturation. At the beginning of fruit development, AsA accumulation was attributable to the synergic action of l-galactose and Myo-inositol, while the l-gulose pathway was predominant between the end of fruit development and the beginning of ripening. In leaves, the l-galactose pathway appeared to play a major role in AsA accumulation, even though higher GalUr isoform expression suggests a synergistic contribution of both pathways in this tissue. In juice, the trend of the AsA content may be related to the decrease in the transcription levels of the GME, GDH, MyoOx, and GalUr12 genes. Newhall was the genotype that accumulated the most AsA. The difference between Newhall and the other varieties seems to be attributable to the GLDH, GalUr12, APX2, and DHAR3 genes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthocyanins 3aascorbic acid 3abiosynthesis 3afruiting 3agalactose 3agenotype 3ajuices 3amyo-inositol 3aoranges 3asynergism 3atranscription (genetics)1 aRusso, Maria Patrizia1 aCaruso, Marco 1 aGuardo, Mario Di1 aRusso, Giuseppe 1 aFabroni, Simona 1 aTimpanaro, Nicolina 1 aLicciardello, Concetta 0 tPlants.g2021 June 24, v. 10, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants100712913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03165naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001800171245016300189300001800352500001500370520156100385592002801946650001501974650001501989650002202004650001302026650001702039650001002056650000902066650002202075650001502097650001402112650000902126650001802135650004002153650001202193650002502205650004902230650001402279650002202293650001102315650002302326650002302349650002602372653001502398700002302413700002102436773010202457856005502559852000902614655001202623IND4468214820221121222336.0120418e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446821482DNAL7 a222573132pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2011.05429.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aORSINI, LUISA10aGenomic signature of natural and anthropogenic stress in wild populations of the waterflea Daphnia magna: validation in space, time and experimental evolution  ap. 2160-2175.  a2019-12-06  aNatural populations are confronted with multiple selection pressures resulting in a mosaic of environmental stressors at the landscape level. Identifying the genetic underpinning of adaptation to these complex selection environments and assigning causes of natural selection within multidimensional selection regimes in the wild is challenging. The water flea Daphnia is a renowned ecological model system with its well‐documented ecology, the possibility to analyse subfossil dormant egg banks and the short generation time allowing an experimental evolution approach. Capitalizing on the strengths of this model system, we here link candidate genome regions to three selection pressures, known to induce micro‐evolutionary responses in Daphnia magna: fish predation, parasitism and land use. Using a genome scan approach in space, time and experimental evolution trials, we provide solid evidence of selection at the genome level under well‐characterized environmental gradients in the wild and identify candidate genes linked to the three environmental stressors. Our study reveals differential selection at the genome level in Daphnia populations and provides evidence for repeatable patterns of local adaptation in a geographic mosaic of environmental stressors fuelled by standing genetic variation. Our results imply high evolutionary potential of local populations, which is relevant to understand the dynamics of trait changes in natural populations and their impact on community and ecosystem responses through eco‐evolutionary feedbacks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aparasitism 3alandscapes 3agenetic variation 3aland use 3aSiphonaptera 3agenes 3afish 3anatural selection 3aecosystems 3apredation 3aeggs 3aDaphnia magna 2aAdaptation, Physiologicalxgenetics 2aAnimals 2aBiological Evolution 2aDaphniaxgeneticsxparasitologyxphysiology. 2aEcosystem 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenome 2aPredatory Behavior 2aSelection, Genetic 2aStress, Physiological 0aadaptation1 aSPANIER, KATINA I.1 aMeester, Luc de,0 tMolecular ecology.g2012 May, v. 21, no. 9 p.2160-2175dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2011.05429.x  aDNAL 7aarticle01873naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002300142245009800165300001400263500001900277520065200296592002800948650001800976650001300994650002301007650001301030650001901043651001101062653001801073653001201091653001601103653001501119653001301134653001001147653001601157653001301173653001601186653000801202700002701210773011701237856007601354852000901430655001201439IND60697361320221120235425.0200605e20170831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069736132DNAL7 a10.3897/jhr.58.129192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhalaim, Andrey I.10aIchneumonidae (Hymenoptera) associated with xyelid sawflies (Hymenoptera, Xyelidae) in Mexico  ap. 17-27.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTwo species of ichneumon wasps (Ichneumonidae), Gelaneshorstmanni Khalaim, sp. n.

However, the relationship between body size and trophic ecology can be highly variable both within and between closely-related and similarly-sized species. In this study we compared the intra- and interspecific relationship between body size and trophic position for North American Yellow Perch Perca flavescens and European Perch Perca fluviatilis, which share similarities in morphology, life history traits and trophic requirements. We used stable isotope ratios (δ¹⁵N and δ¹³C) to characterize differences in size-dependency of trophic position and to trace consumer foraging history of Yellow Perch in lakes in the Northwestern United States and European Perch in lakes in Germany. The trophic position and stable isotope ratios of Yellow Perch and European Perch steadily increased with total body length, but European Perch were consistently feeding at higher trophic positions than Yellow Perch at a given length. European Perch occupied considerably higher trophic positions (mean trophic position = 3.9) than Yellow Perch (mean trophic position = 2.8). Large European Perch were increasingly piscivorous, whereas large Yellow Perch were more opportunistic and omnivorous predators of invertebrate prey. Overall, the trophic position among individual Yellow Perch varied more strongly than in European Perch. We conclude that both species similarly increase in trophic position with size, but the specific size-dependency of both trophic position and resource use varies with taxonomy and local ecological conditions. Thus, body size as a sole measure of trophic position should be considered cautiously when generalizing across populations and species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPerca flavescens 3aPerca fluviatilis 3abody length 3acarbon 3aforaging 3afreshwater ecosystems 3ainvertebrates 3alakes 3alife history 3aniches 3anitrogen 3aomnivores 3apiscivores 3apredators 3astable isotopes 3ataxonomy 3aGermany 3aNorthwestern United States1 aTwardochleb, LauraA.1 aOlden, JulianD.1 aMehner, Thomas1 aArlinghaus, Robert0 tEnvironmental biology of fishes.g2018 Jan., v. 101, no. 1 p.23-37dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl43475x0378-19097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-017-0678-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01542naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002300112245004600135300001600181520073500197592002800932653001500960653001000975653001300985653002200998653001201020700002001032700002301052700002701075700001801102773011101120852000901231655001201240IND60125261720221119190118.0151124e200308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012526172DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStrayer, David L.,12aA Classification of Ecological Boundaries  ap. 723-729.  aEcologists use the term boundary to refer to a wide range of real and conceptual structures. Because imprecise terminology may impede the search for general patterns and theories about ecological boundaries, we present a classification of the attributes of ecological boundaries to aid in communication and theory development. Ecological boundaries may differ in their origin and maintenance, their spatial structure, their function, and their temporal dynamics. A classification system based on these attributes should help ecologists determine whether boundaries are truly comparable. This system can be applied when comparing empirical studies, comparing theories, and testing theoretical predictions against empirical results.  aPublisher supplied data 0aboundaries 0aedges 0aecotones 0alandscape ecology 0apatches1 aPower, Mary E.,1 aFagan, William F.,1 aPICKETT, STEWARD T.

The standards are the minimum information about a single amplified genome (MISAG) and the minimum information about a metagenome-assembled genome (MIMAG), including (but not limited to) assembly quality, and estimates of genome completeness and contamination. These standards can be used in combination with other GSC checklists including the minimum information about a genome sequence (MIGS), minimum information about a metagenomic sequence (MIMS) and minimum information about a marker gene sequence (MIMARKS). Community-wide adoption of MISAG and MIMAG will facilitate more robust comparative genomic analyses of bacterial and archaeal diversity.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArchaea 3abacteria 3abiotechnology 3agenetic markers 3agenome 3ainformation 3ametagenomics 3anucleotide sequences 3astandards and grades1 aKyrpides, Nikos C.1 aStepanauskas, Ramunas1 aHarmon-Smith, Miranda1 aDoud, Devin1 aReddy, T.

This reciprocal relationship occurs via cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) such as integrins, selectins, cadherins and IgSF adhesion molecules. To study these cell-ECM interactions, researchers use two-dimensional substrates or three-dimensional matrices composed of native proteins or bioactive peptide sequences to study single cell function. While two-dimensional substrates provide valuable information about cell-ECM interactions, three-dimensional matrices more closely mimic the native ECM; cells cultured in three-dimensional matrices have demonstrated greater cell movement and increased integrin expression when compared to cells cultured on two-dimensional substrates. In this article we review a number of cellular processes (adhesion, motility, phagocytosis, differentiation and survival) and examine the cell adhesion molecules and ECM proteins (or bioactive peptide sequences) that mediate cell functionality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3abioactive properties 3acadherins 3acell adhesion 3acell movement 3acultured cells 3aextracellular matrix 3ahumans 3aintegrins 3aphagocytosis 3atissue repair1 aGonzalez, Anjelica L.0 tFrontiers in biology.g2013 Feb., v. 8, no. 1 p.32-49dSpringer-Verlagx1674-79847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11515-012-1199-x  aDNAL 7aarticle02542naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245008100166300001600247520116200263592002801425650002001453650001501473650002301488650001801511650001501529650001301544650001801557650001701575650001601592650003001608650001501638650001101653650002101664650002101685650001501706650001501721653001801736653001401754653001501768653001701783700001901800700002301819773012501842856008401967852000902051655001202060IND60519012620221121115612.0160420e20160425xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051901262DNAL7 a10.1080/10408398.2012.7410822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Hanru10aPrebiotics: A Potential Treatment Strategy for the Chemotherapy-damaged Gut?  ap. 946-956.  aMucositis, characterized by ulcerative lesions along the alimentary tract, is a common consequence of many chemotherapy regimens. Chemotherapy negatively disrupts the intestinal microbiota, resulting in increased numbers of potentially pathogenic bacteria, such as Clostridia and Enterobacteriaceae, and decreased numbers of “beneficial” bacteria, such as Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria. Agents capable of restoring homeostasis in the bowel microbiota could, therefore, be applicable to mucositis. Prebiotics are indigestible compounds, commonly oligosaccharides, that seek to reverse chemotherapy-induced intestinal dysbiosis through selective colonization of the intestinal microbiota by probiotic bacteria. In addition, evidence is emerging that certain prebiotics contribute to nutrient digestibility and absorption, modulate intestinal barrier function through effects on mucin expression, and also modify mucosal immune responses, possibly via inflammasome-mediated processes. This review examines the known mechanisms of prebiotic action, and explores their potential for reducing the severity of chemotherapy-induced mucositis in the intestine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBifidobacterium 3aClostridia 3aEnterobacteriaceae 3aLactobacillus 3aabsorption 3abacteria 3adigestibility 3adrug therapy 3ahomeostasis 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3amucins 3amucosal immunity 3aoligosaccharides 3aprebiotics 3aprobiotics 0aAnimal models 0amucositis 0aprebiotics 0achemotherapy1 aGeier, Mark S.1 aHowarth, Gordon S.0 tCritical reviews in food science and nutrition.g2016 Apr. 25, v. 56, no. 6 p.946-956dTaylor & Francisx1549-78527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2012.7410823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01404naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002500154245005300179300001600232520055100248592002800799650002500827650001500852650002100867650000900888650001700897773008000914856008800994990002301082852000901105655001201114IND60096327020221118040630.0141104e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009632702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cryogenics.2012.01.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNotardonato, William10aActive control of cryogenic propellants in space  ap. 236-242.  aA new era of space exploration is being planned.

The three monotypic genera (Liparophyllum, Menyanthes, and Nephrophyllidium) are clearly differentiated morphologically, but the two larger genera (Nymphoides and Villarsia) contain several taxa of uncertain affinity. We undertook a phylogenetic analysis, using a combination of morphological and molecular data, to resolve relationships among species and to evaluate the current circumscription of genera. DNA sequence data for nuclear (ITS) and chloroplast (rbcL and trnK/matK) gene regions were largely congruent (by partition-homogeneity test), and a combined data phylogeny revealed several strongly supported relationships. Analyses using asterid outgroup taxa supported the monophyly of Menyanthaceae. Menyanthes trifoliata and Nephrophyllidium crista-galli comprised a clade sister to the remainder of the family. Species of Nymphoides, except N. exigua, resolved to a single, deeply-nested clade, indicating that the floating-leaved habit is derived evolutionarily within the family. The genus Villarsia comprised a paraphyletic grade toward Nymphoides, wherein the species resolved to three assemblages: (1) a shallowly nested clade containing V. albiflora, V. calthifolia, V. marchantii, V. parnassifolia, V. reniformis, and V. umbricola; (2) an isolated South African clade including V. manningiana and the type species, V. capensis; and (3) a heterogeneous clade of taxa from three genera, including V. exaltata, V. lasiosperma, and V. latifolia, plus the anomalous species V. capitata, V. congestiflora, Liparophyllum gunnii, and Nymphoides exigua. Our results indicate that the genera Menyanthes, Nephrophyllidium, and Nymphoides should be retained as circumscribed, with the exception that Nymphoides exigua should be restored to Villarsia. The genus Villarsia, however, eventually should be subdivided among monophyletic lineages, whereby in the strict sense Villarsia would contain only South African taxa.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAsterales 0aBayesian 0adioecy 0aheterostyly 0aparsimony 0asystematics1 aLes, Donald H.1 aPadgett, Donald J.1 aJacobs, S.

Sampling points were selected to characterize the profile of the organosol within the peatland, the soil profile between the peatland and the agricultural land, and the soil profile of the outlying agricultural land, which is used as permanent grassland. Based on phytocoenological records, a semi-quantitative analysis of taxa in accordance with the Braun–Blanquet scale was performed. The study revealed that the thickness of the peat horizon of the fen in comparison with the bog is very low. In terms of the quality of organic matter, the monitored peatlands are dominated by fresh plant residues such as cellulose and lignin. Differences between individual types of peatlands were also found in the soil reaction and the supply of nitrogen to the organic matter of peat. The values of the soil exchange reaction were neutral on the fen, as well as slightly alkaline but extremely low on the bog. A significantly higher nitrogen supply was found in the organic matter of the fen in contrast to the bog. At the same time, extremely low content of accessible P and an above-limit content of As in the surface horizons were also found on the fen. From the phytocoenological point of view, 22 plant species were identified on the fen, while only five species were identified on the bog, which also affected the higher diversity (H’) and equitability (e). The results of the statistical testing confirmed the diversity of the studied peatlands and the different impact of environmental variables on plant diversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3acellulose 3agrasslands 3alignin 3anitrogen 3aorganic carbon 3apH 3apeat 3apeatlands 3arisk 3asoil profiles 3aspecies diversity1 aBarančíková, Gabriela 1 aFazekaš, Juraj 1 aŠtofejová, Lenka 1 aHalas, Jan,1 aLitavec, Tadeáš 1 aLiptaj, Tibor 0 tPlants.g2021 June 24, v. 10, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants100712903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03400naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024001700117024002900134024001200163040001800175100002700193245015900220300001600379506017300395520136300568650001801931650003001949650002501979650001102004650002102015650001302036650002202049650001202071650002102083650001002104650002202114650001002136650001302146650001602159650003302175650001302208650001002221650001202231650001602243700001702259700001902276700002302295700002002318700002302338773016002361856011402521856007602635956008502711961001702796852000902813655001202822IND60580185220221214224404.0170819e20161019xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058018522DNAL7 a10113/58018522hdl7 a3295852aris7 a10.1093/aesa/saw0692doi8 ans13112  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRanger, Christopher M.10aComparative morphology and distribution of antennal sensilla on Xylosandrus germanus and Xylosandrus crassiusculus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae)  ap. 172-188.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aThe non-native ambrosia beetles Xylosandrus germanus (Blandford) and Xylosandrus crassiusculus (Motschulsky) are destructive pests of plants and trees growing in ornamental nurseries and tree fruit orchards. Olfaction plays an important role in aiding female X. germanus and X. crassiusculus in locating suitable hosts; adult males of both species are flightless and not involved in host selection. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to characterize the antennae of both species, which consisted of a scape, funicle, and club. Emphasis was placed on the type, structure, and distribution of sensilla associated with the antennal clubs of female and male X. germanus and X. crassiusculus. Sensilla observed on the anterior surface of the club for females and males of both species include one type of sensillum chaeticum (SC1), one type of sensillum trichodeum (ST1), and five types of sensilla basiconica (SB1–5). The SB1 are the most abundant sensilla type found on female and male clubs for both species. Densities and distributions of these sensilla types on the antennal club are described, and possible functions are discussed based on morphology. These results provide an improved understanding of sensilla associated with X. germanus and X. crassiusculus that will aid electrophysiological investigations into their host selection behavior. 3aCurculionidae 3aXylosandrus crassiusculus 3aXylosandrus germanus 3aadults 3aambrosia beetles 3aantennae 3aelectrophysiology 3afemales 3ahost preferences 3ahosts 3ainsect morphology 3amales 3aorchards 3aplant pests 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asensilla 3asmell 3asociety 3atree fruits1 aHorst, Leona1 aBarnett, Jenny1 aReding, Michael E.1 aAnderson, Betsy1 aKrause, Charles R.0 tAnnals of the entomological society of america.g2016 Oct. 19, v. 110, no. 2 p.172-188dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44731x0013-87467nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/58018523Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aesa/saw0693Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/329585.pdf  aUSDA/ARSUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02850naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003000150245015800180300001400338520144000352592002801792650002101820650001501841650001801856650001501874650001301889650001101902650002001913650001701933650001601950650002101966650001401987650001202001653002202013653002602035653002402061653001502085653002602100653002302126700001902149700002502168773010602193856008402299852000902383655001202392IND60600508520221119223551.0180703e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060050852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2013.10.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartínez de Yuso, Alicia10aInfluence of activation atmosphere used in the chemical activation of almond shell on the characteristics and adsorption performance of activated carbons  ap. 74-80.  aThe aim of this work was to compare the effect of different activating atmospheres on the final properties and adsorption performance of activated carbons. Almond shell based activated carbons have been obtained by chemical activation with phosphoric acid. Two sets of activated carbons were prepared. First set was prepared under inert atmosphere at different impregnation ratios, temperatures and times of activation. Second set of activated carbons was prepared at the same activating conditions except the activating atmosphere using an oxidant one. Activated carbons prepared under both activation atmospheres were characterized by elemental analysis (EA), thermogravimetry (TGA), temperature programmed desorption (TPD), point zero charge (PZC), Boehm titration and N2 physisorption. To study the adsorption performance of the activated carbons toluene adsorption–desorption isotherms were determined gravimetrically. The results obtained confirm that the activating atmosphere has a strong influence on the final characteristics of the activated carbons. Activated carbons with higher oxygen content and more negative surface charge have been obtained by changing the activating atmosphere by an oxidant one. Surface area is also higher for activated carbons prepared under oxidant atmosphere. However toluene adsorption capacity is lower for activated carbons prepared under oxidant atmosphere due to their surface chemistry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3aalmond shells 3adesorption 3aoxidants 3aoxygen 3aphosphoric acid 3asurface area 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 3atitration 3atoluene 0aActivated carbons 0aActivation atmosphere 0aChemical activation 0aAdsorption 0aAir pollution control 0aAgricultural waste1 aRubio, Begoña1 aIzquierdo, M.

Most atmospheric inputs to ecosystems have to pass through the soil; thus, the atmosphere––soil boundary influences the type and amount of materials and energy entering the soil. Belowground plant inputs occur through the rhizosphere, the zone of soil immediately adjacent to the root. This soil boundary layer affects root inputs to soil and root extraction of water and nutrients from soil. We discuss how water, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen dynamics are affected by atmosphere––soil and soil––root boundaries and how light, soil pH, and dust are affected by the atmosphere––soil boundary. (We also examine pH with regard to the root––soil boundary, but not in a separate section.) We examine the linkages between these small-scale boundaries and landscape ecology and discuss how the understanding of small-scale boundaries can contribute to the emerging field of boundary theory.  aPublisher supplied data 0abiological soil crusts 0arhizosphere 0anutrient cycles 0anitrogen 0acarbon1 aHAWKES, CHRISTINE V.1 aFIRESTONE, MARY K.0 tBioScience.g2003 Aug., v. 53, no. 8 p.739-749dAmerican Institute of Biological Sciencesx0006-35687nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02689naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245013100168300001600299520169700315592002802012653001702040653002502057653002102082653001402103653001702117653001302134700002402147773012302171856008402294852000902378655001202387IND60130179120221119031421.0151127e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013017912DNAL7 a10.1600/0363644087856798792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBell, Hester L.10aProposal for an Expanded Distichlis (Poaceae, Chloridoideae): Support from Molecular, Morphological, And Anatomical Characters  ap. 536-551.  aThe Distichlis clade comprises Distichlis (7 species), Monanthochloëë (2), and Reederochloa (1). All species except D. distichophylla (endemic to Australia) and D. spicata (widespread in the New World) are restricted either to North or South America. We investigated phylogenetic relationships within the clade using chloroplast (trnL––F and ndhF) and nuclear ribosomal (internal transcribed spacers and 5.8S) DNA sequences. We also studied lemma micromorphology, leaf blade anatomy, macromorphology, and biogeography in a phylogenetic context. The Distichlis clade is strongly supported in the molecular analyses. A morphological synapomorphy for the clade is the presence of a single papilla on the center of each subsidiary cell of lemma stomata. Other diagnostic features include dioecy, rhizomes or stolons, conspicuously distichous leaves, 5––13 lemma nerves, dumbbell- or flask-shaped bicellular microhairs with sunken basal cells, and growth in alkaline or saline soils. The nuclear and chloroplast phylogenies indicate that Monanthochloëë and Reederochloa are nested within a paraphyletic Distichlis, and a number of structural characters, including leaf blade length, number of spikelets per inflorescence, and number of florets per spikelet, also fall within the range of variation in Distichlis. Therefore, we propose expanding the circumscription of Distichlis to include Monanthochloëë and Reederochloa, and make the following new combinations: Distichlis acerosa, D. eludens , and D. littoralis . Biogeographical analysis revealed that the group likely originated in North America followed by a number of long-distance dispersal events, including back dispersals.  aPublisher supplied data 0aBiogeography 0ageneric delimitation 0aMonanthochloëë 0aphylogeny 0aReederochloa 0ataxonomy1 aColumbus, J.

We show that the N-terminal 78kDa polyprotein (R78) of MCDV acts as a suppressor of RNA silencing in a well-established assay system. We further demonstrate that R78 is cleaved by the viral 3C-like protease into 51 and 27kDa proteins (p51 and p27), and that p51 is responsible for silencing suppressor activity. Silencing suppressor activity of R78 is conserved in three divergent MCDV strains (MCDV-Severe, MCDV-M1, and MCDV-Tennessee), as well as the waikavirus Bellflower vein chlorosis virus, but was not detected for orthologous protein of Rice tungro spherical virus (RTSV-A) or the similarly-positioned protein from the sequivirus Parsnip yellow fleck virus (PYFV).

The physical phenomena involve unsteady two-phase vapor–liquid flow and intense boiling heat transfer of the cryogenic fluid that is coupled with the transient heat conduction inside pipe walls. The objective for the present study is to compare the chilldown rates and flow patterns between the upward flow and downward flow in a vertical pipe. Liquid nitrogen is employed as the working fluid and the test section is a vertical straight segment of a Pyrex glass pipe with an inner diameter of 8mm. The effects of mass flow rate on the flow patterns, heat transfer characteristics and interface movement were determined through experiments performed under several different mass flow rates. Through flow visualization, measurement and analysis on the flow patterns and temperature variations, a physical explanation of the vertical chilldown is given. By observing the process and analyzing the results, it is concluded that pipe chilldown in a vertical flow is similar to that in microgravity to some extent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboiling 3acryogenics 3aglass 3aheat transfer 3amass flow 3amicrogravity 3anitrogen 3aphysical phenomena 3atemperature1 aChung, Jacob N.1 aAmber, Samuel H.0 tCryogenics.g2012 , v. 52, no. 4-6 p.268-277dElsevier Ltdx0011-22757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cryogenics.2012.01.0333Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle04211naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245009400185300001600279500001500295520185100310592002802161650002902189650002402218650001202242650002202254650001302276650001902289650002102308650003002329650002302359650002102382650002102403650002702424650001402451650001602465650001802481650003502499650001402534650002702548650003202575650002802607650003302635650002702668650001402695650005002709650003502759650005902794650001102853650001702864650005102881650001602932650001802948650004902966650007003015650005403085653001803139700002003157700001903177700001903196700001503215700002403230700002103254773011203275856008103387852000903468655001203477IND4458823320221119221242.0141111e20110614xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445882332DNAL7 a215247002pmid7 a10.1016/j.jep.2011.04.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFazliana, Mansor10aLabisia pumila var. alata reduces bacterial load by inducing uroepithelial cell apoptosis  ap. 111-116.  a2019-12-06  aETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Labisia pumila var. alata (LPva) is a traditional medicinal herb used by Malaysian women to treat many ailments of the genitourinary tract. Its phytoestrogenic properties suggest potential to prevent recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) in women post menopause. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the mechanisms of action of LPva in an in vitro model of UTI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bladder epithelial cell lines T24 and 5637 and uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) strain CFT073 were used to model uroepithelial infection. The ability of LPva to induce programmed cell death was tested using the Annexin-V-FLUOS and TUNEL assays. Expression of caveolin-1, β1 integrin and antimicrobial peptides HBD-2 and LL-37 in response to LPva treatment and/or infection, was assessed using RT real-time PCR. Effects on protein expression were confirmed by Western blot analysis. Sensitivity and yeast agglutination assays were employed to determine if LPva had antimicrobial activities and/or interacted with type 1 fimbriae, respectively. Finally, bacterial adherence and invasion to cells treated with LPva was examined. RESULTS: LPva induced uroepithelial apoptosis which was coupled with upregulated expression of caveolin-1 and downregulation of β1 integrin. LPva did not exhibit direct antimicrobial properties and did not influence antimicrobial peptide levels in cells. Additionally, LPva did not interact with type 1 fimbriae and did not affect adherence in comparison to non-treated control cells. However, LPva significantly reduced the number of intracellular UPEC in bladder epithelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that LPva has beneficial applications against UPEC infection due to its ability to induce programmed cell death and reduce bacterial invasion of the uroepithelium.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantimicrobial properties 3amechanism of action 3abladder 3aprotein synthesis 3afimbriae 3amicrobial load 3aepithelial cells 3apolymerase chain reaction 3abacterial adhesion 3amedicinal plants 3aWestern blotting 3aantimicrobial peptides 3abioassays 3aPrimulaceae 3aagglutination 3auropathogenic Escherichia coli 3aapoptosis 3aurinary tract diseases 2aIntegrin beta1xmetabolism. 2aApoptosisxdrug effects 2aBacterial Loadxdrug effects 2aCaveolin 1xmetabolism 2aCell Line 2aEpithelial Cellsxdrug effectsxmicrobiology. 2aEscherichia colixdrug effects 2aEscherichia coli Infectionsxdrug therapyxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aPhytotherapy 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aPrimulaceae 2aUp-Regulation 2aUrinary Bladderxdrug effectsxmicrobiology. 2aUrinary Tract Infectionsxdrug therapyxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aUrotheliumxcytologyxdrug effectsxmicrobiology. 0acell invasion1 aRamos, Nubia L.1 aLüthje, Petra1 aSekikubo, Musa1 aHolm, Åsa1 aWan Nazaimoon, W.M.1 aBrauner, Annelie0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2011 June 14, v. 136, no. 1 p.111-116dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2011.04.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03635naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024003700113040001800150100002000168245017100188300001800359520200700377592002802384650001302412650002102425650002502446650001302471650001402484650000902498650001402507650001702521650001102538650001302549650002202562650001402584650001002598650001802608650000902626650003102635700002402666700001902690700002202709700002102731700001902752700002202771773010702793856011202900856008303012961001303095852000903108655001203117IND4460188920221118170732.0141111e20110901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446018892DNAL7 a10113/502802hdl7 a10.1016/j.jplph.2011.01.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPiesik, Dariusz10aFusarium infection in maize: Volatile induction of infected and neighboring uninfected plants has the potential to attract a pest cereal leaf beetle, Oulema melanopus  ap. 1534-1542.  aFusarium infection of maize leaves and/or roots through the soil can stimulate the emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). It is also well known that VOC emission from maize plants can repel or attract pests. In our experiments, we studied VOC induction responses of Zea mays L. ssp. mays cv. ‘Prosna’ having Fusarium infection (mix of four species) in leaves or roots, then tested for VOC induction of uninfected neighboring plants, and finally examined wind-tunnel behavioral responses of the adult cereal leaf beetle, Oulema melanopus L. (Chrysomelidae: Coleoptera) behavior to four induced VOCs. In the first part of our experiment, we confirmed that several green leaf volatiles (GLVs; (Z)-3-hexenal, (E)-2-hexenal, (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol, (E)-2-hexen-1-ol, (Z)-3-hexen-1-yl acetate, 1-hexyl acetate), terpenes (β-pinene, β-myrcene, Z-ocimene, linalool, β-caryophyllene), and shikimic acid pathway derivatives (benzyl acetate, methyl salicylate, indole) were positively induced from maize plants infected by Fusarium spp. The quantities of induced VOCs were higher at 7d than 3d post-infection and greater when plants were infected with Fusarium on leaves rather than through soil. In the second part of our experiment, uninfected maize plants also showed significantly positive induction of several VOCs when neighboring an infected plant where the degree of induction was negatively related to the distance from the infected plant. In the third part of our experiment, a Y-tube bioassay was used to evaluate upwind orientation of adult cereal leaf beetles to four individual VOCs. Female and male O. melanopus were significantly attracted to the GLVs (Z)-3-hexenal and (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, and the terpenes linalool and β-caryophyllene. Our results indicate that a pathogen can induce several VOCs in maize plants that also induce VOCs in neighboring uninfected plants, though VOC induction could increase the range at which an insect pest species is attracted to VOC inducing plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium 3aOulema melanopus 3aZea mays subsp. mays 3aacetates 3abioassays 3acorn 3aemissions 3ainsect pests 3aleaves 3alinalool 3amethyl salicylate 3apathogens 3aroots 3ashikimic acid 3asoil 3avolatile organic compounds1 aLemńczyk, Grzegorz1 aSkoczek, Agata1 aLamparski, Robert1 aBocianowski, Jan1 aKotwica, Karol1 aDelaney, Kevin J.0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2011 Sept. 1, v. 168, no. 13 p.1534-1542dElsevier GmbHx0176-16177nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/502803Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2011.01.0323Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02542naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024001700117024003900134040001800173100002800191245006500219300001600284500001500300506017300315520072800488650001501216650002101231650001601252650000901268650001201277650002201289650002101311650001301332650000901345650001201354650001001366650002701376650001901403650001001422650001201432650002801444651001001472653001201482653001001494700002101504700002401525773010501549856011401654856008501768956012901853961000901982852000901991655001202000IND60580185520221214224419.0170819e20170801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058018552DNAL7 a10113/58018552hdl7 a3403192aris7 a10.18681/pjn.v35.i02.p151-1542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIbrahim, Ibrahim Khayry14aThe cyst nematodes Heterodera and Globodera species in Egypt  ap. 151-154.  a2019-12-06  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aA survey was conducted in three governorates Alexandria, El Behera and Sohag of Egypt during 2012-2016 and one hundred seventy-eight soil and root samples were collected for the detection of cyst nematodes.

To address gaps in previous studies, we measured herbivory and defence in the same system, quantified defence with bioassays, and considered effects of leaf age. We quantified herbivory and defence of young and mature leaves along a continental gradient in eastern North America in the native herb Phytolacca americana L. Herbivory in the field declined with latitude and was strongly correlated with lepidopteran abundance. Laboratory bioassays revealed that leaf palatability was positively correlated with latitude of origin. Young leaves were more damaged than mature leaves at lower latitudes in the field, but less palatable in bioassays. Both defence and palatability displayed non‐linear latitudinal patterns, suggesting potential mechanisms based on biological or climatic thresholds. In sum, observational and experimental studies find patterns consistent with high herbivore pressure and stronger plant defences at lower latitudes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLepidoptera 3aPhytolacca americana 3abioassays 3abiocenosis 3acorrelation 3aherbivores 3aindigenous species 3alatitude 3aleaves 3apalatability 3aNorth America1 aSchemske, Douglas W.0 tEcology letters.g2018 Apr., v. 21, no. 4 p.578-587dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3774062x1461-023X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ele.129253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02791naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245007600160300001600236500002000252520149900272592002801771650001501799650001901814650001301833650001101846650002101857650001301878650001601891650001501907650001201922650001801934650002601952650001401978650001401992650001302006650001302019650001102032650001502043650001302058700002402071700002002095773012402115856007302239852000902312655001202321IND60590874220221120100907.0180314e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059087422DNAL7 a10.1111/vop.124932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFreeman, Kate S.10aComparison of anterior segment health in wild and captive common murres  ap. 174-181.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOBJECTIVE: To evaluate and compare the anterior segment health of wild and captive common murres. PROCEDURES: Thirty wild common murres (Uria aalge) were captured and housed in freshwater pools and had an adnexal and anterior segment exam performed prior to a subsequent wildlife health study. The examination included phenol red thread tear tests, fluorescein staining, slit‐lamp biomicroscopy, rebound tonometry, and conjunctival culture sampling. Six captive common murres housed in natural seawater at the Monterey Bay Aquarium were examined in a similar manner. RESULTS: The most common ophthalmic lesion in the wild birds was corneal fibrosis with 55% prevalence, and over half of these were potentially vision threatening. Lenticular opacity (cataract or sclerosis or both) was the most common lesion in captive murres seen in 67% of the eyes. Mean phenol red tear test for all eyes without ulcers was 20 ± 3.6 mm. Mean intraocular pressure for all eyes without ulcers or flare was 23 ± 2.6 mmHg. The wild murres had a low percentage (17%) of positive conjunctival cultures. The captive murres had no growth on any culture. CONCLUSIONS: Wild murres are more likely to suffer corneal lesions, whereas captive murres are more likely to experience age‐related lenticular diseases. Corneal scarring indicates that wild murres are frequently exposed to ocular trauma and the body condition scores indicate they appear to remain successful predators despite some vision compromise.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUria aalge 3abody condition 3acataract 3acornea 3acorneal diseases 3afibrosis 3afluorescein 3afreshwater 3aopacity 3aophthalmology 3aphenolsulfonphthalein 3apredators 3asclerosis 3aseawater 3astaining 3avision 3awild birds 3awildlife1 aFiorello, Christine1 aMurray, Michael0 tVeterinary ophthalmology.g2018 Mar., v. 21, no. 2 p.174-181dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl58131x1463-52167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vop.124933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03329naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154100002600172245014900198300001600347520164500363592002802008650001402036650002002050650001202070650001302082650001002095650001002105650001502115650001802130650001302148650002002161650001302181650001802194650002202212650001102234650001302245650001202258650003502270650003702305650005202342650003502394650003602429650003902465650003202504700002302536700002602559700002102585773008302606856008902689852000902778655001202787IND4466417220221117160156.0141110e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446641722DNAL7 a212159892pmid7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2010.12.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCalhôa, Carla Filipa14aThe influence of metal speciation on the bioavailability and sub-cellular distribution of cadmium to the terrestrial isopod, Porcellio dilatatus  ap. 531-537.  aCadmium is a non-essential toxic metal that is able to bioaccumulate in both flora fauna and has the potential to biomagnify in some food chains. However, the form in which cadmium is presented to consumers can alter the bioavailability and possibly the internal distribution of assimilated Cd. Previous studies in our laboratory highlighted differences in Cd assimilation among isopods when they were provided with a plant-based food with either Cd biologically incorporated into plant tissue or superficially amended with ionic Cd²⁺. Cd is known for its high affinity for sulphur ligands in cysteine residues which form the basis for metal-binding proteins such as metallothionein. This study compares Cd assimilation efficiency (AE) in Porcellio dilatatus fed with food amended with either cadmium cysteinate or cadmium nitrate in an examination of the influence of Cd speciation on metal bioavailability followed by an examination of the sub-cellular distribution using a centrifugal fractionation protocol. As hypothesized the AE of Cd among isopods fed with Cd(NO₃)₂ (64%, SE=5%) was higher than AE for isopods fed with Cd(Cys)₂ (20%, SE=3%). The sub-cellular distribution also depended on the Cd species provided. Those isopods fed Cd(Cys)₂ allocated significantly more Cd to the cell debris and organelles fractions at the expense of allocation to metal-rich granules (MRG). The significance of the difference in sub-cellular distribution with regard to toxicity is discussed. This paper demonstrates that the assimilation and internal detoxification of Cd is dependent on the chemical form of Cd presented to the isopod.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPorcellio 3abioavailability 3acadmium 3acysteine 3afauna 3aflora 3afood chain 3afractionation 3agranules 3ametallothionein 3anitrates 3aplant tissues 3aplant-based foods 3asulfur 3atoxicity 2aAnimals 2aCadmiumxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aEnvironmental Pollutantsxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aFeeding Behaviorxdrug effects 2aIntracellular Spacexmetabolism 2aIsopodaxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aMetallothioneinxmetabolism1 aMonteiro, Marta S.1 aSoares, Amadeu M.V.M.1 aMann, Reinier M.0 tChemosphere.g2011 Apr., v. 83, no. 4 p.531-537dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2010.12.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02492naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245011100164300001600275520149700291592002801788653003401816653001601850653001601866653001501882653001201897653001201909700002501921700001601946773012301962856008402085852000902169655001202178IND60130179620221119033320.0151127e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013017962DNAL7 a10.1600/0363644087865001632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTheis, Nina10aPhylogenetics of the Caprifolieae and Lonicera (Dipsacales) Based on Nuclear and Chloroplast DNA Sequences  ap. 776-783.  aRecent phylogenetic analyses of the Dipsacales strongly support a Caprifolieae clade within Caprifoliaceae including Leycesteria, Triosteum, Symphoricarpos, and Lonicera. Relationships within Caprifolieae, however, remain quite uncertain, and the monophyly of Lonicera, the most species-rich of the traditional genera, and its subdivisions, need to be evaluated. In this study we used sequences of the ITS region of nuclear ribosomal DNA and five chloroplast non-coding regions (rpoB––trnC spacer, atpB––rbcL spacer, trnS––trnG spacer, petN––psbM spacer, and psbM––trnD spacer) to address these problems. Our results indicate that Heptacodium is sister to Caprifolieae, Triosteum is sister to the remaining genera within the tribe, and Leycesteria and Symphoricarpos form a clade that is sister to a monophyletic Lonicera. Within Lonicera, the major split is between subgenus Caprifolium and subgenus Lonicera. Within subgenus Lonicera, sections Coeloxylosteum, Isoxylosteum, and Nintooa are nested within the paraphyletic section Isika. Section Nintooa may also be non-monophyletic. Our analysis of the genus Lonicera highlights instances of homoplasy in several morphological characters (e.g. hollow stems in subgenus Caprifolium and section Coeloxylosteum in subgenus Lonicera). Furthermore, our data indicate possible instances of hybridization in section Nintooa and biogeographic disjuctions between the Old and New Worlds (e.g. subsections Distegiae and Alpigenae).  aPublisher supplied data 0achloroplast non-coding region 0aHeptacodium 0ahoneysuckle 0aKolkwitzia 0aWeigela 0aZabelia1 aDonoghue, Michael J.1 aLi, Jianhua0 tSystematic botany.g2008 Oct., v. 33, no. 4 p.776-783dThe American Society of Plant Taxonomists, Incx0363-64457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1600%2F0363644087865001633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02349naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245012100166300001600287520130800303592002801611650001901639650001101658650001601669650001401685650001101699650001801710650001501728651001001743651001801753700001201771700001701783700001701800773007801817856008301895852000901978655001201987IND60096870820221120122346.0141104e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009687082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2012.05.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Qingqing10aIntegrated inventory-based carbon accounting for energy-induced emissions in Chongming eco-island of Shanghai, China  ap. 173-181.  aThe majority of the total carbon emissions in China are energy induced. A clear understanding of energy-induced carbon emissions is therefore necessary for local communities to develop a better carbon emissions management system. We develop an integrated inventory method for energy-induced carbon emissions accounting in local Chinese communities. The method combines scope and sectoral analyses on the basis of local statistical features. As an outcome four core findings are presented: (1) From 2000 to 2009, the energy-induced carbon emissions of Chongming rapidly increased from 1.75 to 4.90 million tons, with the annual growth rate of 12.12%. (2) Emissions from manufacturing, construction, and household sectors accounted for 84.44%; manufacturing is the biggest emitting sector. (3) Carbon emissions from imported electricity reached a historic high of 22.51% in 2009, indicating the necessity of taking the imported carbon emissions into consideration. (4) In 2008, the per capita carbon emissions of Chongming were lower than that of the United States and Shanghai, but higher than that of the global average. Three strategic approaches are proposed: to optimize industrial structure and improve efficiency, reinforce carbon management for the household sector, and enhance carbon statistics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChinese people 3acarbon 3aelectricity 3aemissions 3aenergy 3amanufacturing 3astatistics 3aChina 3aUnited States1 aGuo, Ru1 aLi, Fengting1 aXia, Bingbin0 tEnergy policy.g2012 Oct., v. 49 p.173-181dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2012.05.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03133naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003300148245011900181300002000300520162700320592002801947650001701975650001401992650001502006650001602021650001302037650002002050650001102070650001502081650002802096650001002124650001502134650002302149650001302172651001502185700002102200700002002221700001402241700002302255700002002278700002702298700002102325700002102346700002602367773015502393856008202548852000902630655001202639IND60744396520221118031332.0210713e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074439652DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-12806-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIslam, Abu Reza Md.

The present study explored the spatiotemporal dynamics of wetlands, prediction of wetland risk assessment. The wetland risk assessment was predicted based on ten selected parameters, such as fragmentation probability, distance to road, and settlement. We used M5P, random forest (RF), reduced error pruning tree (REPTree), and support vector machine (SVM) machine learning techniques for wetland risk assessment. The results showed that wetland areas at present are declining less than one-third of those in 1988 due to the construction of the dam at Farakka, which is situated at the upstream of the Padma River. The distance to the river and built-up area are the two most contributing drivers influencing the wetland risk assessment based on information gain ratio (InGR). The prediction results of machine learning models showed 64.48% of area by M5P, 61.75% of area by RF, 62.18% of area by REPTree, and 55.74% of area by SVM have been predicted as the high and very high-risk zones. The results of accuracy assessment showed that the RF outperformed than other models (area under curve: 0.83), followed by the SVM, M5P, and REPTree. Degradation of wetlands explored in this study demonstrated the negative effects on biodiversity. Therefore, to conserve and protect the wetlands, continuous monitoring of wetlands using high resolution satellite images, feeding with the ecological flow, confining built up area and agricultural expansion towards wetlands, and new wetland creation is essential for wetland management.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3apollution 3aprediction 3aprobability 3aresearch 3arisk assessment 3arivers 3asatellites 3asupport vector machines 3atrees 3awatersheds 3awetland management 3awetlands 3aBangladesh1 aTalukdar, Swapan1 aMahato, Susanta1 aZiaul, Sk1 aEibek, Kutub Uddin1 aAkhter, Shumona1 aPhạm, Quó̂c Bảo,1 aMohammadi, Babak1 aKarimi, Firoozeh1 aLinh, Nguyen Thi Thuy0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 July, v. 28, no. 26 p.34450-34471dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-12806-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01839naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245008900169300001600258520094500274592002801219653001701247653001001264653001201274653001701286653001701303653001301320773012301333856008401456852000901540655001201549IND60130179720221119033316.0151127e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013017972DNAL7 a10.1600/0363644087865001722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHofreiter, Anton12aA Revision of Bomarea Subgenus Bomarea s.str.

Seventy-nine species of Bomarea s.str. occur from Mexico (23°°N) to Chile (40°°S) on the western side of the Andes and on the eastern side to 28°°S in Argentina. The 33 species of section Multiflorae can be found from 19°°N to 18°°S. North of Honduras and south of northern Peru they only grow on the eastern slopes of the American Cordilleras. Their distribution is nearly congruent with the distribution of cloud forests. Different species occur from 1500 m to 4500 m; they grow mostly twining, sometimes suberect to erect. They can be found in the cloud forests, the puna, and pááramo. This section includes hummingbird pollinated and insect pollinated species. To date, 75 binomials are validly published, and, in this publication, 33 species are accepted. The distribution, morphology, variability, and ecology of the Multiflorae species are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAlstroemeria 0aAndes 0aBomarea 0acloud forest 0adistribution 0arevision0 tSystematic botany.g2008 Oct., v. 33, no. 4 p.661-684dThe American Society of Plant Taxonomists, Incx0363-64457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1600%2F0363644087865001723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02326naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002400144245012800168520108800296592002801384650002001412650001601432650002701448650001301475650001801488650001301506650001401519650002501533651001001558700002601568700002001594700002101614700002801635700002001663700001801683700002001701773012001721856007801841852000901919655001201928IND60745584320221122032313.0210723e20210625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074558432DNAL7 a10.3390/plants100712972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShyam, Chitralekha 10aIn Vitro Production of Somaclones with Decreased Erucic Acid Content in Indian Mustard [Brassica juncea (Linn.)

Somaclonal variation was explored as a probable source of additional variability for the manipulation of fatty acids, especially low erucic acid contents that may be valuable for this commercially important plant species. The plantlets regenerated from tissue cultures (R₀), their R₁ generation and respective parental lines were compared for morpho-physiological traits and fatty acid profile for the probable existence of somaclonal variations. The first putative somaclone derived from genotype CS54 contained 5.48% and 5.52% erucic acid in R₀ and R₁ regenerants, respectively, compared to the mother plant (41.36%). In comparison, the second somaclone acquired from PM30 exhibited a complete absence of erucic acid corresponding to its mother plant (1.07%). These putative somaclones present a source of variation for exploitation in the development of future mustard crops with low erucic acid content.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica juncea 3aerucic acid 3afatty acid composition 3agenotype 3aoilseed crops 3aoilseeds 3aplantlets 3asomaclonal variation 3aIndia1 aTripathi, Manoj Kumar1 aTiwari, Sushma 1 aTripathi, Niraj 1 aSolanki, Ravindra Singh1 aSapre, Swapnil 1 aAhuja, Ashok 1 aTiwari, Sharad 0 tPlants.g2021 June 25, v. 10, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants100712973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02759naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002000156245013600176300001800312520124400330592002801574650001201602650002401614650001001638650001201648650001101660650002001671650000901691650002301700650001001723650001301733650002201746650000901768650002701777650003101804650001801835650001601853650001101869650001401880650001101894650001001905650001001915651001001925651002101935651001001956651001801966700002201984700001902006773013102025856004002156852000902196655001202205IND4468056620221123034240.0120423e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446805662DNAL7 a221739382pmid7 a10.1002/jsfa.47452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJang, Eun‐Hee10aComparison of physicochemical characteristics and consumer perception of rice samples with different countries of origin and prices  ap. 1605-1613.  aBACKGROUND: Rice is the only food item which is not liberalized in Korea. To prepare for future liberalization of the rice market in Korea, the physicochemical characteristics and consumer perception of four domestic rice samples were compared with those of 11 foreign rice samples. Additionally, the influences of country of origin (CO) and price on purchase intent (PI) and willingness to pay (WTP) were investigated. RESULTS: Consumer acceptance of rice samples from Japan was generally higher than that of rice samples from other countries. In an informed test, PI was affected by price and CO, while WTP was affected mostly by price. The PI decreased with the price provided while the WTP increased. In a blind test, consumers evaluated PI and WTP according to sensory liking. The PI was higher in the informed test than in the blind test in all domestic samples. Generally, consumer acceptance was highly correlated with fat acidity (r = − 0.76), protein content (r = − 0.72), and b value (r = − 0.64) of the rice samples. CONCLUSION: Further efforts to increase the quality of rice are recommended for survival in the global market after liberalization of rice, even though consumers showed loyalty for PI of domestic samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aconsumer acceptance 3afoods 3amarkets 3aprices 3aprotein content 3arice 3awillingness to pay 2aColor 2aCommerce 2aConsumer Behavior 2aDiet 2aDietary Fatsxanalysis 2aDietary Proteinsxanalysis 2aFood Analysis 2aFood Supply 2aHumans 2aIntention 2aOryza. 2aSeeds 2aTaste 3aJapan 3aKorean Peninsula 0aJapan 0aKorea (South)1 aLim, Seung‐Taik1 aKim, Sang Sook0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2012 June, v. 92, no. 8 p.1605-1613dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.4745  aDNAL 7aarticle02738naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245008300173300001600256520131700272592002801589650002001617650002201637650001201659650001501671650001201686650001301698650001601711650001601727650001401743650002301757650001301780650000901793650001301802650003301815650001701848650001201865650002101877650001301898653002401911653001901935653001401954653002201968653001301990700002802003773010802031856008402139852000902223655001202232IND60600509320221119224854.0180703e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060050932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2013.11.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaxena, Sandeep K.10aSelective production of green gasoline by catalytic conversion of Jatropha oil  ap. 158-165.  aA catalytic process for value addition of bio-oil derived from the Jatropha curcas plant through the production of green gasoline has been described. Four zeolite based catalysts possessing different porosity and acidity have been prepared by using Ultrastable Y (HY), Beta (BEA), micro-crystalline ZSM-5 (MZ) and nano-crystalline ZSM-5(NZ) zeolites. The textural properties of the samples have been characterized by XRD, SEM, BET surface area, pore volume, pore size distribution and micro-calorimetric ammonia adsorption studies. These catalysts have been exploited for the production of green fuel suitable for gasoline applications. Among the various catalysts, the nano-crystalline ZSM-5 synthesized in the laboratory exhibited excellent catalytic properties such as moderate acidity and stacking order of mesoporosity (which is absent in microcrystalline ZSM-5) responsible for the production of gasoline with as high as 77.4% selectivity and 95 research octane number (RON). The catalyst also exhibited enhanced time-on-stream stability supported by coke resistance ability (derived from TGA analysis of spent catalyst) when compared with the other zeolites within the studied period of 20h. The present study provides a new catalytic process for production of gasoline from J. curcas oil for biorefinery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJatropha curcas 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacidity 3aadsorption 3aammonia 3abiofuels 3abiorefining 3acalorimetry 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3agasoline 3aoils 3aporosity 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asurface area 3atexture 3athermogravimetry 3azeolites 0aJatropha curcas oil 0aStrong acidity 0aMesopores 0aHydrogen transfer 0aGasoline1 aViswanadham, Nagabhatla0 tFuel processing technology.g2014 Mar., v. 119 p.158-165dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12445x0378-38207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2013.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02469naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245012700170300001600297520136500313592002801678653001101706653002001717653001601737653002401753653001801777700002501795700001901820700003101839700002301870700002201893773012301915856008402038852000902122655001202131IND60130179920221119031400.0151127e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013017992DNAL7 a10.1600/0363644087865002082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalino, Alexandre12aA New Species of Microgramma (Polypodiaceae) from Brazil and Recircumscription of the Genus Based on Phylogenetic Evidence  ap. 630-635.  aWe describe a new species of Microgramma (M. microsoroides) from the Atlantic Forest of Brazil, present a phylogeny of Microgramma, and provide a new generic circumscription. Microgramma comprises ca. 30 species in the Neotropics and perhaps two species in Africa and on islands in the Indian Ocean. Several species are contentious with regard to generic placement, and have been treated within Pleopeltis, Polypodium, and Solanopteris. From all known species of Microgramma, the new species differs by the sori forming irregular rows between adjacent primary veins. This finding is quite surprising, inasmuch as all other species in the genus have sori in two very strict rows, one row on each side of the midrib. The monophyly of Microgramma, as newly redefined, is strongly supported in chloroplast DNA-based phylogenetic analyses, using the genes rbcL and rps4, the rps4––trnS intergenic spacer, and the trnL––trnF intergenic spacer on 13 samples from 12 species. The new species is nested within Microgramma as sister to Microgramma megalophylla. Recognition of the relationships of M. microsoroides calls into question certain soral characters traditionally used to define genera of Polypodiaceae, as well as genera of ferns in other families. Sorus placement is notoriously variable in some genera and in many different families of Polypodiales.  aPublisher supplied data 0aBrazil 0achloroplast DNA 0aMicrogramma 0amolecular phylogeny 0aPolypodiaceae1 aAlmeida, Thais Elias1 aSmith, Alan R.1 aGóómez, Adrianna Navarro1 aKreier, Hans-Peter1 aSchneider, Harald0 tSystematic botany.g2008 Oct., v. 33, no. 4 p.630-635dThe American Society of Plant Taxonomists, Incx0363-64457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1600%2F0363644087865002083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03183naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245011900171300001800290520108100308536034701389592002801736596001501764596001101779596001401790650002501804650001701829650001801846650003801864650001201902650001501914650001701929650001301946650002201959653002501981653002102006653001402027653002602041653001502067653002202082653001902104700001402123700002002137700001802157700002102175700001902196700001702215700001802232700001802250700001202268700001302280700002202293700001902315700001402334773012602348856008602474852000902560655001202569IND60780752820221122205516.0220726e20220615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078075282DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2021.19525772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Fei-Bing10aAnti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities of chemical constituents from the flower buds of Buddleja officinalis  ap. 3031-3042.  aFive new glycosides including mimenghuasu A and B (1-2), isolinarin (3), cyclocitralosides A and B (4–5), along with forty-seven known compounds were isolated from the flower buds of Buddleja officinalis. These structures were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic analysis (UV, IR, 1 D, 2 D NMR, and MS spectra).

A perspective on the fitness effects of mutation accumulation  ap. 753-766.  aAll adaptive alleles in existence today began as mutations, but a common view in ecology, evolution, and genetics is that non-neutral mutations are much more likely to be deleterious than beneficial and will be removed by purifying selection. By dramatically limiting the effectiveness of selection in experimental mutation accumulation lines, multiple studies have shown that new mutations cause a detectable reduction in mean fitness. However, a number of exceptions to this pattern have now been observed in multiple species, including in highly replicated, intensive analyses. We briefly review these cases and discuss possible explanations for the inconsistent fitness outcomes of mutation accumulation experiments. We propose that variation in the outcomes of these studies is of interest and understanding the underlying causes of these diverse results will help shed light on fundamental questions about the evolutionary role of mutations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecology 3aevolution 3amutation accumulation1 aMelde, Robert H.1 aSharp, Nathaniel P.0 tEvolutionary ecology.g2022 Oct., v. 36, no. 5 p.753-766dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl3870055x0269-76537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10682-022-10187-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01798naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003000149245013400179520082600313592002801139653002101167653002801188653001901216653001601235700002001251700005901271773009801330856008301428852000901511655001201520IND60679367520221116151633.0191227e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067936752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sciaf.2019.e001612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEluyemi, Ayodeji Adekunle10aEmpirical relationships of earthquake magnitude scales and estimation of Guttenberg–Richter parameters in gulf of Guinea region  aAttempts have been made to investigate the relationships between various earthquake magnitude scales for the region of the Gulf of Guinea, namely moment magnitude (Mw), surface wave magnitude (Ms), body wave magnitude (mb) and local magnitude (ML). The study involves a sum of 535 earthquake data from the period of 1918 to 2016. It was found that Ms−Mw;Mw−ML and mb−Mw scales are in fairly good agreement while mb−Ms magnitude scale differs by a magnitude unit of 1.45. Since the region of study is seismically active and mainly under the ocean, comprising of the mid-Atlantic ridges and the plate boundary, the seismo-tectonics of the study region is inferred from the obtained Gutenberg-Richter (GR) recurrence parameters. The inferences made are the prime input to the seismic hazard assessment of the region.  aPublisher supplied data 0aMagnitude scales 0aEmpirical relationships 0aGulf of Guinea 0aWest Africa1 aBaruah, Santanu1 aBaruah, Saurabh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7953-726X0 tScientific African.g2019 Nov., v. 6 p.e00161-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27277x2468-22767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sciaf.2019.e001613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01973naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001500154245009400169300001600263520098500279592002801264650001201292650001201304650001801316650001301334650001001347700001801357700002901375700001401404700001701418773008001435856008801515990002301603852000901626655001201635IND60096328120221118040948.0141104e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009632812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cryogenics.2012.01.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Tao10aDemonstration of liquid nitrogen wicking using a multi-layer metallic wire cloth laminate  ap. 301-305.  aCryogenic heat transport devices are the most basic and critical component for the thermal integration between the cryogenic component and its cooling source. In space environments, containment of heat transfer fluid inside a capillary structure is critical due to the absence of gravity. Cryogenic heat pipes using the capillary force for circulation may provide a solution for heat transfer in space applications due to its independence of gravity and transport distance. To achieve a high effective capillary performance, several options of wicking structures have been investigated. An efficient wicking flow of liquid nitrogen is demonstrated with a sintered, multi-layer, porous lamination of metal wire (pore size as low as 5μm) in an open cryogenic chamber. The test data are presented in this paper. This technology has potential for use in development of improved cryogenic heat transfer devices and containment of cryogenic propellants under micro-gravity environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3acooling 3agravity 3aheat transfer 3anitrogen 3apipes1 adeBock, Peter1 aStautner, Ernst Wolfgang1 aDeng, Tao1 aImmer, Chris0 tCryogenics.g2012 , v. 52, no. 4-6 p.301-305dElsevier Ltdx0011-22757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cryogenics.2012.01.0153Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02610naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012300169300001800292520103800310536010501348592002801453650002401481650002101505650001601526650002301542650002001565650001701585650001901602650002301621650001101644650001501655650002101670650001301691650002201704650001701726650001801743653002701761653003301788653003001821653002201851700001701873700001701890773012601907856008602033852000902119655001202128IND60780753020221122230015.0220726e20220615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078075302DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2021.19530232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Cuifang10aAntiproliferative effect of secofriedelanophyllemblicine, a triterpenoid present in the roots of Phyllanthus emblica L  ap. 3198-3202.  aPhyllanthus emblica L. is a widely distributed tropical medicinal plant with good therapeutic properties. In the present study, the chemical constituents isolation of the roots of P. emblica were carried out and six known compounds (1-6) were purified and their structures were determined by means of spectroscopic analysis. The known triterpenoid, secofriedelanophyllemblicine (1), was selected to check for its cytotoxic effect on a series of human tumor cells and normal cells. Secofriedelanophyllemblicine exhibited cell growth inhibition specifically on MCF-7 breast cancer cells when compared to other tested cell lines. Further flow cytometric analysis showed that secofriedelanophyllemblicine could inhibit cell proliferation and induced G2 phase arrest in the cell-cycle progression of MCF-7 cells. The gathered results suggest that secofriedelanophyllemblicine is a cell-cycle regulator in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells and might be used as a candidate chemopreventive agent for breast cancer prevention and intervention.  aThis work was supported by a grant (No. 2018Z030) from QuanZhou Science and Technology Plan Project.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhyllanthus emblica 3abreast neoplasms 3acell growth 3acell proliferation 3achemoprevention 3acytotoxicity 3aflow cytometry 3agrowth retardation 3ahumans 3ainterphase 3amedicinal plants 3aresearch 3aspectral analysis 3atherapeutics 3atriterpenoids 0aPhyllanthus emblica L. 0asecofriedelanophyllemblicine 0aMCF-7；antiproliferative 0acell-cycle arrest1 aXu, Huaimeng1 aWang, Yixuan0 tNatural product research.g2022 June 15, v. 36, no. 12 p.3198-3202dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000126x1478-64277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14786419.2021.19530233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03354naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012700166300001200293520194000305592002802245650001702273650002502290650001602315650001802331650001202349650001802361650002302379650001102402650002102413650000902434650001502443650001502458653003202473653001802505653001502523653002202538653002502560700001702585700002102602700001902623700001902642700001602661773010402677856008202781852000902863655001202872IND50060483620221122225026.0190403e20130201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006048362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2012.11.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Chen Fei14aThe feeding quality of rice (Oryza sativa L.) straw at different cutting heights and the related stem morphological traits  ap. 1-8.  aThis study was to investigate the feeding quality of rice (Oryza sativa L.) straw at different cutting heights and the related stem morphological traits. Wuyujing 3, Yangfujing 8 and Liangyoupeijiu in 2010, and Wuyujing 3, Nanjing 44, Nanjing 46, and Liangyoupeijiu in 2011 were used in this study. In 2010, we investigated the feeding quality related traits (such as nonstructural carbohydrates (NSC), crude protein (CP), hemicelluloses and acid detergent fiber (ADF) contents) of rice straw among three cutting heights 10cm, 20cm and 30cm. In 2011, we investigated the nutrient contents (such as NSC, CP, hemicelluloses and ADF contents and in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD)) of leaf, sheath and stem in the top 1st, 2nd and 3rd nodes and the stem morphological characteristics by free hand sections. The results in 2010 indicated that the NSC content of rice straw at 10cm cutting height was higher than that at 20cm and 30cm cutting heights, CP content of rice straw at 10cm cutting height was lower than that at 20cm and 30cm cutting heights, hemicelluloses and ADF contents were not significantly different among 3 cutting heights. The results of 2011 indicated that the NSC content in stem of the top 3rd node was much higher than that in the 2nd and 1st node, and higher than that in leaf and sheath of the same node. CP content in leaf was much higher than that in stem and sheath. Hemicelluloses content in leaf and sheath was higher than that in stem, and ADF content was higher in sheath than that in leaf and stem, but all not significantly (p>0.05). IVDMD of stem was higher than leaf and sheath. Those results could explain the feeding quality differences of rice straw at different cutting heights. Wall thickness (WT) and the parenchyma area percentage of stem were significantly positively correlated with NSC content and IVDMD (p<0.05), which could be used as selection traits for more digestible rice straw.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aacid detergent fiber 3acorrelation 3acrude protein 3acutting 3adigestibility 3adry matter content 3aleaves 3anutrient content 3arice 3arice straw 3astem nodes 0aNonstructural carbohydrates 0aCrude protein 0aRice straw 0aDifferent heights 0aMorphological traits1 aShen, Yi Xin1 aDing, Cheng Long1 aXu, Neng Xiang1 aCheng, Yun Hui1 aGu, Hong Ru0 tField crops research.g2013 Feb. 01, v. 141 p.1-8dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl10215x0378-42907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2012.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01717naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245013300161300001400294500001900308520059300327536003200920592002800952650001500980650001300995650001501008650001301023650001601036650001301052651001201065651000901077653001501086653001301101700002701114773011701141856007601258852000901334655001201343IND60697362620221121005622.0200605e20171220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069736262DNAL7 a10.3897/jhr.61.203452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLucia, Mariano10aNew species and designation of primary types in Neotropical carpenter bees of the genus Xylocopa Latreille (Hymenoptera, Apidae)  ap. 31-48.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe describe and figure two distinctive new species of Neotropical carpenter bees of the genus Xylocopa, X.

One approach for estimating population parameters for live tree stem carbon entails three primary steps: (1) construction of an individual tree, allometric carbon model, (2) application of the model to tree-level data for a probability sample of plots, and (3) use of a probability-based (design-based) estimator of mean carbon per unit area for a population of interest. Compliance with the IPCC good practice guidance requires satisfaction of two criteria, one related to minimizing bias and one related to minimizing uncertainty. For this carbon estimation procedure, the portion of uncertainty attributed to the variance of the probability-based estimator of the population mean using the plot-level predictions is usually correctly estimated, but the portion attributed to the variance of the allometric model estimator is usually ignored. The result is that the total variance of the population mean estimator cannot be asserted to comply with the IPCC good practice criteria because not only is it not minimized, it is not even correctly estimated.Within the framework of what is coming to be characterized as hybrid inference, model-based inferential methods were used to estimate the variance of the tree-level allometric model estimator which was then propagated through to the variance of the probability-based estimator of mean carbon per unit area. This combined estimator, consisting of a model-based estimator used to predict a variable for a probability sample of a population followed by a probability-estimator of the population total or mean using the sample predictions, is characterized as a hybrid estimator. For this study, two probability-based estimators of the mean were considered, simple random sampling estimators and model-assisted regression estimators that used airborne laser scanning (ALS) data as auxiliary information. The variance of the allometric model estimator incorporated variances of distributions of diameter and height measurement errors, covariances of model parameter estimators, model residual variance, and variances of distributions of wood densities and carbon content proportions.The novel features of the study included the hybrid inferential framework, consideration of six sources of uncertainty including the variances of distributions of wood densities and carbon content proportions, use of ALS data with model-assisted regression estimators of the population mean, and use of confidence intervals for the population mean as the basis for comparisons rather than intermediate products such as model prediction accuracy. The primary conclusions were that the variance of the allometric model estimator was negligible or marginally negligible relative to the variance of the probability estimator when using species-specific allometric models and simple random sampling estimators, but non-negligible when using species-specific models and model-assisted regression estimators and when using a non-specific model with either estimator.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallometry 3acarbon 3aclimate change 3acompliance 3aconfidence interval 3acovariance 3amodels 3aprediction 3atrees 3auncertainty 3avariance 3awood 0aAllometric model 0aUncertainty analysis 0aWood density 0aCarbon content1 aChen, Qi1 aDomke, Grant M.1 aStåhl, Göran1 aSaarela, Svetlana1 aWestfall, James A.0 tForest ecology and management.g2016 Oct. 15, v. 378 p.44-56dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2016.07.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03268naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245016800181300001600349500001500365520142000380592002801800650003101828650002001859650004301879650002201922650001201944650002201956650001301978650001001991650002102001650002502022650001802047650001002065650001902075650001102094650002102105650001302126650002102139650001402160650001402174650001202188650001802200650002002218650001602238650002802254650003102282650002202313650001302335650004702348651001002395653001202405700001602417700001402433700001702447773010902464856004802573852000902621655001202630IND4480124020221119201838.0120727e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448012402DNAL7 a220761042pmid7 a10.1007/s00438-011-0657-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Linlin12aA ras GTPase-activating protein-binding protein, TaG3BP, associated with the modulation of male fertility in a thermo-sensitive cytoplasmic male sterile wheat line  ap. 417-431.  a2019-12-06  aHybrid wheat development may contribute to higher, more stable yield and could result in greater food security for much of the world’s growing population. YS type thermo-sensitive cytoplasmic male sterile (TCMS) wheat lines were developed for use in hybrid wheat breeding in China. To investigate the molecular mechanism of modulation of male fertility in the YS-type TCMS wheat lines, a ras GTPase-activating protein-binding protein (TaG3BP) was examined. The deduced amino acid sequence encoded by TaG3BP was conserved in the sequenced genomes of Embryophyte. TaG3BP expression in the anthers of YS-type TCMS lines taken at the critical fertility reversion stage of pollen development from male fertile anthers was higher than that from male-sterile anthers, either by quantitative real-time PCR or by western blot analysis. Sequence analysis on the cDNA and genomic DNA of TaG3BP in three kinds of K-type CMS wheat lines and their maintainers indicated that there were no significant difference between the genes or in their 5′ flanking sequences. The TaG3BP expression revealed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR was lower in the young spikes of these CMS lines than that of their maintainers. This indicates that TaG3BP expression is associated with the modulation, from male-sterile to fertile, of the TCMS wheat line, and TaG3BP might be a key factor in the pathway responsible for the fertility reversion.  aPublisher supplied data 3acytoplasmic male sterility 3aprotein binding 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis 3ahybrids 3acomplementary DNA 3abreeding 3awheat 3aWestern blotting 3aamino acid sequences 3afood security 3agenes 3amale fertility 3apollen 3amaintainer lines 2aBreeding 2aCarrier Proteins 2aCytoplasm 2aFertility 2aFlowers 2aGenome, Plant 2aHot Temperature 2aInfertility 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Proteinsxphysiology 2aSequence Analysis 2aTriticum 2aras GTPase-Activating Proteinsxphysiology 3aChina 0aanthers1 aSong, Guoqi1 aHe, Beiru1 aHu, Yin-Gang0 tMolecular genetics and genomics.g2011 Dec., v. 286, no. 5-6 p.417-431dSpringer-Verlagx1617-46157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00438-011-0657-5  aDNAL 7aarticle01498naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245007000170300001600240520062300256592002800879650001300907650001200920650001500932650001700947700002300964773010700987856008201094990002301176852000901199655001201208IND60094152520221118125244.0141104e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009415252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbpa.2013.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamat, Siddhesh S14aThe enzymatic conversion of phosphonates to phosphate by bacteria  ap. 589-596.  aPhosphonates are ubiquitous organophosphorus compounds that contain a characteristic CP bond which is chemically inert and hydrolytically stable.

While most research focuses on a single policy criterion, our comprehensive framework seeks to synthesize insights on five criteria: effectiveness (GHG mitigation), efficiency, equity, political acceptability, and implementation process. Further, we address potential policy mix interactions, and identify critical gaps to guide future research. Although results vary by region, we offer some general findings. First, stringent road pricing can be effective for GHG mitigation in the short- and long-run, especially for passenger vehicles (less so for freight), while also playing a complementary role to vehicle efficiency regulations (mitigating rebound effects). Second, both equity and political acceptability can be improved by careful design of exemptions and usage of revenues – though the ideal design seems to vary considerably by region. Finally, the implementation process is highly important for acceptability, which should include stakeholder consultation, clear communication of benefits, potentially a demonstration and referendum phase, and ideally agreement among political parties. There is much less evidence for ZEV zones, which don't seem necessary for GHG mitigation, though offering ZEV exemptions for road pricing may be an effective design feature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aenergy policy 3afreight 3apolitics 3apollution control 3astakeholders 0aRoad pricing 0aTolls 0aCarbon tax 0aGas tax 0aClimate policy 0aPolicy evaluation 0aGHG mitigation1 aWolinetz, Michael0 tEnergy policy.g2021 Sept., v. 156 p.112457-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2021.1124573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03271naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002300190245010900213300001600322506007600338520154200414592002801956506003701984650001602021650003102037650001402068650001002082650001802092650002902110650001202139650001502151650002902166700002902195700002402224700002102248700002202269700002002291700002002311700002102331700002102352700003202373700002102405700001602426700002602442700002002468700002102488700001802509773009802527856008302625852000902708655001202717IND60082626920221207121225.0141101e20130115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008262692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ydbio.2012.08.0152doi7 aPMC35325622pmcid7 a229600382pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCooney, Jeffrey D.10aTeleost growth factor independence (gfi) genes differentially regulate successive waves of hematopoiesis  ap. 431-441.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGrowth Factor Independence (Gfi) transcription factors play essential roles in hematopoiesis, differentially activating and repressing transcriptional programs required for hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) development and lineage specification. In mammals, Gfi1a regulates hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), myeloid and lymphoid populations, while its paralog, Gfi1b, regulates HSC, megakaryocyte and erythroid development. In zebrafish, gfi1aa is essential for primitive hematopoiesis; however, little is known about the role of gfi1aa in definitive hematopoiesis or about additional gfi factors in zebrafish. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of an additional hematopoietic gfi factor, gfi1b. We show that gfi1aa and gfi1b are expressed in the primitive and definitive sites of hematopoiesis in zebrafish. Our functional analyses demonstrate that gfi1aa and gfi1b have distinct roles in regulating primitive and definitive hematopoietic progenitors, respectively. Loss of gfi1aa silences markers of early primitive progenitors, scl and gata1. Conversely, loss of gfi1b silences runx-1, c-myb, ikaros and cd41, indicating that gfi1b is required for definitive hematopoiesis. We determine the epistatic relationships between the gfi factors and key hematopoietic transcription factors, demonstrating that gfi1aa and gfi1b join lmo2, scl, runx-1 and c-myb as critical regulators of teleost HSPC. Our studies establish a comparative paradigm for the regulation of hematopoietic lineages by gfi transcription factors.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDanio rerio 3aGATA transcription factors 3aepistasis 3agenes 3ahematopoiesis 3ahematopoietic stem cells 3amammals 3apopulation 3atranscription (genetics)1 aHildick-Smith, Gordon J.1 aShafizadeh, Ebrahim1 aMcBride, Paul F.1 aCarroll, Kelli J.1 aAnderson, Heidi1 aShaw, George C.1 aTamplin, Owen J.1 aBranco, Diana S.1 aDalton, A.

In this paper, we use the computable general equilibrium (CGE) approach to simulate the impact of China's increasing resource tax rate policy and carbon tax policy. The strengths and weaknesses of the two policies are compared from the perspective of energy utilization, air emissions, the macro economy, government tax revenue, household income, and enterprise net profit. A carbon tax leads to a reduction of all kinds of energy consumption. A carbon tax of 1 yuan/ton of CO₂ can reduce CO₂ emissions by 2100 tons and significantly reduce SO₂, NOₓ, PM₂.₅, and PM₁₀ emissions. From the perspective of energy utilization, carbon emissions, and pollutant emissions, the effect of a carbon tax is significantly better than that of a resource tax. If the rate of a resource tax rises by 50%, or a carbon tax is levied at the rate of 4 yuan/ton of CO₂, China's economy (on a GDP basis) will decline by 0.1%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abusiness enterprises 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon markets 3acomparative study 3aenergy 3aenergy policy 3ahousehold income 3amodels 3apollutants 3ataxes 3aChina 0aResource tax 0aCarbon tax 0aEnvironmental protection effect 0aEconomic effect 0aCGE1 aDong, Wanhao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4432-36161 aZhou, Qian0 tEnergy policy.g2021 Sept., v. 156 p.112460-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2021.1124603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02881naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100001900190245011700209300001400326506007600340520137200416592002801788506003701816650001901853650001901872650002101891650003001912650002001942650001201962650000901974650001201983650001701995650001402012650000902026650002502035650001402060653000802074653001902082653001702101653001002118700002402128700002102152700002102173773008902194856008302283852000902366655001202375IND60528725920221207070132.0160716e20160301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052872592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ydbio.2016.01.0082doi7 aPMC48010392pmcid7 a267942562pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHung, Irene H.12aA combined series of Fgf9 and Fgf18 mutant alleles identifies unique and redundant roles in skeletal development  ap. 72-84.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling is a critical regulator of skeletal development. Fgf9 and Fgf18 are the only FGF ligands with identified functions in embryonic bone growth. Mice lacking Fgf9 or Fgf18 have distinct skeletal phenotypes; however, the extent of overlapping or redundant functions for these ligands and the stage-specific contributions of FGF signaling to chondrogenesis and osteogenesis are not known. To identify separate versus shared roles for FGF9 and FGF18, we generated a combined series of Fgf9 and Fgf18 null alleles. Analysis of embryos lacking alleles of Fgf9 and Fgf18 shows that both encoded ligands function redundantly to control all stages of skeletogenesis; however, they have variable potencies along the proximodistal limb axis, suggesting gradients of activity during formation of the appendicular skeleton. Congenital absence of both Fgf9 and Fgf18 results in a striking osteochondrodysplasia and revealed functions for FGF signaling in early proximal limb chondrogenesis. Additional defects were also noted in craniofacial bones, vertebrae, and ribs. Loss of alleles of Fgf9 and Fgf18 also affect the expression of genes encoding other key intrinsic skeletal regulators, including IHH, PTHLH (PTHrP), and RUNX2, revealing potential direct, indirect, and compensatory mechanisms to coordinate chondrogenesis and osteogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abone formation 3achondrogenesis 3adyschondroplasia 3afibroblast growth factors 3agene expression 3aligands 3amice 3amutants 3anull alleles 3aphenotype 3aribs 3askeletal development 3avertebrae 0aFGF 0aChondrogenesis 0aGrowth plate 0aMouse1 aSchoenwolf, Gary C.1 aLewandoski, Mark1 aOrnitz, David M.0 tDevelopmental biology.g2016 Mar. 01, v. 411 p.72-84dElsevier Inc.x0012-16067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2016.01.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01831naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002000141245008800161300001600249500001900265520049100284592002800775650001800803650001400821650001300835650001000848650001400858650002300872650001000895650001200905650000900917650001300926651001000939653002300949653001000972653001300982653002200995700001601017700001301033700002001046700002001066700001801086700001901104773014201123856007501265852000901340655001201349IND60726524720221116145107.0210205e20200909xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072652472DNAL7 a10.1093/jme/tjaa1842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiangaspero, A.10aAccidental Nasal Myiasis Caused by Megaselia rufipes (Diptera: Phoridae) in a Child  ap. 121-124.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA case of a nasal myiasis in a 3-yr-old Italian girl who was referred to Bambino Gesù Hospital in Rome, Italy, is reported.

Estimates of Erosion Rates  ap. 1191-1197.  aepub  aErosion rates were estimated for 6- and 12.9-ha nested agricultural watersheds in the western Willamette Valley, Oreg., using ¹³⁷Cs activity levels and two different approaches, termed “volumetric” and “gravimetric.” The volumetric approach involved calculation of the volume and mass of sediment currently residing in depositional zones, based on areal extent of the zone and depth of occurrence of ¹³⁷Cs in the zone. This sediment was assumed to have come from the uplands (sideslopes plus ridgetops) by erosion during the period of fallout (since 1954). Reasonable ranges of watershed sediment delivery ratios and lengths of record were assumed. It was estimated by this technique that modern erosion rates in the uplands had been between 3 and 14 metric tons ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹. The gravimetric approach involved algebraic manipulation of areal concentrations of ¹³⁷Cs activities in depositional and upland zones to obtain estimates of erosion loss of ¹³⁷Cs from the uplands. Estimated ¹³⁷Cs losses were converted to estimated soil losses, which ranged from 6 to 27 metric tons ha⁻¹yr⁻¹. Considering the imprecision of these markedly different means of estimating soil loss rates, the volumetric and gravimetric estimates agree reasonably well. Together, they provide good evidence that the rate of modern erosion at the study site has been within and very possibly above the range of erosion rates normally thought of as tolerable.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural watersheds 3acesium radioisotopes 3ahighlands 3asediments 3asoil 3asoil erosion1 aKling, G.

Both red and white sorghum were processed using a traditional Nigerian wet-milling process to sorghum flour. The sorghum milling waste, sorghum bran, was hydrolysed using both enzymatic and dilute acid hydrolysis to produce a generable fermentation feedstock. The hydrolysates were subsequently investigated for fermentative biofuel production. Following a hydrolysis step, a medium containing ˜61 g/L glucose was obtained. Trace presence of inhibitors was detected in the hydrolysates and sufficient nitrogen content to support microorganism growth and bioethanol production. In test bioethanol production experiments using the sorghum milling waste derived hydrolysates only, 24.35 g/L bioethanol was produced by a yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus, equivalent to a yield of 0.15 g bioethanol per g of sorghum milling waste.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKluyveromyces marxianus 3aSorghum bicolor 3aacid hydrolysis 3abioethanol 3abiorefining 3abran 3aethanol production 3afeedstocks 3afermentation 3afuel production 3aglucose 3ahydrolysates 3anitrogen content 3asorghum flour 3awastes 3awet milling 3ayeasts 0aSorghum milling waste 0aSorghum bran 0aBiorefinery 0aHydrolysis 0aYeast screening1 aGreetham, Darren1 aDu, Chenyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8216-05041 aDyer, Paul S.0 tBiochemical engineering journal.g2019 Oct. 15, v. 150 p.107288-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12044x1369-703X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bej.2019.1072883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03015naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245013800166300001500304520134300319592002801662650002201690650001301712650001001725650001301735650002301748650000901771650002101780650001801801650000901819650001401828650001201842651001001854653002601864653000901890653000901899653001601908653001801924700001301942700002101955700001301976700001501989700001602004700001502020700001802035700001702053700001902070700001202089700001602101700001602117700001602133700001702149700001602166700001602182773010902198856008502307852000902392655001202401IND60524491720221118225644.0190403e20160830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052449172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2016.07.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHao, Xiaoli10aReassortant H5N1 avian influenza viruses containing PA or NP gene from an H9N2 virus significantly increase the pathogenicity in mice  ap. 95-101.  aReassortment between different influenza viruses is a crucial way to generate novel influenza viruses with unpredictable virulence and transmissibility, which may threaten the public health. As currently in China, avian influenza viruses (AIVs) of H9N2 and H5N1 subtypes are endemic in poultry in many areas, while they are prone to reassort with each other naturally. In order to evaluate the risk of the reassortment to public health, A/Goose/Jiangsu/k0403/2010 [GS/10(H5N1)] virus was used as a backbone to generate a series of reassortants, each contained a single internal gene derived from the predominant S genotype of the A/Chicken/Jiangsu/WJ57/2012 [WJ/57(H9N2)]. We next assessed the biological characteristics of these assortments, including pathogenicity, replication efficiency and polymerase activity. We found that the parental WJ/57(H9N2) and GS/10(H5N1) viruses displayed high genetic compatibility. Notably, the H5N1 reassortants containing the PA or NP gene from WJ/57(H9N2) virus significantly increased virulence and replication ability in mice, as well as markedly enhanced polymerase activity. Our results indicate that the endemicity of H9N2 and H5N1 in domestic poultry greatly increases the possibility of generating new viruses by reassortment that may pose a great threat to poultry industry and public health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfluenza A virus 3achickens 3agenes 3agenotype 3aindigenous species 3amice 3apoultry industry 3apublic health 3arisk 3avirulence 3aviruses 3aChina 0aAvian influenza virus 0aH9N2 0aH5N1 0aReassortant 0aPublic health1 aHu, Jiao1 aWang, Jiongjiong1 aXu, Jing1 aCheng, Hao1 aXu, Yunpeng1 aLi, Qunhui1 aHe, Dongchang1 aLiu, Xiaowen1 aWang, Xiaoquan1 aGu, Min1 aHu, Shunlin1 aXu, Xiulong1 aLiu, Huimou1 aChen, Sujuan1 aPeng, Daxin1 aLiu, Xiufan0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2016 Aug. 30, v. 192 p.95-101dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2016.07.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03512naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024003500132024004200167040001800209100001900227245014300246300001600389506002800405506006400433520147000497592002801967596004501995596004502040506003702085650002502122650001402147650002802161650001802189650001402207650001602221650001302237650001702250650001402267650001602281650002302297650001502320650001502335650002102350650001402371650001402385650001902399650002102418650002002439650001402459650001002473650000902483700002402492700002102516700002302537700001702560700002102577700002302598773012802621856008202749903002202831852000902853655001202862IND60589177420221207115543.0180619e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058917742DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-016-3169-62chorus7 a10.1007/s11104-016-3169-62doi7 a10.1007/s11104-016-3169-62chorusOpen  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhite, JamesF.10aDisease protection and allelopathic interactions of seed-transmitted endophytic pseudomonads of invasive reed grass (Phragmites australis)  ap. 195-208.  aResource is Open Access  aSpringer Science and Business Media LLC License Information  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Non-native Phragmites australis (haplotype M) is an invasive grass that decreases biodiversity and produces dense stands. We hypothesized that seeds of Phragmites carry microbes that improve seedling growth, defend against pathogens and maximize capacity of seedlings to compete with other plants. METHODS: We isolated bacteria from seeds of Phragmites, then evaluated representatives for their capacities to become intracellular in root cells, and their effects on: 1.) germination rates and seedling growth, 2.) susceptibility to damping-off disease, and 3.) mortality and growth of competitor plant seedlings (dandelion (Taraxacum officionale F. H. Wigg) and curly dock (Rumex crispus L.)). RESULTS: Ten strains (of 23 total) were identified and characterized; seven were identified as Pseudomonas spp. Strains Sandy LB4 (Pseudomonas fluorescens) and West 9 (Pseudomonas sp.) entered root meristems and became intracellular. These bacteria improved seed germination in Phragmites and increased seedling root branching in Poa annua. They increased plant growth and protected plants from damping off disease. Sandy LB4 increased mortality and reduced growth rates in seedlings of dandelion and curly dock. CONCLUSIONS: Phragmites plants associate with endophytes to increase growth and disease resistance, and release bacteria into the soil to create an environment that is favorable to their seedlings and less favorable to competitor plants.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199  cUSGSdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000002030 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPhragmites australis 3aPoa annua 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3aRumex crispus 3aTaraxacum 3aallelopathy 3abacteria 3abiodiversity 3abranching 3adamping off 3adisease resistance 3aendophytes 3ahaplotypes 3ainvasive species 3amortality 3apathogens 3aroot meristems 3aseed germination 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3asoil1 aKingsley, KathrynI.1 aKowalski, KurtP.1 aIrizarry, Ivelisse1 aMicci, April1 aSoares, MarcosA.1 aBergen, MarshallS.0 tPlant and soil.g2018 Jan., v. 422, no. 1-2 p.195-208dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl49373x0032-079X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-016-3169-63Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aDNAL 7aarticle01938naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245008500171300001600256520085100272592002801123650001401151650001801165650001801183650001201201650002001213650001401233650001601247650001701263650001601280650001601296650001601312700002101328700002501349773009801374856008301472852000901555655001201564IND60082627120221117221131.0141101e20130115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008262712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ydbio.2012.10.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcKeown, Sonja J.10aExpression and function of cell adhesion molecules during neural crest migration  ap. 244-257.  aNeural crest cells are highly migratory cells that give rise to many derivatives including peripheral ganglia, craniofacial structures and melanocytes. Neural crest cells migrate along defined pathways to their target sites, interacting with each other and their environment as they migrate. Cell adhesion molecules are critical during this process. In this review we discuss the expression and function of cell adhesion molecules during the process of neural crest migration, in particular cadherins, integrins, members of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules, and the proteolytic enzymes that cleave these cell adhesion molecules. The expression and function of these cell adhesion molecules and proteases are compared across neural crest emigrating from different axial levels, and across different species of vertebrates.  aPublisher supplied data 3acadherins 3acell adhesion 3acell movement 3aganglia 3aimmunoglobulins 3aintegrins 3amelanocytes 3aneural crest 3aproteinases 3aproteolysis 3avertebrates1 aWallace, Adam S.1 aAnderson, Richard B.0 tDevelopmental biology.g2013 Jan. 15, v. 373, no. 2 p.244-257dElsevier Inc.x0012-16067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2012.10.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02494naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245017400166300001600340520122000356592002801576650001201604650001201616650001101628650001401639650001301653650000901666650001301675650001201688650000901700650001301709650001301722650000901735653002501744653001201769653001301781653001901794653001901813700001901832773011401851856008601965852000902051655001202060IND60610749120221118234150.0180911e20171005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061074912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2017.05.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Juhee10aSoil attenuation of the seepage potential of metallic elements (Cu, Zn, As(V), Cd, and Pb) at abandoned mine sites: A batch equilibrium sorption and seepage column study  ap. 292-300.  aSoil attenuation of off-site leaching potential of metallic elements at the two abandoned mine sites was investigated using batch sorption and layered column studies. In batch study, the leachate concentration-specific sorption (Kd*) by downgradient clean soils was in the order of Pb>Cu>Cd>Zn>As for DY site and Pb>As>Cu>Cd>Zn for BS site. In the layered (mine+clean) soil column, element elution was significantly reduced (e.g., no initial flush, retarded peak arrival, and lower peak concentration) while sulfate elution can be an indicator of the dissolution of sulfur-bearing minerals in mine soils. The greatest reduction was observed for Pb and Cu while the lowest was for Cd (2–19%) and Zn (6–51%), consistent with the batch data. Both the reduced elution at slow seepage and concentration drop after flow interruption support the time-limited propensity. In column segments, the sorptive elements (Cu, Pb, and As) were dominantly found in the inlet while less sorptive ones (Zn and Cd) in the outlet. Both batch and column data suggest that the element leaching with mine leachate movement can be greatly attenuated by the interactions with the surrounding downgradient soil during the seepage process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic 3acadmium 3acopper 3aleachates 3aleaching 3alead 3aminerals 3aseepage 3asoil 3asorption 3asulfates 3azinc 0aChemical attenuation 0aSeepage 0aLeachate 0aMine discharge 0aAbandoned mine1 aHyun, Seunghun0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2017 Oct. 05, v. 339 p.292-300dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2017.05.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03135naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245012100173300001600294520162800310592002801938650003201966650000801998650001702006650002202023650001602045650001602061650001202077650002202089650001402111650002202125650001002147650002202157650001202179653001502191653003702206653001602243653000902259653002102268700002102289700001902310700001802329700006202347700002802409773011002437856008502547852000902632655001202641IND60524491920221118225759.0190403e20160830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052449192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2016.07.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHadsbjerg, Johanne10aSequence adaptations during growth of rescued classical swine fever viruses in cell culture and within infected pigs  ap. 123-134.  aClassical swine fever virus (CSFV) causes an economically important disease of swine. Four different viruses were rescued from full-length cloned cDNAs derived from the Paderborn strain of CSFV. Three of these viruses had been modified by mutagenesis (with 7 or 8 nt changes) within stem 2 of the subdomain IIIf of the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) that directs the initiation of protein synthesis. Rescued viruses were inoculated into pigs. The rescued vPader10 virus, without modifications in the IRES, induced clinical disease in pigs that was very similar to that observed previously with the parental field strain and transmission to in-contact pigs occurred. Two sequence reversions, in the NS2 and NS5B coding regions, became dominant within the virus populations in these infected pigs. Rescued viruses, with mutant IRES elements, did not induce disease and only very limited circulation of viral RNA could be detected. However, the animals inoculated with these mutant viruses seroconverted against CSFV. Thus, these mutant viruses were highly attenuated in vivo. All 4 rescued viruses were also passaged up to 20 times in cell culture. Using full genome sequencing, the same two adaptations within each of four independent virus populations were observed that restored the coding sequence to that of the parental field strain. These adaptations occurred with different kinetics. The combination of reverse genetics and in depth, full genome sequencing provides a powerful approach to analyse virus adaptation and to identify key determinants of viral replication efficiency in cells and within host animals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClassical swine fever virus 3aRNA 3acell culture 3acomplementary DNA 3ahog cholera 3amutagenesis 3amutants 3aprotein synthesis 3aribosomes 3asequence analysis 3aswine 3avirus replication 3aviruses 0aPestivirus 0aNext generation sequencing (NGS) 0aAttenuation 0aIRES 0aReverse genetics1 aFriis, Martin B.1 aFahnøe, Ulrik1 aNielsen, Jens1 aBelsham, Graham J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1187-48731 aRasmussen, Thomas Bruun0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2016 Aug. 30, v. 192 p.123-134dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2016.07.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02235naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001600188245005700204300001600261506007600277520110400353592002801457506003701485650001201522650001901534650002101553650002401574650001701598650001401615650003701629650002001666650002401686773009401710856004801804852000901852655001201861IND50090080220221207095418.0140612e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009008022DNAL7 a10.1007/s11515-014-1304-42doi7 aPMC42546602pmcid7 a254848932pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiao, Li-Ya10aNeurotrophin signaling and visceral hypersensitivity  ap. 216-224.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNeurotrophin family are traditionally recognized for their nerve growth promoting function and are recently identified as crucial factors in regulating neuronal activity in the central and peripheral nervous systems. The family members including nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) are reported to have distinct roles in the development and maintenance of sensory phenotypes in normal states and in the modulation of sensory activity in disease. This paper highlights receptor tyrosine kinase (Trk) -mediated signal transduction by which neurotrophins regulate neuronal activity in the visceral sensory reflex pathways with emphasis on the distinct roles of NGF and BDNF signaling in physiologic and pathophysiological processes. Viscero-visceral cross-organ sensitization exists widely in human diseases. The role of neurotrophins in mediating neural cross talk and interaction in primary afferent neurons in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and neurotrophin signal transduction in the context of cross-organ sensitization are also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aganglia 3ahuman diseases 3ahypersensitivity 3anerve growth factor 3anerve tissue 3aphenotype 3areceptor protein-tyrosine kinase 3asensory neurons 3asignal transduction0 tFrontiers in biology.g2014 June, v. 9, no. 3 p.216-224dSpringer-Verlagx1674-79847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11515-014-1304-4  aDNAL 7aarticle01831naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100002300161245008900184300001400273500000900287520067400296592002800970650001200998650001301010650001301023650001401036650002101050650001801071650001501089650001501104650001201119650000901131650001201140700002001152700002201172773014601194856009601340852000901436655001201445IND60667860020221119180538.0191125e196801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066786002DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1968.03615995003200010016x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarrows, Harold L.10aInteraction of Limestone Particle Size and Phosphorus on the Control of Soil Acidity  ap. 64-68.  aepub  aVarious size fractions of limestone and calcite were equilibrated in a Leon fine sand previously treated with varying rates of phosphorus. The efficiency of 42- to 48-mesh liming material was reduced 1.1, 1.6, and 5.8%, respectively, by the addition of 25, 50, and 150 ppm P. The same levels of P reduced the efficiency of 12- to 14-mesh material 2.2, 3.6, and 8.5%. Material finer than 80-mesh was not affected. The reduced efficiencies were attributed to the formation of surface coatings of phosphatic material.

Biological and chemical effects of burnt litter on plants are not as of yet fully understood. We aimed to assess the effects of heat-treated leaf litter on germination and seedling root growth of Eucalyptus globulus. METHODS: Litter from E. globulus, Acacia dealbata, Pinus pinaster, and Quercus suber was collected in Portugal, on Humic Cambisol, and heated between 25 °C and 600 °C. Those materials were then characterized by: ¹³C CPMAS NMR spectroscopy, proximate lignin and cellulose, and elemental analyses. Afterwards, they were used as substrate in bioassays with Eucalyptus seeds. RESULTS: Heating changed litter composition (P < 0.05), consistently across species: alkyl C, O-alkyl C, and methoxyl + N-alkyl C decreased more than 50%; and aromatic C increased more than 5-fold. Unheated and lightly heated litters inhibited germination and growth, with maximum inhibition by Quercus and Eucalyptus litters, down to 17% of the control (P < 0.05). Severely charred materials had neutral or stimulatory effects, up to 191% of the control (P < 0.05). These responses were associated with concentrations of dominant C types in litters (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Litter charring, as it occurs during wildfires, is potentially critical for the success of E. globulus’s regeneration from seeds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcacia dealbata 3aCambisols 3aEucalyptus globulus 3aPinus pinaster 3aQuercus suber 3abioassays 3acarbon 3acellulose 3aearly development 3aecosystems 3agermination 3aheat treatment 3alignin 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aplant litter 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3astable isotopes 3awildfires 3aPortugal1 aIncerti, Guido1 aSaracino, Antonio1 aLanzotti, Virginia1 aSilva, JoaquimS.1 aRego, FranciscoC.1 aMazzoleni, Stefano1 aBonanomi, Giuliano0 tPlant and soil.g2018 Jan., v. 422, no. 1-2 p.495-514dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl49373x0032-079X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-017-3419-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02668naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001400141245013800155300001600293500001900309520134800328592002801676650002501704650001501729650001201744650001001756650002301766650000901789650001201798650001601810650001901826651001401845653001701859653001301876653003501889653002701924700002201951700001901973700001601992773014202008856007502150852000902225655001202234IND60726525120221116145109.0210205e20201112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072652512DNAL7 a10.1093/jme/tjaa2062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Wei10aEight New Species of Sucking Lice (Psocodea: Phthiraptera) From Endemic Murine Rodents in Australia and an Updated Identification Key  ap. 298-319.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBased on a comprehensive study of museum specimens, eight new species of sucking lice of the genus Hoplopleura Enderlein, 1904 (Psocodea: Phthiraptera: Hoplopleuridae), are described from six genera of Australian Old Endemic rodents: Conilurus Ogilby, 1838 (Rodentia: Muridae), Leggadina Thomas, 1910 (Rodentia: Muridae), Leporillus Thomas, 1906 (Rodentia: Muridae), Mesembriomys Palmer, 1906 (Rodentia: Muridae), Pogonomys Milne-Edwards, 1877 (Rodentia: Muridae), and Xeromys Thomas, 1889 (Rodentia: Muridae). The description of these new species increases the number of sucking louse species from endemic Australian rodents from 13 to 21 and extends the records of sucking lice to all of the 14 genera of endemic rodents in Australia. Our results show that sucking lice are much more diverse among rodents in Australia than previously known. Furthermore, the Australian Hoplopleura species are host specific—each Hoplopleura species, including the eight new species described in the present study, parasitizes only a single host species, except Hoplopleura irritans Kuhn and Ludwig, 1967 (Psocodea: Phthiraptera: Hoplopleuridae) and Hoplopleura melomydisWeaver, 2017 (Psocodea: Phthiraptera: Hoplopleuridae), each of which is found on two host species. An updated dichotomous key for identifying Australian Hoplopleura species is included.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHoplopleura irritans 3aLeporillus 3aXeromys 3ahosts 3amedical entomology 3amice 3amuseums 3anew species 3ataxonomic keys 3aAustralia 0aPhthiraptera 0aAnoplura 0aHoplopleura identification key 0aendemic murine rodents1 aDurden, Lance A.,1 aWeaver, Haylee1 aShao, Renfu0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2020 Nov. 12, v. 58, no. 1 p.298-319dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl45776x0022-25857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jme/tjaa2063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02720naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245010800165300001600273520133200289592002801621650001301649650001401662650001301676650001901689650000901708650001901717650002201736650001901758650000901777650001901786650000701805650001801812650001301830650001501843653002501858653002101883653002001904653000901924653001601933700001501949700001501964700001901979700001901998773011402017856008602131852000902217655001202226IND60610749220221118234046.0180911e20171015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061074922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2017.05.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Dong10aFluidized-bed Fenton coupled with ceramic membrane separation for advanced treatment of flax wastewater  ap. 390-398.  aFluidized-bed Fenton coupled with ceramic membrane separation to treat the flax secondary effluent was investigated. The operating variables, including initial pH, dosage of H2O2 and Fe⁰, air flow rate, TMP and pore size, were optimized. The distributions of DOMs in the treatment process were analyzed. Under the optimum condition (600mgL⁻¹H2O2, 1.4gL⁻¹ Fe⁰, pH=3, 300Lh⁻¹ air flow rate and 15psi TMP), the highest TOC and color removal efficiencies were 84% and 94% in the coupled reactor with 100nm ceramic membrane, reducing 39% of total iron with similar removal efficiency compared with Fluidized-bed Fenton. Experimental results showed that the ceramic membrane could intercept catalyst particles (average particle size >100nm), 10.4% macromolecules organic matter (AMW>20000Da) and 12.53% hydrophobic humic-like component. EEM-PARAFAC identified four humic-like (M1–M4) and one protein-like components (M5), and the fluorescence intensities of M1–M5 in the secondary effluent were 63.27, 63.05, 33.41, 16.71 and 0.72 QSE, respectively. After the coupled treatment, the removal efficiencies of M1(81%), M2(86%) were higher than M3, M4(63%, 61%). Pearson correlation analysis suggested that M1, M2 and M3 were the major contributors to the cake layer, and M4, M5 might more easily lead to pore blockages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair flow 3acatalysts 3aceramics 3adecolorization 3aflax 3afluidized beds 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydrophobicity 3airon 3aorganic matter 3apH 3aparticle size 3aporosity 3awastewater 0aFluidized-bed Fenton 0aCeramic membrane 0aFlax wastewater 0aDOMs 0aEEM-PARAFAC1 aDing, Lili1 aHuang, Hui1 aChen, Mengtian1 aRen, Hongqiang0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2017 Oct. 15, v. 340 p.390-398dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2017.05.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04035naa a2200925 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245011100167300001800278520178500296592002802081650001202109650001702121650002602138650003102164650001002195650002002205650002202225650001602247650001702263650001202280650001702292650002202309650001802331650001002349650002102359650002502380653000902405653000902414653000702423653000802430653000802438653000802446653000802454653001102462653000702473653000702480653000702487653000702494653000702501653000802508653000802516653000802524653000702532653000702539653000902546653000702555653000702562653000702569653001202576653000702588653000802595653000902603653000702612653000802619653000702627653001202634653001502646653001802661653001602679653002702695653000902722700001402731700001702745700001902762700001702781700001902798700001602817700001202833700001802845700001802863773012202881856008503003852000903088655001203097IND60649599420221118235225.0190801e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064959942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbalip.2019.06.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Jianfei10aAdipose lipidomics and RNA-Seq analysis revealed the enhanced mitochondrial function in UCP1 knock-in pigs  ap. 1375-1383.  aUncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) plays a key role in nonshivering thermogenesis and is involved in the pathogenesis of obesity. In a previous study, we generated adipocyte-specific UCP1 knock-in (UCP1-KI) pigs, which exhibited improved thermoregulatory ability and decreased fat deposition. To investigate whether UCP1 knock-in alters the lipid composition of adipose tissues, lipidomics of inguinal subcutaneous white adipose tissue (iWAT) and backfat from 6-month-old cold-treated UCP1-KI pigs and wild-type (WT) pigs were profiled. In addition, genome-wide RNA-sequencing of iWAT was performed to further study the genetic basis for lipid alterations. The results showed that iWAT and backfat from UCP1-KI pigs exhibited distinct lipidomic profiles, as the mild lipid alteration was observed in backfat of UCP1 knock-in pigs. Inguinal WAT from UCP1-KI pigs contained significantly decreased total triacylglycerol (p < 0.05), together with the downregulation of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism, suggesting the decreased lipogenesis in iWAT of UCP1-KI pigs. Significantly increased levels of total sphingolipids (p<0.05) were also observed in iWAT from UCP1-KI pigs. Notably, two mitochondrial-specific lipid species, cardiolipin CL72:8 (18:2) and CL74:9 (18:2), were found to be dramatically increased in iWAT from UCP1-KI pigs, suggesting enhanced mitochondrial function. This observation was further supported by the significant upregulation of numerous mitochondrial-related genes and significantly increased number of large mitochondria and mitochondrial cristae in iWAT of UCP1-KI pigs. Taken together, these data illustrate the specific role of UCP1 in lipid metabolism of fat tissues in pigs and provide new data for characterization of fat traits in UCP1-KI pigs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abackfat 3acardiolipins 3afatty acid metabolism 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aheat production 3alipid composition 3alipogenesis 3amitochondria 3aobesity 3apathogenesis 3asequence analysis 3asphingolipids 3aswine 3atriacylglycerols 3awhite adipose tissue 0aUCP1 0aiWAT 0aCE 0aCho 0aTAG 0aDAG 0aCer 0aGluCer 0aSM 0aPC 0aPI 0aPS 0aCL 0aLPC 0aFFA 0aLPS 0aPE 0aPA 0aDEGs 0aBP 0aKP 0aCC 0aUCP1-KI 0aWT 0aTME 0aQPCR 0aHR 0aNST 0aFC 0aUCP1-KI 0aLipidomics 0aTranscriptome 0aCardiolipin 0aMitochondrial function 0aPigs1 aTao, Cong1 aCao, Chunwei1 aZheng, Qiantao1 aLam, Sin Man1 aShui, Guanghou1 aLiu, Xuexue1 aLi, Kui1 aZhao, Jianguo1 aWang, Yanfang0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2019 Oct., v. 1864, no. 10 p.1375-1383dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12057x1388-19817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbalip.2019.06.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02335naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126100002300144245007800167300001600245520107800261592002801339650001601367650000901383650002101392650001501413650001901428650001201447650001301459650001001472650002701482653001801509653001901527653002101546653001801567653002101585653001801606700002201624700002601646700002001672773011901692852000901811856008101820655001201901IND4401684920221116221859.0181020e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440168492DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175070748162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcQueen, Rachel H.10aOdor Intensity in Apparel Fabrics and the Link with Bacterial Populations  ap. 449-456.  aNine apparel fabrics varying in fiber (cotton, wool, polyester) and knit structure (1 × 1 rib, interlock, single jersey) were investigated for their retention of axillary odor following wear. As axillary odor results from bacterial metabolism of apocrine and sebaceous secretions, counts of total aerobic bacteria and corynebacteria on the fabrics were carried out. Odor intensity was strongly associated with the fiber type, with polyester fabrics rating high in odor intensity and cotton and wool mid-low odor intensity. A structure effect was apparent for polyester fabrics, with the lightweight single jersey fabric rated less odorous than the heavier-weight interlock and 1 × 1 rib structures. The relationship between fiber type and odor was not influenced by bacterial numbers present, with counts after one day similar for all fabrics. However, the number of bacteria declined more rapidly on polyester fabrics than on either the cotton or wool fabrics. Counts of odor-associated corynebacteria subgroup (A) remained largely unchanged on wool fabrics for 28 days.  aPublisher supplied data 3alint cotton 3awool 3asynthetic fibers 3apolyesters 3atextile fibers 3afabrics 3aclothing 3aodors 3abacterial colonization 0aaxillary odor 0acorynebacteria 0afabric structure 0afiber content 0asensory analysis 0astaphylococci1 aLaing, Raechel M.1 aBrooks, Heather J.

The data were obtained from the first extraction of the traps between May and October of 2015. This paper presents the results for the Entomobryomorpha Börner, 1913, which was part of the Collembola captured. Four families and 12 genera have been studied: Isotomidae Schäffer, 1896 (Folsomia Willem, 1902, Tetracanthella Schött, 1891, Uzelia Absolon, 1901, FolsomidesStach, 1922, IsotomurusBörner, 1903, Parisotoma Bagnall, 1940, PseudisotomaHandschin, 1924 and Pachyotoma Bagnall, 1949), Orchesellidae Börner, 1906 (OrchesellaTempleton, 1835 and Heteromurus Wankel, 1860), Entomobryidae Schäffer, 1896 (Entomobrya Rondani, 1861) and Lepidocyrtidae Wahlgren, 1906 (Lepidocyrtus Bourlet, 1839 and Pseudosinella Schäffer, 1897). The species of Orchesella were studied in a previous paper (Baquero et al. 2017). The richness of the habitat sampled is defined by twenty-one species, eight of which are new: Pachyotoma penalarensis Baquero & Jordana n. sp., Entomobrya guadarramensis Jordana & Baquero n. sp., Entomobrya ledesmai Jordana & Baquero n. sp., Lepidocyrtus labyrinthi Baquero & Jordana n. sp., Lepidocyrtus paralignorum Baquero & Jordana n. sp., Lepidocyrtus purgatori Baquero & Jordana n. sp., Pseudosinella valverdei Baquero & Jordana n. sp. and Pseudosinella gonzaloi Baquero & Jordana n. sp. Entomobrya intermediaBrook, 1884 (England) is discussed and a new name Entomobrya katzi Jordana & Baquero n. sp. is proposed for E. intermedia sensu Katz et al.

To provide an appropriate hair removal method and maintain animal welfare, we introduced four commonly used depilation methods—namely, scissors shearing, electric shaving, depilatory cream, and sodium sulfide, and made systematic comparisons, instead of only examining one or two methods, as reported in the past. To further assess convenience and possible effects on skin wound healing, we performed a skin trauma model after depilation in C57BL/6J mice and recorded wound healing time. Meanwhile, the skin tissues around the wound were stained with H&E and Masson. The results showed that the wound contraction rate of the sodium sulfide group was significantly lower than other groups at different points in time. Furthermore, depilatory cream and sodium sulfide methods could induce a topical inflammatory response on the third day after the operation and delay the regeneration of collagen fibers. We concluded that sodium sulfide depilatory has a significant negative effect on wound healing. Depilatory cream is gentler, with mild skin irritation and symptoms of inflammation. The electric shaving method is more convenient and safer, and thus could be the best choice for preoperative depilation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal welfare 3acollagen 3acream 3ainflammation 3amodels 3askin irritation 3asodium sulfide1 aJia, Lintao 1 aZhang, Xiao 0 tAnimals.g2022 Feb. 25, v. 12, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani120505813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02911naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245016000173300001600333520135400349592002801703650001001731650004401741650003701785650001101822650001401833650002801847650001801875650002101893650002601914650002001940650001301960650001901973650001301992650000702005650001902012650001502031650001402046650002102060653002102081653001502102653001702117653002102134653002702155700001402182773011502196856008502311852000902396655001202405IND60610749320221118233658.0180829e20170915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061074932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2017.05.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdelhaleem, Amal10aPhotodegradation of 4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid under visible LED activated N-doped TiO2 and the mechanism of stepwise rate increment of the reused catalyst  ap. 491-501.  aPhotodegradation of 4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid (4-CPA) was systematically investigated using N-doped TiO2 (N-TiO2) under commercially available visible light emitting diode (Vis LED) as a novel Vis LED illumination in photocatalysis applications. The synergetic effect of Vis LED/N-TiO2 process was studied in detail by varying reaction conditions including the initial concentration of 4-CPA, catalyst dosage, light intensity, and initial pH. Additionally, the influence of inorganic anions and radical scavengers on the performance of the Vis LED/N-TiO2 process was also evaluated. The Vis LED/N-TiO2 was found to be a promising process in terms of mineralization of 4-CPA. It is interesting to note that the performance of this process was not reduced after successive usage of the recycled catalyst; instead, the reaction rate of 4-CPA decay actually increased by using the spent catalyst. The mechanism behind rate enhancement after/during reuse was explored by XPS and FT-IR analyses and it was proven that hydroxyl groups can be incorporated into the catalyst surface by the repeated wetting of N-TiO2 after each reuse. This facilitates the formation of hydrogen bonds between the 4-CPA molecules and N-TiO2, thereby allowing more collisions between the trapped 4-CPA and radicals at the interface of bulk solution and catalyst, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3a4-CPA 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aanions 3acatalysts 3afree radical scavengers 3afree radicals 3ahydrogen bonding 3alight emitting diodes 3alight intensity 3alighting 3amineralization 3amoieties 3apH 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotolysis 3asynergism 3atitanium dioxide 0aPhotodegradation 0aHerbicides 0aN-doped TiO2 0aHydrogen bonding 0aCommercial visible LED1 aZhu, Wei,0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2017 Sept. 15, v. 338 p.491-501dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2017.05.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02632naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006100147245007200208300001800280500001900298520144700317592002801764650001401792650001201806650001401818650001901832650001401851650001201865650001801877650001701895650001501912650001701927653001101944653000801955653001701963700002501980773013902005856008102144852000902225655001202234IND60712135920221117224436.0201009e20201128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071213592DNAL7 a10.1017/S00071145200021722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAtkins, Janice L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4919-906810aSarcopenic obesity in ageing: cardiovascular outcomes and mortality  ap. 1102-1113.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aObesity is a major public health issue with prevalence increasing worldwide. Obesity is a well-established risk factor for CVD and mortality in adult populations. However, the impact of being overweight or obese in the elderly on CVD and mortality is controversial. Some studies even suggest that overweight and obesity, measured by BMI, are apparently associated with a decreased mortality risk (known as the obesity paradox). Ageing is associated with an increase in visceral fat and a progressive loss of muscle mass. Fat mass is positively associated and lean mass is negatively associated with risk of mortality. Therefore, in older adults BMI is not a good indicator of obesity. Sarcopenia has been defined as the degenerative loss of muscle mass, quality and strength with age and is of major concern in ageing populations. Sarcopenia has previously been associated with increased risks of metabolic impairment, cardiovascular risk factors, physical disability and mortality. It is possible for sarcopenia to co-exist with obesity, and sarcopenic obesity is a new class of obesity in older adults who have high adiposity levels together with low muscle mass, quality or strength. Therefore, sarcopenia with obesity may act together to increase their effect on metabolic disorders, CVD and mortality. This review will discuss the available evidence for the health implications of sarcopenic obesity on CVD and mortality in older adults.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadiposity 3aelderly 3amortality 3amuscle tissues 3anutrition 3aobesity 3apublic health 3arisk factors 3asarcopenia 3avisceral fat 0aMuscle 0aCVD 0aOlder adults1 aWannamathee, S.

In this work, we describe a distinct role for Ribbon (Rib) in controlling cell shape/volume increases during elongation of the Drosophila salivary gland (SG). Notably, the morphogenetic changes in rib mutants occurred without effects on general SG cell attributes such as specification, proliferation and apoptosis. Moreover, the changes in cell shape/volume in rib mutants occurred without compromising epithelial-specific morphological attributes such as apicobasal polarity and junctional integrity. To identify the genes regulated by Rib, we performed ChIP-seq analysis in embryos driving expression of GFP-tagged Rib specifically in the SGs. To learn if the Rib binding sites identified in the ChIP-seq analysis were linked to changes in gene expression, we performed microarray analysis comparing RNA samples from age-matched wild-type and rib null embryos. From the superposed ChIP-seq and microarray gene expression data, we identified 60 genomic sites bound by Rib likely to regulate SG-specific gene expression. We confirmed several of the identified Rib targets by qRT-pCR and/or in situ hybridization. Our results indicate that Rib regulates cell growth and tissue shape in the Drosophila salivary gland via a diverse array of targets through both transcriptional activation and repression. Furthermore, our results suggest that autoregulation of rib expression may be a key component of the SG morphogenetic gene network.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila 3aRNA 3aapoptosis 3aautoregulation 3abinding sites 3acell growth 3acell movement 3acell polarity 3acell proliferation 3agene expression 3agenes 3ain situ hybridization 3amicroarray technology 3amorphogenesis 3amutants 3asalivary glands 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptional activation 0aDrosophila 0aMorphogenesis 0aRibbon 0aSalivary gland 0aSize control1 aLee, Joslynn S.1 aWells, Michael B.1 aGrevengoed, Elizabeth1 aSlattery, Matthew1 aAndrew, Deborah J.0 tDevelopmental biology.g2016 Jan. 01, v. 409 p.234-250dElsevier Inc.x0012-16067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2015.10.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02284naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245008200173300001500255500001900270520087900289536020901168592002801377650001201405650002001417650002801437650002001465650001601485650001401501651001101515653002001526653002601546653001301572653001601585700001701601700001801618700002101636700001901657773009501676856008201771852000901853655001201862IND60726525420221116145140.0210303e20210128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072652542DNAL7 a10.3897/mycokeys.77.600842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAïgnon, Hyppolite L.10aThree new species of Inosperma (Agaricales, Inocybaceae) from Tropical Africa  ap. 97-116.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHere, we describe three new species of Inosperma from Tropical Africa: Inosperma africanum, I. bulbomarginatum and I. flavobrunneum. Morphological and molecular data show that these species have not been described before, hence need to be described as new. The phylogenetic placements of these species were inferred, based on molecular evidence from sequences of 28S and RPB2. Additional analysis using ITS dataset shows interspecific variation between each species. Phylogenetic analyses resolve I. flavobrunneum in Old World Tropical clade 1 with weak support, I. bulbomarginatum is sister of Old World Tropical clade 1 and I. africanum is indicated as sister to the rest of Inosperma. Complete description and illustrations, including photographs and line drawings, are presented for each species. A new combination of Inocybe shawarensis into Inosperma is also proposed.  aPart of this research was funded by the Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning and the Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst and National Geographic Society.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInocybe 3adata collection 3ainterspecific variation 3anew combination 3anew species 3aphylogeny 3aAfrica 0aEctomycorrhizal 0amolecular systematics 0ataxonomy 0aWest Africa1 aJabeen, Sana1 aNaseer, Arooj1 aYorou, Nourou S.1 aRyberg, Martin0 tMycoKeys.g2021 Jan. 28, v. 77 p.97-116dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2143x1314-40497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3897/mycokeys.77.600843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02600naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245018600160300001600346520129600362592002801658650001801686650002101704650001501725650001801740650003001758650001301788650001001801650001301811650002201824650002301846650000901869650002001878700002601898700002701924700003201951773012801983856008202111852000902193655001202202IND60589177920221117192658.0180619e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058917792DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-017-3471-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Yue10aStepwise incorporation of white clover (Trifolium repens L.) as fertiliser increases nitrogen fixation and improves nitrogen retention when intercropped with leek (Allium porrum L.)  ap. 541-554.  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: We investigated whether the incorporation of intercropped white clover as a split-dose fertiliser improves N retention of the plant-soil system in leek production. METHODS: White clover and leek were grown in pots where clover was stepwise incorporated into soil as fertiliser. Half of the clover was incorporated before leek transplantation (LT), the other half was incorporated 26 (S1) or 41 (S2) days after LT, compared with full incorporation of all clover (F) before LT. ¹⁵N injection and leaching studies were performed to investigate interspecific competition and the effects of precipitation on soil N availability. RESULTS: Stepwise incorporations increased or had no effect on leek growth, despite competition for N between white clover and leek. Compared to F, leek grown with stepwise incorporations had similar and lower N accumulation before the second incorporation, but N was higher at the end of the experiment. N₂ fixation by white clover increased the total N input into soil and matched N availability with leek N demand and growth rate. Loss of inorganic N by leaching was lowest in S2 and highest in F. CONCLUSIONS: Stepwise incorporations of white clover improved N retention in the plant-soil system and could be used to increase leek yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllium porrum 3aTrifolium repens 3acrop yield 3aintercropping 3ainterspecific competition 3aleaching 3aleeks 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fixation 3anitrogen retention 3asoil 3astable isotopes1 aSorensen, JornNygaard1 aPetersen, KarenKoefoed1 aKristensen, HanneLakkenborg0 tPlant and soil.g2018 Jan., v. 422, no. 1-2 p.541-554dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl49373x0032-079X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-017-3471-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03017naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002500169245016000194300001600354520189900370592002802269653002402297653001302321653001302334653001802347653002302365653002202388653001602410653001602426653001702442773010602459856011702565852000902682655001202691IND60126417120221121082636.0151107e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012641712DNAL7 a10.1651/0278-0372(2008)028[0334:EEEDTA]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSwiney, Katherine M.10aEgg Extrusion, Embryo Development, Timing and Duration of Eclosion, and Incubation Period of Primiparous and Multiparous Tanner Crabs (Chionoecetes bairdi)  ap. 334-341.  aThis study compares timing of egg extrusion, embryo development, timing and duration of eclosion, and incubation periods of Kodiak, Alaska, primiparous and multiparous Tanner crabs (Chionoecetes bairdi) reared in identical conditions to determine if and how these variables differ between reproductive states. Female reproductive state (primiparous or multiparous) and dates of egg extrusion were recorded, eggs were sampled monthly to determine egg stage and area, and larvae were collected daily during eclosion to determine timing and duration of eclosion. Primiparous Tanner crabs extruded eggs on average 103 days earlier than multiparous females and embryos developed similarly between groups. Both groups exhibited an embryonic developmental diapause at the gastrula stage, but the length of diapause was approximately 6 months for the primiparous group and 3 months for the multiparous group. This diapause appears to synchronize eclosion. The eggs of primiparous Tanner crabs were significantly smaller than the eggs of multiparous females for a few months after extrusion, but the differences may not be biologically significant. Eclosion was relatively synchronous between the two groups, however the mean eclosion date was 10 days earlier for primiparous females and on average, eclosion took 7 days for primiparous females and 12 days for multiparous females. Primiparous Tanner crabs have an average incubation period of 489 days which is 92 days longer than the average multiparous female incubation period of 397 days. Results of this study clearly illustrate that reproductive cycles differ between primiparous and multiparous Tanner crabs which may result in different reproductive potentials. Differences between primiparous and multiparous Tanner crabs must be understood and included in models for effective stock assessment, fishery management plans, and rebuilding plans.  aPublisher supplied data 0aChionoecetes bairdi 0adiapause 0aeclosion 0aegg extrusion 0aembryo development 0aincubation period 0aprimiparous 0amultiparous 0aTanner crabs0 tJournal of crustacean biology.g2008 May, v. 28, no. 2 p.334-341dCrustacean Societyx0278-03727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1651%2F0278-0372%282008%29028%5B0334%3AEEEDTA%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01080naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245003700165300001600202520030600218592002800524650001800552700001800570700002500588773012500613856007900738852000900817655001200826IND60302162820221118034009.0150704e20140117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030216282DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12467042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGollihar, Jimmy10aMany Paths to the Origin of Life  ap. 259-260.  aThe origin of life remains a daunting mystery in part because rather than knowing too little, we increasingly know about too many possible mechanisms that might have led to the self-sustaining replication of nucleic acids and the cellularization of genetic material that is the basis of life on Earth.  aPublisher supplied data 3anucleic acids1 aLevy, Matthew1 aEllington, Andrew D.0 tScience.g2014 Jan. 17, v. 343, no. 6168 p.259-260dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.12467043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02607naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245012500173300001600298520122400314592002801538650004401566650001501610650002101625650002101646650002301667650001501690650001501705650001101720650000701731650001901738650003301757650002301790650001601813653001101829653001501840653001901855653002701874700002401901700002701925773011501952856008502067852000902152655001202161IND60610749620221118233819.0180829e20170915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061074962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2017.05.0592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŞimşek, Selçuk10aSynthesis and characterization of a composite polymeric material including chelating agent for adsorption of uranyl ions  ap. 437-446.  aIn this study, a versatile polymeric material was synthesized by grafting Calcon Carboxylic Acid (CCA), which is known as a chelating agent for some metal ions, to polyacrylamide (PAA) structure. Thus, the adsorptive properties of inert PAA polymer were significantly improved owing to this procedure. The obtained new material, CCA-g-PAA, was characterized by point zero charge (PZC), FTIR, SEM, and UV–VIS–NIR analysis. The adsorption properties of new material were investigated comprehensively and experimental variables were optimized such as pH, temperature, time, and concentration. Experimental data were evaluated by using theoretical adsorption models. The maximum adsorption capacity of material was calculated as 0.079molkg⁻¹ by considering Langmuir equation. The constants calculated from Freundlich and DR model were found as 6.98 and 0.441, respectively. Adsorption kinetic was also explained with pseudo second order and intra particular diffusion models. Experimental studies were showed that adsorption was endothermic and occurred spontaneously. The developed material has important advantages such as reusability, cost-effective synthesis procedure, high adsorption capacity, and selectivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3acarboxylic acids 3achelating agents 3acost effectiveness 3aendothermy 3ametal ions 3amodels 3apH 3apolyacrylamide 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature 0aUranyl 0aAdsorption 0aPolyacrylamide 0aCalcon carbocylic acid1 aŞenol, Zeynep Mine1 aUlusoy, Halil İbrahim0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2017 Sept. 15, v. 338 p.437-446dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2017.05.0593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02510naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245010800166300001600274520127600290592002801566650001301594650000801607650001301615650001201628650001501640650001501655650002501670650002601695650001201721650001401733650001101747650001601758650002001774650001001794653001801804653001801822653001101840700001901851773011301870856008401983852000902067655001202076IND60524492320221118230651.0201125e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052449232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2016.06.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBen-Noah, I.10aAeration of clayey soils by injecting air through subsurface drippers: Lysimetric and field experiments  ap. 222-233.  aWe examined the effects of air injection into clayey-soil, with and without a perforated sphere around the dripper, on oxygen concentrations and pepper yields in a barrel experiment, and on soil oxygen concentrations and stem growth of young mango trees in a field experiment. The perforated sphere was intended to reduce soil resistance to air flow and to enhance the efficiency of air spreading in the soil. The main findings were that injecting atmospheric air did not contribute much to aeration of soils with high existing oxygen concentrations, i.e., about 80% of the atmospheric 21%, in the barrel experiments, and did not contribute at all in the field experiment, where oxygen concentration was about 95% of atmospheric. Furthermore, it was found that an oxygen concentration of about 80% did not decrease pepper yield in the absence of other stresses such as salinity or nutrients deficiency. A perforated sphere increased soil oxygen concentration when both water and air were applied through the sphere. A positive effect of air injection on pepper yields was found in soils with high volumetric water contents, i.e., average above 0.4 throughout the growth period. Conversely, air injection decreased pepper yields in barrels where water contents were lower.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaeration 3aair 3aair flow 3abarrels 3aclay soils 3acrop yield 3aemitters (equipment) 3afield experimentation 3amangoes 3anutrients 3aoxygen 3asalt stress 3astem elongation 3atrees 0aSoil aeration 0aAir injection 0aPepper1 aFriedman, S.P.0 tAgricultural water management.g2016 Oct., v. 176 p.222-233dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2016.06.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02578naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245019500165520131500360592002801675650000801703650001801711650001101729650002501740650002201765650001401787650002201801651001001823653005601833653003101889653003701920653003001957700001601987773011802003856008602121852000902207655001202216IND60744535820221122055721.0211213e20211015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074453582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1130782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Lin10aEnvironmental regulation and the growth of the total-factor carbon productivity of China's industries: Evidence from the implementation of action plan of air pollution prevention and control  aTo abate the severe air pollution, the Chinese government released the Action Plan of Air Pollution Prevention and Control (APAPPC) in 2013. This paper regards the APAPPC as a quasi-experiment and uses the DID method to investigate the impact of environmental regulation on the growth of green total-factor productivity of China's industries. This article employs the non-radial directional distance function (NDDF) and the global Malmquist index to measure the total-factor carbon productivity of China's industries. Further regressions suggest that the implementation of the APAPPC has significantly promoted the growth of the total-factor carbon productivity in the air pollution-intensive industries, and its marginal effect has steadily increased with time. This result is still valid after using a series of counterfactual tests and robustness tests. The further mechanism study shows that the APAPPC has significantly promoted R&D investment, especially in instruments and equipment, which has effectively promoted technical efficiency and technological advancement. It indicates that stringent and well-designed environmental regulations should lead to a “win-win” situation of environmental improvement and economic development by encouraging enterprises to upgrade their technology and equipment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair pollution 3acarbon 3aeconomic development 3aenvironmental law 3aequipment 3apollution control 3aChina 0aAction plan of air pollution prevention and control 0aChina'S industrial sectors 0aTotal-factor carbon productivity 0aData envelopment analysis1 aTang, Lizhi0 tJournal of environmental management.g2021 Oct. 15, v. 296 p.113078-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1130783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02524naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100001500147245010400162300001600266520123600282592002801518650001801546650002101564650001501585650001501600650002001615650001201635650002601647650002201673650002401695650002101719650001101740650001901751650001801770650001001788650001701798700002401815700002301839700002201862700002401884773007801908856008301986852000902069655001202078IND4469065920221119202234.0141111e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446906592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.flora.2012.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBahr, Adam10aLong-term changes in vegetation and soil chemistry in a calcareous and sandy semi-natural grassland  ap. 379-387.  aCalcicole plant species are vulnerable to acidification and fertilization, caused by deposition and changes in land use, since they are adapted to nutrient-poor calcareous conditions. In this study we used vegetation data (vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens) from 1964 and 1985 and stored soil samples from 1966 to investigate long-term soil chemistry and vegetation changes in a semi-natural, sandy calcareous grassland in southern Sweden. In the re-investigation in 2008 we found that increased decalcification due to acidification could not be verified. The plant community had changed from stress-tolerant calcareous grassland towards a community promoted by higher nutrient availability. Furthermore, the cover of species indicating calcareous conditions had decreased. A decline in the cover of species adapted to alkaline, phosphorus-poor conditions may be due to increased nutrient availability, but there were also indications that the vegetation had changed due to overgrowth by woody plants. This long-term impoverishment of the plant community highlights the need for appropriate management of calcareous grasslands, in order to limit the nutrients available in the soil and prevent overgrowth by shrubs and trees.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3acalcareous soils 3acalcicoles 3agrasslands 3aland use change 3alichens 3anutrient availability 3aplant communities 3apopulation dynamics 3arange management 3ashrubs 3asoil nutrients 3asoil sampling 3atrees 3awoody plants1 aEllstrÃ¶m, Magnus1 aSchnoor, Tim Krone1 aPÃ¥hlsson, Lars1 aOlsson, PÃ¥l Axel0 tFlora.g2012 May, v. 207, no. 5 p.379-387dElsevier GmbHx0367-25307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.flora.2012.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03638naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245011800172300001500290500001900305506002800324506004300352520185900395592002802254596004502282506003702327650003402364650002102398650001302419650002202432650002402454650002102478650002202499650001302521650001302534650003302547650001602580650002102596650001502617651002302632651003002655651000902685653003102694653002002725653001502745653002302760653001802783653001102801700002002812700002102832773009502853856008102948903002203029852000903051655001203060IND60726525620221207054302.0210205e20210128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072652562DNAL7 a10.3897/neobiota.64.600502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolthouse, Mark Cody10aUrban host plant utilisation by the invasive Halyomorpha halys (Stål) (Hemiptera, Pentatomidae) in northern Utah  ap. 87-101.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Access  aPensoft Publishers License Information  aThe invasive and highly polyphagous brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys (Stål), is a severe agricultural and urban nuisance pest in North America. Since its initial invasion into Utah in 2012, H. halys has become well established in urban and suburban locations along the western foothills of the Wasatch Front in northern Utah. Bordering the Great Basin Desert, this area is unique from other North American locations with H. halys due to its high elevation (> 1200 m), aridity (30-year mean RH = 53.1%; dew point = -1.9 °C) and extreme temperatures (the 30-year mean minimum and maximum in January and July in Salt Lake City range from -3.1 to 3.6 °C and 20.3 to 32.4 °C, respectively). To document which plant species harbour H. halys, surveys were conducted in 17 urban/suburban sites in four counties during 2017 and 2018. Halyomorpha halys was more abundant in Salt Lake and Utah counties than in the more northern counties of Davis and Weber and was found on 53 plant species, nine of which hosted two or more developmental stages in both years. The majority of hosts were in the families Fabaceae, Rosaceae and Sapindaceae. Northern catalpa, Catalpa speciosa (Warder), was the most consistent host, supporting a majority of H. halys detections in all life stages; thus we identify it as a sentinel host. Twenty-nine species were novel hosts for H. halys in North America; of these, Acer ginnala Maxim, Populus tremuloides Michx., Prunus armeniaca × domestica ‘Flavor King’ and Prunus virginiana ‘Schubert’ were detected with two or more life stages of H. halys in both years. Peak populations of H. halys occurred from mid-June to mid-September. We describe H. halys plant utilisation by life stage and seasonal period to aid future detection and management of this invasive insect in the greater Intermountain West region.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAcer tataricum subsp. ginnala 3aCatalpa speciosa 3aFabaceae 3aHalyomorpha halys 3aPopulus tremuloides 3aPrunus armeniaca 3aPrunus virginiana 3aaltitude 3adewpoint 3adry environmental conditions 3ahost plants 3ainvasive species 3asalt lakes 3aGreat Basin Desert 3aIntermountain West region 3aUtah 0aBrown marmorated stink bug 0aCatalpaspeciosa 0ahost plant 0aIntermountain West 0asentinel host 0asurvey1 aSpears, Lori R.1 aAlston, Diane G.0 tNeoBiota.g2021 Jan. 28, v. 64 p.87-101dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2193x1314-24887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3897/neobiota.64.600503Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aDNAL 7aarticle04182naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094024003700134024004400171040001800215100006200233245014000295300001600435506007600451506003100527520176300558592002802321596007002349596007002419596004102489506003702530650004102567650002202608650001602630650001702646650001102663650001302674650001302687650003002700650001802730650001502748650001902763650001102782650001902793650001402812650001102826650002002837650001602857650001202873650001802885650001802903650002502921650001502946651001702961653002802978653001303006653001303019653000903032653002203041653001803063700002003081700002003101700002403121700002103145773012703166856008403293856004503377961001703422852000903439655001203448IND60524492520221215142402.0190403e20170131xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052449252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2016.07.0112chorus7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2016.07.0112doi7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2016.07.0112chorusOpen  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmin, M.G.

However, karst geology poses unique challenges in accurately simulating management impacts to both surface and groundwater hydrology. Two versions of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), Regular-SWAT and Topo-SWAT (which incorporates variable source area hydrology), were assessed for their robustness in simulating hydrology of the karstic Spring Creek watershed of Centre County, Pennsylvania, USA. Appropriate representations of surface water – groundwater interactions and of spring recharge – discharge areas were critical for simulating this karst watershed. Both Regular-SWAT and Topo-SWAT described the watershed discharge adequately with daily Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies (NSE) ranging from 0.77 to 0.79 for calibration and 0.68–0.73 for validation, respectively. Because Topo-SWAT more accurately represented measured daily streamflow, with statistically significant improvement of NSE over Regular-SWAT during validation (p-value=0.05) and, unlike Regular-SWAT, had the capability of spatially mapping recharge/infiltration and runoff generation areas within the watershed, Topo-SWAT was selected to predict nutrient and sediment loads. Total watershed load estimates (518t nitrogen/year, 45t phosphorus/year, and 13600t sediment/year) were within 10% of observed values (−9.2% percent bias for nitrogen, 6.6% for phosphorous, and 5.4% for sediment). Nutrient distributions among transport pathways, such as leaching and overland flow, corresponded with observed values. This study demonstrates that Topo-SWAT can be a valuable tool in future studies of agricultural land management change in karst regions.  aPublisher supplied data  cAgricultural Research Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100007917  cPennsylvania State Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100008321  cU.S. Environmental Protection Agency0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3aagricultural land 3agroundwater 3ahydrogeology 3akarsts 3aleaching 3anitrogen 3anonpoint source pollution 3aoverland flow 3aphosphorus 3apollution load 3arunoff 3asediment yield 3asediments 3aspring 3asprings (water) 3astream flow 3astreams 3asurface water 3awater quality 3awatershed management 3awatersheds 3aPennsylvania 0aAgricultural management 0aNutrient 0aSediment 0aSWAT 0aTopographic index 0aWater quality1 aVeith, Tamie L.1 aCollick, Amy S.1 aKarsten, Heather D.1 aBuda, Anthony R.0 tAgricultural water management.g2017 Jan. 31, v. 180, no. pt.

A total of 117 captures were made, representing 73 individual turtles (32 green, 41 hawksbill). Almost half of the green turtles were recaptured on at least one occasion, with a maximum time at liberty of 574 days (median = 94 days). Only 20% of hawksbill turtles were recaptured, with a maximum time at liberty of 587 days (median = 120 days). These data suggest that the study sites are utilised by a combination of transient visitors and short to medium-term resident turtles. However, no evidence of long-term nocturnal site fidelity was found. The size ranges observed in both species indicate that all turtles were immature, and the minimum sizes are consistent with previously reported settlement sizes from the region. Despite the lack of long-term fidelity, turtles were regularly encountered over the course of the study, indicating that these reefs are an important nocturnal refugium for local juvenile turtles in general.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChelonia mydas 3aEretmochelys imbricata 3acoral reefs 3ajuveniles 3aphilopatry 3asea turtles 3asurveys 3aCaribbean 0aturtle 0aresting 0ahome range 0acoral reef 0aCaribbean1 aHenderson, Aaron C.0 tTropical zoology.g2018 Jan. 2, v. 31, no. 1 p.44-54dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2037x1970-95287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03946975.2017.14031963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03447naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001600166245016200182300001600344520173700360592002802097650002002125650001902145650003002164650001602194650001902210650001602229650001102245650001702256650001002273650001902283650002202302650001402324650001302338650001102351650001502362650004302377650001702420650001102437650001202448650001202460650003502472650002402507650003402531650002202565650006502587700001502652700002102667773011502688856008102803852000902884655001202893IND50090081320221118235333.0150407e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009008132DNAL7 a243570362pmid7 a10.1007/s11626-013-9718-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeepika, A.10aDevelopment of primary cell cultures from mud crab, Scylla serrata, and their potential as an in vitro model for the replication of white spot syndrome virus  ap. 406-416.  aPrimary cell cultures were developed from haemocytes and testis of Scylla serrata. Haemocytes were collected from live animals and cultured in double-strength L-15 medium (2× L-15) prepared in crab saline, supplemented with 5% foetal bovine serum and antibiotic–antimycotic solution (penicillin 100 U/mL, streptomycin 100 μg/mL and amphotericin B 0.25 μg/mL) with osmolality adjusted to 894 mOsm/kg. The haemocytes adhered within 2 h after seeding and showed proliferation up to 72 h. The disaggregated testis tissue fragments were seeded in 3× L-15 supplemented with non-essential amino acid mixture, lipid concentrate and antibiotic–antimycotic solution, with osmolality adjusted to 1,035 mOsm/kg with crab saline. Cells from the testis could be subcultured and maintained up to 21 d as suspension culture. Different dilutions of white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) inoculum (known virus copy number) prepared from infected Penaeus monodon were inoculated in the cultured cells, and the cytopathic effects like detachment, rounding of cells and clear areas of depleted cells were observed after 48 h in haemocyte cultures. However, WSSV-exposed testis cells did not show any obvious change until 72 h post-infection. WSSV was detected in both haemocyte and testis cultures at different time-points of infection by conventional and real-time PCR using WSSV-specific primers. The transcripts of WSSV were found to be much higher in haemocytes than in testis culture. The virus harvested from the cultured haemocytes after three passages could infect healthy P. monodon. The present study showed that mud crab haemocyte culture can support WSSV replication, and it can be used as an in vitro tool for WSSV replication.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPenaeus monodon 3aScylla serrata 3aWhite spot syndrome virus 3aamino acids 3aamphotericin B 3ablood serum 3acattle 3acell culture 3acrabs 3acultured cells 3acytopathogenicity 3ahemocytes 3ainoculum 3amodels 3aosmolality 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3astreptomycin 3atestes 3aviruses 2aAnimals 2aBrachyuraxcytologyxvirology. 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aPrimary Cell Culturexmethods 2aVirus Replication 2aWhite spot syndrome virus 1xgeneticsxgrowth & development.1 aMakesh, M.1 aRajendran, K.

Therefore defining the regulatory mechanisms controlling Nkx2.5 expression in SHF populations serves an important function in understanding the etiology of complex CHD. Through a comparative analysis of regulatory elements controlling SHF expression of Nkx2.5 in the chicken and mouse, we have found evidence that Nkx2.5 autoregulation is important for maintaining Nkx2.5 expression during SHF differentiation in both species. However the mechanism of Nkx2.5 maintenance differs between placental mammals and non-mammalian vertebrates: in chick Nkx2.5 binds directly to a genomic enhancer element that is required to maintain Nkx2.5 expression in the SHF. In addition, it is likely that this is true in other non-mammalian vertebrates given that they possess a similar genomic organization. By contrast, in placental mammals, Nkx2.5 autoregulation in the SHF functions indirectly through Mef2c. These data underscore a tight relationship in mammals between Nkx2.5 and Mef2c in SHF transcriptional regulation, and highlight the potential for evolutionary cis-regulatory analysis to identify core, conserved components of the gene networks controlling heart development.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aautoregulation 3achickens 3achicks 3aenhancer elements 3aetiology 3aheart 3aheart diseases 3ahomeotic genes 3ahumans 3amice 3amutation 3apopulation 3atranscription (genetics) 3atransposons1 aZhang, Boding1 aLee, Benjamin1 aEvans, Samuel I.1 aLassar, Andrew B.1 aLee, Kyu-Ho0 tDevelopmental biology.g2013 Feb. 1, v. 374, no. 1 p.198-209dElsevier Inc.x0012-16067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2012.11.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02063naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126100002200144245008400166300001600250520097500266592002801241650001601269650001901285650001701304650001101321653001901332653000901351653002001360653001501380700003201395700002001427700002301447700002201470773011901492852000901611856008101620655001201701IND4401687220221122015947.0181020e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440168722DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175070719692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDubas, Stephan T.10aDeposition of Polyelectrolyte Multilayers to Improve the Color Fastness of Silk  ap. 437-441.  aThe color fastness to washing of silk fibers dyed with scarlet dye was improved by the deposition of a thin polymer film which prevented desorption of the dye in standard soap solution. Dyed silk fibers were coated with polyelectrolytes multilayers (PEM) by following the so-called layer-by-layer deposition method in which up to 30 layers of cationic poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) and anionic poly(sodium 4-styrene sulfonate) were deposited. The growth of the film was confirmed using attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometry and the dye exhaustion from the silk fiber was monitored using UV-Vis spectroscopy. The ability of the PEM to act as an electrostatic barrier against the release of the negatively charged dye was investigated as a function of the terminating top layer. The results showed that the negative layer-terminated PEM is more efficient at preventing the release of the dye than the positively terminated PEM.  aPublisher supplied data 3asilk fabric 3atextile fibers 3aelectrolytes 3adyeing 0acolor fastness 0asilk 0apolyelectrolyte 0athin films1 aChutchawalkulchai, Eakaphon1 aEgkasit, Sanong1 aIamsamai, Chularat1 aPotiyaraj, Pranut0 tTextile research journal.g2007 June, v. 77, no. 6 p.437-441dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175070719693Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02131naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100002000161245009200181300001300273500000900286520103200295592002801327650001701355650000901372650002401381650001801405650001701423650001501440650002501455650001201480650001601492700002301508773014501531856009601676852000901772655001201781IND60667860920221119175231.0191125e197101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066786092DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1971.03615995003500010011x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampbell, G.

The finer textured soils showed a greater change in water potential with temperature than did coarser soils at similar water potentials. Water potential change with bulk density also was determined for samples of three soils. Little change was noted except on a clay subsoil sample. These results indicate that in most cases negligible differences will arise from measuring water potential at laboratory temperature rather than at the temperature existing in the field and from use of disturbed field samples with altered bulk density rather than undisturbed field soil. However, at water potentials below about −20 bars, temperature effects may become significant, especially in fine textured soils, and measurements on clay subsoils may be significantly affected by changes in bulk density.  aPublisher supplied data 3abulk density 3aclay 3afine-textured soils 3apsychrometers 3asoil texture 3asoil water 3asoil water potential 3asubsoil 3atemperature1 aGardner, Walter H.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1971 Jan., v. 35, no. 1 p.8-12dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1971.03615995003500010011x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01472naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245014400165300001600309520061700325592002800942653001800970653001700988700002101005773010701026856007601133852000901209655001201218IND60126418120221119220425.0151107e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012641812DNAL7 a10.1651/07-2864R.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShimomura, Michitaka10aDescription of a New Species of Cephalocarida, Sandersiella kikuchii, and Redescription of S. acuminata Shiino Based Upon the Type Material  ap. 572-579.  aA new species of cephalocarid, Sandersiella kikuchii, is described from central Japan, 300 m depth.

The high usage has been mainly as a result of a government policy of free insecticide spraying on cocoa farms, in an effort to curb declining yields caused by pests and diseases and to prevent the use of unapproved or banned insecticides on cocoa farms. However the scale of cocoa farming, the frequency and intensity of usage coupled with the mode of application may result in large physical volumes of insecticides in the environment. This makes the knowledge of the concentration and fate of neonicotinoids in the environment extremely important. The present study was aimed at assessing the levels of five major neonicotinoids in soils from cocoa farmlands in Ghana. Extraction and cleanup of analytes were performed by use of a method based on the original QuEChERS procedure after optimizing salts, sorbents and instrumental conditions. Analyte extraction with NaCl and MgSO4 in acidified acetonitrile followed by cleanup with primary secondary amine (PSA) presented the optimum conditions for extraction. Quantification was performed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with electrospray ionization (ESI). Validation of the procedure showed average recoveries ranging from 72.0 to 104.8% for all analytes at all fortification levels with relative standard deviation (RSD)≤15.0. Limits of quantitation were<10μgkg−1 for all neonicotinoids studied. The results obtained from the analysis of 52 samples from cocoa farms revealed imidacloprid as the predominant neonicotinoid with concentrations ranging from 4.3 to 251.4μgkg−1 in>50% of samples analyzed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3aadsorbents 3acrop production 3afarming systems 3afarms 3aimidacloprid 3ainsecticide residues 3aionization 3aissues and policy 3aliquid chromatography 3amagnesium sulfate 3apests 3aplantations 3aresearch and development 3asodium chloride 3asoil 3aspraying 3astatistical analysis 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aGhana 0aNeonicotinoids 0aTropical soils 0aGhana 0aCocoa 0aQuEChERS 0aLC-MS/MS1 aGordon, Christopher1 aCarboo, Derick1 aFomsgaard, Inge S.0 tScience of the total environment.g2014 Nov. 15, v. 499 p.276-283dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.08.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02706naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245008000179300001600259520139000275592002801665650002101693650001901714650002101733650001401754650001601768650001301784650002901797650001901826650001301845650001401858650001401872650001001886653002401896653001601920653003401936653002101970653001701991700002402008700003202032773010302064856008402167852000902251655001202260IND60122714820221119210819.0150325e20150319xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012271482DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2014.9615632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonçalves, Alexandra G.10aOzonation of bezafibrate over ceria and ceria supported on carbon materials  ap. 776-785.  aTwo catalysts containing ceria dispersed on the surface of multi-walled carbon nanotubes and activated carbon were investigated as ozonation catalysts for the mineralization of bezafibrate (BZF). The results were compared with those obtained in the absence of the catalyst and in the presence of the parent carbon materials, as well as in the presence of ceria (CeO ₂). Carbon materials containing ceria showed an interesting catalytic effect. Both materials enhanced the mineralization of BZF relatively to single ozonation and ozonation catalysed by the corresponding carbon materials. In the catalytic ozonation with these materials, both surface and bulk reactions are supposed to occur. The BZF ozonation catalysed by CeO ₂ leaded to the highest mineralization degrees, indicating that the reaction mechanism followed in the presence of CeO ₂ (free radical oxidation in solution) leads to the formation of intermediates more easily degradable, mainly after 120 min of reaction. Some primary products and refractory final oxidation compounds in single and catalytic ozonation of BZF were followed. The original chlorine present on the BZF molecule is completely converted to chloride anion and part of the nitrogen is mainly converted to along with smaller amounts of and .

Where anthelmintic drugs are available, drug resistance is a major problem in livestock parasites, and a looming threat to public health. Monitoring the efficacy of these medicines and screening for new drugs has been hindered by the lack of objective, high-throughput approaches. Several cell monitoring technologies have been adapted for parasitic worms, including video-, fluorescence-, metabolism enzyme- and impedance-based tools that minimize the screening bottleneck. Using the xCELLigence impedance-based system we previously developed a motility-viability assay that is applicable for a range of helminth parasites. Here we have improved substantially the assay by using diverse frequency settings, and have named it the xCELLigence worm real-time motility assay (xWORM). By utilizing strictly standardized mean difference analysis we compared the xWORM output measured with 10, 25 and 50 kHz frequencies to quantify the motility of schistosome adults (human blood flukes) and hatching of schistosome eggs. Furthermore, we have described a novel application of xWORM to monitor movement of schistosome cercariae, the developmental stage that is infectious to humans. For all three stages, 25 kHz was either optimal or near-optimal for monitoring and quantifying schistosome motility. These improvements in methodology sensitivity should enhance the capacity to screen small compound libraries for new drugs both for schistosomes and other helminth pathogens at large.  aPublisher supplied data 0aHelminths 0aViability 0axCELLigence 0aSchistosome 0aStrictly standardized mean difference (SSMD) 0aHigh-throughput1 aLoukas, Alex1 aBrindley, Paul J.1 aIrelan, Jeff T.1 aSmout, Michael J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6937-01120 tInternational Journal for Parasitology: Drugs and Drug Resistance.g2015 Dec., v. 5 p.141-148dElsevier Ltdx2211-32077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpddr.2015.07.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02434naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245006200164300001800226500001500244520104900259592002801308650001601336650001801352650001301370650002201383650002601405650003501431650002101466650002301487650001601510650001201526653001101538700002001549700001601569700001901585700002201604700001901626700002301645700001801668700002301686700001801709700002001727773012201747856007401869852000901943655001201952IND60664483420221119063106.0190912e20130416xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066448342DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra40913a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSánchez, Carolina,10aConvenient synthesis of C75, an inhibitor of FAS and CPT1  ap. 6564-6571.  a2019-12-06  aC75 is a synthetic racemic α-methylene-γ-butyrolactone exhibiting anti-tumoral properties in vitro and in vivo as well as inducing hypophagia and weight loss in rodents. These interesting properties are thought to be a consequence of the inhibition of the key enzymes FAS and CPT1 involved in lipid metabolism. The need for larger amounts of this compound for biological evaluation prompted us to develop a convenient and reliable route to multigram quantities of C75 from easily available ethyl penta-3,4-dienoate 6. A recently described protocol for the addition of 6 to a mixture of dicyclohexylborane and nonanal followed by acidic treatment of the crude afforded lactone 8, as a mixture of cis and trans isomers, in good yield. The DBU-catalyzed isomerization of the methyl esters 9 arising from 8 gave a 10 : 1 trans/cis mixture from which the trans isomer was isolated and easily transformed into C75. The temporary transformation of C75 into a phenylseleno ether derivative makes its purification, manipulation and storage easier.  aPublisher supplied data 3aundereating 3aisomerization 3alactones 3acis-trans isomers 3abiological assessment 3acarnitine palmitoyltransferase 3alipid metabolism 3acatalytic activity 3aweight loss 3arodents 0aesters1 aMakowski, Kamil1 aMera, Paula1 aFarràs, Jaume1 aNicolás, Ernesto1 aHerrero, Laura1 aAsins, Guillermina1 aSerra, Dolors1 aHegardt, Fausto G.1 aAriza, Xavier1 aGarcía, Jordi,0 tRSC advances.g2013 Apr. 16, v. 3, no. 18 p.6564-6571dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ra40913a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02443naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245009700161300001800258520109300276592002801369650001201397650001401409650003101423650001401454650001101468650000901479650001601488650001401504653000801518653001901526653001801545653001401563700001801577700001501595700001401610700001701624700001501641700005901656700005601715773013901771856007801910852000901988655001201997IND60724086420221120065102.0210120e20210106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072408642DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c206942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xiaoxiao10aHigh-Performance Field Emitters Based on SiC Nanowires with Designed Electron Emission Sites  ap. 3062-3069.  aMaking field emitters with both low turn-on field (Eₜₒ) and high current emission stability is one of the keys to push forward their practical applications. In the present work, we report the exploration of high-performance field emitters with designed sharp corners around SiC nanowires for fundamentally enhanced electron emission sites. The sharp corners with tailored densities are rationally created based on a facile etching technique. Accordingly, the emission sites and nanowires are integrated into a single-crystalline configuration without interfaces, which could offer the emitters with a robust structure to avoid the structural damage induced by the generated Joule heat and electrostatic forces over long-term field emission (FE) operation. Consequently, the Eₜₒ of the as-fabricated SiC field emitter is low down to 0.52 V/μm, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art one ever reported. Moreover, they have high electron emission stability with a current fluctuation of just 2% over 10 h, representing their promising applications in FE-based electronic units.  aPublisher supplied data 3adensity 3aelectrons 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aemissions 3afields 3aheat 3amethodology 3ananowires 0aSiC 0afield emission 0aturn-on field 0astability1 aLou, Chenxuan1 aLi, Weijun1 aWang, Lin1 aGao, Fengmei1 aShao, Gang1 aChen, Shanliang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5037-783X1 aYang, Weiyou1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3607-35140 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Jan. 06, v. 13, no. 2 p.3062-3069dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c206943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03455naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245011400182300001600296520141600312592002801728650002901756650002801785650002201813650003401835650002001869650001001889650002601899650002501925650001801950650001301968650002901981650001102010650006402021650002402085650003602109650002702145650005302172650003902225650006702264650002902331650002802360650002802388650001302416650002002429650005202449650008702501650002402588650002702612650002802639700001702667700002102684773009102705856004802796852000902844655001202853IND4483116620221119225802.0120519e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448311662DNAL7 a224611452pmid7 a10.1007/s00294-012-0373-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlom, Gary A.10aIdentification of an Hsp90 mutation that selectively disrupts cAMP/PKA signaling in Saccharomyces cerevisiae   ap. 149-163.  aThe molecular chaperone Hsp90 cooperates with multiple cochaperone proteins as it promotes the folding and activation of diverse client proteins. Some cochaperones regulate the ATPase activity of Hsp90, while others appear to promote Hsp90 interaction with specific types of client proteins. Through its interaction with the adenylate cyclase Cyr1, the Sgt1 cochaperone modulates the activity of the cAMP pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A specific mutation in yeast Hsp90, hsc82-W296A, or a mutation in Sgt1, sgt1-K360E, resulted in altered transcription patterns genetically linked to the cAMP pathway. Hsp90 interacted with Cyr1 in vivo and the hsc82-W296A mutation resulted in reduced accumulation of Cyr1. Hsp90-Sgt1 interaction was altered by either the hsc82-W296A or sgt1-K360E mutation, suggesting defective Hsp90-Sgt1 cooperation leads to reduced Cyr1 activity. Microarray analysis of hsc82-W296A cells indicated that over 80 % of all transcriptional changes in this strain may be attributed to altered cAMP signaling. This suggests that a majority of the cellular defects observed in hsc82-W296A cells are due to altered interaction with one specific essential cochaperone, Sgt1 and one essential client, Cyr1. Together our results indicate that specific interaction of Hsp90 and Sgt1 with Cyr1 plays a key role in regulating gene expression, including genes involved in polarized morphogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3aadenylate cyclase 3acAMP-dependent protein kinase 3agene expression 3agenes 3amicroarray technology 3amolecular chaperones 3amorphogenesis 3amutation 3atranscription (genetics) 3ayeasts 2aAdaptor Proteins, Signal Transducingxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAntifungal Agentsxpharmacology 2aCyclic AMPxmetabolism 2aCyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinasesxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungal 2aHSP90 Heat-Shock Proteinsxantagonists & inhibitorsxgenetics. 2aMacrolidesxpharmacology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMorphogenesisxgenetics 2aMutation 2aProtein Binding 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteinsxantagonists & inhibitorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSignal Transduction 2aTranscription, Genetic 2aUp-Regulationxgenetics1 aLangner, Ewa1 aJohnson, Jill L.0 tCurrent genetics.g2012 June, v. 58, no. 3 p.149-163dSpringer-Verlagx0172-80837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00294-012-0373-7  aDNAL 7aarticle02140naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100001700169245006000186300001600246500001500262520103200277592002801309650001301337650001301350650001501363650004301378650001301421650001001434650001101444650001501455651001001470653001101480700002201491700002301513700002101536773009001557856008601647852000901733655001201742IND4456590120221119041839.0141111e20110901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445659012DNAL7 a252143452pmid7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.03.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDykes, Linda10aFlavonoid composition of lemon-yellow sorghum genotypes  ap. 173-179.  a2019-12-06  aFlavonoid composition of lemon-yellow sorghums grown in two locations in Texas, USA was evaluated and compared with that of white and red sorghums using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-PDA).

Cu exposure increased hepatic 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and malic enzyme activities, whereas fatty acid synthetase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, and carnitine palmitoyltransferases I activities remained unaffected. Cu, zinc, iron, and manganese contents were also changed in several tissues (gill, liver, spleen, gastrointestinal tract, and muscle) in a tissue-, dose-, and time-dependent manner. This was the first study to examine the effects of waterborne Cu exposure on several enzymatic activities mediating hepatic lipogenesis and lipolysis in fish as well as to show that waterborne Cu exposure could enhance the metabolism of lipid synthesis and consequently induce the increase of hepatic lipid deposition in S. hasta.  aPublisher supplied data 3amanganese 3afatty acids 3aisocitrate dehydrogenase 3alipogenesis 3ahepatosomatic index 3afish 3amalic enzyme 3agastrointestinal system 3airon 3aspleen 3achronic exposure 3afatty liver 3aNADP-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 3acopper 3aenzyme activity 3aphosphogluconate dehydrogenase 3alipid content 3aliver 3azinc 3along term effects 3acarnitine palmitoyltransferase 3alipolysis 3agills 2aAnimals 2aCopperxtoxicity 2aGluconatesxmetabolism 2aGlucosephosphate Dehydrogenasexmetabolism 2aLipid Metabolismxdrug effects 2aLiverxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aPerciformesxphysiology 2aToxicity Tests, Chronic 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxtoxicity 0aglucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase1 aLuo, Zhi1 aLiu, Xu1 aSong, Yu-Feng1 aLiu, Cai-Xia1 aZheng, Jia-Lang1 aZhao, Yan-Hong0 tArchives of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2013 Feb., v. 64, no. 2 p.301-315dSpringer-Verlagx0090-43417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00244-012-9835-7  aDNAL 7aarticle03278naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245007200174300001600246520155100262592002801813650001801841650002701859650001301886650000801899650001601907650001101923650001101934650001501945650001201960650001101972650001701983650001702000650001302017650001902030650001502049650001102064653000802075653001002083653001302093653000802106653000802114653000802122653000802130653001002138653000802148653000802156653000902164653000802173653000802181653001002189653001402199653001802213653002002231653002002251653001902271653002102290700001702311700001702328700001902345700001802364773010202382856008702484852000902571655001202580IND60545637920221118125406.0160902e20141115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054563792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.08.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLang-Yona, Naama10aMarine aerosol as a possible source for endotoxins in coastal areas  ap. 311-318.  aMarine aerosols, that are very common in the highly populated coastal cities and communities, may contain biological constituents. Some of this biological fraction of marine aerosols, such as cyanobacteria and plankton debris, may influence human health by inflammation and allergic reactions when inhaled. In this study we identify and compare sources for endotoxins sampled on filters in an on-shore and more-inland site. Filter analysis included endotoxin content, total bacteria, gram-negative bacteria and cyanobacteria genome concentrations as well as ion content in order to identify possible sources for the endotoxins. Satellite images of chlorophyll-a levels and back trajectory analysis were used to further study the cyanobacteria blooms in the sea, close to the trajectory of the sampled air. The highest endotoxin concentrations found in the shoreline site were during winter (3.23±0.17 EU/m3), together with the highest cyanobacteria genome (1065.5 genome/m3). The elevated endotoxin concentrations were significantly correlated with cyanobacterial levels scaled to the presence of marine aerosol (r=0.90), as well as to chlorophyll-a (r=0.96). Filters sampled further inland showed lower and non-significant correlation between endotoxin and cyanobacteria (r=0.70, P value=0.19), suggesting decrease in marine-originated endotoxin, with possible contributions from other sources of gram-negative non-cyanobacteria. We conclude that marine cyanobacteria may be a dominant contributor to elevated endotoxin levels in coastal areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aaerosols 3aair 3achlorophyll 3acities 3acoasts 3aendotoxins 3afilters 3agenome 3ahuman health 3ainflammation 3aplankton 3aremote sensing 3ashorelines 3awinter 0aCl- 0achl-a 0acyano/Na 0aHCl 0aLAL 0aLPS 0aMDL 0aMODIS 0aNFW 0aLRW 0aqPCR 0aNa+ 0aCSE 0aDECOS 0aEndotoxin 0aCyanobacteria 0aMarine aerosols 0aFilter sampling 0aHealth effects 0agenomic analysis1 aLehahn, Yoav1 aHerut, Barak1 aBurshtein, Noa1 aRudich, Yinon0 tScience of the total environment.g2014 Nov. 15, v. 499 p.311-318dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.08.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03479naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245012600175300001400301520192500315592002802240650002202268650001302290650001102303650001402314650001602328650003002344650001502374650001102389650001602400650001102416650001802427650002002445650002202465650001202487650001602499650001002515651001102525653001502536653001402551653001402565653001602579653001502595653002002610653001402630653001102644653001202655653001602667700002602683700002402709773012002733856005102853852000902904655001202913IND50075791220221119082524.0140410e20130301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007579122DNAL7 a10.1080/10256016.2012.6770412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSamborska, Katarzyna10aEstimation of groundwater residence time using environmental radioisotopes (14C,T) in carbonate aquifers, southern Poland  ap. 73-97.  aTriassic carbonate aquifers in the Upper Silesia region, affected by intense withdrawal, have been investigated by means of isotopic analyses of ¹⁴C, δ¹³C, δ²H, δ¹⁸O and ³H. The isotopic examinations were carried out in the 1970s and in the early 1980s, and it was the first application of tracers to estimate age and vulnerability for the contamination of groundwater in this region. Similar isotopic analyses were conducted in 2007 and 2008 with the same Triassic carbonate formation. The isotopic examinations were performed within the confined part of the carbonate formation, wherein aquifers are covered by semi-permeable deposits. The direct recharge of the aquifer occurs in the outcrop areas, but it mainly takes place due to percolation of the water through aquitards and erosional windows. The Triassic aquifer has been intensively drained by wells and by lead–zinc mines. Nowadays, the declining water demand and closure of some mines have induced a significant increase in the water table level. The detailed analysis of the results, including the radiocarbon age corrections and the comparison of radioisotope activities, has made it possible to estimate the range of residence time within the carbonate Triassic aquifer. This range from several tens to several tens of thousands indicates that the recharge of aquifers might have occurred between modern times and the Pleistocene. The apparent age of the water estimated on the basis of ¹⁴C activity was corrected considering the carbon isotope exchange and the diffusion between mobile water in fractures and stagnant water in micropores. The obtained corrected period of recharge corresponds to the result of investigations of noble gases, which were carried out in the 1990s. In almost half of the cases, groundwater is a mixture of young and old water. The mixing processes occur mainly in areas of heavy exploitation of the aquifer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aage determination 3aaquifers 3acarbon 3adeuterium 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3amicropores 3amixing 3anoble gases 3aoxygen 3aradionuclides 3astable isotopes 3atracer techniques 3atritium 3awater table 3awells 3aPoland 0aage dating 0acarbon-13 0acarbon-14 0agroundwater 0ahydrogen-2 0amixing of water 0aoxygen-18 0aPoland 0atritium 0awater cycle1 aRóżkowski, Andrzej,1 aMaloszewski, Piotr,0 tIsotopes in environmental and health studies.g2013 Mar. 1, v. 49, no. 1 p.73-97dTaylor & Francisx1477-26397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10256016.2012.677041  aDNAL 7aarticle03240naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245017100159300001600330500002000346520167700366592002802043650002302071650000902094650001302103650001202116650001702128650002702145650002202172650002302194650001502217650001102232650001402243650000702257650002702264650001902291650001302310650001902323650001202342650001002354650000902364651001102373700002202384700002802406700001602434700002002450700002102470700001902491773010602510856007302616852000902689655001202698IND60550203020221122100800.0160909e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055020302DNAL7 a10.1111/sum.122832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRocha, J.

Understanding the dynamics of decomposition for these residues and their effects on soil fertility are relevant for the management of forest plantations. The objectives with this study were to assess the effects of forest residue management and fertilizer, both applied in the establishment of a Eucalyptus grandis Hill ex Maiden stand, on the decomposition rate (k), nutrient release and soil fertility after harvest of this stand. The treatments were applied to a plantation (R1). After 8 yr, R1 was clear‐cut and all of the treatments were reapplied to a new planting (R2). At the end of R1 (age of 8 yr), there was a reduction of 10% in the wood volume in the treatment with the forest residues removed and 36% reduction with no fertilizer application. At the end of 1 yr for plantation R2, these reductions were 30 and 57%, respectively. Residue decomposition under R2 was assessed by a new approach that involved collecting samples directly on the site without using litter bags. The k of forest residues was 3.6 for leaves, 1.2 for bark and 0.8 for branches. The application of small rates of N and P fertilizer did not influence the k of forest residues. In the first 300 days after clear‐cutting, approximately 50% of N, P, Ca, Mg and S and 80% of K in the forest residues were released. Even so, this did not result in significant changes in soil fertility levels. Only small reductions in soil N and P contents over time and changes in topsoil pH resulted from forest residue removal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus grandis 3abark 3abranches 3acalcium 3aclearcutting 3afertilizer application 3aforest management 3aforest plantations 3aharvesting 3aleaves 3amagnesium 3apH 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3aplant residues 3aplanting 3asoil fertility 3atopsoil 3atrees 3awood 3aBrazil1 aMarques, E.

Three other RH control methods of continuous fanning, setting constant target RH (namely Whole process 30 %) and controlling RH based on RH change (namely 30 %-RH) were also carried out for comparison. Drying time of 30 %-RWSA group was significantly (p ≤ 0.05) shortened, while shrinkage, RWSA, rehydration ratio were insignificantly different from (p > 0.05) those of 30 %-RH group. The cell aspect ratio of continuous fanning group was the lowest. The results showed that the qualities of shiitake mushrooms could not be improved by shortening RH keeping time, shiitake mushroom should be dried in low RH environment. The Gaussian process regression (GPR) model was effective for on-line prediction of RWSA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLentinula edodes 3aair 3acomputer vision 3acontrol methods 3adehumidification 3amodels 3amushrooms 3anormal distribution 3aprediction 3arehydration 3arelative humidity 3ashrinkage 3asurface area 0aSurface wrinkling 0aCell aspect ratio 0aGaussian process regression1 aZhang, Yue1 aZhang, Yuting1 aLiu, Yanhong1 aGao, Zhenjiang1 aZhu, Guangfei1 aXie, Yongkang1 aMowafy, Samir0 tJournal of food engineering.g2022 Feb., v. 315 p.110814-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2021.1108143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02196naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245007000170300001400240520075100254592002801005650002101033650002101054650001001075650002101085650002201106650002201128650001201150650002201162650001601184650002101200650004401221650001901265653001601284653001501300653001801315653001601333653002001349653002001369700002401389700002401413700002401437700002601461700002901487773009301516856008401609852000901693655001201702IND60634281220221123034840.0200614e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063428122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.algal.2018.03.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aImbs, Tatiana I.10aFucoidanase inhibitory activity of phlorotannins from brown algae  ap. 54-59.  aThe inhibitors of recombinant fucoidanase FFA2 from the marine bacterium Formosa algae KMM 3553ᵀ were found among the metabolites of brown algae Fucus evanescens and Costaria costata. NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry analysis showed that high molecular weight phlorethols (degree of polymerization (DP) of 12–25 monomers) from C. costata (ICc) and fucophloretol (DP = 3) from F. evanescens (IFe) were inhibitors of fucoidanase. To inhibit one mole of FFA2 fucoidanase about two molecules of the ICc inhibitor or 7 molecules of the IFe inhibitor are needed. It has been suggested that the effectiveness of inhibition increases with the increasing molecular weight of phlorotannins. An irreversible type of inhibition was established.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCostaria costata 3aFucus evanescens 3aalgae 3aaquatic bacteria 3aenzyme inhibition 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aenzymes 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3amolecular weight 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolymerization 0aFucoidanase 0aInhibitors 0aPhlorotannins 0aPhlorethols 0aFucophlorethols 0aElectrophoresis1 aSilchenko, Artem S.1 aFedoreev, Sergey A.1 aIsakov, Vladimir V.1 aErmakova, Svetlana P.1 aZvyagintseva, Tatiana N.0 tAlgal research.g2018 June, v. 32 p.54-59dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12360x2211-92647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.algal.2018.03.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03375naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245012100165300001600286520163800302592002801940650003701968650001002005650002002015650003902035650001602074650001002090650001302100650002102113650001702134650001302151650001402164650004302178650005202221650001702273653000802290653001102298653000902309653000802318653000802326653000802334653000802342653001102350653000902361653000802370653000902378653000902387653002902396653001602425653001302441653001402454653001802468700002002486700002202506700002102528700002302549773007402572856008202646852000902728655001202737IND60552394120221117011419.0161021e20140601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055239412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2014.03.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJoshi, Dolly10aDown-regulation of miR-199b associated with imatinib drug resistance in 9q34.1 deleted BCR/ABL positive CML patients  ap. 109-112.  aChronic myeloid leukemia (CML) occurs due to t(9,22) (q34;q11) and molecularly BCR/ABL gene fusion. About 15–18% Philadelphia positive CML patients have gene deletions around the translocation breakpoints on 9q34.1. The microRNAs (miRNAs), namely miR-219-2 and miR-199b, centromeric to the ABL1 gene are frequently lost in CML patients. We have designed a study to determine miR-219-2 and miR-199b expression levels which would help to understand the prognosis of imatinib therapy. A total of 150 CML patients were analyzed to identify 9q deletion. Fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) was performed using BCR/ABL dual color, dual fusion probe to study the signal pattern and BAC probes for miR-199b and miR-219-2 (RP11-339B21 and RP11-395P17) to study the miRNA deletions. The expression level of miRNA was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). FISH analysis revealed 9q34.1 deletion in 34 (23%) CML patients. The deletions were not detected using BAC probes for miRNAs in 9q deleted patients. The expression analysis showed down-regulation of miR-199b and miR-219-2 in the 9q deleted patients (34 CML) as compared to a pool of patients without deletion. However, miR-199b (9q34.11) was significantly (p=0.001) down-regulated compared to miR-219-2. The follow-up study showed that the miR-199b was found to be strongly associated with imatinib resistance, as 44.11% patients showed resistance to imatinib therapy. Hence, the deletion in 9q34.1 region (ABL) plays an important role in disease pathogenesis. Eventually, miRNAs can provide new therapeutic strategies and can be used as a prognostic indicator.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacterial artificial chromosomes 3acolor 3adrug resistance 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3agene fusion 3agenes 3amicroRNA 3amyeloid leukemia 3apathogenesis 3apatients 3aprognosis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atherapeutics 0aCML 0amiRNAs 0aFISH 0aBAC 0aBCR 0aABL 0aPCR 0aRT-PCR 0aREST 0aCHR 0aMCyR 0aCCyR 0aChronic myeloid leukemia 0a9q deletion 0amiR-199b 0amiR-219-2 0aReal time PCR1 aChandrakala, S.1 aKorgaonkar, Seema1 aGhosh, Kanjaksha1 aVundinti, Babu Rao0 tGene.g2014 June 01, v. 542 p.109-112dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2014.03.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03493naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245011000174300001400284520161500298592002801913650001501941650002701956650001601983650002201999650001102021650002002032650001702052650002802069650002202097650001802119650002402137650001502161650001302176650001902189650002602208653000802234653001202242653000802254653000802262653000802270653001502278653000902293653000802302653000702310653001002317653000902327653000802336653000702344653000902351653000802360653001002368653001002378653001002388653000902398653000902407653000802416653000802424653000902432653001602441653002502457700001302482700001402495700002002509700001702529700001602546773007502562856008902637852000902726655001202735IND60545470120221119153651.0160902e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054547012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2015.06.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Binliang14aThe combined effects of UV-C radiation and H2O2 on Microcystis aeruginosa, a bloom-forming cyanobacterium  ap. 34-43.  aIn order to get insight into the impacts of UVC/H2O2 on Microcystis aeruginosa, physiological and morphological changes as well as toxicity were detected under different UVC/H2O2 treatments. In the presence of sole UVC or H2O2, the net oxygen evolution rate decreased significantly (p<0.05) since activity of photosystem II (PSII) was inhibited. Meanwhile, increase of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), degradation of microcystin (MC) and ultrastructure destructions were observed. Under sole UVC treatment, no changes happened in the activity of photosystem I (PSI), but the degradation of D1 protein was observed. Under sole H2O2 treatment, an increase of malondialdehyde, aggregation of D1 protein and deformation of the thylakoid membrane were observed. ROS content under H2O2 treatment was about 5 times than that under UVC treatment. Combined use of UVC and H2O2, as well as 20mJcm−2 UVC and 60μM H2O2, showed high synergetic effects. Obvious damage to membrane systems, the marked degradation of MC and inhibition of the photosystems were observed. It could be deduced that UVC worked on intracellular membrane components directly and the damaged oxygen-evolving complex, which was followed by the D1 protein degradation. H2O2 oxidised the membrane lipids via an ROS-mediated process, with thylakoid injury and the aggregation of D1 protein being the lethal mechanisms, and both PSII and PSI being the attacking targets. With regard towards the effective inactivation of M. aeruginosa and high removal of MC, UVC/H2O2 proposed a novel practical method in controlling cyanobacterial blooms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aD1 protein 3aMicrocystis aeruginosa 3adeformation 3ahydrogen peroxide 3alipids 3amalondialdehyde 3amicrocystins 3aoxygen evolving complex 3aoxygen production 3aphotosystem I 3aprotein degradation 3athylakoids 3atoxicity 3aultrastructure 3aultraviolet radiation 0aROS 0aDCFH-DA 0aMDA 0aTCA 0aTBA 0aSDS–PAGE 0aPVDF 0aPBS 0aMC 0aMC-LR 0aHPLC 0aPAR 0aSP 0aPSII 0aPSI 0aFv/Fm 0aETRII 0aY(II) 0aETRI 0aY(I) 0aOEC 0aUVC 0aH2O2 0aPhotosystem 0aCyanobacterial bloom1 aWang, Xi1 aHu, Yiwei1 aChang, Mingxian1 aBi, Yonghong1 aHu, Zhengyu0 tChemosphere.g2015 Dec., v. 141 p.34-43dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2015.06.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01365naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245009800162300001800260500002000278520039800298592002800696650001200724650002800736650002400764650002200788700002300810700002100833700001700854773009800871856007300969852000901042655001201051IND60571215320221116150738.0170712e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057121532DNAL7 a10.1890/07-0842.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalmer, Michael W.10aIndices for detecting differences in species composition: some simplifications of rda and cca  ap. 1769-1771.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe provide algebraic simplifications for the redundancy analysis (RDA) eigenvalue and the canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) eigenvalue in the special case of permanent plots sampled twice.

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and can drive cancer recurrence. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) DLX6-AS1 on osteosarcoma stemness and the underlying mechanism involved. DLX6-AS1 enhanced osteosarcoma stemness in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, DLX6-AS1 competitively interacted with miR-129-5p to DLK1, resulting in activation of Wnt signaling and promotion of stemness in osteosarcoma. DLX6-AS1 functionally interplayed with miR-129-5p to form a reciprocal feedback loop to activate Wnt signaling. High DLX6-AS1 expression was observed in osteosarcoma tissues, and predicted a poor prognosis for osteosarcoma patients. Our study suggests that DLX6-AS1, combined with miR-129-5p and DLK1, can be utilized as factors for the clinical diagnosis and prognosis of osteosarcoma, and may be potential targets for the treatment of osteosarcoma.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescents 3adrug therapy 3anon-coding RNA 3aosteosarcoma 3apatients 3aprognosis 3aradiotherapy 3astem cells 0aDLX6-AS1 0amiR-129-5p 0aDLK1 0aStemness 0aOsteosarcoma 0aCSCs 0aLncRNAs 0aRIP 0aceRNAs 0aRISC1 aTang, Ting1 aYu, Hai-Ming1 aYao, Xue-Dong0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 Dec. 09, v. 507, no. 1-4 p.260-266dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.11.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02554naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245010900159300001600268520127900284592002801563650001501591650001201606650001401618650001501632650001801647650001701665650001201682650002501694650002201719650001201741650001301753650000901766650002001775651001401795700001501809700001601824700001701840700001401857700001601871700001301887773011301900856007402013852000902087655001202096IND60081340120221120222257.0150207e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008134012DNAL7 a10.1111/conl.120622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAttiwill, P.M.10aTimber Harvesting Does Not Increase Fire Risk and Severity in Wet Eucalypt Forests of Southern Australia  ap. 341-354.  aLindenmayer et al. proposed that logging makes “some kinds of forests more prone to increased probability of ignition and increased fire severity.” The proposition was developed most strongly in relation to the wet eucalypt forests of south‐eastern Australia. A key argument was that logging in wet forests results in drier forests that tend to be more fire‐prone, and this argument has gained prominence both in the literature and in policy debate. We find no support for that argument from considerations of eucalypt stand development, and from reanalysis of the only Australian study cited by Lindenmayer et al. In addition, there is no evidence from recent megafires in Victoria that younger regrowth (<10 years) burnt with greater severity than older forest (>70 years); furthermore, forests in reserves (with no logging) did not burn with less severity than multiple‐use forests (with some logging). The flammability of stands of different ages can be explained in terms of stand structure and fuel accumulation, rather than as a dichotomy of regrowth stands being highly flammable but mature and old‐growth stands not highly flammable. Lack of management of fire‐adapted ecosystems carries long‐term social, economic, and environmental consequences.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus 3aburning 3aeconomics 3aecosystems 3afire severity 3aflammability 3aforests 3afuels (fire ecology) 3aissues and policy 3alogging 3aregrowth 3arisk 3astand structure 3aAustralia1 aRyan, M.F.1 aBurrows, N.1 aCheney, N.P.1 aMcCaw, L.1 aNeyland, M.1 aRead, S.0 tConservation letters.g2014 July, v. 7, no. 4 p.341-354dBlackwell Pub.wJournal:J000000138x1755-263X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/conl.120623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03034naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001400155245011100169300001600280520163300296592002801929650001601957650002401973650002401997650001902021650002402040650001102064650001802075650002002093650001502113650001402128650001802142650001302160650000902173650001602182653001102198653001702209653001202226653001302238653001402251700002302265700003102288700002402319700002202343773007702365856008902442852000902531655001202540IND60545470220221119153746.0160902e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054547022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2015.06.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Lan12aA comparative analysis on the in vivo toxicity of copper nanoparticles in three species of freshwater fish  ap. 181-189.  aCopper nanoparticles (CuNPs) are used extensively in a wide range of products and the potential for toxicological impacts in the aquatic environment is of high concern. In this study, the fate and the acute toxicity of spherical 50nm copper nanoparticles was assessed in juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) and zebrafish (Danio rerio) for in vivo aqueous exposures following standardized OECD 203 guideline tests. The fate of the CuNPs in the aqueous media was temperature dependent. At the higher study temperature (26±1°C), there was both an enhanced particle aggregation and higher rate of dissolution compared with that at the lower study temperature (15±1°C). 96h LC50s of the CuNPs were 0.68±0.15, 0.28±0.04 and 0.22±0.08mg Cu/L for rainbow trout, fathead minnow and zebrafish, respectively. The 96h lowest-observed-effect concentration (LOEC) for the CuNPs were 0.17, 0.023 and <0.023mg/L for rainbow trout, fathead minnow, and zebrafish respectively, and are below the predicted environmental concentration of CuNPs for some aquatic environments suggesting a possible ecotoxicological risk to fish. Soluble copper was one of main drivers for the acute toxicity of the copper nanoparticles suspensions. Both CuNPs suspension and copper nitrate caused damage to gill filaments and gill pavement cells, with differences in sensitivity for these effects between the fish species studied. We show therefore common toxicological effects of CuNPs in different fish species but with differences in sensitivity with implications for hazard extrapolation between fish species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aPimephales promelas 3aacute toxicity 3aaquatic environment 3acopper 3aecotoxicology 3afreshwater fish 3aguidelines 3ajuveniles 3ananoparticles 3anitrates 3arisk 3atemperature 0aCopper 0aNanoparticle 0aIn vivo 0aToxicity 0aHistology1 aVijver, Martina G.1 aPeijnenburg, Willie J.G.M.1 aGalloway, Tamara S.1 aTyler, Charles R.0 tChemosphere.g2015 Nov., v. 139 p.181-189dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2015.06.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03557naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245014300165300001200308520194100320592002802261650001902289650001702308650001702325650002302342650001402365650002302379650001102402650001202413650001302425650001302438650002602451650001002477650001102487650001502498650002002513650002202533650001502555650001502570650001402585650003002599650001302629650001902642650001502661650000902676651001002685700001802695700001802713700001902731700001702750773013402767856008102901852000902982655001202991IND60555824620221120134952.0161030e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055582462DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-016-5577-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Mohit10aMultitemporal analysis of forest fragmentation in Hindu Kush Himalaya—a case study from Khangchendzonga Biosphere Reserve, Sikkim, India  ap. 596.  aForests in the mountains are a treasure trove; harbour a large biodiversity; and provide fodder, firewood, timber and non-timber forest products; all of these are essential for human survival in the highest mountains on earth. The present paper attempts a spatiotemporal assessment of forest fragmentation and changes in land use land cover (LULC) pattern using multitemporal satellite data over a time span of around a decade (2000–2009), within the third highest protected area (PA) in the world. The fragmentation analysis using Landscape Fragmentation Tool (LFT) depicts a decrease in large core, edge and patches areas by 5.93, 3.64 and 0.66 %, respectively, while an increase in non-forest and perforated areas by 6.59 and 4.01 %, respectively. The land cover dynamics shows a decrease in open forest, alpine scrub, alpine meadows, snow and hill shadow areas by 2.81, 0.39, 8.18, 3.46 and 0.60 %, respectively, and there is an increase in dense forest and glacier area by 4.79 and 10.65 %, respectively. The change analysis shows a major transformation in areas from open forest to dense forest and from alpine meadows to alpine scrub. In order to quantify changes induced by forest fragmentation and to characterize composition and configuration of LULC mosaics, fragmentation indices were computed using Fragstats at class level, showing the signs of accelerated fragmentation. The outcome of the analysis revealed the effectiveness of geospatial tools coupled with landscape ecology in characterization and quantification of forest fragmentation and land cover changes. The present study provides a baseline database for sustainable conservation planning that will benefit the subsistence livelihoods in the region. Recommendations made based on the present analysis will help to recover forest and halt the pessimistic effects of fragmentation and land cover changes on biodiversity and ecosystem services in the region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpine meadows 3abiodiversity 3acase studies 3aconservation areas 3adatabases 3aecosystem services 3aforage 3aforests 3afuelwood 3aglaciers 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahills 3ahumans 3aland cover 3aland use change 3alandscape ecology 3alandscapes 3alivelihood 3amountains 3anontimber forest products 3aplanning 3aremote sensing 3ashrublands 3asnow 3aIndia1 aAreendran, G.1 aKrishna, Raj,1 aSharma, Ankita1 aJoshi, P.

Large vertebrates were severely depleted at one site, Boca Manu (BM), whereas the other, Cocha Cashu Biological Station (CC), supported an intact fauna. At both sites we sampled small (≥1 m tall, <1 cm dbh) and large (≥1 cm and <10 cm dbh) saplings in the central portion of 4‐ha plots within which all trees ≥10 cm dbh were mapped and identified. This design ensured that all conspecific adults within at least 50 m (BM) or 55 m (CC) of any sapling would have known locations. We used the Janzen‐Connell model to make five predictions about the sapling cohorts at BM with respect to CC: (1) reduced overall sapling recruitment, (2) increased recruitment of species dispersed by abiotic means, (3) altered relative abundances of species, (4) prominence of large‐seeded species among those showing depressed recruitment, and (5) little or no tendency for saplings to cluster closer to adults at BM. Our results affirmed each of these predictions. Interpreted at face value, the evidence suggests that few species are demographically stable at BM and that up to 28% are increasing and 72% decreasing. Loss of dispersal function allows species dispersed abiotically and by small birds and mammals to substitute for those dispersed by large birds and mammals. Although we regard these conclusions as preliminary, over the long run, the observed type of directional change in tree composition is likely to result in biodiversity loss and negative feedbacks on both the animal and plant communities. Our results suggest that the best, and perhaps only, way to prevent compositional change and probable loss of diversity in tropical tree communities is to prohibit hunting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abiodiversity 3abirds 3afauna 3afloodplains 3amammals 3amodels 3aplant communities 3aprediction 3asaplings 3aspecies recruitment 3atropical forests 3aPeru1 aNuñez-Iturri, Gabriela1 aPitman, Nigel C.

In addition, the effects of Lipid multi-particulates (LMP) formulation on creatine stability and bioavailability were assessed in rodents and healthy human subjects. When used individually, L-carnitine tartrate at 50 µM and creatine monohydrate at 0.5 µM did not affect myoblast protein synthesis and signaling. However, when combined, they led to a significant increase in protein synthesis. Increased AKT and RPS6 phosphorylation were observed with 50 µM L-carnitine tartrate 5 µM creatine in combination in primary human myoblasts. When Wistar rats were administered creatine with LMP formulation at either 21 or 51 mg/kg, bioavailability was increased by 27% based on the increase in the area under the curve (AUC) at a 51 mg/kg dose compared to without LMP formulation. Tmax and Cmax were unchanged. Finally, in human subjects, a combination of LMP formulated L-carnitine at 500 mg (from L-carnitine tartrate) with LMP formulated creatine at 100, 200, or 500 mg revealed a significant and dose-dependent increase in plasma creatine concentrations. Serum total L-carnitine levels rose in a similar manner in the three combinations. These results suggest that a combination of low doses of L-carnitine tartrate and creatine monohydrate may lead to a significant and synergistic enhancement of muscle protein synthesis and activation of anabolic signaling. In addition, the LMP formulation of creatine improved its bioavailability. L-carnitine at 500 mg and LMP-formulated creatine at 200 or 500 mg may be useful for future clinical trials to evaluate the effects on muscle protein synthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanabolism 3abioavailability 3ablood serum 3acarnitine 3acreatine 3adose response 3ahumans 3alipids 3amuscle protein 3amyoblasts 3aphosphorylation 3aprotein synthesis1 aRivas, Donato 1 aGrosicki, Gregory J.1 aEzzyat, Yassine 1 aCeglia, Lisa 1 aPrice, Lori Lyn1 aOrhan, Cemal 1 aŞahin, Kazım,1 aFowler, Kelli 1 aWhite, Tyler 1 aDurkee, Shane 1 aKritsch, Katja 1 aBellamine, Aouatef 0 tNutrients.g2021 Nov. 09, v. 13, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu131139853Available from publisher's site  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03737naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245008600159300001600245500002000261520202400281592002802305650002502333650002502358650001402383650002702397650001302424650001202437650001902449650001702468650002902485650001702514650002802531650001602559650002702575650002802602650003602630650001602666650001702682650001102699650001202710650000902722650001202731650002802743650001702771650002102788650001402809650001602823650001102839650001302850700001702863700002702880700002202907773012402929856007303053852000903126655001203135IND60588127920221120143114.0180103e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058812792DNAL7 a10.1002/tox.222652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDas, Shubhankar10aHarmonization of Mangiferin on methylmercury engendered mitochondrial dysfunction  ap. 630-644.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMangiferin (MGN), a C‐glucosylxanthone abundantly found in mango plants, was studied for its potential to ameliorate methylmercury (MeHg) induced mitochondrial damage in HepG2 (human hepatocarcinoma) cell line. Cell viability experiments performed using 3‐[4,5‐dimethylthiazol‐2‐yl]‐2,5‐ diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) showed protective property of MGN in annulling MeHg‐induced cytotoxicity. Conditioning the cells with optimal dose of MGN (50 µM) lowered MeHg‐induced oxidative stress, calcium influx/efflux, depletion of mitochondrial trans‐membrane potential and prevented mitochondrial fission as observed by decrease in Mitotracker red fluorescence, expression of pDRP1 (serine 616), and DRP1 levels. MGN pre‐treated cells demonstrated elevation in the activities of glutathione (GSH), Glutathione‐S‐transferase (GST), Glutathione peroxidase (GPx), Glutathione reductase (GR), reduced levels of Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) enzyme complexes. In addition, the anti‐apoptotic effect of MGN was clearly indicated by the reduction in MeHg‐induced apoptotic cells analyzed by flowcytometric analysis after Annexin V‐FITC/propidium iodide staining. In conclusion, the present work demonstrates the ability of a dietary polyphenol, MGN to ameliorate MeHg‐mediated mitochondrial dysfunction in human hepatic cells in vitro. This hepatoprotective potential may be attributed predominantly to the free radical scavenging/antioxidant property of MGN, by facilitating the balancing of cellular Ca²⁺ ions, maintenance of redox homeostasis and intracellular antioxidant activities, ultimately preserving the mitochondrial function and cell viability after MeHg intoxication. As MeHg intoxication occurs over a period of time, continuous consumption of such dietary compounds may prove to be very useful in promoting human health. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In this study, we isolated mutants of the unicellular green alga, Coccomyxa sp. strain Obi, defective in the gene for the large subunit of ATP:α-d-glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase (AGPL) by means of a transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) as follows. First, two expression cassettes encoding left and right arms of TALEN for AGPL mutagenesis were introduced into strain Obi, and from two independent transformants of strain Obi carrying both expression cassettes, seven derivatives bearing different mutations in AGPL were isolated. When these mutants were grown in 1/2-diluted and 1/3-diluted minimal media, their lipid contents were significantly higher than those of their parental strains. The growth in 1/3-diluted medium was similar between the mutants and their parental strains, while the growth in 1/2-diluted medium was significantly lower for the mutants than for their parental strains. The lipid productivity, which is a crucial factor for commercial production of biofuels, was not statistically different between the parental and mutant strains. We concluded that the suppression of starch biosynthesis to increase lipid productivity in microalgae is a risky strategy as it could result in low biomass productivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3aCoccomyxa 3aScenedesmus obliquus 3abiofuels 3abiomass production 3abiosynthesis 3agenes 3alipids 3amicroalgae 3amutagenesis 3amutants 3astarch 3atranscription (genetics) 3atransferases 0aAGPase 0aAGPL 0aTALEN 0aBiofuel 0aStarch 0aGreen alga 0aα-d-Glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase 0aTALEN1 aIde, Yoko1 aHayakawa, Jumpei1 aYoshimitsu, Yuya1 aFukuhara, Izumi1 aAbe, Jun1 aKasai, Yuki1 aHarayama, Shigeaki0 tAlgal research.g2018 June, v. 32 p.300-307dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12360x2211-92647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.algal.2018.04.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02656naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245009600165520159600261592002801857650001601885650002301901650001801924650001801942650001401960650001401974651001201988700002102000700002002021700002102041700001502062700002202077773012302099856007502222852000902297655001202306IND60757854820221118013922.0211125e20211109xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075785482DNAL7 a10.3390/nu131139862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiedermaier, Tobias 10aPotential of Vitamin D Food Fortification in Prevention of Cancer Deaths—A Modeling Study  aMeta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have estimated a 13% reduction of cancer mortality by vitamin D supplementation among older adults.

Then, we derived expected effects on total cancer mortality and related costs and savings from potential implementation of vitamin D food fortification in Germany and compared the results to those for supplementation. In RCTs with vitamin D supplementation in average doses of 820–2000 IU per day, serum concentrations of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D increased by 15–30 nmol/L, respectively. Studies on food fortification found increases by 10–42 nmol/L, thus largely in the range of increases previously demonstrated by supplementation. Fortification is estimated to be considerably less expensive than supplementation. It might be similarly effective as supplementation in reducing cancer mortality and might even achieve such reduction at substantially larger net savings. Although vitamin D overdoses are unlikely in food fortification programs, implementation should be accompanied by a study monitoring the frequency of potentially occurring adverse effects by overdoses, such as hypercalcemia. Future studies on effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation and fortification are warranted.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3afood fortification 3ahypercalcemia 3ameta-analysis 3amortality 3avitamin D 3aGermany1 aGredner, Thomas 1 aKuznia, Sabine 1 aSchöttker, Ben 1 aMons, Ute 1 aBrenner, Hermann 0 tNutrients.g2021 Nov. 09, v. 13, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu131139863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03451naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245019000161300001600351500002000367520177400387592002802161650001602189650002802205650001302233650002102246650002702267650002302294650001402317650001202331650001602343650001102359650002402370650001302394650001102407650001902418650002102437650002102458650003902479650002102518650001502539700002402554700002002578700002002598700002102618700002102639700002202660700002102682773012402703856007302827852000902900655001202909IND60588128020221120071353.0180103e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058812802DNAL7 a10.1002/tox.222472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTseng, Tsui‐Hwa10aInhibition of MDA‐MB‐231 breast cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth by apigenin through induction of G2/M arrest and histone H3 acetylation‐mediated p21WAF1/CIP1 expression  ap. 434-444.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aApigenin (4′,5,7‐trihydroxyflavone), a flavonoid commonly found in fruits and vegetables, has anticancer properties in various malignant cancer cells. However, the molecular basis of the anticancer effect remains to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated the cellular mechanisms underlying the induction of cell cycle arrest by apigenin. Our results showed that apigenin at the nonapoptotic induction concentration inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase in the MDA‐MB‐231 breast cancer cell line. Immunoblot analysis indicated that apigenin suppressed the expression of cyclin A, cyclin B, and cyclin‐dependent kinase‐1 (CDK1), which control the G2‐to‐M phase transition in the cell cycle. In addition, apigenin upregulated p21ᵂᴬF¹/Cᴵᴾ¹ and increased the interaction of p21ᵂᴬF¹/Cᴵᴾ¹ with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), which inhibits cell cycle progression. Furthermore, apigenin significantly inhibited histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity and induced histone H3 acetylation. The subsequent chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay indicated that apigenin increased acetylation of histone H3 in the p21ᵂᴬF¹/Cᴵᴾ¹ promoter region, resulting in the increase of p21ᵂᴬF¹/Cᴵᴾ¹ transcription. In a tumor xenograft model, apigenin effectively delayed tumor growth. In these apigenin‐treated tumors, we also observed reductions in the levels of cyclin A and cyclin B and increases in the levels of p21ᵂᴬF¹/Cᴵᴾ¹ and acetylated histone H3. These findings demonstrate for the first time that apigenin can be used in breast cancer prevention and treatment through epigenetic regulation. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In 2018, a second dose was recommended for individuals between 4 and 6 years old. This study aims to assess the impact of routine varicella vaccination on the number and profile of hospitalized varicella patients during the single dose period, as well as in the first two years after the adoption of the second dose.An observational retrospective study was conducted in an infectious disease pediatric hospital, in Minas Gerais, Brazil. Clinical as well as epidemiological data from patients hospitalized due to varicella between 2010 and 2019 were collected. Patients were split into groups based on the vaccine introduction: pre-vaccine period, single dose and two-dose period. They were compared by age, sex, reason for admission, illness-related complications and clinical outcome.There were 1193 admissions due to varicella during the studied period. When compared with the pre-vaccine period, the number of hospitalizations decreased in 61.5% during the single-dose regime, reaching 95.2% in the two-dose period. Hospitalization rates decreased in all age groups, including non-vaccinated individuals such as those younger than 12 months (92.1%). As for reasons of admission, secondary bacterial skin infections were perceived to be the most common cause (>70%). A reduction was also seen in admission of immunocompromised or HIV positive patients (84.8%).The collected data shows a significant impact in the number of hospital admissions due to varicella after six years of the implementation of the vaccine, positively affecting both vaccinated and non-vaccinated individuals. Further reduction was seen after the second dose was initiated, but its true impact will only be understood fully after a longer period of continuous vaccination.  aPublisher supplied data 3achickenpox 3ahospitals 3aretrospective studies 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aBrazil 0aChickenpox vaccine 0aVaricella zoster virus infection1 aCorrêa, Henrique Peragallos1 aRibeiro, Izabella Avelin1 aNascimento, Victor Adalberto Machado1 aGreco, Chiara Menezes1 aPinto, Isabella Cristina Tristão1 aTeixeira, Daniela Caldas1 aDiniz, Lilian Martins Oliveira1 aRibeiro, José Geraldo Leite0 tVaccine.g2022 Jan. 21, v. 40, no. 2 p.390-395dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.08.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03359naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245021200162300001600374520142600390592002801816650001401844650002501858650001301883650002001896650001401916650001501930650001801945650001701963650001601980650002501996650001102021650001502032650002202047650001502069650001902084650003102103650003402134650001002168650001502178650001502193650001902208650001302227650001602240653002102256653003402277653003702311653002102348653001302369700002002382700002502402700002902427700001902456700002202475700002302497773012402520856008002644852000902724655001202733IND60520665220221118012227.0160522e20160219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052066522DNAL7 a10.1515/prolas-2015-00472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuter, Olga10aWaterless Cleaning Compositions with Disinfection Properties: Efficacy and Environmental Aspects / Bezûdens Tîrîðanas Lîdzekïi Ar Dezinficçjoðo Iedarbîbu: Efektivitâte Un Apkârtçjas Vides Aspekti  ap. 307-313.  aThe microbial ecology of different indoor environments determines the human microbiome. Hence, cleaning and disinfection of indoor environments like hospitals, apartments, automobiles, etc. are of great importance. Nonaqueous surface cleaning preparations (SCPs) are often used for this purpose. A cleaning composition may contain the following compounds: primary surfactant, cosurfactant, solvent, cosolvent, organotropic (organic solubilizing) agent, hydrotropic (water solubilising) agent, water and salts, and special additives. In this paper, the efficacy of complex preparations is discussed, focusing on the chemical composition and testing methods. Particular attention is paid to quaternary ammonium compounds, i.e. surfactants with disinfection properties, which are known to act as antistatic agents, detergents, oil-in-water emulsifiers, corrosion inhibitors, and lubricants. Specificity of target microorganisms, physicochemical properties of surrounding media and treatment mode are the main factors affecting the efficacy of disinfection. Due to the enormous economic importance and massive worldwide use of surfactants and disinfectants, their environmental impact needs to be evaluated and controlled. Increased knowledge and better understanding of the antimicrobial capacity of disinfectants are essential to optimise sanitation procedures, to reduce costs, environment waste and to improve shelf life.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3achemical composition 3acleaning 3acleaning agents 3acorrosion 3adetergents 3adisinfectants 3adisinfection 3aemulsifiers 3aenvironmental impact 3ahumans 3alubricants 3amicrobial ecology 3amicrobiome 3amicroorganisms 3aphysicochemical properties 3aquaternary ammonium compounds 3asalts 3asanitation 3ashelf life 3asolubilization 3asolvents 3asurfactants 0abiodegradability 0aquaternary ammonium compounds 0aminimum inhibitory concentration 0asurface cleaning 0atoxicity1 aDâvids, Madars1 aVecstaudþa, Dagnija1 aÐteinberga, Vilhelmîne1 aKukela, Agnese1 aSegliòð, Valdis1 aKïaviòð, Mâris0 tProceedings of the Latvian Academy of Sciences.g2016 Feb. 19, v. 69, no. 6 p.307-313dDe Gruyter Openx1407-009X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/prolas-2015-00473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03503naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002200155245007900177300001400256520174100270592002802011650002602039650004002065650002902105650002902134650002902163650002602192650001402218650001802232650002202250650002302272650001802295650001702313650001502330650002402345650003702369650000702406650001602413650001902429650002302448650002202471650001002493650001102503653001502514653001202529653001702541653002202558653001402580700005902594700002102653700002402674773012802698856009002826852000902916655001202925IND60637423420221118033440.0190523e20190702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063742342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2019.04.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShwaiki, Laila N.10aInhibitory effect of four novel synthetic peptides on food spoilage yeasts  ap. 43-52.  aThe spoilage of foods caused by the growth of undesirable yeast species is a problem in the food industry. Yeast species such as Zygosaccharomyces bailii, Zygosaccharomyces rouxii, Debaryomyces hansenii, Kluyveromyces lactis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been encountered in foods such as high sugar products, fruit juices, wine, mayonnaise, chocolate and soft drinks. The demand for new methods of preservations has increased because of the negative association attached to chemical preservatives. The sequence of a novel short peptide (KKFFRAWWAPRFLK-NH2) was modified to generate three versions of this original peptide. These peptides were tested for the inhibition of the yeasts mentioned above, allowing for the better understanding of their residue modifications. The range of the minimum inhibitory concentration was between 25 and 200 μg/mL. Zygosaccharomyces bailii was the most sensitive strain to the peptides, while Zygosaccharomyces rouxii was the most resistant. Membrane permeabilisation was found to be responsible for yeast inhibition at a level which was a two-fold increase of the MIC (400 μg/mL). The possibility of the production of reactive oxygen species was also assessed but was not recognised as a factor involved for the peptides' mode of action. Their stability in different environments was also tested, focusing on high salt, pH and thermal stability. The newly designed peptides showed good antifungal activity against some common food spoilage yeasts and has been proven effective in the application in Fanta Orange. These efficient novel peptides represent a new source of food preservation that can be used as an alternative for current controversial preservatives used in the food industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDebaryomyces hansenii 3aKluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aZygosaccharomyces bailii 3aZygosaccharomyces rouxii 3aantifungal properties 3achocolate 3afood industry 3afood preservation 3afood preservatives 3afood spoilage 3afruit juices 3amayonnaise 3amechanism of action 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3apH 3asoft drinks 3asugar products 3asynthetic peptides 3athermal stability 3awines 3ayeasts 0aAnti-yeast 0aPeptide 0aPreservative 0aZygosaccharomyces 0aSynthetic1 aArendt, Elke K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8414-77011 aLynch, Kieran M.1 aThery, Thibaut L.C.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2019 July 02, v. 300 p.43-52dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2019.04.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02954naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005600151245010800207300001800315520189700333592002802230650001502258650002502273650002302298650001702321650002202338650001902360650002002379651001402399700002102413773009902434856008602533852000902619655001202628IND60749960920221119182829.0211003e20211001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074996092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.08.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBozorgi, Ali1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1044-496X10aMicro array patch (MAP) for the delivery of thermostable vaccines in Australia: A cost/benefit analysis  ap. 6166-6173.  aIt is anticipated that transforming the vaccine supply chain from syringe-and-needle to thermostable vaccines enabled by Micro Array Patch (MAP) will result in reduced supply chain costs as well as reduced wastes (environmental impact) and improved safety. This paper provides a thorough cost comparison of the conventional syringe-and-needle vaccine supply chain versus the MAP vaccine supply chain for influenza vaccine delivery in Australia.To determine the potential cost implications and general benefits of replacing syringe-and-needle flu vaccine with MAP-enabled thermostable flu vaccine in Australia.We first provide a snapshot of the existing flu vaccine supply chain in Australia including its limitations and opportunities for improvement. Data/information is collected through interviewing the key stakeholders across vaccine supply chain including vaccine manufacturers, logistics providers, clinics, hospitals, and pharmacies. A cost/benefit analysis of the anticipated supply chain of the MAP-enabled vaccine will reveal the opportunities and challenges of supply chain transformation for flu vaccine delivery in Australia.Our high-level practice-informed cost/benefit analysis identifies cold chain removal as an important source of cost saving, but administrative cost savings appear to be even more significant (e.g., time saving for nurses and those involved in cold chain management). Our analysis also identifies the key benefits and limitations of vaccine supply chain transformation in Australia.We conclude that the benefits of moving from syringe-and-needle vaccines to thermostable MAP-delivered vaccines are beyond transportation and storage cost saving. Potential benefits through cost saving, waste reduction, and service level improvement are discussed along with various safety and wellbeing consequences as well as directions for future research in this area.  aPublisher supplied data 3acold chain 3aenvironmental impact 3ainfluenza vaccines 3astakeholders 3athermal stability 3atransportation 3awaste reduction 3aAustralia1 aFahimnia, Behnam0 tVaccine.g2021 Oct. 01, v. 39, no. 41 p.6166-6173dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.08.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02396naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245007500161300001300236500001100249520119600260592002801456650001201484650001501496650002001511650001101531650001901542650002401561650001601585650001001601650000901611650002001620650002801640700001701668700001601685700001801701700001401719700001901733700001301752773010701765856008101872852000901953655001201962IND60555825120221120134949.0161029e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055582512DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-016-2872-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoose, T.10aChallenges in imaging and predictive modeling of rhizosphere processes  ap. 9-38.  aReview  aBACKGROUND: Plant-soil interaction is central to human food production and ecosystem function. Thus, it is essential to not only understand, but also to develop predictive mathematical models which can be used to assess how climate and soil management practices will affect these interactions. SCOPE: In this paper we review the current developments in structural and chemical imaging of rhizosphere processes within the context of multiscale mathematical image based modeling. We outline areas that need more research and areas which would benefit from more detailed understanding. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the combination of structural and chemical imaging with modeling is an incredibly powerful tool which is fundamental for understanding how plant roots interact with soil. We emphasize the need for more researchers to be attracted to this area that is so fertile for future discoveries. Finally, model building must go hand in hand with experiments. In particular, there is a real need to integrate rhizosphere structural and chemical imaging with modeling for better understanding of the rhizosphere processes leading to models which explicitly account for pore scale processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aecosystems 3afood production 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3amathematical models 3arhizosphere 3aroots 3asoil 3asoil management 3asoil-plant interactions1 aKeyes, S.

Mannogalactan was the main polysaccharide in cold-water extracted fraction (CWEF), while a linear (1→6)-β-d-glucan was the main polymer in hot-water extracted fraction (HWEF). Autoclave-extracted fraction (AEF) contained a mixture of at least four different α- and β-glucans. The report of linear (1→6)-β-glucan and linear (1→3)-β-glucan is a new finding for P. eryngii fruiting bodies. The immunostimulatory properties of the fractions on THP-1 macrophages were studied. All fractions at 50, 250 and 500 μg/mL were not cytotoxic and produced different stimulus on NO, IL-1β and IL-10 secretion by the cells. Thus, our results showed that it is possible to concentrate different P. eryngii polysaccharides in selected fractions using a simple and low-cost procedure. Since biological effects depends on the polysaccharide structure, this technique allows the obtainment of fractions with distinct immunomodulatory activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPleurotus eryngii 3acarbohydrate structure 3acytotoxicity 3aimmunostimulants 3ainterleukin-10 3amacrophages 3amushrooms 3apolymers 3asecretion 3atemperature 3awater 0aPleurotus eryngii mushroom 0aPolysaccharides 0aβ-D-glucansgg 0aMannogalactan 0aImmunostimulatory properties1 aZavadinack, Matheus1 aSmiderle, Fhernanda R.1 aCipriani, Thales R.1 aCordeiro, Lucimara M.C.1 aIacomini, Marcello0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2021 Jan. 15, v. 252 p.117177-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2020.1171773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02712naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245018300171520131900354592002801673650002101701650001501722650001201737650001801749650002701767650001501794650001801809650001101827650001101838650003101849650002401880650001401904650001001918650001301928653001801941653002301959653002101982653001302003653001702016700001902033773012202052856008302174852000902257655001202266IND60646272020221119232845.0200106e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064627202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bcab.2019.1011872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOladipo, Babatunde10aProcess optimization of solvent extraction of seed oil from Moringa oleifera: An appraisal of quantitative and qualitative process variables on oil quality using D-optimal design  aMoringa oleifera seed oil (MOSO) was extracted from its kernels using solvent extraction method. The effect of extraction time (1–3 h), solid/solvent ratio (0.050–0.200 g/ml) and type of solvent (ethyl acetate, ethanol and n-hexane) on MOSO yield were assessed. The coefficient of determination - R², adjusted R², and predicted R² of 0.9993, 0.9986 and 0.9965, respectively obtained demonstrate the model developed can effectively explain the extraction process. Optimal condition of extraction time of 3 h, solid/solvent ratio of 0.050 g/ml and n-hexane established for the process could be used to obtain MOSO yield of 41.72 ± 0.45 wt%. Extraction efficacy test showed ethanol, ethyl acetate and n-hexane gave maximum MOSO yield of 8.24 ± 0.00, 14.28 ± 0.22 and 42.00 ± 0.45 wt%, respectively. The physical and chemical properties of the MOSO differed on the basis of choice of solvent used for the extraction. The acid values of the oil were 8.25 ± 0.01, 3.40 ± 0.04 and 2.88 ± 0.07 mg KOH/g oil with ethanol, ethyl acetate and n-hexane. Fatty acid profile analysis of the MOSO samples confirms that a high-oleic oil could be produced from Moringa oleifera seeds, and thus, could potentially serve as feedstock for chemical and food processing industries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMoringa oleifera 3aacid value 3aethanol 3aethyl acetate 3afatty acid composition 3afeedstocks 3afood industry 3ahexane 3amodels 3aphysicochemical properties 3apotassium hydroxide 3aseed oils 3aseeds 3asolvents 0aVegetable oil 0aSolvent extraction 0aMoringa oleifera 0aModeling 0aOptimization1 aBetiku, Eriola0 tBiocatalysis and agricultural biotechnology.g2019 July, v. 20 p.101187-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6239x1878-81817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcab.2019.1011873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03051naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245008700166300001600253520172400269592002801993650002002021650002002041650001502061650001902076650001602095650001402111650002202125650001402147650001102161650001702172650000902189650002202198650001402220650001102234650001902245650001602264650001102280650002502291650001202316700001602328700001602344700001302360773010602373856008102479852000902560655001202569IND60081340920221120021749.0151029e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008134092DNAL7 a10.1007/s00344-013-9405-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeng, Xiangnan10aPhotosynthesis Regulation by Glucohexaose Through Redox Changes in Cucumis sativus  ap. 571-578.  aTo investigate the effects of glucohexaose (P6) on cucumber, leaf CO₂ assimilation, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, chlorophyll content, and carbohydrate metabolism were examined in cucumber plants. The net photosynthetic rate (P ₙ) of cucumber leaves was enhanced after being treated with 10 μg mL⁻¹ P6. The increase was correlated with increases in transpiration rate (E) and stomatal conductance (G ₛ), whereas the intercellular CO₂ concentration (C ᵢ) was not different from the control plants. Chlorophyll content, absorption of light energy per unit area (ABS/CS), capture of light energy per unit area (TRₒ/CS), quantum yield of electron transport per unit area (ETₒ/CS), maximum photochemical efficiency of PSII (φP ₒ), quantum yield of photosynthetic institution electron transfer (φE ₒ), probability of other electron acceptors that captured exciton-transferred electrons to the electronic chain which exceeds QA (ψ ₒ), number of reaction centers per unit leaf area (RC/CSₒ), and the performance index on absorption basis (PIABS) were improved, but heat dissipation per unit area (DIₒ/CS) and maximum quantum yield of non-chemical quenching (φD ₒ) were reduced. In addition, increases in sucrose, soluble sugars, and starch contents were observed in P6-treated plants. However, H₂O₂ scavenger (DMTU) or NADPH oxidase inhibitor (DPI) pretreatment significantly abolished the effect of P6 on photosynthesis. The results demonstrated that ROS played a critical role in P6-induced photosynthesis. The increase in chlorophyll content together with efficient light absorption, transmission, and conversion in P6-treated plants is important for increasing photosynthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCucumis sativus 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aabsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3achlorophyll 3acucumbers 3aelectron transfer 3aelectrons 3aenergy 3afluorescence 3aheat 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3aphotosystem II 3aprobability 3astarch 3astomatal conductance 3asucrose1 aGong, Yujie1 aFan, Haiyan1 aYu, Yang0 tJournal of plant growth regulation.g2014 Sept., v. 33, no. 3 p.571-578dSpringer USx0721-75957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00344-013-9405-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02922naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245009700210300001600307520142000323592002801743650001801771650003201789650001501821650001301836650002101849650001501870650001201885653002601897653002101923653002801944653003101972653002902003653000902032653000802041653001002049653000802059653000802067653000802075653001702083700002302100700002302123700002402146700001902170773014802189856008202337852000902419655001202428IND60622547820221117235423.0181127e20181209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062254782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.11.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiyanaga, Yukihiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7999-661010aChemoattractant receptors activate, recruit and capture G proteins for wide range chemotaxis  ap. 304-310.  aThe wide range sensing of extracellular signals is a common feature of various sensory cells. Eukaryotic chemotactic cells driven by GPCRs and their cognate G proteins are one example. This system endows the cells directional motility towards their destination over long distances. There are several mechanisms to achieve the long dynamic range, including negative regulation of the receptors upon ligand interaction and spatial regulation of G proteins, as we found recently. However, these mechanisms are insufficient to explain the 105-fold range of chemotaxis seen in Dictyostelium. Here, we reveal that the receptor-mediated activation, recruitment, and capturing of G proteins mediate chemotactic signaling at the lower, middle and higher concentration ranges, respectively. These multiple mechanisms of G protein dynamics can successfully cover distinct ranges of ligand concentrations, resulting in seamless and broad chemotaxis. Furthermore, single-molecule imaging analysis showed that the activated Gα subunit forms an unconventional complex with the agonist-bound receptor. This complex formation of GPCR-Gα increased the membrane-binding time of individual Gα molecules and therefore resulted in the local accumulation of Gα. Our findings provide an additional chemotactic dynamic range mechanism in which multiple G protein dynamics positively contribute to the production of gradient information.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDictyostelium 3aG-protein coupled receptors 3aG-proteins 3aagonists 3achemoattractants 3achemotaxis 3aligands 0aEukaryotic chemotaxis 0aGradient sensing 0aDynamic range extension 0aG protein-coupled receptor 0aSingle-molecule analysis 0aGip1 0aTMR 0aTIRFM 0aSRD 0aPDF 0aEL2 0acAR1-R2(EL2)1 aKamimura, Yoichiro1 aKuwayama, Hidekazu1 aDevreotes, Peter N.1 aUeda, Masahiro0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 Dec. 09, v. 507, no. 1-4 p.304-310dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.11.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02402naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002900145245010700174300001600281500002000297520111200317592002801429596005201457596005101509596005001560650003201610650002801642650001501670650002701685650002001712650001201732650001101744700002201755700002001777700002201797773010801819856008001927852000902007655001202016IND60790310320221120132525.0220824e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079031032DNAL7 a10.1002/2211-5463.124132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPedersen, Jesper Torbøl10aIsolation of native plasma membrane H+‐ATPase (Pma1p) in both the active and basal activation states  ap. 774-783.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe yeast plasma membrane H⁺‐ATPase Pma1p is a P‐type ATPase that energizes the yeast plasma membrane. Pma1p exists in two activation states: an autoinhibited basal state and an activated state. Here we show that functional and stable Pma1p can be purified in native form and reconstituted in artificial liposomes without altering its activation state. Acetylated tubulin has previously been reported to maintain Pma1p in the basal state but, as this protein was absent from the purified preparations, it cannot be an essential component of the autoinhibitory mechanism. Purification of and reconstitution of native Pma1p in both activation states opens up for a direct comparison of the transport properties of these states, which allowed us to confirm that the basal state has a low coupling ratio between ATP hydrolysis and protons pumped, whereas the activated state has a high coupling ratio. The ability to prepare native Pma1p in both activation states will facilitate further structural and biochemical studies examining the mechanism by which plasma membrane H⁺‐ATPases are autoinhibited.  aPublisher supplied data  cDanish Strategic Research Council (FungalFight)  cThe Innovation Fund Denmark project LESSISMORE  cDanish National Research Foundation (PUMPKIN) 3aH-transporting ATP synthase 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3ahydrolysis 3aliposomes (artificial) 3aplasma membrane 3atubulin 3ayeasts1 aKanashova, Tamara1 aDittmar, Gunnar1 aPalmgren, Michael0 tFEBS Open Bio.g2018 May, v. 8, no. 5 p.774-783dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:23386x2211-54637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2211-5463.124133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02535naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245013500162300001600297500002000313520106600333592002801399650002001427650002501447650001701472650001501489650003701504650001901541650003401560650002001594650002501614650003601639700002101675700002101696700002101717700002101738700002101759700002001780700002901800700001901829700002301848773012401871856007301995852000902068655001202077IND60588128720221122034206.0180103e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058812872DNAL7 a10.1002/tox.222682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Ming‐Cheng10aInhibition of NF‐κB and metastasis in irinotecan (CPT‐11)‐resistant LoVo colon cancer cells by thymoquinone via JNK and p38  ap. 669-678.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aClinically used chemotherapeutics can effectively eliminate most tumor cells. However, they cause unwanted side effects and result in chemoresistance. To overcome such problems, phytochemicals are now used to treat cancers by means of targeted therapy. Thymoquinone (TQ) is used to treat different cancers (including colon cancer) and is an NF‐κB inhibitor. Irinotecan resistant (CPT‐11‐R) LoVo colon cancer cell line was previous constructed by step‐wise CPT‐11 challenges to un‐treated parental LoVo cells and expresses EGFR/IKKα/β/NF‐κB pathway. TQ resulted in reduced total and phosphorylation of IKKα/β and NF‐κB and decreased metastasis in CPT‐11‐R cells. TQ not only reduced activity of ERK1/2 and PI3K but also activated JNK and p38. Furthermore, TQ was also found to suppress metastasis through activation of JNK and p38. Therefore, TQ suppressed metastasis through NF‐κB inhibition and activation of JNK and p38 in CPT‐11‐R LoVo colon cancer cells. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

For rotavirus vaccines, these have not yet been well established. We studied non-specific effects up to 18 months of age using data from a quasi-experimental before-after study comparing cohorts of rotavirus vaccinated and unvaccinated infants with medical risk conditions.Infants were enrolled at six weeks of age before and after a stepped-wedge implementation of a hospital-based risk-group rotavirus vaccination program. Other infant vaccinations were administered according to the Dutch National Immunization Program and similar in both cohorts. Non-specific effect outcomes were prospectively collected using monthly questionnaires and included acute hospitalization (excluding for acute gastroenteritis), monthly incidence of acute respiratory illness and eczema. We used time-to-event analysis and negative binomial regression to assess the effect of at least one dose of rotavirus vaccination for each of these outcomes.FindingsThe analysis included 496 rotavirus unvaccinated and 719 vaccinated medical risk infants. In total, 1067 (88%) were premature, 373 (31%) small for gestational age and 201 (17%) had a congenital pathology. The adjusted hazard ratio for first acute hospitalization was 0·91 (95 %CI 0·76;1·16) for rotavirus vaccinated versus unvaccinated infants. Adjusted incidence rate ratio for acute respiratory illness was 1·05 (95 %CI 0·96;1·15) and for eczema 0·89 (95 %CI 0·69;1·15).The results suggest no, or minimal non-specific effects from rotavirus vaccination on acute hospitalization, acute respiratory illness or eczema in medical risk infants.Trial registration: as NTR5361 in the Dutch trial registry, www.trialregister.nl.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRotavirus 3aeczema 3agastroenteritis 3ahazard ratio 3ahumans 3arespiratory tract diseases 3arisk 3asmall for gestational age 3avaccination 3avaccines 0aNon-specific effects 0aHRV 0aNIP 0aARI 0aBCG1 aRouers, Elsbeth D.M.1 aBonten, Marc J.M.1 aBruijning-Verhagen, Patricia C.J.2 aOn behalf of the RIVAR study teameauthor0 tVaccine.g2021 Oct. 01, v. 39, no. 41 p.6151-6156dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.08.0673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02591naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006000151245013200211300001800343520122700361592002801588650002301616650001901639650001501658650001301673650002401686650001601710650001301726653003301739653002701772653002601799653003901825653002501864653002501889700005801914700002701972773009901999856008602098852000902184655001202193IND60749961420221119182811.0211003e20211001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074996142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.08.0702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRane, Madhura S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8179-910310aDurability of protection after 5 doses of acellular pertussis vaccine among 5–9 year old children in King County, Washington  ap. 6144-6150.  aWaning of immunity after vaccination with the acellular Pertussis (aP) vaccine has been proposed as one of the main reasons for pertussis resurgence in the US. In this study, we estimated time-varying vaccine effectiveness after 5 doses of aP vaccine.We conducted a retrospective cohort study among children 5–9 years old (born between 2008 and 2012) living in King County, Washington, USA, who participated in the Washington State Immunization Information System. We estimated time-varying vaccine effectiveness after 5 doses of aP using smoothed scaled Schoenfeld residuals obtained from fitting Cox proportional hazards models to the data as well as piecewise constant Poisson regression.There were 55 pertussis cases in this cohort, of whom 22 (40%) were fully-vaccinated and 33 (60%) were under-vaccinated. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) remained high for up to 42 months after the fifth dose (VE(t) = 89%; 95% CI: 64%, 97%) as estimated using survival analysis methods and up to 4 years (VE(t) = 93%; 95% CI: 67%, 98%) as estimated using Poisson regression.We did not find evidence for waning of vaccine effectiveness for up to four years after 5 doses of aP among 5 –9 years old children in King County, WA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWashington (state) 3acohort studies 3adurability 3aimmunity 3ainformation systems 3avaccination 3avaccines 0aAcellular pertussis vaccines 0aVaccine waning effects 0aVaccine effectiveness 0aTime-varying vaccine effectiveness 0aSchoenfeld residuals 0aPertussis resurgence1 aRohani, Pejman1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7221-38011 aHalloran, M.

After sequencing and related analysis, the LmAPX cDNA sequence was 965bp in length and had an open reading frame (ORF) of 750bp coding for 250 amino acids. Furthermore, the LmAPX sequence was sub-cloned into prokaryotic expression vector pET28a and the recombinant proteins had a high expression level in Escherichia coli. Results from a southern blot analysis indicated that three inserts of this gene existed in the tobacco genome encoding LmAPX. Compared with the control plants (wild-type and empty vector control), the transgenic plants expressing the LmAPX gene exhibited lower amount of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and relatively higher values of ascorbate peroxidase activity, proline content, and net photosynthetic rate (Pn) under the same salt stress. These results suggested that overexpression of the LmAPX gene could decrease ROS production caused by salt stress and protect plants from oxidative stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aLycium chinense 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aSouthern blotting 3aascorbate peroxidase 3acomplementary DNA 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3agenetic vectors 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aopen reading frames 3aoxidative stress 3aphotosynthesis 3aproline 3arecombinant proteins 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3atobacco 3atransgenic plants 0aAPX 0acAPX 0aCAT 0aCTAB 0aH2O2 0aIPTG 0aMS 0aORF 0apAPX 0aPn 0aPS II 0aROS 0asAPX 0aSOD 0atAPX 0aUTR 0aAscorbate peroxidase 0aSalt stress 0aCloning 0aOverexpression 0aReactive oxygen species1 aWang, Gang1 aJi, Jing1 aGao, Hailing1 aGuan, Wenzhu1 aWu, Jiang1 aGuan, Chunfeng1 aWang, Yurong0 tGene.g2014 June 10, v. 543 p.85-92dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2014.03.0613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01976naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245010700155300001800262500002000280520112300300592002801423650001401451650001701465650001201482700002401494773009801518856007301616852000901689655001201698IND60571216520221116150717.0170712e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057121652DNAL7 a10.1890/08-0033.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNovak, Mark10aEstimating nonlinear interaction strengths: an observation‐based method for species‐rich food webs  ap. 2083-2089.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEfforts to estimate the strength of species interactions in species‐rich, reticulate food webs have been hampered by the multitude of direct and indirect interactions such systems exhibit and have been limited by an assumption that pairwise interactions display linear functional forms. Here we present a new method for directly measuring, on a per capita basis, the nonlinear strength of trophic species interactions within such food webs. This is an observation‐based method, requiring three pieces of information: (1) species abundances, (2) predator and prey‐specific handling times, and (3) data from predator‐specific feeding surveys in which the number of individuals observed feeding on each of the predator's prey species has been tallied. The method offers a straightforward way to assess the completeness of one's sampling effort in accurately estimating interaction strengths through the construction of predator‐specific prey accumulation curves. The method should be applicable to a variety of systems in which empirical estimates of direct interaction strengths have thus far remained elusive.  aPublisher supplied data 3afood webs 3aprey species 3asurveys1 aWootton, J.

Current therapies are only effective for a proportion of sufferers and new therapeutic targets are desperately needed to alleviate this burden. Recently the role of epigenetics in the development of many complex diseases including migraine has become an emerging topic. By understanding the importance of acetylation, methylation and other epigenetic modifications, it then follows that this modification process is a potential target to manipulate epigenetic status with the goal of treating disease. Bisulphite sequencing and methylated DNA immunoprecipitation have been used to demonstrate the presence of methylated cytosines in the human D-loop of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), proving that the mitochondrial genome is methylated. For the first time, it has been shown that there is a difference in mtDNA epigenetic status between healthy controls and those with disease, especially for neurodegenerative and age related conditions. Given co-morbidities with migraine and the suggestive link between mitochondrial dysfunction and the lowered threshold for triggering a migraine attack, mitochondrial methylation may be a new avenue to pursue. Creative thinking and new approaches are needed to solve complex problems and a systems biology approach, where multiple layers of information are integrated is becoming more important in complex disease modelling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3aacetylation 3adisease resistance 3aepigenetics 3ahumans 3amethylation 3amigraine 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial DNA 3amitochondrial genome 3amodels 3anervous system diseases 3aprecipitin tests 0aWHO 0amtDNA 0aMA 0aMO 0aCSD 0aGWAS 0aHDACs 0aMigraine 0aEpigenetics 0aMitochondrial methylation 0aDisease susceptibility1 aStuart, Shani1 aLea, Rod A.1 aHaupt, Larisa M.1 aGriffiths, Lyn R.0 tGene.g2014 June 10, v. 543 p.1-7dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2014.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02044naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245009500169520098700264592002801251650001301279650002101292650001801313651001001331653001301341653001801354653002501372653002301397653001001420700001401430700001801444700001501462773012001477856008801597852000901685655001201694IND60782803220221120121703.0220921e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078280322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2022.1065402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Shupeng10aQuantification and spatial distribution of aluminum in-use stocks in Henan Province, China  aThe accounting of aluminum in-use stocks (ALIS) has received widespread attention, but the systematic assessment of China's ALIS at the provincial level remains unclear. Based on a bottom-up approach, this study utilizes Henan Province as an example to investigate the ALIS and its spatial patterns at China's provincial level. In 2017, the total and per capita of ALIS in Henan were 12 Tg and 125 kg/capita. About 90% of the ALIS deposited in residential buildings, nonresidential buildings, automobiles, power generation, power transmission and distribution, and household durables. An apparent difference was revealed between urban and rural ALIS, showing that the total reserves of the building and consumer durables sectors in urban are about 70% higher than in rural areas. At the prefecture-level, the aluminum stock density varied from 35 to 225 t/km², and the per capita ALIS ranged from 96 to 227 kg/capita, indicating a significant imbalance in spatial distribution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3apower generation 3astocking rate 3aChina 0aAluminum 0aIn-use stocks 0aSpatial distribution 0aIndustrial ecology 0aChina1 aWang, Zhe1 aZhang, Tingan1 aYue, Qiang0 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2022 Nov., v. 186 p.106540-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2022.1065403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03021naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245010400160300001800264500002000282520175200302592002802054650000902082650001802091650001202109650001902121650001602140650000902156650001402165650001202179650001002191650002702201650001702228650000702245650001402252650001502266650001202281650002902293700002302322700001902345700001802364773009902382856007302481852000902554655001202563IND60571216620221116150719.0170712e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057121662DNAL7 a10.1890/07-0168.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRäsänen, Katja10aGeographic variation in maternal investment: acidity affects egg size and fecundity in rana arvalis  ap. 2553-2562.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEnvironmental‐stress‐mediated geographic variation in reproductive parameters has been little studied in natural vertebrate populations outside the context of climatic variation. Based on life‐history theory, an increase in the degree of environmental stress experienced by a population should lead to (1) a shift in reproductive allocation from fecundity to offspring quality, (2) stronger trade‐offs between reproductive parameters, and (3) changes in the relationship between female phenotype and maternal investment. To test these predictions, we investigated geographic variation in maternal investment of moor frogs (Rana arvalis) in relation to breeding site acidity (pH 4–8). We found that mean egg size increased and clutch size and total reproductive output (TRO) decreased with increasing acidity among 19 Swedish moor frog populations. Tests for variation and co‐variation in maternal investment and female size and age in 233 females from a subset of four acid origin (AO) and four neutral origin (NO) populations revealed that clutch size and TRO increased with female size in both acid and neutral environments. However, in AO populations, egg size also increased with female size, and clutch size and TRO with female age, whereas in NO populations, egg size increased with female age. The strength of the egg‐size–clutch‐size trade‐off tended to be stronger in AO than in NO females as expected if the former experience stronger environmental constraints. All in all, these results suggest that environmental acidification selects for investment in larger eggs at a cost to fecundity, imposes negative effects on reproductive output, and alters the relationship between female phenotype and maternal investment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRana 3aacidification 3aacidity 3abreeding sites 3aclutch size 3aeggs 3afecundity 3afemales 3afrogs 3ageographical variation 3alife history 3apH 3aphenotype 3aprediction 3aprogeny 3areproductive performance1 aSöderman, Fredrik1 aLaurila, Anssi1 aMerilä, Juha0 tEcology.g2008 Sept., v. 89, no. 9 p.2553-2562dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/07-0168.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03281naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005900151245009300210300001800303520180500321592002802126650001002154650002102164650001802185650002002203650001402223650002002237650001102257650002202268650001802290650001202308650001702320650003102337650001602368650001302384653002202397653001702419653002102436653002002457700002102477700002202498700002402520700006102544773009902605856008602704852000902790655001202799IND60749961620221119182732.0211003e20211001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074996162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.08.0852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKunitoki, Keiko1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7641-542710aAccess to HPV vaccination in Japan: Increasing social trust to regain vaccine confidence  ap. 6104-6110.  aVaccine hesitancy is a growing concern in global public health, and illustrates serious problems arising from loss of social trust. Japan is experiencing a human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine crisis that started with a rapid decline in the vaccination rate in 2013 from approximately 70% to less than 1% and lasting for 7 years. We analyze Japan’s case of vaccine hesitancy for HPV vaccine, using a framework for examining barriers to access and use of health technologies according to four categories: architecture, availability, affordability, and adoption. Significant problems were identified in the architecture of the decision-making body, public information availability, adoption of evidence in policy-making process, knowledge and confidence among providers, education to the public, and communication with end-users. We propose a series of actions to address these barriers. The national government should diversify the advisory committee to include broader scientific evidence and various viewpoints. Municipalities should actively distribute information cooperating with local providers. Professional associations should create an alliance to influence policy makers and deliver education to health care providers and end-users. Politicians should integrate opinions from citizens and scientists to implement an up-to-date policy. Civil society should share individual stories from cervical cancer patients and positive experiences of vaccinated girls. Mass media should use more diverse sources of information to report more comprehensive and science-based views. These actions would help build mutual trust among stakeholders, which is required to increase social trust in the HPV vaccine in Japan and thereby regain vaccine confidence and reduce preventable deaths and complications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJapan 3aPapillomaviridae 3aaffordability 3adecision making 3aeducation 3ahealth services 3ahumans 3aissues and policy 3apublic health 3asociety 3astakeholders 3auterine cervical neoplasms 3avaccination 3avaccines 0aVaccine hesitancy 0aSocial trust 0aAccess framework 0aCervical cancer1 aFunato, Masafumi1 aMitsunami, Makiko1 aKinoshita, Takahiro1 aReich, Michael R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3338-06120 tVaccine.g2021 Oct. 01, v. 39, no. 41 p.6104-6110dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.08.0853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02160naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245009600158300001600254500002000270520089100290592002801181650003201209650001801241650001901259650001401278650001601292650001201308650003501320650002001355650001701375700001401392700002001406700001601426700001601442700001501458700001501473700001701488700001501505773012401520856007301644852000901717655001201726IND60588129020221120071151.0180103e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058812902DNAL7 a10.1002/tox.222822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Chengmin10aMitochondrial Dysfunction and Ca2+ Overload in Injured Sertoli Cells Exposed to Bisphenol A  ap. 823-831.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBisphenol‐A (BPA) is well known as one of endocrine‐disrupting chemicals and testicular toxicant. In this present study, we determined whether BPA caused cell injury through mitochondria impairment and ROS overproduction. The cellular ROS production, mitochondrial ATP synthetase activity and Ca²⁺ concentration were examined. We have found BPA caused the cellular mitochondria dysfunction and followed by cell death in Sertoli cells. Moreover cytoplasm Ca²⁺ overload was also involved. Furthermore, pretreatment with N‐acetyl‐L‐cysteine (NAC) could alleviate the damage by causing a remarkable decrease in ROS production and mitochondrial dysfunction. Collectively, our results showed that BPA exposure induced Sertoli cell apoptosis because of excessive ROS generation and mitochondrial dysfunction. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Here, we ask how functional traits of plant species vary in response to drought and flooding and whether trait plasticity is a better predictor of plants’ cover than average functional trait values. METHODS: We transplanted vegetative recruits (similar size and age) of eight common species from a moderately grazed alpine wetland in the Eastern Tibetan Plateau to a common garden where we evaluated the trait responses of these species to drought and flooding. We also measured the coverage, biomass, and height of these plant species in the field communities. RESULTS: The leaf morphological and physiological traits of these eight species generally showed different responses to drought and flood conditions. Variation (plasticity) of leaf morphological or physiological traits rather than average values of these traits were better predictors of cover and biomass in the field community. Species with lower plasticity in leaf morphological traits had higher plasticity in leaf physiology and the higher coverage and biomass in the field community. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the ability to quickly adjust leaf physiology to changing environmental conditions provides an advantage in this ecosystem, where intra-annual rainfall variability is high and thus resource fluctuations are pulsed in time. In contrast, greater functional trait plasticity in leaf morphology was a disadvantage, possibly because the benefits of these adjustments did not outweigh their initial costs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3adrought 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3aglobal change 3agrazing intensity 3aleaves 3aphysiology 3aprediction 3arain 3awetlands 3aChina1 aYu, Kailiang1 aRatajczak, Zak1 aNippert, Jesse B.1 aTondrob, Dorjeeh1 aXu, Danghui1 aLi, Wei1 aDu, Guozhen0 tPlant and soil.g2016 Oct., v. 407, no. 1-2 p.401-415dSpringer International Publishingx0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-016-2898-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02863naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245010200160300001800262500002000280520144800300592002801748650001201776650001401788650001101802650001401813650001201827650001901839650001601858650001501874650001201889650000901901650001401910650001601924650001201940650002001952650001301972650002401985650001402009650001202023650000902035650002902044650002402073650001602097700001902113700003202132773009902164856007302263852000902336655001202345IND60571216720221116150755.0170712e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057121672DNAL7 a10.1890/07-1211.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarquis, Olivier10aIntergenerational effects of climate generate cohort variation in lizard reproductive performance  ap. 2575-2583.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAn evaluation of the link between climate and population dynamics requires understanding of climate effects both within and across generations. In ectothermic vertebrates, demographic responses to climate changes should crucially depend on balancing needs for heat and water. Here, we studied how temperature and rainfall regimes experienced before and during adulthood influenced reproductive performances (litter size, offspring size, and survival) in a natural population of the live‐bearing common lizard, Lacerta vivipara, monitored continuously from 1989 to 2004. Rainfall regime, but not temperature, had both immediate and delayed effects on these reproductive performances. Rainfall during the first month of life was positively correlated with juvenile survival. Females experiencing more rainfall during gestation produced smaller neonates that showed greater survival when controlling for the positive effect of body size on survival. Furthermore, females that experienced heavier rainfall when in utero produced fewer but longer neonates during adulthood. These demographic effects of rainfall on adult reproductive traits may come from maternal effects of climate conditions and/or from delayed effects of rainfall on the environment experienced early in life. Irrespective of the precise mechanism, however, this study provides evidence of intergenerational climate effects in natural populations of an ectothermic vertebrate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLacerta 3aadulthood 3aadults 3abody size 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acorrelation 3aectothermy 3afemales 3aheat 3ajuveniles 3alitter size 3alizards 3amaternal effect 3aneonates 3apopulation dynamics 3apregnancy 3aprogeny 3arain 3areproductive performance 3areproductive traits 3atemperature1 aMassot, Manuel1 aLe Galliard, Jean François0 tEcology.g2008 Sept., v. 89, no. 9 p.2575-2583dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/07-1211.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02982naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245012600167300001600293520167300309592002801982650001402010650002102024650001102045650001502056650001402071650001602085650001502101650001102116650001802127650002802145650001102173650001102184650001602195651001802211700002302229700002002252700002202272700002602294700002002320773010602340856008102446852000902527655001202536IND60081341520221122143828.0151029e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008134152DNAL7 a10.1007/s00344-014-9411-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarver, Sean T.10aGrowth and Flowering Responses of Sea Marigold to Daminozide, Paclobutrazol, or Uniconazole Applied as Drenches or Sprays  ap. 626-631.  aBorrichia frutescens (L.) DC., sea marigold, is a woody perennial shrub native to the Gulf and Atlantic coasts of North America and has potential as a landscape shrub or groundcover. This study assesses application rates of three commercially available plant growth regulators (PGRs) on B. frutescens during container production. In one experiment, plants were drenched with 0, 0.5, 1, 2, or 4 mg active ingredient (a.i.) pot⁻¹ of uniconazole or 0, 5, 10, 20, or 40 mg a.i. pot⁻¹ of paclobutrazol, and in a second experiment, plants were sprayed with solutions of either 0, 25, 50, 100, or 200 mg a.i. L⁻¹ of uniconazole, 0, 50, 100, 200, or 400 mg a.i. L⁻¹ of paclobutrazol, or 0, 2500, 5000, 10000, or 20000 mg a.i. L⁻¹ of daminozide. Drench-applied paclobutrazol (40 mg a.i. pot⁻¹) reduced shoot mass and root mass (52.9 and 48.5 %, respectively). Both paclobutrazol (40 mg a.i. pot⁻¹) and uniconazole (2 mg a.i. pot⁻¹) reduced leaf number by as much as 56.7 and 23.8 %, respectively. Height was reduced 54.9 % by paclobutrazol at 40 mg a.i. pot⁻¹ and 34.9 % by uniconazole at 2 mg a.i. pot⁻¹. Drench application of paclobutrazol and uniconazole reduced internode extension by 50.1 and 41.4 %, respectively. At the levels tested, daminozide, paclobutrazol, and uniconazole were generally ineffective at controlling growth when applied as a spray. Drench application of paclobutrazol or uniconazole can be used to control height during container production of B. frutescens, whereas spray application rates need to be tested at higher concentrations or multiple applications to achieve desired control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBorrichia 3aapplication rate 3acoasts 3adaminozide 3aflowering 3aingredients 3alandscapes 3aleaves 3apaclobutrazol 3aplant growth substances 3ashoots 3ashrubs 3auniconazole 3aNorth America1 aArnold, Michael A.1 aByrne, David H.1 aArmitage, Anna R.1 aLineberger, R.

It is widely used by designers of drip irrigation systems to simulate the active wetting pattern. However, there are many design parameters of the domain and for the flux calculation; other than the acceptable simulations, some configurations might cause under-estimation or over-estimation of the wetting pattern. Comparative assessments of the surface drip simulation parameters were performed. We evaluated the effect of different domain geometries, element shapes, coordinate systems, emitter discharges, and soil textures on the accuracy and stability of the simulation. The results showed that the 3D simulations are more successful and reliable than the 2D simulations in terms of mass balance error. For the 2D domains, the error increases as the texture goes finer, and for axisymmetric domains than the Cartesian ones. We found a relationship between the flux and the soil hydraulic conductivity that their quotient should not exceed 1.8 and 3.2 for axisymmetric and cartesian coordinates. Our outcomes show that the infiltration stage took more time than the redistribution stage because of the variation in water content that delays the convergence at infiltration.Additionally, we found that the range between the saturated and the residual water content of the soil causes instability of the simulation as it gets higher. The differences between 2D simulations and the equivalent 3D slices were highly dependent on the soil texture, the heavier the larger; and dependent on the simulation phase, where the redistribution phase has fewer differences than the infiltration phase. Finally, we have determined the best matching 2D flux profile to each 3D profile and revealed the source of variation between 2D and 3D profiles where it was mostly-affected by the emitter’s location, the soil texture, and simulation phase. In part 2 of this paper, we expanded the study for subsurface drip simulations and showed the difference between the two systems’ designs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aemitters (equipment) 3ageometry 3ahydraulic conductivity 3amicroirrigation 3aporous media 3asoil texture 3asolutes 3atexture 3awater content 0aHYDRUS 0aModeling 0aDrip irrigation 0aSimulation 0aDomains 0aAxisymmetric 0aFlux1 aAlazba, A.A.0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2019 July, v. 162 p.189-205dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2019.03.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03076naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245007500172520152200247592002801769650002101797650001001818650002201828650003001850650001401880650000701894650001501901650001001916650001601926650002101942650001501963650002501978653001502003653001702018653001502035653002602050653001602076653002102092653002102113700002002134700002802154700001602182700003902198700002702237700003202264700001402296700001802310700001802328773009502346856008402441852000902525655001202534IND60646272720221119232812.0200217e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064627272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.algal.2019.1015692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNirmalakhandan, N.10aAlgal wastewater treatment: Photoautotrophic vs. mixotrophic processes  aPhotoautotrophic algal systems have been investigated as potentially greener and more sustainable alternatives to the traditional bacteria-based wastewater treatment (WWT) systems. This paper presents mixotrophic algal systems as better suited for WWT. Since the literature is void of mixotrophic WWT systems, a brief review of the laboratory results from the literature comparing the different types of algal metabolisms is presented first. Details of a mixotrophic WWT system driven by an extremophilic alga, Galdieria sulphuraria (pH = 1 to 4; temperature = 25 to 56 °C) are presented next. Results from pilot scale version of this mixotrophic system (700 L) are summarized to show that it can reduce biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and nutrients in primary-settled wastewater in a single step to yield discharge-ready effluent in <3 days of fed-batch processing. Average volumetric removal rates of BOD₅ (16.5 ± 3.6 mg L⁻¹ d⁻¹) and ammoniacal nitrogen (6.09 ± 0.92 mg L⁻¹ d⁻¹) in this mixotrophic system were found to be not different from those reported for the photoautotrophic high rate algal ponds (significance level of 0.05); but, that of phosphates (1.40 ± 0.57 mg L⁻¹ d⁻¹) is greater than that reported for the photoautotrophic high rate algal ponds (significance level of 0.05). Additionally, the extreme culture conditions in this particular mixotrophic system enabled concurrent reductions of E. coli (>5 log) and other pathogenic bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aalgae 3aammonium nitrogen 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3anutrients 3apH 3aphosphates 3aponds 3atemperature 3avirulent strains 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aAutotrophy 0aHeterotrophy 0aMixotrophy 0aGaldieria sulphuraria 0aBOD removal 0aNutrient removal 0aPathogen removal1 aSelvaratnam, T.1 aHenkanatte-Gedera, S.M.1 aTchinda, D.1 aAbeysiriwardana-Arachchige, I.S.A.1 aDelanka-Pedige, H.M.K.1 aMunasinghe-Arachchige, S.P.1 aZhang, Y.1 aHolguin, F.O.1 aLammers, P.J.0 tAlgal research.g2019 Aug., v. 41 p.101569-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12360x2211-92647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.algal.2019.1015693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03158naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245012400164300001400288520151700302592002801819650002701847650001201874650002301886650001101909650001501920650002601935650001601961650001201977650001101989650002302000650002102023650001402044650001102058650001102069650001602080650001802096650001102114650001402125650001302139650002202152650001202174650001202186650001702198651001402215653002202229653001202251653002302263653002402286653001502310700001602325700001702341773012302358856007802481852000902559655001202568IND60520666320221118012332.0160522e20150825xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052066632DNAL7 a10.1515/remc-2015-00012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThomas, Lisa K.10aRiver dynamics and invasion: distribution patterns of native and invasive woody vegetation at the Río Negro, Argentina  ap. 45-57.  aSalicaceae are typical invaders of riparian ecosystems throughout the world and they have the potential to change much of the invaded habitats. Along Patagonian streams, riparian softwood forests composed of non-native Salicaceae are increasing in abundance, area and tree species diversity. Especially in the last decades, dense floodplain forests dominated by invasive willows and poplars and additionally Russian olive and tamarisk spread almost explosively e.g. along the Río Negro in northern Patagonia. This study focuses on the identification of ecological niches and niche overlaps of the native and invasive woody species in order to assess the impact on the native Salix humboldtiana Willd. Data on species (presence/ absence) and explanatory variables were gathered in the field using a grid-based, stratified-randomized sampling design. Different environmental variables were then related to species occurrence in different life stages (adult, juvenile, seedling) using habitat distribution models. In the final models, flood duration, the amount of gravel and the location (upper or middle river valley) were included to describe the probability of occurrence of native and invasive taxa. For all life stages, a strong niche overlap could be observed for S. humboldtiana and the invasive taxa with no remaining exclusive habitats indicating a potential threat to the native willow. The study contributes to a better understanding of Salicaceae invasion and its consequences for riparian ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElaeagnus angustifolia 3aPopulus 3aSalix humboldtiana 3aadults 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3afloodplains 3aforests 3agravel 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3ajuveniles 3amodels 3aniches 3aprobability 3ariver valleys 3arivers 3aseedlings 3asoftwood 3aspecies diversity 3astreams 3awillows 3awoody plants 3aArgentina 0afloodplain forest 0awillows 0aSalix humboldtiana 0ariparian vegetation 0asuccession1 aMosner, Eva1 aLeyer, Ilona0 tRiparian ecology and conservation.g2015 Aug. 25, v. 2, no. 1 p.45-57dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:23171x2299-10427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/remc-2015-00013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01555naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245008700159300002000246500001900266520044900285592002800734650002100762650001400783650001900797650000900816650002900825650001500854700001600869700001400885700001400899700001300913700001600926700002000942773013600962856007401098852000901172655001201181IND60720716420221122070041.0201216e20201215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072071642DNAL7 a10.1039/d0cc06387h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Li-Song10aSelf-assembling peptide–etoposide nanofibers for overcoming multidrug resistance  ap. 15321-15324.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe developed a new strategy to overcome the MDR of etoposide using self-assembling nanofibers.

PD-L1 interacts with programmed death-1 (PD-1) on T cells to trigger an inhibitory signal that suppresses anti-tumor T cell responses as an important mechanism of tumor escape from anti-tumor immune response. Recent development of PD-1/PD-L1 blockades has provided novel immunotherapy strategies for cancers including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Although the therapy is quite effective for some patients with NSCLC, others are resistant to the treatment, so that regulatory mechanisms of PD-L1 in lung cancer cells need to be understood in detail. Here we analyzed effect of interferon-β (IFN-β) that can be produced in cancer microenvironment on PD-L1 expression in lung tumor cells. An addition of IFN-β elevated PD-L1 expression in mouse and human lung cancer cell lines in culture. This phenomenon was totally dependent on JAK signaling molecules, while IRF9 deficiency in murine lung cancer cells partially attenuated the IFN-β-induced increase in PD-L1. mTOR may not be significantly involved in the regulation of PD-L1, whereas PI3-K pathway played differential roles on PD-L1 mRNA and cell-surface PD-L1 expression, in the cells treated with IFN-β. These results strongly suggest that the type I IFN receptor signal elicits an increase in PD-L1 expression in lung cancer cells through IRF9-dependent and independent pathways.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3adeath 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3aimmunotherapy 3ainterferon-beta 3alung neoplasms 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3aneoplasm cells 3apatients 0aInterferon-β 0aPD-L1 0aLung cancer 0aJAK inhibitor 0aIRF91 aKishida, Tsunao1 aKotani, Shin-ichiro1 aTakayama, Koichi1 aMazda, Osam1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9489-35560 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 Dec. 09, v. 507, no. 1-4 p.330-336dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.11.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03005naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245011800166520116200284592002801446650002501474650001401499650001601513650002301529650001301552650002001565650001201585650001701597650001401614650001201628650001301640650001301653650001201666650001901678650002101697650001801718650002001736650002001756650001301776650002101789650001801810650001401828650001701842650001401859650001101873653001401884653002801898653001401926653001601940653001901956700001501975700001601990700001702006700001502023700001502038700001602053700001502069700005602084773010802140856008602248852000902334655001202343IND60713308720221118073802.0220103e20210115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071330872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2020.1171852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJia, Yanan10aChemical structure and inhibition on α-glucosidase of polysaccharides from corn silk by fractional precipitation  aAimed to explore different corn silk polysaccharide (CSP) fractions derived by ethanol precipitation on the physicochemical properties and biological activities, four fractions (CSP20, CSP40, CSP60, and CSP80) were obtained. CSPs consisted of mannose, galactose, arabinose, rhamnose, xylose, and glucose with different ratios, and exhibited different total sugar content, uronic acid content, protein content, and total phenols content. All fractions also showed different physical properties, such as molecular weight, intrinsic viscosity, particle size, and microstructure. Besides, CSP80 exhibited stronger antioxidant activity and α-glucosidase inhibitory activity than the other three fractions. Enzyme kinetic analysis suggested that CSP80 inhibited α-glucosidase by mixed type and reversible mechanisms, respectively. Fluorescence intensity measurements confirmed that the secondary structure of α-glucosidase was changed by the binding of CSP80. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) results illustrated that the binding of CSP80 to α-glucosidase complex was spontaneous driven by enthalpy and hydrogen bonds played a major role in the binding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aarabinose 3acalorimetry 3achemical structure 3aenthalpy 3aenzyme kinetics 3aethanol 3afluorescence 3agalactose 3aglucose 3ahydrogen 3akinetics 3amannose 3amicrostructure 3amolecular weight 3aparticle size 3apolysaccharides 3aprotein content 3arhamnose 3astyles (flowers) 3asugar content 3atitration 3auronic acids 3aviscosity 3axylose 0aCorn silk 0aPolysaccharide fraction 0aStructure 0aAntioxidant 0aα-Glucosidase1 aXue, Zihan1 aWang, Yajie1 aLu, Yangpeng1 aLi, Ruilin1 aLi, Nannan1 aWang, Qirou1 aZhang, Min1 aChen, Haixia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2596-96220 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2021 Jan. 15, v. 252 p.117185-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2020.1171853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01737naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245011500159300002000274500001900294520069800313592002801011650002301039650002101062650001701083650001901100650001601119650001701135700001901152700002101171773013601192856007401328852000901402655001201411IND60720716520221122130654.0201216e20201215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072071652DNAL7 a10.1039/d0cc06547a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Chih-Yao10aInorganic AlCl₃–alkali metal thiocyanate ionic liquids as electrolytes for electrochemical Al technologies  ap. 15297-15300.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA series of inorganic AlCl₃–alkali metal thiocyanate (AMSCN: AM = Li, Na, K) ionic liquids (ILs) are demonstrated as electrolytes for Al electrodeposition and Al-anion rechargeable batteries (AARBs) at 303–363 K.

The rapid identification of bacteria plays a vital role in the treatment of bacterial infection at an early stage of the disease. In this work, an active polythiophene derivative containing reactive pentafluorophenyl (PFP) ester pendant groups was prepared via Fe³⁺-catalyzed oxidative polymerization. As far as we know, this is the first report of active polythiophene with reactive PFP ester moieties. The active polythiophene derivative was conjugated with vancomycin and α-methoxy-ω-amino poly(ethylene glycol) (mPEG-NH₂) via a reactive ester–amine reaction, resulting in the formation of water-soluble and fluorescent vancomycin-containing polythiophene (PTPVan). Since vancomycin can selectively interact with Gram-positive bacteria and kill them, the antibacterial properties of PTPVan were evaluated. The detection of Gram-positive bacteria was carried out by observing the color change and the fluorescence response of bacteria upon incubation with PTPVan through the naked eye and a fluorescence spectroscope, respectively. The staining of Gram-positive bacteria was observed using a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM).  aPublisher supplied data 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aantibacterial properties 3abacterial infections 3acolor 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3afluorescence 3aimage analysis 3amoieties 3apolyethylene glycol 3apolymerization 3astaining 3avancomycin 3awater solubility1 aWang, Shuai1 aFeng Hu, Xue1 aMing Li, Chang1 aQun Xu, Li0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2017 Nov. 15, v. 5, no. 44 p.8814-8820dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7tb02061a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02975naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094024002200135024001900157040001800176100003300194245010200227300001600329506007600345520149400421592002801915506003701943650002201980650002002002650002502022650001102047650001402058650001602072650002302088653002502111653002002136653002302156653002502179653002502204700002202229700002302251700002002274700002102294773010602315856008702421852000902508655001202517IND60545634720221207142052.0160902e20141101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054563472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.08.0212doi7 aPMC41867732pmcid7 a251737622pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamirez-Andreotta, Monica D.10aEnvironmental Research Translation: Enhancing interactions with communities at contaminated sites  ap. 651-664.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe characterization and remediation of contaminated sites are complex endeavors fraught with numerous challenges. One particular challenge that is receiving increased attention is the development and encouragement of full participation by communities and community members affected by a given site in all facets of decision-making. Many disciplines have been grappling with the challenges associated with environmental and risk communication, public participation in environmental data generation, and decision-making and increasing community capacity. The concepts and methods developed by these disciplines are reviewed, with a focus on their relevance to the specific dynamics associated with environmental contamination sites. The contributions of these disciplines are then synthesized and integrated to help develop Environmental Research Translation (ERT), a proposed framework for environmental scientists to promote interaction and communication among involved parties at contaminated sites. This holistic approach is rooted in public participation approaches to science, which includes: a transdisciplinary team, effective collaboration, information transfer, public participation in environmental projects, and a cultural model of risk communication. Although there are challenges associated with the implementation of ERT, it is anticipated that application of this proposed translational science method could promote more robust community participation at contaminated sites.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acommunity service 3adecision making 3ainformation exchange 3amodels 3apollution 3aremediation 3arisk communication 0aPublic participation 0aSuperfund sites 0aContaminated sites 0aEnvironmental health 0aCommunity engagement1 aBrusseau, Mark L.1 aArtiola, Janick F.1 aMaier, Raina M.1 aGandolfi, A.

These enzymes are involved in the control of cell proliferation, differentiation and metabolism and a large number of the anticancer drugs currently used are directed against PKs. The structure and function of PKs are well conserved throughout evolution. In schistosome parasites, PKs were shown to be involved in essential functions at every stage of the parasite life cycle, making these enzymes promising anti-parasite drug targets. In this study, we tested a panel of commercial inhibitors for various PKs and analyzed their effects on pairing and egg production by schistosomes as well as their toxicity towards schistosomula larvae. Results obtained confirmed the deleterious effect of PK targeting on Schistosoma mansoni physiology and the important function of different tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases in the biology and reproduction of this parasite. They also indicated for the first time that the Protein kinase B (also called Akt) which is a major downstream target of many receptor tyrosine kinases and a central player at the crossroads of signal transduction pathways activated in response to growth factors and insulin, can constitute a novel target for anti-schistosome chemotherapy. Structural and functional studies have shown that SmAkt is a conserved kinase and that its activity can be inhibited by commercially available Akt inhibitors. In treated adult worms, Akt/PKB kinase pathway inhibitors induced profound alterations in pairing and egg laying and they also greatly affected the viability of schistosomula larvae.  aPublisher supplied data 0aProtein kinase 0aInhibitor 0aProtein kinase B (PKB) 0aAkt 0aSchistosoma mansoni 0aChemotherapy1 aVanderstraete, Mathieu1 aCailliau, Katia1 aLescuyer, Arlette1 aLancelot, Julien1 aDissous, Colette0 tInternational Journal for Parasitology: Drugs and Drug Resistance.g2014 Dec., v. 4 p.256-266dElsevier Ltdx2211-32077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpddr.2014.09.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01702naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245006700168300001600235520052700251592002800778650001400806650001800820650001200838650001500850650004400865650002200909653002900931653001800960653002400978700001501002700001901017700001701036700001301053700001601066773014001082856008501222852000901307655001201316IND60544282820221119235623.0190415e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054428282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytol.2014.12.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Doudou10aNew phenolic glycosides isolated from Penthorum chinense Pursh  ap. 163-167.  aA phytochemical investigation from 80% ethanol extract of Penthorum chinense Pursh (Saxifragaceae) resulted in the isolation of three new phenolic glycosides (1–3), together with three known phenolic glycosides (4–6).

Two important protective factors for low-grade inflammation may be physical activity (PA) and fitness. We examined the independent associations of objective and subjective measurements of PA and fitness with low-grade inflammation in European adolescents. METHODS: A total of 1045 adolescents, aged from 12.5 to 17.5 years old from 10 European cities, were selected from the HELENA-Cross-Sectional Study. Objectively-measured and self-reported PA variables were obtained by accelerometry and the International PA Questionnaire for Adolescents, respectively. Overall, cardiorespiratory, muscular and motor fitness variables were assessed by standardized field-based fitness tests and the International Fitness Scale. C-reactive protein (CRP), complement factors 3 (C3) and 4 (C4), interleukin-6 and TNF-α inflammatory markers were measured. RESULTS: Objectively-measured vigorous PA was inversely associated with C3 (β=−0.094, P=0.021) but it did not remain significant after any objective fitness indicator was included in the model. Other objectively measured or self-reported assessments of PA were not significantly associated with inflammatory markers. All objective measures of fitness were inversely associated with CRP, C3 and C4, whereas only self-reported motor fitness remained significantly associated with C3, C4 and TNF-α. All these observations were independent of age, sex, city and body mass index or waist circumference. CONCLUSION: High PA in adolescence may play an indirect role on lessening low-grade inflammation through improvements in fitness.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC-reactive protein 3aaccelerometry 3aadolescence 3aadolescents 3aadulthood 3aatherogenesis 3aatherosclerosis 3abody mass index 3acities 3acomplement 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3amodels 3aphysical activity 3aquestionnaires 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3awaist circumference 2aActigraphy 2aAdolescent 2aAge Factors 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aC-Reactive Proteinxanalysis 2aComplement C3xanalysis 2aComplement C4xanalysis 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInflammationxbloodxepidemiologyximmunologyxprevention & control. 2aInflammation Mediatorsxblood 2aInterleukin-6xblood 2aMale 2aMotor Activity 2aPhysical Fitness 2aRegression Analysis 2aSelf Report 2aTumor Necrosis Factor-alphaxblood 0aEuropexepidemiology.1 aGomez-Martinez, Sonia1 aRuiz, Jonatan R.1 aDiaz, Ligia Esperanza1 aOrtega, Francisco B.1 aWidhalm, Kurt1 aCuenca-Garcia, Magdalena1 aManios, Yannis1 aDe Vriendt, Tineke1 aMolnar, Denes1 aHuybrechts, Inge1 aBreidenassel, Christina1 aGottrand, Frederic1 aPlada, Maria1 aMoreno, Sara1 aFerrari, Marika1 aMoreno Aznar, Luis,1 aSjöström, Michael1 aMarcos, Ascensión,2 aHELENA Study Group0 tAtherosclerosis.g2012 Mar., v. 221, no. 1 p.260-267dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0021-91507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2011.12.0323Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02719naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100007000140245015300210300001800363520148400381592002801865650002401893650003301917650001101950650001701961650002401978650002002002650001802022650002302040650001902063700001702082700001302099700002002112773014202132856007402274852000902348655001202357IND60642785620221120050105.0190508e20171115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064278562DNAL7 a10.1039/c7tb02068f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaiBoth authors contributed equally to this manuscript., Shenyang10aToward the low actuation temperature of flexible shape memory polymer composites with room temperature deformability via induced plasticizing effect  ap. 8845-8853.  aSemi-crystalline/elastomer blends such as poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) have been well-studied as shape memory polymer (SMP) systems over the last decade. The SMP system is known to be reliable as the activation or transitional temperature (Tₜᵣₐₙₛ) is well defined by its glass transition temperature (Tg). In this study, the possibility of altering SMPs’ Tₜᵣₐₙₛ by introducing plasticizer molecules, such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), into the system was investigated. Significant changes in morphologies and thermal behaviours of the composites after the incorporation of plasticizer inferring the possible changes in shape memory behaviours were reported. It was concluded that the SMP performance, in terms of activation temperature, shape fixing (Rf), shape recovery (Rᵣ) ratio, and recovery time, could be improved significantly due to the induced plasticizing effects. With only the incorporation of 5 wt% PEG, the Tₜᵣₐₙₛ of PLA/TPU SMP was successfully decreased from the well-known 75 °C to 50 °C while achieving 85% Rᵣ ratio. An improvement in 37.5% shorter recovery time can be observed with the incorporation of 10 wt% PEG when compared with a pristine PLA/TPU system under 50 °C. The results indicated that plasticizing is an effective method for altering the polymer chain structures and a step closer toward the development of fast response SMPs that can be activated under a low temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aglass transition temperature 3amixing 3aplasticizers 3apolyethylene glycol 3apolylactic acid 3apolyurethanes 3athermal properties 3athermoplastics1 aSun, Yu-Chen1 aRen, Jie1 aNaguib, Hani E.0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2017 Nov. 15, v. 5, no. 44 p.8845-8853dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7tb02068f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02158naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245007500176300001400251520101000265592002801275650001901303650001401322650002401336650002401360650001801384650002501402653000801427653000801435653000801443653001801451653002501469653000901494653003001503653001401533700001801547773009901565856008701664852000901751655001201760IND60526414720221116160959.0190405e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052641472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2016.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenchekroun, Hassan10aStatus concern and the exploitation of common pool renewable resources  ap. 70-82.  aWe examine the impact of social status concern in a common pool renewable resource oligopoly. A small number of players share access to a common pool resource and sell their production in a common market where they are oligopolists. We depart from the mainstream literature on common pool resource oligopolies by considering that each player cares about her social status. We allow for two channels to impact a player's welfare: harvest and profits. Under the first channel, a player has a bump in her utility when her harvest is larger than the average harvest of the rest of the players. In this case we show that the presence of this channel exacerbates the tragedy of the commons. Under the second channel, a player enjoys a bump in her utility if she manages to earn more profits than the average profits of the other players. In this case we show that social status concern may temporarily alleviate the tragedy of the commons: it results in a decrease of extraction over an interval of stock sizes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acommon markets 3aoligopoly 3aprofits and margins 3arenewable resources 3asocial impact 3asocioeconomic status 0aD62 0aQ20 0aQ50 0aSocial status 0aRelative performance 0aEnvy 0aCommon property resources 0aOligopoly1 aLong, Ngo Van0 tEcological economics.g2016 May, v. 125 p.70-82dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11629x0921-80097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2016.02.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02389naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245013000176300001600306520128000322592002801602650001501630650001401645650001501659650002001674650001501694650000901709650001701718650002201735651001301757700002201770700001801792700002401810773010301834856008101937852000902018655001202027IND60080126820221122143259.0150427e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008012682DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-013-3003-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlkhasawneh, Mutasem Sh.10aDetermination of importance for comprehensive topographic factors on landslide hazard mapping using artificial neural network  ap. 787-799.  aA landslide is one of the natural disasters that occur in Malaysia. In addition to the geological factor and the rain as triggering factor, topographic factors such as elevation, slope angle, slope aspect, and curvature are considered as the main causes of landslides. The study in this paper was conducted in three stages. The first stage involved the extraction of extra topographic factors. Previous landslide studies had identified only four of the topographic factors. However, eight new additional factors have also been identified in this study. They are general curvature, longitudinal curvature, tangential curvature, cross-section curvature, surface area, diagonal line length, surface roughness, and rugosity. At this stage, 13 factors were extracted from the digital elevation model. The second stage involved specifying the importance of each factor. The multilayer perceptron network and backpropagation algorithm were used to specify the weight of each factor. Results were verified using the receiver operating characteristics based on the area under the curve method in the third stage. The results indicated 76.07 % accuracy in predicting of landslides, with slope angle as the most important factor while the tangential curvature has the least importance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3adisasters 3alandslides 3aneural networks 3aprediction 3arain 3asurface area 3asurface roughness 3aMalaysia1 aNgah, Umi Kalthum1 aTay, Lea Tien1 aIsa, Nor Ashidi Mat0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2014 Aug., v. 72, no. 3 p.787-799dSpringer-Verlagx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-013-3003-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03847naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004700113040001800160100002400178245019500202300001600397520147100413592002801884650002001912650001701932650001001949650001401959650001901973650002501992650001402017650001002031650002802041650001002069650001302079650001302092650001802105650001402123650001002137650002502147650002502172650002802197650007402225650003202299650002402331650001402355650001102369650003802380650001702418650001102435650005102446650002802497650001402525650000902539650001602548650001302564650001402577650002902591650005702620650001202677651001102689700002202700700002202722700002202744700002602766700002102792700002302813700002002836773009602856856009302952990002303045852000903068655001203077IND60088899620221118074626.0141102e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008889962DNAL7 a222578242pmid7 a10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2011.12.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarneiro, Marcia M.14aThe removal from plasma of chylomicrons and remnants is reduced in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia subjects with identified LDL receptor mutations: Study with artificial emulsions  ap. 268-274.  aChylomicron remnants bind to both their specific receptors (LRP) and to the LDL receptor (LDLR) in the liver. There is controversy whether disturbances of chylomicron metabolism occur in subjects with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). The aim of this study was to evaluate whether there are defects on the removal from plasma of chylomicrons and their remnants in heterozygous FH patients with determined LDLR mutations. We studied 20 heterozygous FH patients (43.2±12 years old, 60% males) and 50 normolipidemic subjects matched for age and gender. FH subjects were not in use of LDL-lowering drugs for at least 6 weeks. The removal from plasma of chylomicrons and their remnants was measured by isotopic decay after venous injection of a chylomicron-like emulsion radiolabeled with ¹⁴C-cholesteryl ester (¹⁴C-CE) and ³H-triolein (³H-TO). These track respectively removal from plasma of chylomicrons and remnants and lipolysis. There was a significant reduction in the fractional catabolic rates (FCR in h⁻¹) of ¹⁴C-CE in FH in comparison with normolipidemics: 0.048 (1.46.10⁻⁷; 0.57) vs. 0.71(0.049; 1.62), [median (25th–75th percentile)], p=0.003. No differences were found in FCR of ³H-TO between FH and controls, respectively 1.62 (1.02; 2.331) and 1.914 (1.34; 2.878), p=0.405. In conclusion heterozygous FH subjects had a significant decrease on the removal from plasma of chylomicrons and their remnants compared with normolipidemics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatherosclerosis 3achylomicrons 3adrugs 3aemulsions 3aheterozygosity 3ahypercholesterolemia 3alipolysis 3aliver 3alow density lipoprotein 3amales 3amutation 3apatients 3aradiolabeling 3areceptors 2aAdult 2aCarbon Radioisotopes 2aCase-Control Studies 2aChi-Square Distribution 2aCholesterol Estersxadministration & dosagexbloodxpharmacokinetics. 2aChylomicron Remnantsxblood 2aChylomicronsxblood 2aEmulsions 2aFemale 2aGenetic Predisposition to Disease 2aHeterozygote 2aHumans 2aHyperlipoproteinemia Type IIxbloodxgenetics. 2aInjections, Intravenous 2aLipolysis 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMutation 2aPhenotype 2aReceptors, LDLxgenetics 2aTrioleinxadministration & dosagexpharmacokinetics. 2aTritium 0aBrazil1 aMiname, Marcio H.1 aGagliardi, Ana C.1 aPereira, Carolina1 aPereira, Alexandre C.1 aKrieger, Jose E.1 aMaranhão, Raul C.1 aSantos, Raul D.0 tAtherosclerosis.g2012 Mar., v. 221, no. 1 p.268-274dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0021-91507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2011.12.0333Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02603naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245005800178300001400236520120800250592002801458650001901486650001601505650001601521650001201537650001001549650001801559650001501577650001301592650001101605650001801616650001101634650002101645650001801666650002101684650001101705650001701716653000801733653000801741653000801749653000801757653001801765653002401783653002201807653001101829700001701840700002001857773010001877856008701977852000902064655001202073IND60526414820221116161012.0190405e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052641482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2015.11.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnkamah-Yeboah, Isaac10aPrice premium of organic salmon in Danish retail sale  ap. 54-60.  aThe year 2016 will be pivotal for organic aquaculture producers in EU, because it represents the deadline for implementing the complete organic life cycle in aquaculture production. Depending on the sturdiness of farms already producing, such a shift in the industry may affect production costs of exclusively using organic fry for production. If the profitability of the primary organic aquaculture producers should be maintained, then farmers must be able to correspondingly receive higher prices, transmitted through the value chain from the retail market. This study identifies the price premium for organic salmon in Danish retail sale using consumer panel scanner data from households by applying a random effect hedonic price model that permits unobserved household heterogeneity. A price premium of 20% was identified for organic salmon. The magnitude of this premium is comparable to organic labeled agricultural products and higher than that of eco-labeled capture fishery products, such as the Marine Stewardship Council. This indicates that the organic label also used for agricultural products may be better known and trusted among consumers than the eco-labels on capture fishery products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aaquaculture 3aecolabeling 3afarmers 3afarms 3afish products 3ahouseholds 3aindustry 3amodels 3aorganic foods 3aprices 3aproduction costs 3aprofitability 3aretail marketing 3asalmon 3asupply chain 0aC23 0aD12 0aQ11 0aQ22 0aPrice premium 0aOrganic aquaculture 0aFishery eco-label 0aSalmon1 aNielsen, Max1 aNielsen, Rasmus0 tEcological economics.g2016 Feb., v. 122 p.54-60dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11629x0921-80097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2015.11.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02944naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245015100173300001800324520173500342592002802077650001602105650001002121650001502131650001602146650002602162650002202188700002902210700002402239700002102263700002202284700002402306700002502330700002602355773009902381856008102480852000902561655001202570IND60081797720221120121424.0141014e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008179772DNAL7 a10.1007/s12161-014-9827-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYatsu, Francini K.

In order to simplify the analytical method, the glycosides were previously hydrolyzed to the corresponding aglycone forms. The separation of all isoflavone aglycones was achieved in 23 min, with a total time of analysis of 30 min, using trifluoroacetic acid 0.1 % (v/v) and acetonitrile:trifluoroacetic acid (100:0.01, v/v) as mobile phase. The LC method specificity was evaluated by the analysis of isoflavone standards submitted to acidic, alkali, neutral, oxidative, and photolytic stress conditions. The isoflavones degraded in alkali at 60 °C or in alkali under ulraviolet C (UVC) radiation, forming, in both conditions, three degradation products D1, D2, and D3 which were analyzed by liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS). The method showed linearity higher than 0.999 with the concentration ranged from 0.1 to 10 μg ml⁻¹ for all isoflavone aglycones. The limits of quantitation obtained using calibration curves were from 0.28 to 0.37 μg ml⁻¹ and the intermediary precision at three levels (2, 6, and 10 μg ml⁻¹) showed RSD values between 0.03 and 0.25 %. After the performed validation, the LC method was applied to compare the isoflavone aglycones content in three different matrices: Glycine max beans, Glycine max dry extract, and isoflavone aglycone loaded nanoemulsion.

Infestation by LF increased TrypPI levels in the leaves of rice plants at the tillering, booting and flowering stages but decreased TrypPI levels at the ripening stage; TrypPI levels in rice stems did not increase at any developmental stage. Infestation by LF at the tillering stage systemically increased TrypPI levels in leaves but not in stems; it also enhanced salicylic acid (SA) levels in leaves and stems, and the ethylene level released from plants. However, LF infestation did not increase JA concentrations. Exogenous application of SA or ethylene enhanced TrypPI levels in the leaves and stems of plants at the tillering stage, whereas treatment with both SA and ethylene induced lower levels of TrypPIs than treatment with SA or ethylene alone, suggesting an antagonistic effect of SA and ethylene on TrypPIs induction. The results suggest that both SA and ethylene signaling pathways are involved in the production of TrypPIs in rice induced by LF; moreover, the antagonistic effect of SA and ethylene may explain the changes in TrypPI levels seen at different plant developmental stages and in different organs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCnaphalocrocis medinalis 3acrop production 3adevelopmental stages 3aethylene 3aleaves 3aproteinase inhibitors 3arice 3asalicylic acid 3asignal transduction 3astems 3atillering 3atrypsin1 aHu, LiuCheng1 aZhou, GuoXin1 aCheng, JiaAn1 aLou, YongGen0 tChinese science bulletin.g2011 Aug., v. 56, no. 22 p.2351-2358dSpringer-Verlagx1001-65387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-011-4568-y  aDNAL 7aarticle02961naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245017600152300001600328520147700344592002801821650001701849650001201866650001401878650001401892650002801906650001901934650004301953650002201996650000902018650002402027650001302051650004402064650001402108650001102122650002202133650001602155650002302171650001302194700001102207700001402218700002002232700001502252773013002267856007302397852000902470655001202479IND60478678820221119021652.0160113e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047867882DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.45782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Wen10aMagnetic nanosized calcium ferrite particles for efficient degradation of crystal violet using a microwave‐induced catalytic method: insight into the degradation pathway  ap. 367-374.  aBACKGROUND: Magnetic iron based catalysts with high oxidation performance are generally effective for many catalytic reactions and can be magnetically recovered after application, showing advantages over other metal oxides. In this work, a highly active nanosized CaFe₂O₄ was prepared by a sol–gel method. Application of the microwave‐induced catalytic degradation (MICD) method to the abatement of crystal violet (CV) using the magnetic catalyst was studied. RESULTS: More than 90% of CV was degraded within 10 min. The intermediate products were investigated by UV–vis, HPLC and NMR. The results confirmed that CV was completely degraded and converted into harmless products. The reaction kinetics, effect of different ion species (Cl⁻, SO₄ ² ⁻, NO₃ ⁻, H₂PO₄ ⁻ and HPO₄ ² ⁻), pH, dye initial concentration, dosage of catalyst, and degradation mechanism were comprehensively studied. It was found that CaFe₂O₄ presented high activity to produce hydroxyl radicals and holes for degradation of CV under microwave radiation (MW). Surface hydroxyl groups of CaFe₂O₄ were a critical part in the generation of radicals, and iron on CaFe₂O₄ surface formed active sites to catalyze CV suggesting that CaFe₂O₄ plays a significant role in degradation of dyes. CONCLUSION: This work provides valuable knowledge on the development of CaFe₂O₄ catalyst for environmental remediation technology. © 2014 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3acalcium 3acatalysts 3achlorides 3aferrimagnetic materials 3agentian violet 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydroxyl radicals 3airon 3amicrowave radiation 3anitrates 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoxidation 3aoxides 3areaction kinetics 3aremediation 3asol-gel processing 3asulfates1 aLi, Qi1 aAn, Shuai1 aZhang, Tingting1 aZhang, Lei0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2016 Feb., v. 91, no. 2 p.367-374dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.45783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02020naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245011000161300001800271520101300289592002801302650001101330650001701341650001301358650001701371650002301388650001501411650002201426650001701448650001101465700001701476773009901493856008101592852000901673655001201682IND60081797820221120111307.0141014e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008179782DNAL7 a10.1007/s12161-014-9828-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Feiyu12aA Measurement Method on Pesticide Residues of Apple Surface Based on Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy  ap. 1858-1865.  aPesticide residues on fruit surfaces do great harm, but it is difficult to realize the fast and on-site measurement of pesticide residues. In this paper, we explored the potential application of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) technology for the fast measurement of chlorpyrifos residues on apple surfaces. The spectral characteristics of phosphorus (213.62 and 214.91 nm), sulfur (393.33 and 396.89 nm), and chlorine (837.594 nm) in chlorpyrifos could be captured by LIBS. Significant spectra differences were found between untreated apples and apples sprayed with chlorpyrifos. The results of chemometrics methods indicate that the spectra of clean apples and the apples sprayed with several different concentrations of chlorpyrifos have obvious differences. The study demonstrates that laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy, which has advantages in micro-destructive, fast, and on-site test, not only can detect chlorpyrifos on fruit surfaces but also allows the semi-quantitative detection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapples 3achemometrics 3achlorine 3achlorpyrifos 3apesticide residues 3aphosphorus 3aspectral analysis 3aspectroscopy 3asulfur1 aDong, Daming0 tFood analytical methods.g2014 Oct., v. 7, no. 9 p.1858-1865dSpringer-Verlagx1936-97517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12161-014-9828-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03187naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147245010000178300001800278520185600296592002802152650002502180650002902205650001602234650001602250650001602266650001402282650001602296650001202312650001502324650001902339650001602358650002202374650002602396700001902422700002702441700001502468700002102483700003102504773012802535856008102663852000902744655001202753IND60555703420221121231123.0170725e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055570342DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-016-7594-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGalanopoulou, Anastasia P.10aInsights into the functionality and stability of designer cellulosomes at elevated temperatures  ap. 8731-8743.  aEnzymatic breakdown of lignocellulose is a major limiting step in second generation biorefineries. Assembly of the necessary activities into designer cellulosomes increases the productivity of this step by enhancing enzyme synergy through the proximity effect. However, most cellulosomal components are obtained from mesophilic microorganisms, limiting the applications to temperatures up to 50 °C. We hypothesized that a scaffoldin, comprising modular components of mainly mesophilic origin, can function at higher temperatures when combined with thermophilic enzymes, and the resulting designer cellulosomes could be employed in higher temperature reactions. For this purpose, we used a tetravalent scaffoldin constituted of three cohesins of mesophilic origin as well as a cohesin and cellulose-binding module derived from the thermophilic bacterium Clostridium thermocellum. The scaffoldin was combined with four thermophilic enzymes from Geobacillus and Caldicellulosiruptor species, each fused with a dockerin whose specificity matched one of the cohesins. We initially verified that the biochemical properties and thermal stability of the resulting chimeric enzymes were not affected by the presence of the mesophilic dockerins. Then we examined the stability of the individual single-enzyme-scaffoldin complexes and the full tetravalent cellulosome showing that all complexes are stable and functional for at least 6 h at 60 °C. Finally, within this time frame and conditions, the full complex appeared over 50 % more efficient in the hydrolysis of corn stover compared to the free enzymes. Overall, the results support the utilization of scaffoldin components of mesophilic origin at relatively high temperatures and provide a framework for the production of designer cellulosomes suitable for high temperature biorefinery applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaldicellulosiruptor 3aClostridium thermocellum 3aGeobacillus 3abiorefining 3acellulosome 3achimerism 3acorn stover 3aenzymes 3ahydrolysis 3alignocellulose 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3athermophilic bacteria1 aMoraïs, Sarah1 aGeorgoulis, Anastasios1 aMorag, Ely1 aBayer, Edward A.1 aHatzinikolaou, Dimitris G.0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2016 Oct., v. 100, no. 20 p.8731-8743dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-016-7594-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02797naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245008600152300002000238520156900258592002801827650002001855650001201875650002201887650002101909650001201930650001501942650001701957650001301974650001701987650001902004650001202023650002602035650001902061650000702080650001602087650001302103700002402116700001602140773012402156856007402280852000902354655001202363IND60664480620221119062855.0190912e20130819xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066448062DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra40866c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXia, Yu10aRecent studies on thermophilic anaerobic bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomass  ap. 15528-15542.  aThis paper reviews recent research developments in biological thermophilic lignocellulosic biomass conversion based on sixty four references published in the past 4 years (2009–2012). Bioconversion of hydrolysate and lignocellulosic biomass with or without pretreatment under thermophilic conditions (with temperatures higher than 50 °C) to fermentation products like hydrogen, methane, ethanol and carboxylic acids is discussed in terms of the bioaugmentation techniques and microorganisms involved. The discussion was divided into two branches according to the form of substrate applied: one branch targeted the fermentation of liquid hydrolysate (liquid fraction generated from the pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass); the other one summarized the studies using raw or pretreated solid lignocellulosic biomass as a feedstock. Fermentation of the hydrolysate was discussed from the aspects of hydrolysate toxicity tolerance and hydrolysate detoxification techniques, while, process affecting parameters like pH, enrichment processes, substrate type and loading as well as microbial communities were reviewed for solid lignocellulosic biomass fermentation. Key information was compiled into four tables respectively summarizing the optimal fermentation conditions for the production of hydrogen/methane and ethanol/carboxylic acids from hydrolysate and lignocellulosic biomass. Information delivered in this article may shed light on the perspectives of the scientific and technical challenges faced by thermophilic anaerobic lignocellulose bioconversion.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioaugmentation 3abiomass 3abiotransformation 3acarboxylic acids 3aethanol 3afeedstocks 3afermentation 3ahydrogen 3ahydrolysates 3alignocellulose 3amethane 3amicrobial communities 3amicroorganisms 3apH 3atemperature 3atoxicity1 aFang, Herbert H.

Its sorption has been studied in a wide range of materials, but no equivalent study exists for microplastics, an emerging environmental vector. Weathering and biofilm formation on microplastics can enhance radioiodine sorption. For the first time, we're reporting how radioiodine interacts with different types of polyethylene derived microplastics (pristine, irradiated, and biofilm developed microplastics). This study revealed that exposure to radiation and the marine environment significantly alters the physico-chemical properties of microplastics. In particular, in marine-exposed samples, a signature of biofilm development was detected. Speciation study indicates that iodine exists in the iodide form in the studied marine environment. The study revealed that, iodide ions attach to biofilm-developed microplastics via electrostatic, ion-dipole, pore filling, and van der Waals interactions. Pore filling, ion-dipole, and van der Waals interactions may cause iodide binding to irradiated microplastics, whereas pore-filling and van der Waals interactions cause iodide binding to pristine microplastics. The distribution coefficient (Kd) of iodine on microplastics is positively correlated with biofilm biomass, which signifies the role of biofilm in radioiodine uptake. The Kd indicates microplastics are potential iodide accumulators and could be a possible vector in the marine system.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofilm 3abiomass 3aenvironmental fate 3aiodine 3airradiation 3amarine environment 3amicroplastics 3apollution 3apolyethylene 3asorption 3avan der Waals forces 0aRadioiodine 0aMicroplastics 0aBiofilm 0aSorption 0aMarine exposure1 aYadav, Sonali1 aJoshi, Vikram1 aKarpe, Rupali1 aPulhani, Vandana1 aKumar, A.V.0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2022 Aug. 15, v. 307 p.119432-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2022.1194323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02359naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245010600172300001600278520102400294592002801318650003301346650001301379650001201392650002501404650002901429650001301458650000701471650002301478650001301501650002001514650001501534650002501549653001501574653001301589653001801602653001201620653001301632700002001645700001701665700002401682773010201706856008401808852000901892655001201901IND60122712620221119210518.0150325e20150304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012271262DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2014.9536012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalovanyy, Andriy10aAmmonium removal by partial nitritation and Anammox processes from wastewater with increased salinity  ap. 595-604.  aThis work is dedicated to the biological treatment of wastewater with increased salinity using a combination of partial nitritation and Anammox processes. Two one-stage deammonification moving bed biofilm reactors were operated with the increase in NaCl concentration every two weeks by 5 and 2.5 g/L. The strategy with a step of 5 g/L of salinity increase led to complete inhibition of the process at the salinity level of 15 g/L. The strategy with a step of 2.5 g/L gave possibility to adapt bacteria to the elevated salinity. After reaching the salinity level of 10 g NaCl/L, the reactor was operated during 92 days with a nitrogen removal rate of 0.39 ± 0.19 g N/(m ²·day) (0.078 ± 0.038 kg N/m ³·day) and an average nitrogen removal efficiency of 59%. It was shown that conductivity cannot be used for monitoring the process when a reactor is treating wastewater with increased salinity, whereas pH can be correlated to effluent ammonium concentration regardless of wastewater salinity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic ammonium oxidation 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3abiological treatment 3aenvironmental technology 3anitrogen 3apH 3aprocess monitoring 3asalinity 3asodium chloride 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0awastewater 0aammonium 0anitrification 0aAnammox 0aactivity1 aPlaza, Elzbieta1 aTrela, Jozef1 aMalovanyy, Myroslav0 tEnvironmental technology.g2015 Mar. 4, v. 36, no. 5 p.595-604dTaylor & Francisx1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2014.9536013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02466naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245012300157300001800280520134100298592002801639650003101667650001601698650001401714650002601728650001801754650001501772700001501787700001401802700001801816700001401834700001701848700001501865773014101880856007402021852000902095655001202104IND60642786020221120063256.0190508e20171108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064278602DNAL7 a10.1039/c7tb02089a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Jiankang10aMicrofiber-reinforced nanofibrous scaffolds with structural and material gradients to mimic ligament-to-bone interface  ap. 8579-8590.  aMost of the existing tissue-engineered scaffolds for the regeneration of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) are unable to recapitulate the structural/compositional/mechanical gradients at native ACL–bone interface. Herein, we present a unique electrospinning strategy to fabricate microfiber-reinforced nanofibrous scaffolds with structure and composition gradients. The orientations of the electrospun nanofibers gradually change from random to highly aligned, and the contents of nano-hydroxyapatite (nHA) and bone morphogenesis protein (BMP-2) encapsulated into the nanofibers exhibit gradient variation. The gradient nanofibrous scaffolds were found to regulate cellular morphology and zonal bone-specific differentiation in vitro. The incorporation of microfibers significantly improved the mechanical property of the gradient nanofibrous scaffolds, which was similar to native ACL–bone fixation after implantation in vivo. Histological observations revealed that the gradient scaffolds facilitated the formation of fibrocartilage transitional zone at graft and bone attachments that are similar to native ligament-to-bone interface. We envision that the presented method might provide biomimetic physical/chemical/mechanical microenvironments for enhanced multitissue regeneration particularly at the soft-hard tissue interface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanterior cruciate ligament 3abiomimetics 3ahistology 3amechanical properties 3amorphogenesis 3ananofibers1 aJiang, Nan1 aQin, Ting1 aZhang, Weijie1 aLiu, Zhuo1 aLiu, Yaxiong1 aLi, Dichen0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2017 Nov. 8, v. 5, no. 43 p.8579-8590dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7tb02089a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03588naa a2200889 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245006800175300001600243520134900259592002801608650001001636650001401646650001101660650001801671650002601689650001701715650001301732650002201745650003801767650001901805650002101824650002801845650002101873650002101894650001601915650002401931650001601955650003701971650001402008650001302022651000902035653001602044653002302060653001402083653002202097653002202119653001502141653000802156653000802164653000802172653000802180653000902188653000902197653000802206653000902214653000802223653000902231653000702240653000902247653000802256653000802264653000802272653001102280653000702291653000902298653000902307653000902316653000802325653000802333653000902341653000802350653000802358653001002366653000902376700002502385700002202410700002002432773014002452856008502592852000902677655001202686IND60544283120221119235906.0190415e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054428312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytol.2014.12.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSemwal, Ruchi Badoni10aButein: From ancient traditional remedy to modern nutraceutical  ap. 188-201.  aButein (2′,3,4,4′-tetrahydroxychalcone), a simple chalcone derivative, occurs in many unrelated genera including Butea Dahlia, Coreopsis and Searsia. It is a reputed food additive and a common ingredient of botanicals used in herbal medicine formulations, particularly in Asian countries. Although a simple polyphenol, this molecule exhibits a range of pharmacological properties, most notably acting as a potent protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor and as an antineoplastic agent. Researchers have convincingly demonstrated that butein inhibits the epidermal growth factor receptor in HepG2 cells and the tyrosine-specific protein kinase activities of the epidermal growth factor receptor. In addition, it also exhibits promising anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, antinephritic, antithrombin, anti-angiogenic and hepatoprotective activities in various animal models. Although this molecule is endowed with an impressive list of biological properties, which have acted as scientific support for its commercialization, there are no review articles that coherently discuss various aspects of this chalcanoid. This review aims to explore the pharmacological relevance of butein, together with its structure–activity relationships and mechanisms of action.

How to separate and purify amino acids from fermentation broths or protein hydrolysates in an effective and low cost way is increasingly becoming an urgent problem. The utilization of solvent extraction technology for amino acids separation offers one solution. RESULTS: Extractions of individual amino acids in aqueous solution with di(2‐ethyl‐hexyl)phosphoric acid (D2EPHA) are dominated by aqueous pH and their hydrophobicity. The degree of extraction of amino acids increases with increasing pH (1.0<pH<3.0), but changes only slightly in the range 3.0<pH<7.0. Amino acids with a longer carbon chain or cyclic structure have higher degrees of extraction, while those with additional polar groups have lower degrees of extraction. Protein hydrolysate from cottonseed meal was obtained by combination of microbial fermentation and HCl hydrolysis. The greatest extraction of amino acids from the hydrolysate was found at initial feed pH 6.5, and byproducts (e.g. reducing sugars and sodium chloride) were completely retained in raffinate. Amino acids loading the organic phase can be completely stripped by using an aqueous solution having an equal volume of 0.5 mol L⁻¹ HCl. CONCLUSION: Use of D2EPHA reactive extraction enabled avoidance of a sequence of purification stages and provided purer back‐extracts. © 2014 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3aaqueous solutions 3abyproducts 3acarbon 3acottonseed meal 3aculture media 3afermentation 3ahydrochloric acid 3ahydrolysates 3ahydrolysis 3ahydrophobicity 3apH 3aphosphoric acid 3aprotein hydrolysates 3areducing sugars 3asodium chloride 3asolvents1 aZhang, Shunxi1 aYang, Xinni1 aQiu, Ling1 aGao, Bing1 aLi, Rui1 aChen, Jiwang0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2016 Feb., v. 91, no. 2 p.483-489dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.46023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02930naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005600144245008800200300001800288500001900306520127900325592002801604650001601632650001501648650001501663650001301678653003501691653003301726653002901759653001801788653002301806700005801829700005601887700005401943700002001997700005502017700001902072700005302091700005802144700005602202773013902258856007802397852000902475655001202484IND60724084420210831000000.0210120e20210105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072408442DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c198352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Guorui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1746-341010aOut-of-Plane Deformations Determined Mechanics of Vanadium Disulfide (VS₂) Sheets  ap. 3040-3050.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe rapid development of two-dimensional (2D) materials has significantly broadened the scope of 2D science in both fundamental scientific interests and emerging technological applications, wherein the mechanical properties play an indispensably key role. Nevertheless, particularly challenging is the ultrathin nature of 2D materials that makes their manipulations and characterizations considerably difficult. Herein, thanks to the excellent flexibility of vanadium disulfide (VS₂) sheets, their susceptibility to out-of-plane deformation is exploited to realize the controllable loading and enable the accurate measurements of mechanical properties. In particular, the Young’s modulus is estimated to be 44.4 ± 3.5 GPa, approaching the lower limit for 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). We further report the first measurement of thickness-dependent bending rigidity of VS₂, which deviates from the prediction of the classical continuum mechanics theory. Additionally, a deeper understanding of the mechanics within two dimensions also facilitates the modulation of strain-coupled physics at the nanoscale. Our Raman measurements showed the Grüneisen parameters for VS₂ were determined for the first time to be γE₂g₁ ≈ 0.83 and γA₁g ≈ 0.32.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeformation 3adisulfides 3aprediction 3avanadium 0atwo-dimensional (2D) materials 0avanadium disulfide nanosheet 0aout-of-plane deformation 0ananomechanics 0astrain engineering1 aZhang, Zhepeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9870-07201 aWang, Yanlei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2214-87811 aGao, Enlai1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1960-02601 aJia, Xiangzheng1 aDai, Zhaohe1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5205-089X1 aWeng, Chuanxin1 aLiu, Luqi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5752-16381 aZhang, Yanfeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1319-32701 aZhang, Zhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9102-13110 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Jan. 05, v. 13, no. 2 p.3040-3050dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c198353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02127naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245012200165300001600287520068700303592002800990650002301018650002201041650001301063650001401076650001201090650001401102650002901116650001301145650001501158650002401173650003301197650001601230650002401246653001501270653001401285653001201299653002401311653002701335700001601362700001601378700001701394700001201411700001501423773010201438856008401540852000901624655001201633IND60122712920221119211152.0150325e20150304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012271292DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2014.9546292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Guixia10aStudy of KOH/Al2O3 as heterogeneous catalyst for biodiesel production via in situ transesterification from microalgae  ap. 622-627.  aHeterogeneous KOH/Al ₂O ₃ catalysts, synthesized by the wet impregnation method with different KOH loadings (20–40 wt%) and calcination temperatures from 400°C to 800°C, were used to produce biodiesel from Chlorella vulgaris biomass by in situ transesterification.

Using unique data from a stratified, random, face-to-face survey with 1,035 households in 108 villages in 2014, we combine double-bounded dichotomous choice with open-ended elicitation formats to assess the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for EFE conservation. We find that local households are willing to pay CFA 1,139.4 (€1.74) per month to prevent EFE extinction. This totals CFA 753.9 million (€1.15 million) per year for all inhabitants. Indigenousness positively influences the WTP for EFE conservation. Spatial data suggest that local communities prefer that elephants remain far from their crops. The existence of human-elephant conflicts has a neutral effect on preferences for EFE conservation. Therefore, our study suggests that local communities would engage in biodiversity preservation when the public benefits of conservation are accompanied by private benefits, such as human-elephant conflict avoidance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElephantidae 3abasins 3abiodiversity 3acrops 3aextinction 3aforests 3ahouseholds 3alandscape management 3alandscapes 3asocial benefit 3aspatial data 3asurveys 3avillages 3awillingness to pay 0aForest elephant extinction 0aIndigenous people 0aContingent valuation 0aWTP 0aInterval regression model 0aDouble-hurdle model 0aQ 57 0a29 0aC241 aAbildtrup, Jens1 aSonwa, Denis,1 aDelacote, Philippe0 tEcological economics.g2016 June, v. 126 p.70-86dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11629x0921-80097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2016.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02543naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011900164300001800283520136100301592002801662650002501690650002001715650001001735650003201745650001501777650002201792650001501814650002801829650002601857650002101883700001501904700001801919700001401937700001701951773009901968856008102067852000902148655001202157IND60081798520221120111144.0141014e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008179852DNAL7 a10.1007/s12161-014-9839-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiong, Zhiyu10aSimultaneous Determination of 16 Organic Acids in Food by Online Enrichment Ion Chromatography−Mass Spectrometry  ap. 1908-1916.  aA novel analytical method for simultaneous determination of 16 organic acids in foodstuff using online enrichment ion chromatography−mass spectrometry (IC–MS) was developed. The online enrichment and separation of the organic acids were performed using ion chromatography with a homemade enrichment column and a homemade separation column. The qualitative and quantitative analyses of the organic acids were performed using mass spectrometry in the selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) source in a negative mode. Two hundred-microliter samples were injected for analysis using an online enrichment time of 3 min. Sodium hydroxide solution (NaOH) was used for the gradient elution system. The two columns made it possible to have a low limit of detection since it has good enriching and separating capabilities. Sixteen kinds of organic acids were separated completely within 30 min. All the curves showed good linearity (R ² ≥ 0.9949) within the test ranges. The limits of detection (LODs) were between 0.01 and 0.22 mg/L, and the average recoveries were between 80.5 and 109.8 %. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) were less than 8.02 %. The results indicated that this method was simple, rapid, sensitive, and accurate for the determination of organic acids in various food products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric pressure 3adetection limit 3afoods 3aion exchange chromatography 3aionization 3amass spectrometry 3amonitoring 3aorganic acids and salts 3aquantitative analysis 3asodium hydroxide1 aDong, Ying1 aZhou, Hongbin1 aWang, Hui1 aZhao, Yunxia0 tFood analytical methods.g2014 Oct., v. 7, no. 9 p.1908-1916dSpringer-Verlagx1936-97517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12161-014-9839-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02708naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245012500167300001600292520125800308592002801566650001301594650001301607650002901620650001401649650001701663650001801680650001101698650000901709650001501718650000901733650001501742650002601757650001601783650001101799650001501810653001201825653002101837653002301858653001401881653002201895653001501917700001601932700001601948700001401964700001701978773010201995856008402097852000902181655001202190IND60122713020221119210821.0150325e20150304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012271302DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2014.9546302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBentarzi, Y.10aQuantifying mobile and immobile zones during simulated stormwater infiltration through a new permeable pavement material  ap. 628-637.  aWe have designed a new eco-material for use in permeable pavements in view to ensuring the sustainable management of stormwater in urban areas. The specific characteristic of this material is that it allows the infiltration of rainfall, storing the infiltrated water and trapping the pollutants carried by runoff such as engine oil and heavy metals. This new material is composed of a mixture of crushed concrete , resulting from inert construction waste, and organic material (compost). We performed tracing experiments in view to monitor the flow of the water within this material in order to study its hydrodynamics under heavy rainfall (rain with a return period of 10 years). The experimental results revealed preferential flows due to the heterogeneity of the material and liable to act as a major vector for the mobility of the pollutants transported within the material by stormwater. The work presented in this article consists in quantifying these preferential flows by determining their water contents in mobile (θ ₘ) and immobile (θ ᵢₘ) water during infiltration. To do this, we used the (NON-EQUILIBRIUM Convection–Dispersion Equation) model, in order to evaluate mobile and stagnant zones in the framework of tracing experiments.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposts 3aconcrete 3aenvironmental technology 3aequations 3aheavy metals 3ahydrodynamics 3amodels 3aoils 3apollutants 3arain 3astormwater 3astormwater management 3aurban areas 3awastes 3awater flow 0acompost 0acrushed concrete 0apermeable pavement 0apollution 0apreferential flow 0astormwater1 aGhenaim, A.1 aTerfous, A.1 aWanko, A.1 aPoulet, J.B.0 tEnvironmental technology.g2015 Mar. 4, v. 36, no. 5 p.628-637dTaylor & Francisx1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2014.9546303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01269naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245014600158300002000304520033200324592002800656650001300684650001100697650002200708700001500730700001300745700001500758773012300773856007400896852000900970655001200979IND60664481120221119063057.0190912e20130701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066448112DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra40873f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Junfei10aFacile one-step synthesis of a 3D macroscopic SnO₂–graphene aerogel and its application as a superior anode material for Li-ion batteries  ap. 11489-11492.  aWe present a facile one-step synthesis of a three-dimensional macroscopic SnO₂–graphene aerogel.

Since it has been suggested that S-Adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) is the main causative factor in Hcy-induced pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease, we evaluate here whether the cytotoxic Hcy effect in endothelial cells is also SAH dependent. METHODS AND RESULTS: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were exposed to the following conditions: (1) non-treated control (resulting in 2.8nM intracellular SAH and 3.1μM extracellular l-Hcy); and incubation with (2) 50μM adenosine-2,3-dialdehyde (ADA; resulting in 17.7nM intracellular SAH and 3.1μM extracellular l-Hcy), (3) 2.5mM Hcy (resulting in 20.9nM intracellular SAH and 1.8mM extracellular l-Hcy), and (4) 1, 10 and 100μM SAH. We then determined the effect of treatment on annexin V-positivity, caspase-3 activity, cytochrome c release (sub)cellular expression of NOX2, NOX4, p47ᵖʰᵒˣ and nitrotyrosine, and H₂O₂. Both Hcy and ADA significantly increased PS exposure (n=5), caspase-3 activity (n=6) and cytochrome c release (n=3). Incubation with extracellular SAH alone did not affect cell viability. Both Hcy and ADA also induced similar increases in nuclear NOX2 and (peri)nuclear NOX4, coinciding with (peri)nuclear p47ᵖʰᵒˣ expression and local reactive oxygen species (ROS) (n=3). Inhibition of NOX-mediated ROS by the flavoenzyme inhibitor diphenylene iodonium (DPI) significantly decreased apoptosis induction (n=3) and ROS production (n=3). CONCLUSION: SAH induces PS exposure and apoptosis in endothelial cells independently of Hcy. Our study therefore shows that Hcy-mediated endothelial dysfunction, as determined in the cell model used, is mainly due to SAH accumulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3aatherosclerosis 3acaspase-3 3acell viability 3acytochrome c 3acytotoxicity 3ahomocysteine 3ahuman umbilical vein endothelial cells 3ahumans 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amodels 3anecrosis 3apathogenesis 2aAdenosinexanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology. 2aApoptosisxdrug effects 2aCaspase 3xmetabolism 2aCell Survival 2aCells, Cultured 2aCytochromes cxmetabolism 2aEndothelial Cellsxdrug effectsxmetabolismxpathology. 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aHomocysteinexmetabolism 2aHumans 2aHydrogen Peroxidexmetabolism 2aMembrane Glycoproteinsxantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aNADPH Oxidasesxantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aOnium Compoundsxpharmacology 2aPhosphatidylserinesxmetabolism 2aS-Adenosylhomocysteinexmetabolism 2aTyrosinexanalogs & derivativesxmetabolism.1 aHahn, Nynke E.1 aBlom, Henk J.1 aLougheed, Sinéad M.1 aStehouwer, Coen D.A.1 aRauwerda, Jan A.1 aKrijnen, Paul A.J.1 avan Hinsbergh, Victor W.M.1 aNiessen, Hans W.M.0 tAtherosclerosis.g2012 Mar., v. 221, no. 1 p.48-54dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0021-91507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2011.11.0323Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02445naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245013400159300001800293500001900311520101000330592002801340650001701368650001201385650001501397650001301412650001101425650001901436653002101455653001801476653002501494653002701519653002101546653002001567700001901587700001701606700005401623700005401677700005401731773013901785856007801924852000902002655001202011IND60724084620221120023427.0210120e20210105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072408462DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c199092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLan, FuYin10aElectrospun Polymer Nanofibers with TiO₂@NiCo-LDH as Efficient Polysulfide Barriers for Wide-Temperature-Range Li–S Batteries  ap. 2734-2744.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHerein, we introduce polymer nanofibers of TiO₂@NiCo-LDH as interlayers into Li–S batteries. From 0 to 60 °C, the interlayers can deliver high sulfur utilization, an outstanding rate capability, and excellent cycling life. High-temperature excitation makes it easier for the valence band electrons of TiO₂ to transition to the conduction band. The electron–hole pairs formed on the surface combine with the ether group of 1,3-dioxolane in the electrolyte, which greatly reduces the decomposition and volatilization rates of the electrolyte, ensuring Li–S batteries with good cycle performance at high temperatures. The capacity can stabilize at 798.6 mAh g–¹ after 100 cycles at 60 °C and 1C, and the battery can provide a capacity higher than 323.2 mAh g–¹ at 0 °C. Simultaneously, the lithium metal symmetrical battery with a functional separator can be continuously cycled for 1800 and 750 h without a short circuit at the current densities of 0.65 and 1.63 mA cm–², respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrolytes 3alithium 3ananofibers 3apolymers 3asulfur 3avolatilization 0aLi−S batteries 0aTiO2@NiCo-LDH 0afunctional separator 0aelectrostatic spinning 0ahigh temperature 0alow temperature1 aZhang, Haiyan,1 aFan, Jinchen1 aXu, Qunjie1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2363-42521 aLi, Hexing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3558-52271 aMin, YuLin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6305-04760 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Jan. 05, v. 13, no. 2 p.2734-2744dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c199093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02818naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002200188245008400210300001800294506007600312520118000388592002801568506003701596650002501633650002701658650001901685650002501704650001001729650001301739650001101752650001601763650002001779650002401799650001001823650001201833650001201845650002201857650001601879650002401895700002301919700002601942700001701968700002401985700002402009700003702033773012802070856008102198852000902279655001202288IND60555703920221207085659.0170725e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055570392DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-016-7699-x2doi7 aPMC50356622pmcid7 a273836072pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGodlewska, Renata10aEvaluation of a protective effect of in ovo delivered Campylobacter jejuni OMVs  ap. 8855-8864.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCampylobacter jejuni is the most prevalent cause of a food-borne gastroenteritis in the developed world, with poultry being the main source of infection. Campylobacter jejuni, like other Gram-negative bacteria, constitutively releases outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). OMVs are highly immunogenic, can be taken up by mammalian cells, and are easily modifiable by recombinant engineering. We have tested their usefulness for an oral (in ovo) vaccination of chickens. Four groups of 18-day-old chicken embryos (164 animals) underwent injection of wt C. jejuni OMVs or modified OMVs or PBS into the amniotic fluid. The OMVs modifications relied on overexpression of either a complete wt cjaA gene or the C20A mutant that relocates to the periplasm. Fourteen days post-hatch chicks were orally challenged with live C. jejuni strain. Cecum colonization parameters were analyzed by two-way ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc test. The wtOMVs and OMVs with wtCjaA overexpression were found to confer significant protection of chicken against C. jejuni (p = 0.03 and p = 0.013, respectively) in comparison to PBS controls and are promising candidates for further in ovo vaccine development.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCampylobacter jejuni 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aamniotic fluid 3aanalysis of variance 3acecum 3achickens 3achicks 3aengineering 3agastroenteritis 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3amammals 3amutants 3aprotective effect 3avaccination 3avaccine development1 aKuczkowski, Maciej1 aWyszyńska, Agnieszka1 aKlim, Joanna1 aDerlatka, Katarzyna1 aWoźniak-Biel, Anna1 aJagusztyn-Krynicka, Elżbieta K.0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2016 Oct., v. 100, no. 20 p.8855-8864dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-016-7699-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02969naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245014900174300001600323520147600339592002801815650002601843650001701869650001901886650001201905650002301917650001101940650001101951650001501962650001701977650001001994650002602004650001402030650001202044653002602056653001302082653001802095653002202113653001602135700004002151700002402191700002002215700001802235773014002253856008502393852000902478655001202487IND60544283720221119235957.0190415e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054428372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytol.2014.12.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiżyński, Bartosz14aThe content of free and esterified triterpenoids of the native marigold (Calendula officinalis) plant and its modifications in in vitro cultures  ap. 410-417.  aSubstantial qualitative and quantitative differences in the triterpenoid profiles of marigold Calendula officinalis L. cv. Persimmon Beauty native plant organs (whole capitular inflorescences, separated ligulate flowers, leaves, and roots) and of various types of marigold in vitro cultures (a suspension culture initiated from seedlings, a hairy root culture, a suspension culture initiated from hairy roots) were demonstrated through GC–MS/FID analysis. The ligulate flowers and whole inflorescences were the richest sources of pentacyclic triterpenoids occurring in free and ester forms, whereas the in vitro cultures synthesized primarily sterols, although the profile of these compounds was considerably different than that of the native plant. The synthesis and accumulation of triterpenoids of taraxastane-type skeletons were determined to occur only in flowers, and D:A-friedooleanane (friedelane) triterpenoids were detected only in the roots, whereas oleanane, ursane and lupane skeletons were determined to be synthesized in all parts of the plant. Certain metabolic features of the parent plant were retained in the in vitro cultures (e.g., the capacity to synthesize oleanane, ursane and lupane skeletons), whereas others were lost. The obtained results confirm the existence of a strong correlation between morphological differentiation and the biosynthesis of plant secondary metabolites, which influences the potential productivity of in vitro cultures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCalendula officinalis 3abiosynthesis 3aesterification 3aflowers 3aindigenous species 3aleaves 3alupane 3apersimmons 3aplant organs 3aroots 3asecondary metabolites 3aseedlings 3asterols 0aCalendula officinalis 0aMarigold 0aTriterpenoids 0aIn vitro cultures 0aHairy roots1 aAlsoufi, Abdulwadood Shakir Mahmood1 aPączkowski, Cezary1 aDługosz, Marek1 aSzakiel, Anna0 tPhytochemistry letters.g2015 Mar., v. 11 p.410-417dElsevier LtdaPhytochemical Society of EuropewJournal:J000000131x1874-39007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytol.2014.12.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03084naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002500145245010000170300001800270500001900288520173300307592002802040650001202068650002202080650002502102650002302127650002602150650001302176650001402189650001902203650001102222650000702233650001702240650001402257650001902271650001402290650001902304650001302323650000902336650001002345650001902355700001502374700002002389773013602409856004802545852000902593655001202602IND6036722320221119225530.0210726e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND603672232DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-011-0480-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKogbara, Reginald B.10aProcess envelopes for stabilisation/solidification of contaminated soil using lime–slag blend  ap. 1286-1296.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPURPOSE: Stabilisation/solidification (S/S) has emerged as an efficient and cost-effective technology for the treatment of contaminated soils. However, the performance of S/S-treated soils is governed by several intercorrelated variables, which complicates the optimisation of the treatment process design. Therefore, it is desirable to develop process envelopes, which define the range of operating variables that result in acceptable performance. METHODS: In this work, process envelopes were developed for S/S treatment of contaminated soil with a blend of hydrated lime (hlime) and ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) as the binder (hlime/GGBS = 1:4). A sand contaminated with a mixture of heavy metals and petroleum hydrocarbons was treated with 5%, 10% and 20% binder dosages, at different water contents. The effectiveness of the treatment was assessed using unconfined compressive strength (UCS), permeability, acid neutralisation capacity and contaminant leachability with pH, at set periods. RESULTS: The UCS values obtained after 28 days of treatment were up to ∼800 kPa, which is quite low, and permeability was ∼10−8 m/s, which is higher than might be required. However, these values might be acceptable in some scenarios. The binder significantly reduced the leachability of cadmium and nickel. With the 20% dosage, both metals met the waste acceptance criteria for inert waste landfill and relevant environmental quality standards. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that greater than 20% dosage would be required to achieve a balance of acceptable mechanical and leaching properties. Overall, the process envelopes for different performance criteria depend on the end-use of the treated material.  aPublisher supplied data 3acadmium 3acalcium hydroxide 3acompression strength 3acost effectiveness 3aenvironmental quality 3afurnaces 3alandfills 3aneutralization 3anickel 3apH 3apermeability 3apetroleum 3apolluted soils 3apollution 3aprocess design 3aresearch 3asand 3aslags 3asolidification1 aYi, Yaolin1 aAl-Tabbaa, Abir0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2011 Sept., v. 18, no. 8 p.1286-1296dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-011-0480-x  aDNAL 7aarticle02532naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245010500176300001400281520133100295592002801626650001401654650001101668650002901679650002201708653001901730653001601749653002101765653002301786653002601809653002901835700001901864700002801883700001601911700002401927773009901951856008702050852000902137655001202146IND60526415520221116161011.0190405e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052641552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2016.02.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFont Vivanco, David14aThe foundations of the environmental rebound effect and its contribution towards a general framework  ap. 60-69.  aThe study of the so-called rebound effect has traditionally pertained to the domain of neoclassical energy economics. In recent years, other disciplines have applied this concept in the context of the environmental assessment of products and policies, and multiple perspectives have unfolded more or less in parallel. Among these, the environmental rebound effect (ERE) perspective, focused on efficiency changes and indicators that go beyond energy to multiple environmental issues, has remained relatively unnoticed. This article thus asks the following questions: What are the foundational aspects of the ERE and how these relate to other perspectives? Are there irreconcilable differences between perspectives? And what is the value of the ERE towards a general framework? We map the fundamental ideas behind the ERE and find that the lack of articulation has resulted in inconsistent usage and lack of clarity. We also argue that the ERE offers many valuable insights for rebound assessment, such as the study of broader efficiency changes and of innovations aimed at tackling multiple environmental issues. Perhaps most importantly, the ERE helps bringing together the existing rebound perspectives, as its application shows that it is both possible and valuable to articulate broader definitions for the rebound effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomics 3aenergy 3aenvironmental assessment 3aissues and policy 0aRebound effect 0aConsumption 0aEnergy economics 0aIndustrial ecology 0aLife cycle assessment 0aTechnological efficiency1 aMcDowall, Will1 aFreire-González, Jaume1 aKemp, René1 avan der Voet, Ester0 tEcological economics.g2016 May, v. 125 p.60-69dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11629x0921-80097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2016.02.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03004naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010900166300001600275520161700291592002801908650001301936650002901949650002701978650001402005650001802019650001102037650000902048650001702057650000902074650001602083650000902099650001102108650002002119650002302139650002502162650001102187650001602198650001202214650000902226700001802235700001702253700002002270700002702290773010302317856008102420852000902501655001202510IND60080127820221121104719.0150427e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008012782DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-013-3013-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSipos, Péter,10aGeochemical, mineralogical and magnetic characteristics of vertical dust deposition in urban environment  ap. 905-914.  aStudies on composition and distribution of dust deposition are necessary for the risk assessment of dust to atmospheric quality. We studied the vertical distribution pattern of dust and metal (Cu, Fe, Pb, Zn) deposition up to 33 m height in urban environment. Integrated geochemical, mineralogical and magnetic study of the seasonally sampled dust helped to specify our knowledge on the use of magnetic susceptibility for tracking its deposition. Harmful dust and metal deposition may occur even at great heights and at the low-traffic side of buildings. Re-suspension of local surface materials dominates the dust deposition primarily in summer and spring due to weather conditions, and it may overwrite the influence of recent anthropogenic activities on dust composition. The accepted air-flow models should be modified by taking the local conditions (weather, morphology, etc.) into account. All studied metals showed strong enrichment in the dust and could be characterized by similar vertical deposition pattern to dust. The total susceptibility was found to be much more useful proxy for tracking dust and metal deposition than mass-specific susceptibility. Using the former, potential errors arising from sampling practice of settled dust could be eliminated. The most important heavy-metal-bearing phases were iron oxides and clay minerals. Their different behavior during the dust deposition is reflected by the vertical metal distribution patterns. Clay minerals originate primarily from re-suspension and may be one of the most important sources of potentially mobile heavy metals in such materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair flow 3aanthropogenic activities 3aatmospheric deposition 3abuildings 3aclay minerals 3acopper 3adust 3aheavy metals 3airon 3airon oxides 3alead 3amodels 3arisk assessment 3aseasonal variation 3aspatial distribution 3asummer 3aurban areas 3aweather 3azinc1 aMárton, Emő1 aMay, Zoltán1 aNémeth, Tibor,1 aKovács Kis, Viktória0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2014 Aug., v. 72, no. 3 p.905-914dSpringer-Verlagx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-013-3013-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01812naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245007800164300001800242520085900260592002801119650001501147650001301162650001401175650002101189650001301210650002101223650001901244650001001263700002401273773009901297856008101396852000901477655001201486IND60081798920221120111252.0141014e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008179892DNAL7 a10.1007/s12161-014-9814-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPękal, Anna10aEvaluation of Aluminium Complexation Reaction for Flavonoid Content Assay  ap. 1776-1782.  aTwo widely applied spectrophotometric assays based on aluminium complex formation used for determination of total flavonoid content in food or medicinal plant samples were examined for several compounds from different classes of flavonoid family. The method which involves the measurement at 410–430 nm after addition of AlCl₃ solution is selective only for flavonols and flavones luteolin. The procedure in the presence of NaNO₂ in alkaline medium seems to be specific for rutin, luteolin and catechins, but also phenolic acids exhibit considerable absorbance at 510 nm. Application of both procedures to natural samples gave different order in terms of their flavonoid content. Thus, the expression “total flavonoid” content is not adequate as the results of both methods are dependent on the structure of the individual flavonoids present.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aaluminum 3aflavanols 3afunctional foods 3aluteolin 3amedicinal plants 3aphenolic acids 3arutin1 aPyrzynska, Krystyna0 tFood analytical methods.g2014 Oct., v. 7, no. 9 p.1776-1782dSpringer-Verlagx1936-97517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12161-014-9814-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03363naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245016400155300001600319520203500335592002802370650002402398650001402422650001002436650001902446650001502465650001902480650001102499650001902510650001902529650001402548651001002562700001902572700001702591700001102608700001702619700001802636700002302654700002202677700001902699773011702718856007302835852000902908655001202917IND60478679620221119021450.0160113e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047867962DNAL7 a10.1111/jbi.126352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKou, Yixuan14aThe antiquity of Cyclocarya paliurus (Juglandaceae) provides new insights into the evolution of relict plants in subtropical China since the late Early Miocene  ap. 351-360.  aAIM: The accumulation of supraspecific lineages in Asia has been linked to climatic changes and tectonic events starting in the Miocene, but few studies have extended the intraspecific history of relict plants in subtropical China back to the Early or Middle Miocene. In this study, we investigate the effects of events from the late Early Miocene onwards on the evolutionary history of a relict plant, Cyclocarya paliurus, in subtropical China. LOCATION: Subtropical China. METHODS: Sequence variation in two chloroplast intergenic spacers (atpB–rbcL and psbA–trnH) and one nuclear gene (PHYA) was investigated across 57 populations of C. paliurus. Standard population genetic analyses, estimation of the most recent common ancestor of chloroplast haplotypes and diversification rate analyses were carried out, and Bayesian skyline plots were constructed. RESULTS: The time to the most recent common ancestor of all 17 chloroplast haplotypes in C. paliurus was 16.69 Ma (95% HPD 8.42–27.86 Ma), which largely coincides with the initial intensification of the Asian monsoon and global climate cooling during the Early to Middle Miocene. Chloroplast lineage diversification started to increase in the early Late Miocene, with peaks at c. 9.6 Ma and c. 3.6 Ma, corresponding temporally to two subsequent intensification events of the Asian monsoon. Bayesian skyline plots of both markers revealed that C. paliurus could have experienced at least two waves of expansion since the middle Pleistocene. The distributions of chlorotypes and clades were both consistent with a multiple‐refugia model but with strong signals of range expansion. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a long evolutionary profile of an archaic plant species in subtropical China, dating from the late Early Miocene. Our results suggest that the occurrence of the Asian monsoon and associated tectonic events, as well as Pleistocene climate changes, had a pervasive influence on the phylogeographical structure of plants in subtropical China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyclocarya paliurus 3aevolution 3agenes 3aglobal cooling 3ahaplotypes 3aintergenic DNA 3amodels 3amonsoon season 3aphylogeography 3atectonics 3aChina1 aCheng, Shanmei1 aTian, Shuang1 aLi, Bo1 aFan, Dengmei1 aChen, Yongjun1 aSoltis, Douglas E.1 aSoltis, Pamela S.1 aZhang, Zhiyong0 tJournal of biogeography.g2016 Feb., v. 43, no. 2 p.351-360dBlackwell Scientific Publications.x0305-02707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jbi.126353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03058naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245009900172300001600271520119600287592002801483650001401511650001701525650003101542650002501573650001701598650001401615650001601629650001901645650001001664650001001674650001201684650001801696650001501714650002801729650001901757650001301776650004401789650001901833650001401852650000901866650001401875650002201889651001701911653002301928653001601951653001801967653002101985653001602006653002202022700002502044700002202069700001902091700002002110700002702130700002902157773014002186856008502326852000902411655001202420IND60544283920221119235740.0190415e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054428392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytol.2014.12.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohamed, Gamal A.10aBlepharisides A and B, new flavonol glycosides from Blepharis ciliaris growing in Saudi Arabia  ap. 177-182.  aBio-guided fractionation of the total MeOH extract (TME) of the aerial parts of Blepharis ciliaris (L.) B.L. Burtt. (Acanthaceae) growing in Saudi Arabia was carried out to evaluate its hepatoprotective activity against CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity in rats. Successive chromatographic separations of the potent hepatoprotective n-BuOH fraction afforded two new flavonol glycosides, blepharisides A (1) and B (2), along with quercetin 3-O-rutinoside (3). Their structures were established by UV, IR, 1D, 2D NMR, and HRESIMS spectral data, in addition to comparison with literature data. Co-treatment of CCl4 hepatic injured rats with the total MeOH extract (TME) and its fractions significantly restored the hepatic marker enzymes and total bilirubin to near-normal values compared to silymarin (reference drug). The isolated compounds were evaluated for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. They displayed significant antioxidant activity (DPPH assay) in relation to propyl gallate (positive control) (% inhibition of 88.2, 87.9, and 74.2, respectively).

Moreover, many models predict increasing frequency and severity of such biotic disturbances due to ongoing climate change, and land use driven changes in forest structure and composition. Bark beetles are recognized as keystone species due to their strong and complex effects on ecosystem dynamics. However, due to the increasingly widely recognized biogeomorphic impacts of trees, bark beetles may have significant indirect biogeomorphic and pedogenetic impacts through their effects at scales ranging from individual trees to forest landscapes. These include: (1) Reduced uprooting, with associated impacts on topography, mass movements, regolith and soil formation, and slope hydrology; (2) Reductions in bioprotection via trapping of downslope sediment movement; (3) Hydrological impacts, including increased total runoff and increased proportion of subsurface flow; (4) Decreased microtopographic irregularity (and associated hydrological and pedological impacts); and (5) Changes in biochemical and biomechanical effects on soils, regolith, and hillslope morphology. Five separator factors (discriminators between different developmental trajectories) were revealed for the case of the central European region. These factors may determine the occurrence and severity of biogeomorphic impacts: First is whether the site is prone to potential uprooting or whether an spruce bark beetle (SBB) outbreak is initiated by a blowdown/uprooting event. Second is whether the site is dominated by mineral soils or Histosols. A third discriminating factor is whether the forest is managed or unmanaged, which determines the pre-attack tree species composition and coarse woody debris and disturbance regimes; and a fourth is the post-outbreak management. Finally, the fifth separator factor relates to slope thresholds that determine the significance of impacts on mass movements and erosion. These findings support the need, and provide guidelines, for research on geomorphic impacts of bark beetle infestations. Though we mainly restrict our consideration to bark beetles in Europe, both our approach and findings are likely to have broader relevance for biogeomorphic impacts of extensive tree mortality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDendroctonus ponderosae 3aHistosols 3aIps typographus 3aPicea 3abark beetle infestations 3abark beetles 3abiomechanics 3aclimate change 3acoarse woody debris 3aecosystems 3aforest resources 3aforests 3aguidelines 3akeystone species 3aland use 3alandscapes 3amass movement 3amineral soils 3amodels 3aregolith 3arunoff 3asediments 3asoil formation 3aspecies diversity 3asubsurface flow 3atopographic slope 3atree mortality 3atrees 3aCentral European region 3aEurasia 3aEurope 3aNorth America 0aBiogeomorphology 0aEcosystem engineering 0aBiotic disturbance 0aOld-growth forests 0aForest management 0aNon-linear pedogenesis1 aPhillips, Jonathan D.1 aPawlik, Łukasz0 tGlobal and planetary change.g2020 Dec., v. 195 p.103317-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12406x0921-81817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2020.1033173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02187naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245015300164300001600317520117300333592002801506650000901534650001801543650001301561650000701574650001501581650001401596650001101610700002001621700001801641700001801659773011501677856004801792852000901840655001201849IND50066352020221119041627.0130512e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006635202DNAL7 a10.1007/s12257-012-0492-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDo, Khac-Uan10aInfluence of the thermochemical sludge pretreatment on the nitrification of A/O reactor with the removal of phosphorus by simultaneous precipitation  ap. 313-320.  aIn the present study, a laboratory scale anoxic/oxic (A/O) reactor is used for the removal of nutrient and sludge reduction. Phosphorus removal was achieved through simultaneous precipitation, and sludge production was reduced through thermochemical pretreatment. The main objective of the study was to investigate the influence of sludge pretreatment on the nitrification rate. Total phosphorus in the effluent was maintained around 0.5 ∼ 1.0 mg/L by simultaneous precipitation, using coagulant alum at 2.2 mole ratio. Before simultaneous precipitation, the nitrification rate of the A/O reactor was found to be 0.050 g N-NH₄ ⁺/g MLVSS.d. The thermochemical sludge pretreatment began on the 120ᵗʰ day at pH 11 and 80°C. The initiation of sludge pretreatment brought about a significant reduction of the A/O reactor nitrification rate, which fell to 0.038 g N-NH₄ ⁺/g MLVSS/day. The effect of sludge pretreatment was reflected in the reduction of the nitrogen removal efficiency from 85 to 74%. Recycling of the thermochemically pretreated sludge accounted for 57% sludge reduction, which had an adverse influence on the nitrification rate of the system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalum 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3apH 3aphosphorus 3arecycling 3asludge1 aRajesh Banu, J.1 aKaliappan, S.1 aYeom, Ick-Tae0 tBiotechnology and bioprocess engineering.g2013 Apr., v. 18, no. 2 p.313-320dSpringer-Verlagx1226-83727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12257-012-0492-5  aDNAL 7aarticle03211naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245009300170300001600263520157700279592002801856650001901884650002001903650002201923650001401945650001301959650002101972650002301993650001902016650002202035650002702057650002002084650001002104651002102114651001502135651003102150653001502181653001102196653002402207653000802231653001302239653001502252653001302267653001602280653001302296653002202309653001002331700002002341700001602361700002002377700002202397700002002419773012202439856005102561852000902612655001202621IND50075788120221116202239.0140410e20120601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007578812DNAL7 a10.1080/10256016.2012.6770422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJunghans, Peter10aStudies of the protein and the energy metabolism in man during a wintering in Antarctica  ap. 208-225.  aDuring the 29th Soviet Antarctic Expedition in Novolazarevskaya from March 1984 to March 1985, the protein and energy metabolisms were studied in six expeditioners from the German Democratic Republic. The investigations were carried out at the beginning of the expedition (May), during the polar night (July) and during the polar day (December). The effect of a special stress situation (sledge trek in April 1984) was investigated in one subject. The stable nitrogen isotope ¹⁵N was used to study the protein metabolism. The assessment of the energy metabolism was based on the oxygen consumption, which was determined by means of a spirograph. In addition, the vital capacity, the breath minute volume, the blood pressure, etc. were measured. The following results were obtained: During the polar night, the utilisation of the dietary proteins and the whole body protein synthesis calculated by means of the ¹⁵N excretion of the total nitrogen in urine were greater (73.6±0.9 % and 3.48±0.17 g protein d⁻¹ kg⁻¹, n=3) than the respective values during the polar day (69.7±1.2, p<0.05, n=3 and 3.05±0.07, p<0.05, n=3) and at the beginning of the expedition (69.6±1.4, p<0.02, n=5 and 2.81±0.09, p<0.01, n=5). The lowest values (58.0 % and 2.43 g protein d⁻¹ kg⁻¹) were obtained in the subject after the trek. The resting metabolic rate (in kJ d⁻¹ m⁻²) was decreased during the polar night (45.6±5.0, n=4) in comparison with the polar day (61.5±11.3, n=3) and the beginning of the expedition (52.3±9.6, n=4) with p<0.01 in both cases.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood pressure 3adietary protein 3aenergy metabolism 3aexcretion 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aoxygen consumption 3aprotein bodies 3aprotein synthesis 3aresting metabolic rate 3astable isotopes 3aurine 3aAntarctic region 3aAntarctica 3aGerman Democratic Republic 0aAntarctica 0aenergy 0aisotope application 0aman 0amedicine 0ametabolism 0anitrogen 0anitrogen-15 0aproteins 0atracer techniques 0aurine1 aSchrader, Georg1 aFaust, Hans1 aWagner, Barbara1 aHirschberg, Klaus1 aReinhardt, Rolf0 tIsotopes in environmental and health studies.g2012 June 1, v. 48, no. 2 p.208-225dTaylor & Francisx1477-26397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10256016.2012.677042  aDNAL 7aarticle02706naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245019700176300001400373520136100387592002801748650002501776650003001801650001201831650002101843650001201864650002301876650001301899650001601912650001901928653002301947653002401970653001401994700002502008700002702033700002002060700001902080773010702099856008102206852000902287655001202296IND60565700020221119235743.0170731e20170415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056570002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.abb.2017.03.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalazar Chávez, Javier,10aPhosphoethanolamine addition to the Heptose I of the Lipopolysaccharide modifies the inner core structure and has an impact on the binding of Polymyxin B to the Escherichia coli outer membrane  ap. 28-34.  aPhosphoethanolamine (pEtN) decoration of E. coli Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) provides resistance to the antimicrobial Polymyxin B (PolB). While EptA and EptB enzymes catalyze the addition of pEtN to the Lipid A and Kdo (pEtN-Kdo-Lipid A), EptC catalyzes the pEtN addition to the Heptose I (pEtN-HeptI). In this study, we investigated the contribution of pEtN-HeptI to PolB resistance using eptA/eptB and eptC deficient E. coli K12 and its wild-type parent strains. These mutations were shown to decrease the antimicrobial activity of PolB on cells grown under pEtN-addition inducing conditions. Furthermore, the 1-N-phenylnapthylamine uptake assay revealed that in vivo PolB has a reduced OM-permeabilizing activity on the ΔeptA/eptB strain compared with the ΔeptC strain. In vitro, the changes in size and zeta potential of LPS-vesicles indicate that pEtN-HeptI reduce the PolB binding, but in a minor extent than pEtN-Kdo-Lipid A. Molecular dynamics analysis revealed the structural basis of the PolB resistance promoted by pEtN-HeptI, which generate a new hydrogen-bonding networks and a denser inner core region. Altogether, the experimental and theoretical assays shown herein indicate that pEtN-HeptI addition promote an LPS conformational rearrangement, that could act as a shield by hindering the accession of PolB to inner LPS-targets moieties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli K12 3aanti-infective properties 3aenzymes 3ahydrogen bonding 3alipid A 3amolecular dynamics 3amutation 3apolymyxin B 3azeta potential 0aLipopolysaccharide 0aPhosphoethanolamine 0aPolymyxin1 aAlarcón, Mackarenna1 aHuerta Peralta, Jaime,1 aNavarro, Belén1 aAguayo, Daniel0 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g2017 Apr. 15, v. 620 p.28-34dElsevier Inc.x0003-98617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2017.03.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02172naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001400149245010800163300001200271520101900283592002801302650001901330650002301349650002801372650001401400650001301414650001201427653001901439653002601458653002101484653001401505653002801519700001901547773015201566856008301718852000901801655001201810IND60544284020221120000004.0190416e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054428402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jobaz.2015.01.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavid, M.10aMalathion acute toxicity in tadpoles of Duttaphrynus melanostictus, morphological and behavioural study  ap. 1-7.  aThe present study was undertaken to evaluate the median lethal concentration (LC50), morphological deformities and changes in behavioural responses caused by commercial formulations of malathion on Duttaphrynus melanostictus tadpoles. The LC50 value was found to be 7.5mg/l and ability of malathion to cause morphological anomalies and changes in behavioural responses in tadpoles were studied at sublethal concentrations of 0.5mg/l (1/15th), 0.75mg/l (1/10th) and 1.5mg/l (1/5th) for a duration of 5days. The morphological defects and changes in behavioural responses like notochord curvature and loss of fright response respectively were witnessed as an important conduct; in addition, other symptoms under both the parameters were known to be time (i.e. developmental stage) and concentration dependent thereby acknowledging the direct cause of damage due to malathion. Thus, based on the present study, care must be taken when this chemical is in use at agricultural sites especially nearby aquatic ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacute toxicity 3aaquatic ecosystems 3alethal concentration 50 3amalathion 3atadpoles 3azoology 0aAcute toxicity 0aBehavioural responses 0aD. melanostictus 0aMalathion 0aMorphological anomalies1 aKartheek, R.M.0 tJournal of Basic & Applied Zoology.g2015 Oct., v. 72 p.1-7dElsevier B.V.aThe Egyptian German Society for ZoologywJournal:23227x2090-98967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jobaz.2015.01.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03416naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001200144245013200156300001800288500001900306520167500325592002802000650001802028650002502046650001302071650001802084650001502102650002502117650002202142653002902164653003602193653004702229653002602276653003702302700001802339700001802357700001902375700001402394700001802408700001502426700001602441700001502457700001702472700001602489700001802505700001702523700002002540700005602560700002002616773013902636856007802775852000902853655001202862IND60724084920221120032039.0210120e20210107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072408492DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c199772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Kun10aHighly Multifunctional and Thermoconductive Performances of Densely Filled Boron Nitride Nanosheets/Epoxy Resin Bulk Composites  ap. 2853-2867.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn the development of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN)-based polymeric composites with high thermal conductivity, it is always challenging to achieve a dense filling of h-BN fillers to form a desired high-density thermal transfer network. Here, a series of boron nitride nanosheets (BNNSs)/epoxy resin (EP) bulk composites filled with ultrahigh BNNSs content (65–95 wt %) is successfully constructed through a well-designed mechanical-balling prereaction combined with a general pressure molding method. By means of this method, the highly filled BNNSs fillers are uniformly dispersed and strongly bonded with EP within the composites. As a result, the densely BNNSs-filled composites can exhibit multiple performances. They have excellent mechanical properties, and their maximum compression strength is 30–97 MPa. For a BNNSs/EP composite with filling ultrahigh BNNSs fraction up to 90 wt %, its highly in-plane thermal conductivities (TC) are 6.7 ± 0.1 W m–¹ K–¹ (at 25 °C) to 8.7 ± 0.2 W m–¹ K–¹ (200 °C), respectively. In addition, the minimum coefficient of thermal expansion of BNNSs/EP composites is 4.5 ± 1.3 ppm/°C (only ∼4% of that of the neat EP), while their dielectric constants are basically located between 3–4 along with their dielectric loss tangent values exceptionally <0.3 in the ultrahigh frequency range of 12–40 GHz. Additionally, these BNNSs/EP composites exhibit remarkable cycle stability in heat transfer during heating and cooling processes because of their structural robustness. Thus, this type of densely BNNSs-filled BNNSs/EP composite would have great potential for further practical thermal management fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboron nitride 3acompression strength 3aepoxides 3aheat transfer 3ananosheets 3athermal conductivity 3athermal expansion 0aboron nitride nanosheets 0adensely BNNSs-filled composites 0adielectric behavior at ultrahigh frequency 0amechanical properties 0acoefficient of thermal expansion1 aYang, Jingwen1 aCao, Chaochao1 aZhai, Qinghong1 aQiao, Wei1 aQiao, Jiaxiao1 aGao, Hejun1 aZhou, Zheng1 aJi, Jiawei1 aLi, Mengyuan1 aLiu, Chaoze1 aWang, Bozheng1 aBai, Wenjuan1 aDuan, Hongliang1 aXue, Yanming1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1061-229X1 aTang, Chengchun0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Jan. 07, v. 13, no. 2 p.2853-2867dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c199773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02858naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012300166300001800289520163900307592002801946650001201974650001001986650001201996650002102008650002002029650001802049650001402067650001402081650002702095650002002122650001102142650002002153650001002173700001702183700001402200700001602214700001702230773009902247856008102346852000902427655001202436IND60081799220221122054812.0141014e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008179922DNAL7 a10.1007/s12161-014-9817-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMing, Tingyong10aAnalysis of Free Amino Acids in Russula griseocarnosa Harvested at Different Stages of Maturity Using iTRAQ®-LC-MS/MS  ap. 1816-1823.  aFree amino acids are closely related to the savory taste and beneficial effects of mushrooms. A novel, sensitive, and selective LC-MS/MS method was developed on the simultaneous determination of 20 free protein amino acids as well as 22 non-protein amino acids in Russula griseocarnosa at different stages of maturity by stable isotope isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) labeled. The results indicated that the content of total free amino acids increased slightly from 19.88 mg/g dry weight (DW) at stage 1 to 20.57 mg/g DW at stage 2, and then dramatically decreased to 14.42 mg/g DW at stage 3. The MSG-like components, including aspartic and glutamic acids were downtrend with the development of fruiting bodies. The contents of monosodium glutamate-like components were in the range of 0.99–2.28 mg/g DW and lower than those of sweet components (2.61–4.35 mg/g DW) or bitter components (1.89–3.39 mg/g DW). Contents of total tasteless components fluctuated in the range of 0.37–0.61 mg/g DW. Glutamine, glutamic acid, and alanine were the most predominant protein amino acids occurring in the free form, and argininosuccinic acid, γ-amino-n-butyric acid, β-alanine, and L-ornithine were the most plentiful non-protein amino acids. Furthermore, it could be noted that the quantitative differences in free amino acids between individuals at the same stages of maturity become larger with the development of fruiting bodies. Our findings provide further evidence regarding the selection of appropriate stages of maturity of R. griseocarnosa for its nutritional value and beneficial effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRussula 3aacids 3aalanine 3afree amino acids 3afruiting bodies 3aglutamic acid 3aglutamine 3amushrooms 3anonprotein amino acids 3anutritive value 3asavory 3astable isotopes 3ataste1 aLi, Jingjing1 aHuo, Peng1 aWei, Yanlin1 aChen, Xinhua0 tFood analytical methods.g2014 Oct., v. 7, no. 9 p.1816-1823dSpringer-Verlagx1936-97517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12161-014-9817-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02357naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100003400164245012200198300001800320520078900338592002801127650002301155650001401178650001301192650001801205650001201223650000701235650001201242650001201254650003401266650002701300650002401327650001101351650002401362650002601386650003101412650001301443650002201456650004101478650004901519650002301568650003901591700002601630700002001656773011801676856004801794852000901842655001201851IND4474159420221122060752.0121003e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447415942DNAL7 a219477132pmid7 a10.1007/s12010-011-9389-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaraboulsi, Fadi Antoine, Jr.10aMultienzymatic Sucrose Conversion into Fructose and Gluconic Acid through Fed-Batch and Membrane-Continuous Processes  ap. 1708-1724.  aMultienzymatic conversion of sucrose into fructose and gluconic acid was studied through fed-batch and continuous (in a membrane reactor) processes.

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of potentially pathogenic Vibrio species in shrimps cultured at inland ponds with low salinity in Thailand. Of 16 shrimp samples (white-leg shrimps and black-tiger shrimps) from ponds with water temperatures from 29 to 32 °C, and salinities from 1 to 5 parts per trillion, 15 contained Vibrio cholerae (densities: 62–252,000 MPN/g). Vibrio parahaemolyticus was present in six samples (370–6,300,000 MPN/g), and Vibrio vulnificus was present in two samples (16–1300 MPN/g). V. parahaemolyticus has higher affinity for non-native white-leg shrimp than for native black-tiger shrimp. The minimum inhibitory concentrations were then measured for 12 common antimicrobial agents. Resistance to ampicillin and oxytetracycline (8% and 2% of the isolates) was documented in V. cholerae isolates, resistance to ampicillin and oxytetracycline (72% and 3%) was found in V. parahaemolyticus isolates, and resistance to nalidixic acid (20%) was detected in V. vulnificus isolates. β-lactamase and tetracycline resistance genes were detected in the resistant Vibrio isolates. The oxytetracycline-resistance phenotype was eliminated by plasmid curing, suggesting that the resistance was related to R-plasmids. Our results show that shrimps cultured even in low salinity ponds are potentially contaminated with pathogenic Vibrio species, and that shrimp are a vehicle for transfer of species with antimicrobial resistance genes to the public.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVibrio cholerae 3aVibrio parahaemolyticus 3aVibrio vulnificus 3aampicillin 3aantibiotic resistance 3abeta-lactamase 3afarming systems 3afood safety 3agenes 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3analidixic acid 3aoxytetracycline 3aphenotype 3aplasmid curing 3aponds 3asalinity 3ashrimp 3atetracycline 3awater temperature 3aThailand 0aVibrio parahaemolyticus 0aVibrio cholerae 0aVibrio vulnificus 0aShrimp 0aAntimicrobial resistance 0aThailand1 aHamano, Kaoru1 aSatomi, Masataka1 aTsutsui, Isao1 aBan, Masatoshi1 aAue-umneoy, Dusit0 tFood control.g2014 Apr., v. 38 p.30-36dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2013.09.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02770naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245013400168300001600302520114500318592002801463650001701491650002501508650001601533650001601549650001001565650001501575650001501590650002001605650001901625650001001644650001001654650001001664650001401674650001401688650003001702650002401732650001601756651001601772653000901788653002101797653001401818653001901832653001401851653001601865700001801881700001801899700002001917700002501937700001801962700002101980773009502001856008702096852000902183655001202192IND60543023620221122223743.0190408e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054302362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2013.09.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOk, Hyun Ee10aMycobiota and natural occurrence of aflatoxin, deoxynivalenol, nivalenol and zearalenone in rice freshly harvested in South Korea  ap. 284-291.  aThe natural fungal mycobiota and contamination by aflatoxins (AFs), deoxynivalenol (DON), nivalenol (NIV), and zearalenone (ZEN) in rice from six locations (80 farms) in South Korea were surveyed during the harvest year 2010. Mycological analysis indicated that Fusarium was the predominant fungal genera, followed by Penicillium, Phoma, Myrothecium, and Cladosporium spp. Within the genus Fusarium, Fusarium graminearum was found most frequently. Polymerase chain reaction analysis targeting the AFs (aflR, omtB, ver-1 and omtA), DON/NIV (tri4, tri5, tri5–tri6, tri7 and tri13) and ZEN (pks4) biosynthetic genes showed that potential ZEN and NIV producers were the most prevalent. A similar trend was observed for the natural occurrence of all four mycotoxins. In both white and brown rice, ZEN was the main mycotoxin contaminant (range 0.4–95.4μg/kg), followed by NIV; AFs and DON were not prevalent. The present study provides a detailed description of the fungi and natural occurrence of these four mycotoxins in rice at harvest, which may help in understanding the population dynamics and in developing effective control measures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCladosporium 3aFusarium graminearum 3aMyrothecium 3aPenicillium 3aPhoma 3aaflatoxins 3abrown rice 3acontrol methods 3adeoxynivalenol 3afarms 3afungi 3agenes 3amycobiota 3anivalenol 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apopulation dynamics 3azearalenone 3aSouth Korea 0aRice 0aFungal mycobiota 0aAflatoxin 0aDeoxynivalenol 0aNivalenol 0aZearalenone1 aKim, Dong Min1 aKim, Dongchul1 aChung, Soo Hyun1 aChŏng, Myŏng-sŏp,1 aPark, Ki Hwan1 aChun, Hyang Sook0 tFood control.g2014 Mar., v. 37 p.284-291dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2013.09.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02777naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245008400163300001600247500001900263520121100282536011901493592002801612596009801640650001801738650001301756650001701769650002801786650002001814650001101834650001401845650000901859650001801868653002301886653003101909653002801940653003601968653001502004700001602019700001402035700001402049700001702063773013302080856008502213852000902298655001202307IND60692996320221120230115.0200504e20180504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069299632DNAL7 a10.1080/13102818.2018.14373582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Yun10aAssessment of polyglycolic acid scaffolds for periodontal ligament regeneration  ap. 701-706.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPeriodontal tissue engineering is a possible strategy for regeneration of human periodontal ligaments (PDLs) around dental implants.

In our study, PGA scaffolds promoted mRNA expression of collagen type I, collagen type III and fibronectin in PDL cells. Masson's trichrome staining showed that after two weeks, the implants were well vascularised in vivo. Fluorescence microscopy indicated that the newly formed tissues were derived from the GFP-labelled human PDL cells. Our study suggested that the delivery of PDL cells via a non-woven PGA mesh might serve as a viable approach to promote periodontal tissue regeneration.  aThis work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 8140030664].  aPublisher supplied data  a814003066cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/50110000180 3abiotechnology 3acollagen 3afibronectins 3afluorescence microscopy 3agene expression 3ahumans 3aligaments 3amice 3atissue repair 0aTissue engineering 0aperiodontal ligament (PDL) 0apolyglycolic acid (PGA) 0agreen fluorescent protein (GFP) 0amicroscopy1 aXia, Haibin1 aZhang, Bi1 aZhao, Yan1 aWang, Yining0 tBiotechnology, biotechnological equipment.g2018 May 4, v. 32, no. 3 p.701-706dTaylor & FranciswJournal:21365x1314-35307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13102818.2018.14373583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02791naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003000152245020800182300001600390520133000406592002801736650002001764650002801784650002201812650002001834650001901854650001001873650001001883650001101893650004301904650001401947650001401961653000901975653000801984653000901992653000902001653001602010653001502026700002602041700002302067700002102090700001902111773009502130856008702225852000902312655001202321IND60543024220221122234707.0190408e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054302422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2013.09.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarrido-Maestu, Alejandro10aIn-house validation of novel multiplex real-time PCR gene combination for the simultaneous detection of the main human pathogenic vibrios (Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and Vibrio vulnificus)  ap. 371-379.  aIn recent years the incidence of vibriosis has greatly increased, raising the concern among consumers about the innocuity of certain food products. Previous studies demonstrated various advantages of molecular methods, including qPCR, for the screening of food-borne pathogens. The new method developed in the present study allows fast and reliable detection of the main human pathogenic Vibrio species (Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and Vibrio vulnificus). Specificity of the combination of primers and probes was successfully tested against several bacterial species and strains (44 different strains). Evaluation of the qPCR efficiency reported a value of 94% with the simultaneous amplification of the internal amplification control. The evaluation of the quality of the method was based on six parameters: relative sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive and negative predictive values as well as Kappa index of concordance. Each of the values obtained were higher than 96%. Additionally a very low limit of detection was determined for the developed method (less than 10 cfu/25 g). All the parameters of the method analyzed were obtained from the analysis of a wide variety of foodstuffs, water samples and reference material from proficiency tests, and compared against the culture reference method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVibrio cholerae 3aVibrio parahaemolyticus 3aVibrio vulnificus 3adetection limit 3afood pathogens 3afoods 3agenes 3ahumans 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3ascreening 3avibriosis 0aompW 0atlh 0avvhA 0aqPCR 0aVibrio spp. 0aValidation1 aChapela, María-José1 aPeñaranda, Elvira1 aVieites, Juan M.1 aCabado, Ana G.0 tFood control.g2014 Mar., v. 37 p.371-379dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2013.09.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04051naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245015000167300001600317500001900333520153400352536035801886592002802244596009802272596010002370596014302470596005502613650002402668650001802692650001102710650001402721650001402735650002202749650003002771650001402801650000902815650001402824650002702838650002902865650002502894651001002919651001002929651001002939653002602949653002202975653002702997700001403024700001703038700001203055700001703067700001803084700001703102700001503119700001903134700001403153700001803167773013403185856008503319852000903404655001203413IND60692997120221121004956.0200504e20180704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069299712DNAL7 a10.1080/13102818.2018.14388522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Zemao10aAnalysis of genetic diversity and population structure of a worldwide collection of Corchorus olitorius L. germplasm using microsatellite markers  ap. 961-967.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJute (Corchorus spp.) is the second most important global natural fiber crop after cotton. Analyses of the genetic diversity and population structure of the germplasm are useful for improving Corchorus breeding. Recently, limited studies on genetic diversity and population structure in jute have been carried out. In the present study, the genetic diversity and population structure of 453 accessions in Corchorus olitorius L., including cultivars, landraces, genetic materials and wild germplasm, were analyzed using 39 SSR markers. The results showed that C. olitorius populations have moderate genetic diversity with an average gene diversity (hₑ) value of 0.322 and polymorphic information content (PIC) value of 0.270 in all accessions. Regarding the geographic distribution, the average hₑ and PIC values were highest in Kenya (0.332, 0.273), followed by Nepal (0.307, 0.259), and China (0.303, 0.253). Among the different germplasm types, the wild germplasm showed higher genetic diversity with an average hₑ value of 0.362 and PIC value of 0.299. The population structure analysis revealed two populations, Pop1 and Pop2; Pop1 was further divided into three subpopulations, and Pop2 was further divided into two subpopulations. These populations were verified by FST statistics, principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and neighbour-joining trees. This study contributes to the knowledge about levels and distribution of genetic diversity of C. olitorius worldwide and provides clues about the origin of C. olitorius.  aThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 31601351]; National Key Technology Support Program [grant number 2013BAD01B03-13]; Science and Technology Innovation Project of Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences [grant number ASTIP-IBFC01]; Germplasm Resources Protection Project [grant number 2016NWB044].  aPublisher supplied data  a31601351cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a2013BAD01B03-13cNational Key Technology Support Programdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004610  aASTIP-IBFC01cScience and Technology Innovation Project of Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciencesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100005196  a2016NWB044cGermplasm Resources Protection Project 3aCorchorus olitorius 3abiotechnology 3acotton 3acultivars 3aequipment 3agenetic variation 3ageographical distribution 3agermplasm 3ajute 3alandraces 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amultidimensional scaling 3apopulation structure 3aChina 3aKenya 3aNepal 0aCorchorus olitorius L 0agenetic diversity 0amicrosatellite markers1 aLu, Ruike1 aDai, Zhigang1 aYan, An1 aChen, Jiquan1 aBai, Zhanbing1 aXie, Dongwei1 aTang, Qing1 aCheng, Chaohua1 aXu, Ying,1 aSu, Jianguang0 tBiotechnology, biotechnological equipment.g2018 July 4, v. 32, no. 4 p.961-967dTaylor & FranciswJournal:21365x1314-35307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13102818.2018.14388523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03000naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245005800171300001600229520140000245592002801645650002301673650002201696650002301718650001601741650001501757650001701772650001701789650001001806650001701816650001001833650001101843650001001854650001101864650004301875650003301918650001201951650002801963650001301991651001002004653001902014653001602033653001602049653001602065653003302081700001902114700001902133700002002152700002102172700002102193700001702214773009502231856008702326852000902413655001202422IND60543024320221122234606.0190408e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054302432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2013.09.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHammami, Walid10aFungal and aflatoxin contamination of marketed spices  ap. 177-181.  aFourteen spice samples were collected from local markets in Doha, Qatar, during 2012, and were surveyed for the presence of potentially harmful mycoflora and for contamination with aflatoxins B1, B2, G1, and G2 by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Among the tested spice samples, chili powder showed the highest presence of fungal propagules, while ginger, curry and garlic samples did not present any fungal contamination. A total of 120 isolates, mostly belonging to Aspergillus and Penicillium genera, were collected and 33 representative species were identified by amplification and sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus nomius and Aspergillus niger were the most dominant. Thirty-seven Aspergillus strains were screened for their potential to produce aflatoxins using biochemical and molecular tools: only 9 A. flavus strains showed both fluorescence and amplification with all the three primers targeting aflP, aflM and aflR genes. Aflatoxins were detected in five spices (black pepper, chili, tandoori masala. turmeric and garam masala), and with the exception of garam masala, the tested samples of turmeric, black pepper, tandoori masala and chili powder exceeded B1 and/or total aflatoxin maximum levels.

These analyses demonstrated that ‘AnminR1’ and ‘AnminR2’ of Actinidia arguta have significantly higher SSC, TAC and SAR than other Actinidia genotypes, indicating better flavour. The analyses also demonstrated that the antioxidant capacity of Actinidia kolomikta and A. arguta fruits was significantly higher than that of other genotypes (Actinidia chinenesis and Actinidia deliciosa), which was approximately 2.37–5.51 fold higher than A. deliciosa cv. There was extensive variety in the Vc content, SOD activity, TPC and TFC amongst Actinidia genotypes, which significantly correlated with TAC. We determined that significant genotypic differences exist in the biochemical components and TAC of Actinidia fruits. The hardy A. kolomikta and A. arguta genotypes have significantly higher antioxidant capacity than the commercial cultivars of A. chinenesis and A. deliciosa indicating that the hardy Actinida genotypes have more health benefits than the commercial cultivars of Actinidia.  aThis work was supported by the Foundation of Jilin Province Science and Technology Department [grant number 20140101217JC], [grant number 2014GB2B100021] and the Foundation of Jilin Province Education Department [grant number 2013051], [grant number 2015188].  aPublisher supplied data  a20140101217JCa2014GB2B100021cFoundation of Jilin Province Science and Technology Department  a2013051a2015188cFoundation of Jilin Province Education Department 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aActinidia arguta 3aActinidia deliciosa 3aActinidia kolomikta 3aascorbic acid 3abiotechnology 3acultivars 3aequipment 3aflavonoids 3aflavor 3akiwifruit 3aoxygen radical absorbance capacity 3asugar content 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atitratable acidity 3aChina 0aActinidia 0abiochemical components 0aantioxidant capacity1 aZhao, Chun-li1 aLi, Jin-ying1 aLiang, Yun-jiang1 aYang, Rui-qin1 aLiu, Jia-yi1 aMa, Zhi1 aWu, Lin0 tBiotechnology, biotechnological equipment.g2018 May 4, v. 32, no. 3 p.558-565dTaylor & FranciswJournal:21365x1314-35307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13102818.2018.14434003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03451naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002800152245010700180300001600287520213000303592002802433650002502461650001902486650002202505650001902527650002202546650001002568650002702578650001602605650002402621650002002645650001402665653001202679653001302691653001402704653002202718653001802740653001702758700001902775700002002794773009502814856008702909852000902996655001203005IND60543024820221122234550.0190408e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054302482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2013.09.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzales-Barron, Ursula10aConducting inferential statistics for low microbial counts in foods using the Poisson-gamma regression  ap. 385-394.  aMixed Poisson distributions have been shown to be able to represent low microbial counts more efficiently than the lognormal distribution because of its greater flexibility to model microbial clustering even when data consist of a large proportion of zero counts. The objective of this study was to develop an alternative modelling framework for low microbial counts based on heterogeneous Poisson regressions. As an illustration, Poisson-gamma regression models were used to assess the effect of chilling on the concentration of total coliforms from beef carcasses (n = 600) sampled at eight large Irish abattoirs. Three Poisson-gamma and three zero-modified (hurdle and zero-inflated) models were appraised with a series of random-effects variants in order to extract any variability in microbial mean concentration, dispersion and/or proportion of zero counts. Models were compared and validated in their ability to predict the coliforms counts on carcasses after chilling. In all five test batches, the hurdle Poisson-gamma distributions predicted the observed post-chill counts closer than the Poisson-gamma distributions. This is justified by the better capacity of the hurdle model to represent a higher proportion of zero counts, which were in fact observed in the post-chill batches. Thus, with a coded variable (pre-chill/post-chill) as treatment, and extracting the significant variability of batches nested in abattoirs for the coliforms mean concentration (σ2u = 2.68), the dispersion measure (σ2v = 2.39) and the probability of zero counts (σ2w = 0.89), the validated hurdle Poisson-gamma model confirmed that chilling has a decreasing effect on the viability of coliforms from beef carcasses, and that the concentration is reduced by an average (pre-chill to post-chill) factor of 2.2 (95% CI: 2.15–2.24) at batch level. The model also indicated that chilling increases the odds of producing a zero count from a carcass swab in about 13.5 times, and that the higher the coliforms concentration in a batch, the weaker the effect that chilling has to reduce such contamination on the beef carcasses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPoisson distribution 3abeef carcasses 3abiological models 3acold treatment 3acoliform bacteria 3afoods 3alognormal distribution 3aprobability 3aregression analysis 3aslaughterhouses 3aviability 0aCarcass 0aChilling 0aColiforms 0aNegative binomial 0aZero-inflated 0aPlate counts1 aCadavez, Vasco1 aButler, Francis0 tFood control.g2014 Mar., v. 37 p.385-394dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2013.09.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02035naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245007900176300001400255520078700269592002801056650001501084650001401099650001901113650002001132650004301152650001901195650002201214650001601236651001901252653001101271653002401282653001001306653001201316700002601328700002401354700002101378700002501399773009301424856008701517852000901604655001201613IND60543024920221122234617.0190408e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054302492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2013.09.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBěláková, Sylvie14aThe occurrence of the selected fusarium mycotoxins in Czech malting barley  ap. 93-98.  aIn 2008–2011, the occurrence of deoxynivalenol (DON), zearalenone (ZON), T-2 toxin (T-2), and HT-2 toxin (HT-2) was studied in 325 malting barley samples collected from various regions of the Czech Republic.

Twenty-one and twenty selected ISSR and SCoT primers amplified 350 and 329 loci, respectively, of which all were polymorphic. The obtained average polymorphism information content (ISSR, 0.38; SCoT, 0.40), average band informativeness (ISSR, 16.67; SCoT, 16.45) and resolving power (ISSR, 9.75; SCoT, 12.52) revealed high genetic diversity prevailing among Salvia accessions. Considering the ISSR and SCoT data, the species with a basic chromosome number of x = 8 showed higher values of the percentage polymorphism loci (PPL), the number of observed alleles (Na) and Shannon index (I) than the other species. The partition of clusters in the neighbour-joining dendrogram based on ISSR, SCoT and combined data was similar and grouped all individuals into four clusters. However, the dendrogram generated based on SCoT separated the individuals into sub-clusters in accordance with their species and section. The Mantel test revealed a similar polymorphism distribution pattern between ISSR and SCoT techniques, the correlation coefficient (r) was 0.83, and the results showed that both techniques were effective to assess the genetic diversity. Our results indicated that SCoT markers can be used as a reliable and informative technique for evaluation of genetic diversity and relationships among Salvia species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalvia 3abiotechnology 3achromosome number 3aequipment 3agenetic variation 3astart codon 0agenetic diversity 0aISSR 0aSCoT 0apolymorphism1 aPour-Aboughadareh, Alireza1 aNoori, Afsaneh1 aAhmadi-Rad, Amin1 aShooshtari, Lia1 aMahdavian, Zahra1 aYousefiazar-Khanian, Masoumeh0 tBiotechnology, biotechnological equipment.g2018 May 4, v. 32, no. 3 p.610-617dTaylor & FranciswJournal:21365x1314-35307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13102818.2018.14473973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03246naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005500147245016000202300001600362520143300378592002801811596006401839650002101903650001201924650001301936650001601949650001801965650002101983650001902004650001602023650001502039650001302054650002402067650001302091650001202104650002102116650001602137650001202153650002302165650002602188650001302214650001302227650001402240650002002254650001602274700002002290700001602310700001302326700001602339700001202355700001502367700001802382700001402400700002102414773010602435856008202541852000902623655001202632IND60588694220221116162535.0180904e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058869422DNAL7 a10.1007/s00248-017-1017-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Weimin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3456-817712aA Combination of Stable Isotope Probing, Illumina Sequencing, and Co-occurrence Network to Investigate Thermophilic Acetate- and Lactate-Utilizing Bacteria  ap. 113-122.  aAnaerobic digestion is a complicated microbiological process that involves a wide diversity of microorganisms. Acetate is one of the most important intermediates, and interactions between acetate-oxidizing bacteria and archaea could play an important role in the formation of methane in anoxic environments. Anaerobic digestion at thermophilic temperatures is known to increase methane production, but the effects on the microbial community are largely unknown. In the current study, stable isotope probing was used to characterize acetate- and lactate-oxidizing bacteria in thermophilic anaerobic digestion. In microcosms fed ¹³C-acetate, bacteria related to members of Clostridium, Hydrogenophaga, Fervidobacterium, Spirochaeta, Limnohabitans, and Rhodococcus demonstrated elevated abundances of ¹³C-DNA fractions, suggesting their activities in acetate oxidation. In the treatments fed ¹³C-lactate, Anaeromyxobacter, Desulfobulbus, Syntrophus, Cystobacterineae, and Azospira were found to be the potential thermophilic lactate utilizers. PICRUSt predicted that enzymes related to nitrate and nitrite reduction would be enriched in ¹³C-DNA fractions, suggesting that the acetate and lactate oxidation may be coupled with nitrate and/or nitrite reduction. Co-occurrence network analysis indicated bacterial taxa not enriched in ¹³C-DNA fractions that may also play a critical role in thermophilic anaerobic digestion.  aPublisher supplied data  aLY12C01003cNatural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province 3aAnaeromyxobacter 3aArchaea 3aAzospira 3aClostridium 3aDesulfobulbus 3aFervidobacterium 3aHydrogenophaga 3aSpirochaeta 3aSyntrophus 3aacetates 3aanaerobic digestion 3abacteria 3aenzymes 3aisotope labeling 3alactic acid 3amethane 3amethane production 3amicrobial communities 3anitrates 3anitrites 3aoxidation 3astable isotopes 3atemperature1 aKrumins, Valdis1 aDong, Yiran1 aGao, Pin1 aMa, Chunyan1 aHu, Min1 aLi, Baoqin1 aXia, Bingqing1 aHe, Zijun1 aXiong, Shangling0 tMicrobial ecology.g2018 Jan., v. 75, no. 1 p.113-122dSpringer USwJournal:jnl46274x0095-36287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-017-1017-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03839naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245006800169300001600237500001900253520196800272536009002240592002802330596007902358650001302437650001802450650001402468650001102482650001102493650001402504650001402518650001402532650000902546650001102555650002602566650001402592650001402606650000902620650002302629650000802652651001302660653003202673653003202705653004302737653002002780653002502800700002002825700002002845700002002865700002402885700002502909700001902934700002102953700002402974773013302998856008503131852000903216655001203225IND60692998820221121004757.0200504e20180504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069299882DNAL7 a10.1080/13102818.2018.14501632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLyapina, Maya10aContact sensitization to metals in dental exposures in Bulgaria  ap. 707-713.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence of contact sensitization to metals used in dental practice among students of dental medicine, students from a dental technician school, dental professionals and patients. A total of 128 participants: 28 dental professionals, 40 students of dental medicine, 38 students from a dental technician school and 22 patients without occupational exposure to metals, were patch tested with potassium dichromate, cobalt(II)chloride hexahydrate, copper(II)sulfate pentahydrate, palladium(II)chloride, aluminium(III)chloride hexahydrate, gold(I)sodium thiosulfate dehydrate, tin and nickel(II)sulfate hexahydrate. The main metal allergens for students of dental medicine were cobalt(II)chloride hexahydrate, gold(I)sodium thiosulfate dehydrate, nickel(II)sulfate hexahydrate and potassium dichromate; for students from the dental technician school – cobalt(II)chloride hexahydrate, nickel(II)sulfate hexahydrate and gold(I)sodium thiosulfate dehydrate; for dental professionals – cobalt(II)chloride hexahydrate, palladium(II)chloride and nickel(II)sulfate hexahydrate, and for dental patients – cobalt(II)chloride hexahydrate, nickel(II)sulfate hexahydrate and copper(II)sulfate pentahydrate. There was a significantly higher incidence of sensitization to potassium dichromate (χ² = 10.497, p = 0.012), palladium(II)chloride (χ² = 5.381, p = 0.02) and gold(I)sodium thiosulfate dehydrate (χ² = 6.347, p = 0.018) in the group of students of dental medicine. Our findings confirm the importance of cobalt(II)chloride hexahydrate as contact sensitizer for all the studied groups. Students of dental medicine could be defined as a group of particular risk of contact sensitization with metals. We recommend that knowledge on the sensitizing properties of metals be provided at the very beginning of the course of practical education in dentistry, together with application of adequate preventive measures.  aThis study was supported by The Medical University of Sofia [grant number 5-С/2016].  aPublisher supplied data  a5-С/2016cMedical University of Sofiadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100009086 3aaluminum 3abiotechnology 3achlorides 3acobalt 3acopper 3adentistry 3aeducation 3aequipment 3agold 3anickel 3aoccupational exposure 3apalladium 3apotassium 3arisk 3asodium thiosulfate 3atin 3aBulgaria 0aMetal contact sensitization 0astudents of dental medicine 0astudents from dental technician school 0adental patients 0adental professionals1 aDencheva, Maria1 aKrasteva, Assya1 aCekova, Mariana1 aDeliverska, Mariela1 aVodenicharov, Vlayko1 aMarkov, Daniel1 aMitova, Yordanka1 aKisselova, Angelina0 tBiotechnology, biotechnological equipment.g2018 May 4, v. 32, no. 3 p.707-713dTaylor & FranciswJournal:21365x1314-35307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13102818.2018.14501633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03674naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245019300166300001600359500001900375520112000394536038701514592002801901596004401929596007401973596004802047596016502095650002602260650002902286650001802315650001402333650001402347650002002361650001402381650001702395650001002412650002202422650000702444650001502451650001902466650001802485650002302503650001802526650001502544653002002559653002002579653002102599653003802620700001602658700001502674700001602689700001502705700001602720700001102736700001802747700001602765700001502781773013402796856008502930852000903015655001203024IND60692999420221121025540.0200504e20180704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069299942DNAL7 a10.1080/13102818.2018.14555362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yihan10aCloning, expression and characterisation of phospholipase B from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and its application in the synthesis of l-alpha-glycerylphosphorylcholine and peanut oil degumming  ap. 968-973.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  al-alpha-glycerylphosphorylcholine (GPC) has been shown to enhance cognitive performance. Meanwhile, vegetable oils must be refined to remove the impurities for them to be edible. Phospholipase B (PLB), having the ability of hydrolyzing both the sn-1 and sn-2 acyl ester bonds of phospholipids, can produce GPC using PC as substrate and transform the non-hydratable phospholipids into their hydratable forms. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae plb gene, which encodes PLB, was cloned and expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115 to produce recombinant PLB (rPLB). Fermentation optimisation yielded rPLB activity levels as high as 1723 U/mL. rPLB demonstrated maximum enzymatic activity at 40 °C and pH 5.5 and was stable at temperatures between 30 and 40 °C and pH values between 5.0 and 6.0. rPLB synthesised GPC with a conversion rate of 17% (w/w) and exhibited high degumming activity towards peanut oil, decreasing the phosphorus content from 91.8 to 3.7 mg/kg within 3 h. This study describes a candidate phospholipase for potential applications involving the modification of phospholipids and vegetable oil degumming.  aThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Fund [grant number 31571805]; the Tianjin Support Plan Program of Science and Technology [grant number 16YFZCSY01040]; the Tianjin Natural Science Fund [grant number 17JCYBJC23700]; and the Innovation and Enterprise Training Program of Undergraduate of Tianjin University of Science and Technology [grant number 201610057003].  aPublisher supplied data  a31571805cNational Natural Science Fund  a16YFZCSY01040cTianjin Support Plan Program of Science and Technology  a17JCYBJC23700cTianjin Natural Science Fund  a201610057003cInnovation and Enterprise Training Program of Undergraduate of Tianjin University of Science and Technologydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004712 3aKomagataella pastoris 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3abiotechnology 3acognition 3adegumming 3aenzyme activity 3aequipment 3afermentation 3agenes 3alysophospholipase 3apH 3apeanut oil 3aphospholipases 3aphospholipids 3aphosphorus content 3avegetable oil 3avegetables 0aPhospholipase B 0aPichia pastoris 0acharacterisation 0al-alpha-glycerylphosphorylcholine1 aLi, Mingjie1 aHuang, Lin1 aGui, Shuang1 aJia, Leibo1 aZheng, Dong1 aFu, Yu1 aZhang, Yutong1 aRui, Jinqiu1 aLu, Fuping0 tBiotechnology, biotechnological equipment.g2018 July 4, v. 32, no. 4 p.968-973dTaylor & FranciswJournal:21365x1314-35307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13102818.2018.14555363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04417naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245016100168300001600329520270400345592002803049650002603077650001403103650002203117650001903139650002403158650001903182650002203201650002203223650001303245650001203258650000903270650001903279650002803298650001403326650002003340650001503360650001203375650002103387650002003408651001103428653002603439653002103465653000803486653001503494653002403509653001203533700002303545700001603568700001803584700001403602700002003616773009503636856008703731852000903818655001203827IND60543026720221123012521.0190408e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054302672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2013.09.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolvoet, K.10aQuantitative study of cross-contamination with Escherichia coli, E. coli O157, MS2 phage and murine norovirus in a simulated fresh-cut lettuce wash process  ap. 218-227.  aThe water management in fresh-cut produce processing is an important factor affecting the microbial quality and safety of fresh-cut produce. For this study, a commercial lettuce washing process was simulated using two subsequent washing baths (WB). The worst case scenario, when no sanitizers are used and still common in some European countries, was investigated to fully understand the potential for cross-contamination and to obtain baseline data for further risk assessment. The two cross-contamination processes (from lettuce to water and from water to lettuce) were included in the simulation study and the transfer of Escherichia coli, E. coli O157, MS2 phage and murine norovirus was quantified. The mean reduction of initially contaminated lettuce through the washing in two successive WB was limited: 0.3 ± 0.1 log CFU E. coli/g after washing in WB1 and an additional reduction of 0.2 ± 0.1 log after WB2. The microbial load of the water in the washing baths, initially starting off with potable water, increased rapidly during the washing process of the contaminated lettuce. Furthermore to quantify the transfer of the four implicated micro-organisms from contaminated water to the lettuce, the first washing bath was inoculated with either approximately 3.0, 4.0 and 5.0 log CFU E. coli/100 ml or 4.8, 5.6 or 6.7 log CFU E. coli O157/100 ml, 4.0, 5.1 or 6.5 log PFU MS2 phages/100 ml or 6.5 log PFU/100 ml norovirus surrogate MNV-1. The contamination of the subsequently washed lettuce portions resulted in levels of ca. 1.0 up to 1.9 log CFU E. coli/g after passing the two washing steps. In addition, after a rapid initial increase, due to spill over of water from WB 1 to WB2, the contamination of WB2 further augmented during the washing process to approximately 1.0 to 0.5 log below the inoculation level of WB1. Transfer of E. coli O157, MS2 phages or MNV-1 from the water to the lettuce was respectively 0.9% ± 0.3%, 0.5% ± 0.2% and 0.5 ± 0.1% after WB1 and resulted in a contamination level for the highest inoculum level of WB1 of respectively ca. 2.9 ± 0.1 log CFU/g, 3.7 ± 0.1 log PFU/g and 4.4 ± 0.1 log PFU/g lettuce. The quantitative data of lettuce contamination and transfers established in this study further highlight the vulnerability of fresh produce to cross-contamination during the washing stage and stresses that notwithstanding the use of initial potable water and partial refreshment of water but without the use of sanitizers, microbial pathogens (or indicator organisms) may easily be introduced and reside for prolonged periods in washing baths enabling cross-contamination to the final fresh-cut product.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aNorovirus 3aPistia stratiotes 3abacteriophages 3across contamination 3adrinking water 3afresh-cut produce 3aindicator species 3ainoculum 3alettuce 3amice 3amicrobial load 3amicrobiological quality 3apathogens 3arisk assessment 3asanitizers 3awashing 3awater management 3awater pollution 3aEurope 0aEscherichia coli O157 0aMurine norovirus 0aMS2 0aWash water 0aCross-contamination 0aLettuce1 aDe Keuckelaere, A.1 aSampers, I.1 aVan Haute, S.1 aStals, A.1 aUyttendaele, M.0 tFood control.g2014 Mar., v. 37 p.218-227dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2013.09.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02530naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003500147245008400182300001600266500001500282520127800297592002801575650001401603650000901617650001301626650003001639650002901669650001901698650001301717650001701730650001501747650000901762650001001771650001701781650001301798653001401811700002401825700002701849700002301876773010601899856008202005852000902087655001202096IND60588695220221116162420.0180619e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058869522DNAL7 a10.1007/s00248-017-1059-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDias, ArmandoCavalcante Franco14aThe parA Region of Broad-Host-Range PromA Plasmids Is a Carrier of Mobile Genes  ap. 479-486.  a2019-12-06  aThe ecological competences in microbiomes are driven by the adaptive capabilities present within microbiome members. Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) promoted by plasmids provides a rapid adaptive strategy to microbiomes, an interesting feature considering the constantly changing conditions in most environments. This study examined the parA locus, found in the highly promiscuous PromA class of plasmids, as the insertion site for incoming genes. A novel PCR system was designed that enabled examining insertions into this locus. Microbiomes of mangrove sediments, salt marsh, mycosphere, and bulk soil revealed habitat-specific sets of insertions in this plasmid region. Furthermore, such habitats could be differentiated based on patterns of parA-inserted genes, and the genes carried by these plasmids. Thus, a suite of dioxygenase-related genes and transposase elements were found in oil-affected mangroves, whereas genes involved in nitrogen and carbon cycling were detected in salt marsh and soils. All genes detected could be associated with capabilities of members of the microbiome to adapt to and survive in each habitat. The methodology developed in this work was effective, sensitive, and practical, allowing detection of mobilized genes between microorganisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3asediments 3aloci 3anitrogen 3apolymerase chain reaction 3ahorizontal gene transfer 3amicroorganisms 3aplasmids 3acarbon cycle 3amicrobiome 3asoil 3agenes 3asalt marshes 3ahabitats 0amangroves1 aCotta, SimoneRaposo1 aAndreote, FernandoDini1 avan Elsas, JanDirk0 tMicrobial ecology.g2018 Feb., v. 75, no. 2 p.479-486dSpringer USwJournal:jnl46274x0095-36287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-017-1059-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03142naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245017700173300001600350520182200366592002802188650002202216650001502238650001202253650002602265650001602291650002402307650001502331650004202346650002102388650001302409650001402422650001902436650001802455650002202473650001602495700002402511773010602535856008202641852000902723655001202732IND60588695320221116162434.0180619e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058869532DNAL7 a10.1007/s00248-017-1026-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVieira, FabricioRocha13aAn Exploration into the Bacterial Community under Different Pasteurization Conditions during Substrate Preparation (Composting–Phase II) for Agaricus bisporus Cultivation  ap. 318-330.  aSubstrate preparation (i.e., composting) for Agaricus bisporus cultivation is the most critical point of mushroom production. Among many factors involved in the composting process, the microbial ecology of the system is the underlying drive of composting and can be influenced by composting management techniques. Pasteurization temperature at the beginning of phase II, in theory, may influence the bacterial community and subsequently the “selectivity” and nutrition of the final substrate. Therefore, this hypothesis was tested by simulation in bioreactors under different pasteurization conditions (57 °C/6 h, 60 °C/2 h, and 68 °C/2 h), simulating conditions adopted by many producers. Bacterial diversity, based on 16S ribosomal RNA obtained by high-throughput sequencing and classified in operational taxonomic units (OTUs), was greater than previously reported using culture-dependent methods. Alpha diversity estimators show a lower diversity of OTUs under a high-temperature pasteurization condition. Bacillales order shows a relatively higher OTU abundance under a high-pasteurization temperature, which also was related to high ammonia emission measurements. On the other hand, beta diversity analysis showed no significantly changes in the bacterial community structure under different conditions. Agaricus bisporus mycelium growth during a standard spawn run period was significantly slower in the compost pasteurized at high temperature. Since the bacterial community structure was not greatly affected by different pasteurization conditions but by-products left (e.g., ammonia) at the end of compost conditioning varied, further studies need to be conducted to determine the functional role of the microbial communities found during substrate preparation for Agaricus bisporus cultivation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgaricus bisporus 3aBacillales 3aammonia 3abacterial communities 3abioreactors 3acommunity structure 3acomposting 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3amushroom growing 3amycelium 3anutrition 3apasteurization 3aribosomal RNA 3aspecies diversity 3atemperature1 aPecchia, JohnAndrew0 tMicrobial ecology.g2018 Feb., v. 75, no. 2 p.318-330dSpringer USwJournal:jnl46274x0095-36287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-017-1026-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03061naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100006100188245014600249300001600395506007600411520170100487592002802188506003702216650001302253650002102266650001202287650001302299650001302312650003202325650002002357650002002377650001602397650002502413700002802438773010602466856008202572852000902654655001202663IND60588695720221207063116.0180619e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058869572DNAL7 a10.1007/s00248-017-1060-52doi7 aPMC57426072pmcid7 a289635772pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFiałkowska, Edyta1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6330-478710aTemperature-Dependence of Predator-Prey Dynamics in Interactions Between the Predatory Fungus Lecophagus sp. and Its Prey L. inermis Rotifers  ap. 400-406.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTemperature is considered an important factor that influences the bottom-up and top-down control in water habitats. We examined the influence of temperature on specific predatory-prey dynamics in the following two-level trophic system: the predatory fungus Lecophagus sp. and its prey Lecane inermis rotifers, both of which originated from activated sludge obtained from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The experiments investigating the ability of conidia to trap rotifers and the growth of fungal mycelium were performed in a temperature range that is similar to that in WWTPs in temperate climate. At 20 °C, 80% of the conidia trapped the prey during the first 24 h, whereas at 8 °C, no conidium was successful. The mycelium growth rate was the highest at 20 °C (r = 1.44) during the first 48 h but decreased during the following 24 h (r = 0.98), suggesting the quickest use of resources. At a medium temperature of 15 °C, the tendency was opposite, and the r value was lower during the first 48 h. At 8 °C, the growth rate was very low and remained at the same level even though numerous active rotifers were potentially available for the fungus. The temperature also influences the production of new conidia; on the 7th day, new conidia were observed in 96% of the wells at 20 °C, but no new conidia were observed at 8°C. These results show that the prey (rotifers)-predator (Lecophagus) dynamics in WWTPs is temperature-dependent, and a temperature of 8 °C is a strongly limiting factor for the fungus. Moderate temperatures ensure the most stable coexistence of the fungus and its prey, whereas the highest temperature can promote the prevalence of the predator.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRotifera 3aactivated sludge 3aconidia 3ahabitats 3amycelium 3apredator-prey relationships 3apredatory fungi 3atemperate zones 3atemperature 3awastewater treatment1 aPajdak-Stós, Agnieszka0 tMicrobial ecology.g2018 Feb., v. 75, no. 2 p.400-406dSpringer USwJournal:jnl46274x0095-36287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-017-1060-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02655naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245016700174300001700341500001900358520129100377592002801668650001801696650002001714650001401734650001301748650001401761650004301775650001501818653003201833653001701865653003901882700001801921700001901939700001901958700002201977700001701999773013502016856008502151852000902236655001202245IND60693000320221119203517.0200504e20180704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069300032DNAL7 a10.1080/13102818.2018.14666622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErkose Genc, Gonca10aEvaluation of FluoroType MTB for direct detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and GenoType MTBDRplus for determining rifampicin and isoniazid resistance  ap. 999-1004.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn recent years, several molecular methods have been introduced for diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC), and detecting the drug resistance in clinical specimens. The FluoroType MTB (FT MTB) assay uses real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect MTBC in clinical specimens. GenoType MTBDRplus is a line probe assay which detects MTBC, as well as rifampicin, and isoniazid resistance. In this study, the diagnostic performances of FT MTB and GenoType MTBDRplus were evaluated. In total, 247 specimens (124 respiratory, 123 non-respiratory) were analyzed comparing mycobacterial growth methods and FT MTB. GenoType MTBDRplus was used for the specimens positive for MTBC. In all, 23 (9.3%) of 247 specimens were positive for both the culture and FT MTB assay; therefore, the GenoType MTBDRplus assay was performed on 23 clinical specimens. The results were concordant with the drug susceptibility test results. The FT MTB assay provided quick and reliable direct detection of MTBC from the clinical specimens with high sensitivity (95.8%) and specificity (100%). Although the performance of GenoType MTBDRplus was problematic in clinical specimens with mycobacterial levels below the detection limits of the assay, it was a reliable test for cultivated specimens.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiotechnology 3adrug resistance 3aequipment 3agenotype 3aisoniazid 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arifampicin 0adrug susceptibility testing 0amycobacteria 0aMycobacterium tuberculosis complex1 aSatana, Dilek1 aYildirim, Esra1 aErturan, Zayre1 aYegenoglu, Yildiz1 aUzun, Meltem0 tBiotechnology, biotechnological equipment.g2018 July 4, v. 32, no. 4 p.999-1004dTaylor & FranciswJournal:21365x1314-35307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13102818.2018.14666623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04549naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245018400169300001600353500001900369520173500388536042802123592002802551596009702579596012702676596011002803596005402913650001602967650001702983650001803000650002803018650002003046650001403066650001303080650002003093650001003113650001203123650004403135650001103179650002303190650002003213650004303233650001303276650001103289650001203300650002103312650003103333653001203364653002603376653001203402653001903414700001603433700001803449700001603467700001603483700001603499700001403515700001403529700002203543700001403565700001703579700001503596773013403611856008503745852000903830655001203839IND60693000420221119203353.0200504e20180704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069300042DNAL7 a10.1080/13102818.2018.14694312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Feibing10aOverexpression of GmSnRK1, a soybean sucrose non-fermenting-1 related protein kinase 1 gene, results in directional alteration of carbohydrate metabolism in transgenic Arabidopsis  ap. 835-845.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSucrose non-fermenting-1-related protein kinase 1 (SnRK1) plays an important role in plant carbohydrate metabolism and starch biosynthesis. The regulatory role of GmSnRK1 from soybean in regulating carbohydrate metabolism and starch accumulation has not been reported. In the present study, a gene encoding the SnRK1 protein, named GmSnRK1, was successfully isolated from soybean, and the functions of this gene were studied. Subcellular localisation analysis in onion epidermal cells indicated that GmSnRK1 protein was localised to the nucleus. The GmSnRK1 gene was introduced into Arabidopsis to obtain transgenic plants. Its overexpression significantly increased the starch content, as well as the sucrose, glucose and fructose content in the transgenic plants compared to the wild-type (WT). Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis showed that overexpression of GmSnRK1 up-regulated the genes involved in starch biosynthesis, including sucrose synthase (AtSUS), phosphoglucomutase (AtPGM), ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AtAGPase), granule-bound starch synthases (AtGBSS I and AtGBSS II), soluble starch synthases (AtSSS I, AtSSS II, AtSSS III and AtSSS IV) and starch branching enzymes (AtSBE I and AtSBE II) genes. In contrast, the expression of sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) gene was decreased in the transgenic plants. Meanwhile, the enzyme activity levels of the five starch biosynthetic enzymes (SUS, AGPase, GBSS, SSS and SBE) exhibited higher activities, while the SPS activity was decreased in the transgenic plants compared to WT. These results suggest that the manipulation of GmSnRK1 expression might be used for improving the starch content in engineered plants for biofuel production.  aThis work was supported by the Natural Science Fund for Colleges and Universities in Jiangsu Province of China under [grant number 17KJB210001], the Talent Introduction Research Project of Huaiyin Institute of Technology under [grant number Z301B16534], the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province of China under [grant number BK2013256] and the National Spark Plan Project of China under [grant number 2014GA69002].  aPublisher supplied data  a17KJB210001cNatural Science Fund for Colleges and Universities in Jiangsu Province of China  aZ301B16534cTalent Introduction Research Project of Huaiyin Institute of Technologydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100009074  aBK2013256cNatural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004608  a2014GA69002cNational Spark Plan Project of China 3aArabidopsis 3abiosynthesis 3abiotechnology 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3aenzyme activity 3aequipment 3afructose 3afuel production 3agenes 3aglucose 3aglucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase 3aonions 3aphosphoglucomutase 3aprotein kinases 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asoybeans 3astarch 3asucrose 3asucrose synthase 3asucrose-phosphate synthase 0aGmSnRK1 0asoluble sugar content 0asoybean 0astarch content1 aRen, Gaolei1 aLi, Fengsheng1 aWang, Bowen1 aYang, Yulin1 aMa, Xiaowei1 aNiu, Yuan1 aYe, Yuxiu1 aChen, Shin-horng,1 aFan, Song1 aWang, Tailin1 aZhou, Qing0 tBiotechnology, biotechnological equipment.g2018 July 4, v. 32, no. 4 p.835-845dTaylor & FranciswJournal:21365x1310-28187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13102818.2018.14694313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03549naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245019100171300001600362500001900378520169200397536019002089592002802279596010402307596006802411650001802479650001402497650001702511650001702528650002302545650001302568650000902581650002602590650001702616653000902633653002402642653002302666653002702689653001302716653001902729653002902748700001702777700001702794700001602811773013402827856008502961852000903046655001203055IND60693001320221119203454.0200504e20180704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069300132DNAL7 a10.1080/13102818.2018.14752542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuan, Chongling10aCombination of ¹³¹I-anti-endoglin monoclonal antibody and 5-fluorouracil may be a promising combined-modality radioimmunotherapy strategy for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma  ap. 974-981.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe present study aimed to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of combined radioimmunoconjugate ¹³¹I endoglin (ENG) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in mouse model with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCC tumour SMMC7721-GFP xenograft-bearing mice were established and divided into four groups: control group, 5-FU group, ¹³¹I-anti-ENG McAb group, and 5-FU and ¹³¹I-anti-ENG McAb combination group. 5-FU or ¹³¹I-anti-ENG McAb was intraperitoneally injected from Monday to Friday with a therapy break on Saturday and Sunday. So was the combination therapy with 5-FU and ¹³¹I-anti-ENG McAb. ¹³¹I-anti-ENG McAb and¹³¹I-IgG were prepared, and their biodistribution was studied. Noninvasive fluorescence imaging, tumour volume and tumour weight were measured. High expression levels of ENG in HCC tissues were confirmed by whole-body phosphor-autoradiography. Whole-body phosphor-autoradiography also showed higher tumour uptake for ¹³¹I-anti-ENG McAb compared with ¹³¹I-IgG. Biodistribution studies indicated higher tumour accumulation and better T/NT (6.44 ± 1.01) of ¹³¹I-anti-ENG McAb. Noninvasive fluorescence imaging revealed significant tumour growth suppression in the ¹³¹I-anti-ENG McAb and 5-FU combination therapy group based on reduced fluorescent signals. After treatment with ¹³¹I-anti-ENG McAb and 5-FU, the tumour volume and tumour weight were all decreased. The tumour growth inhibition rate was up to 77.1 ± 4.06% in the ¹³¹I-anti-ENG McAb and 5-FU combination therapy group. The present study demonstrated that the combination of ¹³¹I-anti-ENG McAb and 5-FU may be a promising combined-modality radioimmunotherapy strategy for HCC.  aThis work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province [grant number ZR2012HM031], Science and Technology Project of Shandong, China [grant number 2013GSF11843].  aPublisher supplied data  aZR2012HM031cNatural Science Foundation of Shandong Provincedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100007129  a2013GSF11843cScience and Technology Project of Shandong, China 3abiotechnology 3aequipment 3afluorescence 3afluorouracil 3agrowth retardation 3ahepatoma 3amice 3amonoclonal antibodies 3atherapeutics 0a131I 0acombination therapy 0aradioimmunotherapy 0aantiangiogenic therapy 0aendgolin 0a5-fluorouracil 0ahepatocellular carcinoma1 aLi, Yanxiang1 aYang, Weifei1 aZhang, Chao0 tBiotechnology, biotechnological equipment.g2018 July 4, v. 32, no. 4 p.974-981dTaylor & FranciswJournal:21365x1314-35307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13102818.2018.14752543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02524naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245008200170300001400252520104600266592002801312650001701340650001701357650001701374650001701391650001901408650001701427650004301444650001201487650001501499651002101514653001501535653001401550653001401564653001501578653001101593653001301604653000901617653000901626653000901635653000901644653000801653653000801661653001301669653000801682653000801690653000801698653000801706653000801714700001701722700001801739773009301757856008701850852000901937655001201946IND60543028420221121231928.0190408e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054302842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2013.10.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHepsag, Fatma10aQuantitation of aflatoxins in pistachios and groundnuts using HPLC-FLD method  ap. 75-81.  aIn this study, a sensitive high performance liquid chromatography coupled to a fluorescence detector (HPLC-FLD) method after post-column derivatisation was applied for the presence of aflatoxins (AFs) in 151 pistachios and 151 groundnuts from Turkey.

Macro analysis was performed on the rate of DDD utilisation of COPD medicines, time of their inclusion in the reimbursement lists and the number of hospitalizations. On a micro level, a study of 426 patients with COPD was conducted to investigate the exacerbation and hospitalization rate relative to pharmacotherapy. A regression model, descriptive analysis, and Kruskal–Wallis non-parametric analysis were conducted. New drugs enter the market relatively quickly but are slow to be introduced into prescribing practices. The medicines’ utilization in Bulgaria has increased from 20 to 21 million DDD for all therapeutic groups, especially for long-acting beta-agonists/long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LABA/LAMA) fixed-dose combinations. A marked increase in hospitalization rates was observed despite lower numbers of registered and monitored COPD patients nationally. However, the hospitalization rates due to exacerbations remained around 18–19%. Variation was observed in the number of hospitalizations for the studied period: increasing during the period 2013–2014 and decreasing over the following two years. This trend was also observed for the number of health insured COPD patients. The hospitalization costs increased from 5.2 to 5.7 million BGN. A statistically significant decrease in the number of hospitalizations for LAMA/LABA patients vs. LABA/inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) patients was observed. Overall, frequent hospitalizations increased the total cost of COPD therapy. Patients on new medicines with improved inhaler devices seem to suffer fewer hospitalizations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadrenal cortex hormones 3abiotechnology 3adrug therapy 3aequipment 3ahealth services 3amarkets 3aregression analysis 3arespiratory tract diseases 3aBulgaria 0acost 0aCOPD 0anew COPD medicines 0ahospitalizations1 aDimitrova, Marii︠a︡c(Professor in Social Philosophy)1 aMitov, Konstantin1 aSavova, Alexandra1 aKamusheva, Maria1 aDimitrov, Ĭordan,1 aManova, Manoela1 aGrekova, Daniela1 aPetkova, Valentina0 tBiotechnology, biotechnological equipment.g2019 Jan. 1, v. 33, no. 1 p.1-11dTaylor & FranciswJournal:21365x1314-35307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13102818.2018.14837393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03010naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245012300167300001600290520147600306592002801782650002501810650001601835650002001851650002301871650001801894650002101912650001401933650001401947650001501961650002701976650001802003650002002021650001302041650001002054650002002064650001402084650001002098650001302108650001102121700001902132700002002151700001802171700002202189700005902211773014302270856008202413852000902495655001202504IND60588697620221116162409.0180619e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058869762DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-017-8579-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan Hoang, Vinh10aNisin-induced expression of recombinant T cell epitopes of major Japanese cedar pollen allergens in Lactococcus lactis  ap. 261-268.  aJapanese cedar pollinosis is a seasonal allergic disease caused by two major pollen allergens: Cry j 1 and Cry j 2 antigens. To develop an oral vaccine to treat pollinosis, we constructed recombinant Lactococcus lactis harboring the gene encoding fused T cell epitopes from the Cry j 1 and Cry j 2 antigens. The recombinant T cell epitope peptide was designed to contain the fused cholera toxin B subunit as an adjuvant and a FLAG tag at the C-terminus. An expression plasmid was constructed by inserting the T cell epitope peptide gene into the multiple cloning sites of plasmid pNZ8148, an Escherichia coli-L. lactis shuttle vector. The constructed plasmid was transformed into L. lactis NZ9000 for expression induced by nisin, an antibacterial peptide from L. lactis. The expression of the epitope peptide was induced with 10–40 ng/mL nisin, and the expressed T cell epitope peptide was detected by western blot analysis using an anti-FLAG antibody and an antibody against the T cell epitopes. The concentration of the epitope peptide was estimated to be ~ 22 mg/L of culture in the presence of 40 ng/mL nisin, although it varied depending on the nisin concentration, the culture time, and the bacterial concentration when nisin was added. The expression of the recombinant epitope peptide in L. lactis, an organism generally recognized as safe, as demonstrated in this study, may contribute to the development of an oral vaccine for the treatment of pollinosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryptomeria japonica 3aEscherichia 3aGRAS substances 3aLactococcus lactis 3aT-lymphocytes 3aWestern blotting 3aadjuvants 3aallergens 3aantibodies 3aantimicrobial peptides 3acholera toxin 3aedible vaccines 3aepitopes 3agenes 3agenetic vectors 3ahay fever 3anisin 3aplasmids 3apollen1 aOchi, Takahumi1 aKurata, Kentaro1 aArita, Yutaka1 aOgasahara, Yusuke1 aEnomoto, Keiichi1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4563-45390 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2018 Jan., v. 102, no. 1 p.261-268dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-017-8579-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02972naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245015700162300001600319520167900335592002802014650002302042650001702065650001202082650001702094650001702111650001702128650001802145650002002163650003102183650001002214650001302224650002002237700001202257700001502269700005602284773014302340856008202483852000902565655001202574IND60588697820221116162725.0180619e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058869782DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-017-8576-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Gong10aVariations in Monascus pigment characteristics and biosynthetic gene expression using resting cell culture systems combined with extractive fermentation  ap. 117-126.  aMonascus pigments are promising sources of natural food colorants, and their productivity can be improved by a novel extractive fermentation technology. In this study, we investigated the variations in pigment characteristics and biosynthetic gene expression levels in resting cell culture systems combined with extractive fermentation in Monascus anka GIM 3.592. Although the biomass was low at about 6 g/L DCW, high pigment titer of approximately 130 AU₄₇₀ was obtained in the resting culture with cells from extractive fermentation, illustrating that it had a good biocatalytic activity for pigment synthesis. The oxidation–reduction potential value correlated with the rate of relative content of the intracellular orange pigments to the yellow pigments (O/Y, r > 0.90, p < 0.05), indicating that the change in pigment characteristics may be responsible for the cellular redox activity. The up- or down-regulation of the pigment biosynthetic genes (MpFasA2, MpFasB2, MpPKS5, mppD, mppB, mppR1, and mppR2) in the resting culture with extractive culture cells was demonstrated by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. Moreover, the mppE gene associated with the yellow pigment biosynthesis was significantly (p < 0.05) down-regulated by about 18.6%, whereas the mppC gene corresponding to orange pigment biosynthesis was significantly (p < 0.05) up-regulated by approximately 21.0%. These findings indicated that extractive fermentation was beneficial for the biosynthesis of the intracellular orange pigment. The mechanism described in this study proposes a potential method for the highly efficient production of Monascus pigments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonascus purpureus 3abiocatalysis 3abiomass 3abiosynthesis 3acell culture 3afermentation 3afood coloring 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3apigments 3aredox potential1 aBei, Qi1 aHuang, Tao1 aWu, Zhenqiang1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8531-48980 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2018 Jan., v. 102, no. 1 p.117-126dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-017-8576-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04040naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245010000181300001400281500001900295520180900314536016002123592002802283596006302311650002702374650002602401650001902427650002502446650001902471650001602490650001202506650002302518650001802541650001202559650001402571650002302585650001602608650002802624650001002652650002102662650001202683650001302695650001202708650001402720650001602734650004402750650001402794650002002808650002502828650001102853650001402864650001302878650001102891650001102902651002102913651001502934653002102949653000802970653002502978700002603003700002103029700002103050700002103071773013203092856008503224852000903309655001203318IND60693002720221119204005.0200504e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069300272DNAL7 a10.1080/13102818.2018.14902012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRusinova-Videva, Snezhana10aMetabolic profiling of Antarctic yeasts by proton nuclear magnetic resonance-based spectroscopy  ap. 12-19.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe continent of Antarctica, as a combination of constantly low temperatures, strong winds, short summer season, and high solar radiation, is a highly extreme habitat suggesting appropriate conditions for growth of psychrophilic microorganisms. Five psychrophilic yeast strains were isolated from the samples taken from the region of the Bulgarian Base on Livingston Island, Antarctica: Cryptococcus laurentii AL₆₅, Sporobolomyces salmonicolor AL₃₆, Debaryomyces hansenii, Leucosporidium scotii and Rhodotorula glutinis, and their biomass yield and exopolysaccharides production were investigated. Best growth was observed for L. scotii and C. laurentii AL₆₅, with 7.5 and 6.0 g/L biomass, respectively, and highest exopolysaccharide yield was established for L. scotii. Metabolic profiling revealed phylogenetically based diversity in the identified metabolic profiles. The proton nuclear magnetic resonance (¹H NMR) spectroscopy analyses of compounds extracted from the biomass of the strains revealed significant differences in the metabolites between individual yeast strains in our investigation including: among the amino acids alanine, valine, threonine, leucine and tyrosine; some organic acids such as gamma-aminobutyric acid, acetic acid, formic acid and others. Glucose was identified in all investigated strains. The highest diversity of compounds was observed in D. hansenii strain, division Ascomycota. The main compounds in the metabolic profile of Basidiomycota strains were sugars. The statistical analysis revealed significant differences in the studied metabolites among the yeast strains. This result suggests that, together with 16S rRNA gene and enzyme gene analyses, metabolite profiling could be also used as a marker for a phylogenetic distance in fungi evolution.  aThis study was supported by the Program for Career Development of Young Scientists, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, under grant number [DFNP-60/27.04.2016].  aPublisher supplied data  aDFNP-60/27.04.2016cCareer Development of Young Scientists 3aCryptococcus laurentii 3aDebaryomyces hansenii 3aLeucosporidium 3aRhodotorula glutinis 3aSporobolomyces 3aacetic acid 3aalanine 3abiomass production 3abiotechnology 3aenzymes 3aequipment 3aexopolysaccharides 3aformic acid 3agamma-aminobutyric acid 3agenes 3agenetic distance 3aglucose 3ahabitats 3aleucine 3amagnetism 3ametabolites 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphylogeny 3asolar radiation 3astatistical analysis 3asummer 3athreonine 3atyrosine 3avaline 3ayeasts 3aAntarctic region 3aAntarctica 0aAntarctic yeasts 0aNMR 0ametabolite profiling1 aKambourova, Margarita1 aAlipieva, Kalina1 aNachkova, Stefka1 aSimova, Svetlana0 tBiotechnology, biotechnological equipment.g2019 Jan. 1, v. 33, no. 1 p.12-19dTaylor & FranciswJournal:21365x1314-35307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13102818.2018.14902013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02960naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245011300172300001600285520154300301592002801844650002301872650001301895650001701908650001801925650001101943650000901954650001601963650001801979650001901997650000902016650002502025650001202050650001302062650001102075651001102086653001402097653001302111653001902124653002202143653001102165700002002176700001802196700002202214700002702236773009502263856008702358852000902445655001202454IND60543029620221122030221.0190408e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054302962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2013.10.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiao, Chia-Ding10aIncidence of citrinin in red yeast rice and various commercial Monascus products in Taiwan from 2009 to 2012  ap. 178-183.  aRed yeast rice, produced by the fermentation of red yeast (Monascus purpureus) with white rice, has long been used in food colouring and meat preservation in Asia. Recently, powdered red yeast rice and its formulated products, used worldwide as dietary supplements, have the ability of reducing blood-lipid levels in humans. However, some Monascus strains could produce the mycotoxin citrinin as a secondary toxic metabolite so that commercial Monascus products are of a serious concern to the public now. The aim of this study was to obtain information about the occurrence of citrinin in red yeast rice and various commercial Monascus products in Taiwan from 2009 to 2012. A simple and rapid HPLC-fluorescence method was developed to detect citrinin in red yeast rice and Monascus products. The method's performance was acceptable in terms of recoveries, which ranged from 81.2% to 94.3% for citrinin-spiked samples at levels of 0.1, 1 and 10 mg/kg, and the relative standard deviation ranged from 2.5% to 5.7%. The limit of quantification of 0.05 mg/kg was achieved. The survey results showed that among total 302 samples, the incidences of citrinin contamination were 69.0%, 35.1% and 5.7% for red yeast rice (raw material), dietary supplements and red yeast rice processed products, respectively. The mean contamination levels were 13.3, 1.2 and 0.1 mg/kg for red yeast rice (raw material), dietary supplements and red yeast rice processed products, respectively. Such high citrinin contamination rate and level is worthy of note.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonascus purpureus 3acitrinin 3afermentation 3afood coloring 3ahumans 3ameat 3ametabolites 3araw materials 3ared yeast rice 3arice 3astatistical analysis 3asurveys 3atoxicity 3ayeasts 3aTaiwan 0aMycotoxin 0aCitrinin 0aRed yeast rice 0aMonascus products 0aTaiwan1 aChen, Ying-Chun1 aLin, Hsu-Yang1 aChiueh, Lih-Ching1 aShih, Daniel Yang-Chih0 tFood control.g2014 Apr., v. 38 p.178-183dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2013.10.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02645naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011400169300001800283500001900301520072700320536027501047592002801322596007701350596006601427596009401493650002001587650001601607650001701623650001801640650001401658650002201672650002101694650001401715650001201729650001301741650001101754650001001765650001701775653001301792653002101805653001101826653000901837700001801846700001501864700001701879773013701896856008502033852000902118655001202127IND60693003220221119203846.0200504e20180903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069300322DNAL7 a10.1080/13102818.2018.14994442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Wenjiao10aCloning and expression analysis of Cucumis sativus L.

In this study, CsCER4, an AtCER4 homologue, was cloned from cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.). The full-length cDNA of CsCER4 is 1464 bp, encoding a protein with 487 amino acid residues. CsCER4 was expressed in all analysed tissues, including leaves, male flowers, female flowers, and fruit.

The objective of this study was to compare incentives, costs, difficulties and benefits of Chinese and Mexican meat-exporting enterprises related to food safety management systems implementation. A questionnaire was applied to identify the main factors involved in HACCP implementation. Data were collected among 32 Chinese and 42 Mexican companies, and analysed using the SAS package. The implementation of the HACCP system was filled out in all exporting meat industries. The results indicated that the major incentives were related to improving product quality for both countries, whilst improving control of the process was the first motivation in the Chinese industry and access to new foreign markets was the first motivation in the Mexican one. In addition, both countries' industries reported that staff training was the most important implementing cost, while product testing was the major operating cost. The difficulties found during HACCP implementation and operation activities were associated with availability of personnel for other tasks for China and costs of certification for Mexico. The reported benefits were relevant for the two countries, due to the ability to reduce microbial counts and increased access to foreign and domestic markets. A better understanding of the costs and benefits associated with HACCP systems could be helpful and is necessary in every segment of the food chain in every sector of domestic and international markets in order to assure food quality and safety.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHACCP 3abusiness enterprises 3acertification 3adata collection 3afood chain 3afood quality 3aforeign markets 3ahuman resources 3ainternational trade 3alivestock and meat industry 3amanagement systems 3ameat 3ameat processing 3amotivation 3aoperating costs 3aprocess control 3aproduct testing 3aquestionnaires 3aChina 3aMexico 0aHACCP 0aChinese and Mexican industry 0aCosts and benefits1 aBai, Li1 aRamírez Valverde, Rodolfo,1 aGong, Shunlong1 aRodríguez-de Lara, Raymundo0 tFood control.g2014 Apr., v. 38 p.109-115dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2013.10.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02897naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245012900207300001600336520165400352592002802006650003502034650001802069650002002087650002002107650001302127650002202140650001302162650001702175650002502192700001902217700003102236700003402267773014302301856008202444852000902526655001202535IND60588698520221116162658.0180619e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058869852DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-017-8605-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFuenmayor, Javier1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6254-803410aTransient gene expression optimization and expression vector comparison to improve HIV-1 VLP production in HEK293 cell lines  ap. 165-174.  aTransient gene expression (TGE) has been used at small and medium scale for the production of biologicals in sufficient quantities to perform pre-clinical and characterization studies. Polyethyleneimine (PEI)-mediated transfection offers a low toxicity and non-expensive method for cell transfection. DNA and PEI concentration for transient gene expression has been extensively optimized in order to increase product titers. However, the possibility to extrapolate the optimal concentrations found for a specific bioprocess when expression vectors or cell lines need to be changed has not been investigated.In this work, the combination of three different HEK293 cell lines with three different vectors was studied for the production of HIV-1 virus-like particles (VLPs). The concentration of DNA and PEI was optimized for the nine combinations. The obtained results were very similar in all cases (DNA = 2.34 ± 0.18 μg/mL and PEI = 5.81 ± 0.18 μg/mL), revealing that transfection efficiency is not dependent on the cell line or vector type, but on DNA and PEI quantities. Furthermore, two of the cell lines tested stably expressed a protein able to recognize specific origins of replication: HEK293T/SV40 and HEK293E/oriP. Origins of replication were included in the vector sequences in order to test their capacity to increase production titers. HEK293T/SV40 resulted in a decrease of cell density and productivity of 2.3-fold compared to a control plasmid. On the other hand, HEK293E/OriP platform enabled a threefold improvement in HIV-1 VLP production keeping the same cell densities and viabilities compared to a control plasmid.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3abioprocessing 3agene expression 3agenetic vectors 3aplasmids 3apolyethyleneimine 3atoxicity 3atransfection 3avirus-like particles1 aCervera, Laura1 aGutiérrez-Granados, Sonia1 aGòdia Casablancas, Francesc,0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2018 Jan., v. 102, no. 1 p.165-174dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-017-8605-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02426naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245012300167300001800290500001900308520082500327536017401152592002801326596005001354596005101404650001801455650001401473650002501487650001301512650001101525650002501536650001101561653002801572653002301600653002501623653002501648700001801673700001501691700002201706700002101728773013701749856008501886852000901971655001201980IND60693003620221119203952.0200504e20180903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069300362DNAL7 a10.1080/13102818.2018.15035632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKasbawati, 10aDetermining an appropriate unstructured kinetic model for batch ethanol fermentation data using a direct search method  ap. 1167-1173.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this paper, we study an extracellular process of a biochemical system such as batch ethanol fermentation system by considering an unstructured kinetic model with four different well-known models for the specific growth rate of the yeast cells. Then, we fit the unstructured models to the experimental data for determining the appropriate model that can capture the dynamic behaviour of the batch ethanol fermentation experimental data. The fitting procedure is proceeded by minimising a least-squared error between the model solutions and the experimental data using a direct search method. Our simulations show that the unstructured model with Aiba-type structured model for the specific growth rate of the yeast cell has the best approximating ability to describe the dynamic of the batch ethanol fermentation data.  aThis study was supported by the Institute for Research and Community Services (LP2M) Hasanuddin University under BMIS 2017 research grant number 15152/UN4.32/LK.23/2017.  aPublisher supplied data  cInstitute for Research and Community Services  a15152/UN4.32/LK.23/2017cHasanuddin University 3abiotechnology 3aequipment 3aethanol fermentation 3akinetics 3amodels 3aspecific growth rate 3ayeasts 0aBatch fermentation data 0aunstructured model 0aparameter estimation 0adirect search method1 aSamsir, Rusni1 aSulfahri, 1 aJaya, Andi Kresna1 aKalondeng, Anisa0 tBiotechnology, biotechnological equipment.g2018 Sept. 3, v. 32, no. 5 p.1167-1173dTaylor & FranciswJournal:21365x1314-35307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13102818.2018.15035633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03068naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245012300176300001800299500001900317520129200336536018101628592002801809650002301837650001701860650001801877650001801895650001901913650001401932650002101946650001901967650003001986650002702016650001102043650001502054650001402069650000902083653002002092653000902112653003002121700001702151700001802168700001602186700001702202700001702219700002102236700002102257700001702278773013702295856008502432852000902517655001202526IND60693003720221119204031.0200504e20180903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069300372DNAL7 a10.1080/13102818.2018.15062662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHāsāna, Ema.

For genetic analysis of resistance to rice blast, the present study used a BC₂F₁ population developed through marker-assisted backcrossing from a cross between blast susceptible MR263 and blast resistant Pongsu Seribu 1 (PS1). We selected out of 450 markers, 65 polymorphic simple sequence repeat markers, including the Pi gene-based markers, and identified 16 markers associated with blast resistance that showed heterozygous bands in the BC2F1 population. Of the 16 polymorphic markers, only eight (RM5961, RM263, RM163, RM224, RM262, RM168, RM229 and RM169) showed a good fit to the expected segregation genotypic ratio (1:1) for the single dominance gene model (df = 1.0, P < 0.05), according to chi-square (χ²) analysis. An analysis of phenotypic data of the BC₂F₁ population also showed a good fit to the expected phenotypic ratio (1:1; R:S) for resistant and susceptible plants. The resistance to blast pathotype P7.2 in PS1 is most likely controlled by a single dominant gene that is linked to the eight markers we identified. These markers could be used in marker-assisted selection programmes to develop a durable blast resistant rice variety.  aThis study was supported by the Long-Term Research Grant Scheme (LRGS) under grant number 5500201 and the IGRF (International Graduate Research Fellowship, UPM) PhD Fellowship.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMagnaporthe oryzae 3abackcrossing 3abiotechnology 3ablast disease 3adominant genes 3aequipment 3agenetic analysis 3aheterozygosity 3amarker-assisted selection 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amodels 3apathotypes 3aphenotype 3arice 0ablast resistant 0aMABC 0aPongsu Serebu 1 and MR2631 aRafii, M.

This method requires only four steps: (i) the first parallel PCR for the amplification of complete and truncated insert fragments; (ii) the second parallel PCR for the exponential amplification of linear plasmids with the same sequences and different break sites mediated by the first products and the corresponding reverse primers; (iii) the formation of manmade cohesive termini after DpnI digestion, mixing, denaturation and annealing; and (iv) transformation. By employing this strategy, large fragments (1–4 kbp) can be easily inserted into the pGADT₇ vector (∼ 8 kbp).  aThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant number 81703400 (to Dr. E.

However, the low fruit yield is a bottleneck for its utilisation in biodiesel production. To date, the genes related to fruit yield of J. curcas are still poorly studied. Therefore, this study was conducted to compare the transcriptome profiles of two J. curcas clones with high and low fruit yield. The results showed that 52 381 unigenes were obtained and annotated to 55 orthologous terms. More than 9 653 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)/Indels and 15 971 SSR loci were identified. In addition, 76 differential expression genes (DEGs) were obtained and mainly down-regulated in a high fruit yield sample. Moreover, the DEGs were significantly enriched in phytohormone signalling pathways, including gibberellin, brassinolide and jasmonic acid. Furthermore, we suggested that some genes might inhibit the initiation of female floral differentiation to decrease the fruit yield in J. curcas. These data will create a reference transcriptome for the genomics database of J. curcas for future studies. We expect that the dataset will serve as a foundation to study the genes function, which help in engineering high-yielding varieties in J. curcas.  aThe work was supported by the Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences under grant number kfj-brsn-2018-6-008.  aPublisher supplied data  akfj-brsn-2018-6-008cProgram of Chinese Academy of Sciences 3aJatropha curcas 3abiodiesel 3abiotechnology 3abrassinolide 3adatabases 3aequipment 3afemales 3afruit yield 3agene expression regulation 3agenomics 3agibberellins 3ajasmonic acid 3alipid content 3aplant hormones 3asequence analysis 3atranscriptome 3aunigenes 0aJatropha curcas L. 0aphytohormone1 aYang, Yuantong1 aWu, Guojiang1 aWang, Yi1 aZaky Zayed, Mohamed1 aChen, Xiaoyang0 tBiotechnology, biotechnological equipment.g2018 Sept. 3, v. 32, no. 5 p.1126-1133dTaylor & FranciswJournal:21365x1314-35307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13102818.2018.15077573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02790naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245015400171300001400325500001100339520137200350592002801722650001101750650002501761650001601786650001801802650001301820650001301833650001101846650001501857650001501872650002201887650002501909650001301934650002901947650002701976650001102003700001902014700002002033700005902053773014102112856008202253852000902335655001202344IND60588699520221116162557.0180619e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058869952DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-017-8612-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTheron, ChrispianW.10aIntegrating metabolic modeling and population heterogeneity analysis into optimizing recombinant protein production by Komagataella (Pichia) pastoris  ap. 63-80.  aReview  aThe methylotrophic yeast Komagataella (Pichia) pastoris has become one of the most utilized cell factories for the production of recombinant proteins over the last three decades. This success story is linked to its specific physiological traits, i.e., the ability to grow at high cell density in inexpensive culture medium and to secrete proteins at high yield. Exploiting methanol metabolism is at the core of most P. pastoris-based processes but comes with its own challenges. Co-feeding cultures with glycerol/sorbitol and methanol is a promising approach, which can benefit from improved understanding and prediction of metabolic response. The development of profitable processes relies on the construction and selection of efficient producing strains from less efficient ones but also depends on the ability to master the bioreactor process itself. More specifically, how a bioreactor processes could be monitored and controlled to obtain high yield of production. In this review, new perspectives are detailed regarding a multi-faceted approach to recombinant protein production processes by P. pastoris; including gaining improved understanding of the metabolic pathways involved, accounting for variations in transcriptional and translational efficiency at the single cell level and efficient monitoring and control of methanol levels at the bioreactor level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPichia 3abiochemical pathways 3abioreactors 3aculture media 3aglycerol 3amethanol 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aprediction 3aprotein synthesis 3arecombinant proteins 3asorbitol 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranslation (genetics) 3ayeasts1 aBerrios, Julio1 aDelvigne, Frank1 aFickers, Patrick1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2600-58330 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2018 Jan., v. 102, no. 1 p.63-80dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-017-8612-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02926naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245012600171300001800297500001900315520113000334536018101464592002801645596005401673596006401727596006801791650002001859650001101879650001701890650001801907650001601925650002401941650001401965650001301979650002001992650001002012650001402022650002202036650002202058653002902080653001202109700001302121700001802134700001702152700002002169773013702189856008502326852000902411655001202420IND60693004720221119203755.0200504e20180903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069300472DNAL7 a10.1080/13102818.2018.15123792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xiao-Jun10aCloning and expression analysis of the phytoene synthase gene in ‘Granny Smith’ apple (Malus × domestica Borkh.)  ap. 1105-1112.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPhytoene synthase (PSY) plays a key role in the biosynthesis and accumulation of carotenoids as the first rate-limiting enzyme in the plant carotenoid pathway. In the present study, the ‘Granny Smith’ apple PSY gene, MdPSY, was cloned using in silico cloning. The length of the MdPSY was 1500 bp, which included a complete open reading frame of 1194 bp, encoding a predicted protein of 397 amino acids. Sequence analysis revealed that the ‘Granny Smith’ apple PSY protein shared high homology with MdPSY2 (99%), MdPSY1 (93.9%), FaPSY (71.8%), CuPSY (70.7%) and NtPSY (69.7%). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the MdPSY protein was closely related to the PSY protein of Rosaceae. An expression profile analysis of different tissues indicated that MdPSY expression in the roots was higher than that in other tissues. MdPSY expression was tested throughout the fruit development period. The results showed that MdPSY plays a role in carotenoid biosynthesis in ‘Granny Smith’ apple. In addition, bagging treatment inhibits PSY gene expression, which in turn affects the synthesis and accumulation of carotenoids.  aThe Natural Science Foundation of Shanxi Province; The Key Research and Development Project of Shanxi Province; The Introduces Talent Project of Shanxi Agricultural University.  aPublisher supplied data  cThe Natural Science Foundation of Shanxi Province  cThe Key Research and Development Project of Shanxi Province  cThe Introduces Talent Project of Shanxi Agricultural University 3aMalus domestica 3aapples 3abiosynthesis 3abiotechnology 3acarotenoids 3acomputer simulation 3aequipment 3afruiting 3agene expression 3agenes 3aphylogeny 3aphytoene synthase 3asequence analysis 0a‘Granny Smith’ apple 0acloning1 aGao, Yan1 aWen, Peng-Fei1 aHao, Yan-Yan1 aChen, Xue-Xiong0 tBiotechnology, biotechnological equipment.g2018 Sept. 3, v. 32, no. 5 p.1105-1112dTaylor & FranciswJournal:21365x1314-35307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13102818.2018.15123793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03073naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245010700168300001800275500001900293520098700312536042001299592002801719596005901747596006201806596005701868650002701925650002201952650001801974650002301992650001902015650001102034650001402045650001002059650001602069650001902085650001702104653001002121653003902131653002302170700001902193700001202212700001602224700001902240700001402259700001902273700002102292773013602313856008502449852000902534655001202543IND60693005220221119203725.0200504e20181102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069300522DNAL7 a10.1080/13102818.2018.15170292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Zixing10aOverexpression of the Bacillus licheniformis GroES enhances thermotolerance of Bacillus subtilis WB600  ap. 1527-1532.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aUse of thermotolerant strains offers the advantage of conducting production process at elevated temperatures, thereby improving the catalytic efficiency and reducing the energy consumption and the production costs. In the present study, thermotolerance gene groES from the thermophilic strain Bacillus licheniformis B186 was implanted into B. subtilis WB600 to improve its thermotolerance. The engineered strain WB600-pHY-groES displayed reduced doubling time as well as increased specific growth rates and cell viability compared with the control. Our results suggested that introducing heat shock proteins (HSPs) from thermophiles into B. subtilis could be an effective approach to enhance its thermotolerance, thus facilitating the development of multichaperone expression systems for constructing more thermotolerant commercial B. subtilis strains. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on improving the thermotolerance of B. subtilis by overexpression of HSPs.  aThis work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant number 31370076, the International Collaborative Project Supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) and National Research Foundation of South Africa (NFC) under grant number 31461143026, and the Youth Innovation Fund from Tianjin University of Science & Technology under grant number 2016LG15.  aPublisher supplied data  a31370076cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31461143026cNational Research Foundation of South Africa  a2016LG15cTianjin University of Science & Technology 3aBacillus licheniformis 3aBacillus subtilis 3abiotechnology 3acatalytic activity 3acell viability 3aenergy 3aequipment 3agenes 3aheat stress 3aheat tolerance 3athermophiles 0aGroES 0athermotolerance; Bacillus subtilis 0aheat shock protein1 aChen, Xiaoling1 aCai, Ke1 aShen, Peili1 aTian, Kangming1 aJin, Peng1 aLiu, Xiaoguang1 aWang, Zhengxiang0 tBiotechnology, biotechnological equipment.g2018 Nov. 2, v. 32, no. 6 p.1527-1532dTaylor & FranciswJournal:21365x1314-35307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13102818.2018.15170293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02736naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245006700167300001400234500001100248520147500259592002801734650002101762650003601783650002301819650001501842650002101857650002201878650003901900650002201939650002501961650002001986650002502006650002402031700006302055773014102118856008202259852000902341655001202350IND60588700120221118044403.0180619e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058870012DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-017-8623-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliveira, Carla10aGuidelines to reach high-quality purified recombinant proteins  ap. 81-92.  aReview  aThe final goal in recombinant protein production is to obtain high-quality pure protein samples. Indeed, the successful downstream application of a recombinant protein depends on its quality. Besides production, which is conditioned by the host, the quality of a recombinant protein product relies mainly on the purification procedure. Thus, the purification strategy must be carefully designed from the molecular level. On the other hand, the quality control of a protein sample must be performed to ensure its purity, homogeneity and structural conformity, in order to validate the recombinant production and purification process. Therefore, this review aims at providing succinct information on the rational purification design of recombinant proteins produced in Escherichia coli, specifically the tagging purification, as well as on accessible tools for evaluating and optimizing protein quality. The classical techniques for structural protein characterization—denaturing protein gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), size exclusion chromatography (SEC), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and circular dichroism (CD)—are revisited with focus on the protein and their main advantages and disadvantages. Furthermore, methods for determining protein concentration and protein storage are also presented. The guidelines compiled herein will aid preparing pure, soluble and homogeneous functional recombinant proteins from the very beginning of the molecular cloning design.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3agel chromatography 3aguidelines 3alight scattering 3amolecular cloning 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aprotein synthesis 3apurification methods 3aquality control 3arecombinant proteins 3astructural proteins1 aDomingues, Lucília,1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1089-76270 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2018 Jan., v. 102, no. 1 p.81-92dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-017-8623-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02353naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245021000171300001400381520095200395592002801347650001901375650002001394650001701414650002501431650001901456650001901475650001301494650001301507650000901520650005801529653001301587653000901600653001701609653001401626700001801640700001101658700001801669700001601687700001601703773009201719856008701811852000901898655001201907IND60543031620221123015716.0190408e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054303162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2013.10.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Shijuan10aSensitive determination of melamine leached from tableware by reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography using 10-methyl-acridone-2-sulfonyl chloride as a pre-column fluorescent labeling reagent  ap. 25-29.  aA new and sensitive pre-column derivatization method was developed for the analysis of melamine leached from tableware by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection. The HPLC sensitivity was greatly enhanced by introducing 10-methyl-acridone-2-sulfonyl chloride (MASC) with excellent fluorescence property into the melamine molecule. Meanwhile, derivatization also greatly increased the hydrophobicity of melamine. Therefore, the common reversed phase column can be used for the HPLC analysis of highly hydrophilic melamine. The detection limit obtained by the proposed method was lower than 0.40 μg/L. This is the first time that HPLC with fluorescence detection was applied to the analysis of melamine. The proposed method was successfully applied to the analysis of melamine leached from tableware. The results indicated that the leaching of melamine from tableware was obvious when hot water or milk was added.  aPublisher supplied data 3aderivatization 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3afluorescent labeling 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aleaching 3amelamine 3amilk 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 0aMelamine 0aHPLC 0aFluorescence 0aTableware1 aYu, Zhaoqiang1 aHu, Na1 aSun, Yuanpeng1 aSuo, Yourui1 aYou, Jinmao0 tFood control.g2014 May, v. 39 p.25-29dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2013.10.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03214naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245010700165300001800272500001900290520137600309536035201685592002802037596006402065596003902129596012202168650002002290650001802310650002002328650001402348650001802362650001002380650002202390650001502412653002902427653004402456653001902500700001302519700001802532773013602550856008502686852000902771655001202780IND60693005720221119203954.0200504e20181102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069300572DNAL7 a10.1080/13102818.2018.15213022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFengshou,12aA hierarchical multi-label classification method based on neural networks for gene function prediction  ap. 1613-1621.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aGene function prediction is used to assign biological or biochemical functions to genes, which continues to be a challenging problem in modern biology. Genes may exhibit many functions simultaneously, and these functions are organized into a hierarchy, such as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) for Gene Ontology (GO). Because of these characteristics, gene function prediction can be seen as a typical hierarchical multi-label classification (HMC) task. A novel HMC method based on neural networks is proposed in this article for predicting gene function based on GO. The proposed method belongs to a local approach by transferring the HMC task to a set of subtasks. There are three strategies implemented in this method to improve its performance. First, to tackle the imbalanced data set problem when building the training data set for each class, negative instances selecting policy and SMOTE approach are used to preprocess each imbalanced training data set. Second, a particular multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is designed for each node in GO. Third, a post processing method based on the Bayesian network is used to guarantee that the results are consistent with the hierarchy constraint. The experimental results indicate that the proposed HMC-MLPN method is a promising method for gene function prediction based on a comparison with two other state-of-the-art methods.  aThis work is supported in part by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under grant number HIT NSRIF.20169, the Heilongjiang Postdoctoral Fund under grant number LBH-Z16081, and the Online Education Research Funds of Online Education Research Center of Ministry of Education (Quantong Education) under grant number 2016YB132.  aPublisher supplied data  cthe Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities  cthe Heilongjiang Postdoctoral Fund  cthe Online Education Research Funds of Online Education Research Center of Ministry of Education (Quantong Education) 3aBayesian theory 3abiotechnology 3adata collection 3aequipment 3agene ontology 3agenes 3aissues and policy 3aprediction 0aGene function prediction 0ahierarchical multi-label classification 0aneural network1 aFu, Ping1 aZheng, Wenbin0 tBiotechnology, biotechnological equipment.g2018 Nov. 2, v. 32, no. 6 p.1613-1621dTaylor & FranciswJournal:21365x1314-35307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13102818.2018.15213023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03587naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011000169300001800279500001900297520162500316536024001941592002802181596004902209650001602258650002202274650001802296650001802314650001402332650001402346650001302360650001202373650001002385650001702395650001102412650002102423650002802444650001402472650001402486650002202500650001102522650001902533650000802552650000902560653001002569653002502579653001602604653002102620653002302641700001902664700001702683700001202700700001402712700001702726773013602743856008502879852000902964655001202973IND60693005820221119203818.0200504e20181102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069300582DNAL7 a10.1080/13102818.2018.15213032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeng, Rui-Min10aGenome-wide identification, classification and expression pattern of LBD gene family in Camellia sinensis  ap. 1387-1397.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe plant-specific LBD (LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES DOMAIN) genes belong to a major family of transcription factors that encode a zinc finger-like domain. This family plays crucial roles in plant development, including lateral organ development, pathogen response, pollen development, plant regeneration and hormone response. However, there is no detailed information of LBD genes in the tea plant. Tea plant [Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze] is a perennial evergreen woody crop that is cultivated worldwide. Tea leaves are used as a non-alcoholic beverage, which is known for its beneficial ingredients and multiple flavours. In this study, a total of 31 CsLBD genes were identified and characterized based on the genome of C. sinensis. CsLBD factors and Arabidopsis counterparts were clustered into 10 subgroups after phylogenetic analysis. Conserved motif analysis revealed that CsLBD proteins with a close evolutionary relationship possessed uniform or similar motif compositions. The interaction networks of LBD proteins in C. sinensis were established according to the data in Arabidopsis. Seven CsLBD genes were examined through qRT-PCR (quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction) in tea plant cultivar, ‘Longjing43’. The expression profiles of these CsLBD genes were investigated in different tissues (i.e. root, stem, leaf and flower) and subjected to five hormonal stimuli (i.e. abscisic acid, gibberellin acid, ethephon, methyl jasmonate and salicylic acid). This study provides an extensive overview of the CsLBD family genes and a valuable foundation for future functional studies of CsLBD factors.  aThis study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant number 31570691.

A palladium-coated carbon-PTFE gas diffusion electrode (Pd/C GDE) was used as a catalytic cathode with hydroxyl radical (•OH) formed as a result of the reaction of electrogenerated H* with H₂O₂. As both the HER and ORR can be induced to occur at the same cathode, the H*/GDE process results in more effective degradation of organic contaminants than can be achieved by a conventional H*/H₂O₂ process involving direct addition of H₂O₂. At circumneutral pH, 82.7% of added formate was degraded after 2 h treatment at an applied potential of −1.0 V vs Ag/AgCl with relatively low concentrations of generated H₂O₂ remaining in the solution. We also show that H* and H₂O₂ (and thus •OH) can be electrogenerated effectively over a wide range of pH (3.2–7.0). These results suggest that by in situ generation of H* and H₂O₂, the H*/GDE process is able to produce significant amounts of •OH without external chemical addition and thus offers an alternative method for abatement of aqueous organic contaminants.  aPublisher supplied data 3acathodes 3aelectrochemistry 3aenvironmental science 3aformates 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydrogen production 3ahydroxyl radicals 3aoxidation 3apH 3atechnology 0aatomic hydrogen 0agas diffusion electrode1 aMiller, C.

Here we report a scalable self-assembly technique for fabricating multifunctional optical coatings that mimic cicada-wing structures. Spin-coated two-dimensional non-close-packed colloidal crystals are utilized as etching masks to pattern subwavelength-structured cone arrays directly on polymer substrates. The resulting gratings exhibit broadband antireflection performance and superhydrophobic properties after surface modification. The dependence of the cone shape and size on the antireflective and self-cleaning properties has also been investigated in this study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCicadidae 3acoatings 3acrystals 3ahydrophobicity 3apolymers 3atransmittance 3awings 0acicada wing 0aself-assembly 0acolloidal crystal 0aantireflection 0aself-cleaning1 aHuang, Zhe-Sheng1 aYang, Hongta0 tACS applied materials .g2015 Nov. 18, v. 7, no. 45 p.25495-25505dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.5b087433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01471naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100001900162245014600181300001600327506002800343520020000371592002800571506003700599650001800636650001000654650001000664650001100674653001500685653001800700653001400718653002300732653001700755653000900772653001500781773019500796856009700991852000901088655001201097IND60757513120221207124055.0190411e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075751312DNAL7 aDOI:10.23885/1814-3326-2016-12-1-131-1342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArzanov, Yu.G.14aThe morphology of the immature stages of the weevil Plinthus (Caucasoplinthus) alternans Reitter, 1888 (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Molytinae)  ap. 131-134.  aResource is Open Access  aThe last-instar larva and pupa of the Western Caucasian weevil Plinthus alternus are described for the first time.

However, despite the increasing use of alternative flame retardants following PBDE bans, the spatiotemporal trends of these replacements have rarely been studied, and the available results are often inconsistent. In the present study, we retrospectively investigated the spatiotemporal trends of PBDEs and a suite of alternative brominated FRs (aBFRs) and chlorinated FRs (i.e., dechloranes or DECs) in three harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) populations from the coasts of California, the Gulf of Maine, and southern Sweden during 1999–2016. We observed significantly decreasing trends of ΣPBDEs in all the three populations at an annual rate of 9–11%, which were predominantly driven by the declining concentrations of tetra- and penta-BDEs. The levels of ΣaBFRs decreased significantly in seals from California (mainly 1,3,5-tribromobenzene) and Sweden (mainly hexabromobenzene), while no trend was observed for those from Maine. By contrast, DECs (dominated by DEC 602) did not decrease significantly in any population. Compared with the consistent PBDE congener profiles across regions, aBFRs and DECs exhibited varying compositional profiles between regions, likely indicating region-specific sources of these alternative FR mixtures. Spatial analysis also revealed regional differences in the concentrations of PBDEs, aBFRs, and DECs in harbor seals. Our reconstructed spatiotemporal trends suggest the effective regulation of commercial penta-BDE mix in these regions and warrant further monitoring of the higher brominated BDEs and alternative FRs.  aPublisher supplied data  a42007287cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a42111530087cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a2020M683176cChina Postdoctoral Science Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002858 3aPhoca vitulina 3abiphenyl 3abromination 3aenvironmental science 3atechnology 3aCalifornia 3aGulf of Maine 3aMaine 3aSweden 0amarine mammals 0aemerging contaminants 0aorganohalogen compounds 0atime trends 0aspatial trends 0abiomonitoring1 aShaw, Susan1 aBerger, Michelle1 aHalaska, Barbie1 aRoos, Anna1 aBäcklin, Britt-Marie1 aZheng, Xiaoshi1 aLiu, Kunyan1 aWang, Yan1 aChen, Da1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5563-00910 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2022 Apr. 20, v. 56, no. 9 p.5714-5723dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.2c006263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03138naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001300145245014500158300001800303520128800321592002801609596009801637596009801735596009801833650002201931650002601953650002101979650002002000650001102020650001502031653001702046653003102063653002002094653001702114653002102131700001402152700005302166700001202219700001702231700005202248700001502300700005602315700005702371773013902428856008002567852000902647655001202656IND60776206320221121012639.0220503e20220414xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077620632DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.2c007782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Bo10aCanopy-Level Flux and Vertical Gradients of Hg⁰ Stable Isotopes in Remote Evergreen Broadleaf Forest Show Year-Around Net Hg⁰ Deposition  ap. 5950-5959.  aVegetation uptake represents the dominant route of Hg input to terrestrial ecosystems. However, this plant-directed sink is poorly constrained due to the challenges in measuring the net Hg⁰ exchange on the ecosystem scale over a long period. Particularly important is the contribution in the subtropics/tropics, where the bulk (∼70%) of the Hg⁰ deposition is considered to occur. Using the relaxed eddy accumulation technique, this study presents for the first time a whole ecosystem Hg⁰ flux record over an evergreen hardwood forest. This tower-based micrometeorological method gauged a cumulated net Hg⁰ flux of −41.1 μg m–² over 16 months, suggesting that the subtropical montane forest acts as a large and continuous sink of atmospheric Hg⁰. The monthly net fluxes were consistently negative (−7.3 to −1.0 μg m–² month–¹) throughout the year, with the smallest absolute values occurring during the mild and dry subseason in spring, which was also the annual lowest in vegetation activity. Colocated measurements of multilevel gradients of Hg⁰ concentration and its stable isotopic composition support the finding of year-round Hg⁰ deposition. The stable Hg isotope measurements also show that in-canopy bi-directional Hg⁰ exchange is prevalent.  aPublisher supplied data  a41829701cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a41921004cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a42007307cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809 3adeciduous forests 3aenvironmental science 3ahardwood forests 3amontane forests 3aspring 3atechnology 0aHg0 exchange 0amicrometeorological method 0aatmospheric Hg0 0aHg0 isotopes 0asubtropic forest1 aYuan, Wei1 aWang, Xun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7407-89651 aLi, Kai1 aLin, Che-Jen1 aLi, Ping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0145-41221 aLu, Zhiyun1 aFeng, Xinbin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7462-89981 aSommar, Jonas1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8634-440X0 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2022 Apr. 14, v. 56, no. 9 p.5950-5959dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.2c007783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04096naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100001800158245012700176300001600303506002800319520231300347592002802660506003702688650002002725650001002745650002902755650001602784650001102800650001502811650001902826650001402845650000902859650002002868650002502888650003502913650001202948650002302960650001602983650000902999650001003008650002203018650002703040650001603067650002303083653002303106653001203129653001003141700002103151700002003172700002003192700001903212773018503231856009303416852000903509655001203518IND60757513520221207140151.0211027e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075751352DNAL7 a10.30766/2072-9081.2021.22.5.761-7692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurova, O.

During the research three methods of collecting insects were used: a UV trap, fly strips and a liquid gadfly trap (“death puddle”). The following blood-sucking insects play a key role in the epizootology of transmissible infections - houseflies (Muscidae), black flies (Simuliidae), mosquitoes (Culicidae), biting midges (Ceratopogonidae), gadflies (Tabanidae). There has been obtained new information on the species, territorial and temporal dynamics of the distribution of vectors of lumpy skin disease in cattle in the subjects of the Russian Federation. Data collection of the spatial and temporal spread of the disease visualized using GIS-technologies have been generated on the basis of the statistical reports. As the result of the research, it has been established that in the Nizhny Novgorod region representatives of the Psychodidae family, the percentage of which was 40.9 %, predominate in the nocturnal entomological complex. They are followed by mosquitoes (genus Culex) - 21.6 %, biting midges - 16.4 % manure flies - 7.0 % and black flies - 3.0 %, respectively. In the Saratov region, the nocturnal entomological complex was represented by manure flies (family Sphaeroceridae), black flies (family Simuliidae) and mosquitoes (genus Culex), the percentages were 56,0, 32,0 and 12,0 %, respectively. At the same time, in the Saratov region there were collected 239 times less mosquitoes than in the Nizhny Novgorod region, which was due to an increase in temperature in the conditions of the southern regions. This caused the water bodies to dry out and reduced the pool of insects whose developmental cycle is related to water. It has been established that all-year keeping of cattle in winter cow yards provides the diversity and rise in the number of insect vectors, which increases the risk of lumpy skin disease as compared to the grazing system of cattle keeping. For collection daytime insect vectors, it is recommended to use fly strips covered with rosin and mineral oil. For collection insects of the nocturnal entomocomplex, which are the main transmitters of the lumpy skin disease virus, one should use ultraviolet traps.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCeratopogonidae 3aCulex 3aLumpy skin disease virus 3aPsychodidae 3aRussia 3aSimuliidae 3aSphaeroceridae 3aTabanidae 3acows 3adata collection 3adisease transmission 3ageographic information systems 3aliquids 3alumpy skin disease 3amineral oil 3arisk 3arosin 3aspecies diversity 3aspecies identification 3atemperature 3atemporal variation 0alumpy skin disease 0ainsects 0atraps1 aZakharova, O.

Such selective recovery requires precise separation at the angstrom scale. Although nanofiltration (NF) has the potential to achieve solute–solute separation, the state-of-the-art polyamide (PA) membranes are typically constrained by limited precision of solute–solute selectivity and their well-documented permeability–selectivity trade-off. Herein, we present a novel capillary-assisted interfacial polymerization (CAIP) approach to generate metal–organic framework (MOF)-PA nanocomposite membranes with reduced surface charges and more uniform pore sizes that favor solute selectivity by enhanced size exclusion. By uniquely regulating the PA–MOF interactions using the capillary force, CAIP results in effective exposure of MOF nanochannels on the membrane surface and a PA matrix with a high cross-linking gradient in the vertical direction, both of which contribute to an exceptional water permeance of ∼18.7 LMH/bar and an unprecedentedly high selectivity between nutrient ions and PFASs. Our CAIP approach breaks new ground for utilizing nanoparticles with nanochannels in fabricating the next-generation, fit-for-purpose NF membranes for improved solute–solute separations.  aPublisher supplied data  a2020-67021-31526cNational Science Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000001  a84008001cU.S. Environmental Protection Agencydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000139  a1936928cDivision of Engineering Education and Centersdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000149  a2018-68011-28371cU.S. Department of Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199  a2020-67021-31526cU.S. Department of Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acoordination polymers 3acrosslinking 3amunicipal wastewater 3ananocomposites 3ananofiltration 3apolyamides 3apolymerization 3asolutes 0acapillary-assisted interfacial polymerization 0atailored separation 0adomestic wastewater 0anutrient recovery 0aemerging contaminants1 aTong, Xin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2849-76831 aKim, Juhee1 aTong, Tiezheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9289-33301 aHuang, Ching-Hua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3786-094X1 aChen, Yongsheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9519-23020 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2022 Apr. 14, v. 56, no. 9 p.5849-5859dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.2c017283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02089naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245006200163300002000225520083900245592002801084650001701112650002201129650001301151650001701164653002301181653001601204653001701220653002401237653002201261700002001283700002201303700002001325700001901345700001601364700002801380700002101408700002301429773012601452856008001578852000901658655001201667IND60528489020170710000000.0160716e20151118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052848902DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.5b090842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Younghoon10aEfficient Luminescence from Perovskite Quantum Dot Solids  ap. 25007-25013.  aNanocrystals of CsPbX₃ perovskites are promising materials for light-emitting optoelectronics because of their colloidal stability, optically tunable bandgap, bright photoluminescence, and excellent photoluminescence quantum yield. Despite their promise, nanocrystal-only films of CsPbX₃ perovskites have not yet been fabricated; instead, highly insulating polymers have been relied upon to compensate for nanocrystals’ unstable surfaces. We develop solution chemistry that enables single-step casting of perovskite nanocrystal films and overcomes problems in both perovskite quantum dot purification and film fabrication. Centrifugally cast films retain bright photoluminescence and achieve dense and homogeneous morphologies.

Using modular insertion of suitable precursors in the starting solution, it is possible to synthesize different types of graphene-based materials ranging from heteroatom-doped graphene nanoballs to hierarchical nanohybrids made up by nitrogen-doped crumpled graphene nanosacks that wrap finely dispersed MoS₂ nanoparticles. These materials are carefully investigated by microscopic (SEM, standard and HR TEM), diffraction (grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD)) and spectroscopic (high resolution photoemission, Raman and UV−visible spectroscopy) techniques, evidencing that nitrogen dopants provide anchoring sites for MoS₂ nanoparticles, whereas crumpling of graphene sheets drastically limits aggregation. The activity of these materials is tested toward the photoelectrochemical production of hydrogen, obtaining that N-doped graphene/MoS₂ nanohybrids are seven times more efficient with respect to single MoS₂ because of the formation of local p–n MoS₂/N-doped graphene nanojunctions, which allow an efficient charge carrier separation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aaerosols 3agraphene 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3anitrogen 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asynthesis 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 0agraphene oxide 0ahydrogen evolution reaction 0atransition metal dichalcogenides 0aphotocatalysis 0ananohybrids1 aCalvillo, Laura1 aCattelan, Mattia1 aFavaro, Marco1 aRighetto, Marcello1 aNappini, Silvia1 aPíš, Igor1 aCelorrio, Verónica1 aFermín, David J.1 aMartucci, Alessandro1 aAgnoli, Stefano1 aGranozzi, G.q(Gaetano),0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2015 Nov. 25, v. 7, no. 46 p.25685-25692dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.5b066683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02998naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245013600163300002000299500001500319520136900334592002801703650002001731650000901751650002101760650002801781650001101809650002601820650000901846650002201855650002301877650001501900653002001915653001701935653004101952653002701993653003002020653002402050700001702074700001902091700001802110700001902128700002402147700002402171700001902195700002002214700001902234773012602253856008002379852000902459655001202468IND60528490320170718000000.0160716e20151125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052849032DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.5b072112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWooh, Sanghyuk10aSurface Modification of TiO2 Photoanodes with Fluorinated Self-Assembled Monolayers for Highly Efficient Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells  ap. 25741-25747.  a2019-12-06  aDye aggregation and electron recombination in TiO₂ photoanodes are the two major phenomena lowering the energy conversion efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). Herein, we introduce a novel surface modification strategy of TiO₂ photoanodes by the fluorinated self-assembled monolayer (F-SAM) formation with 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyltriethoxysilane (PFTS), blocking the vacant sites of the TiO₂ surface after dye adsorption. The F-SAM helps to efficiently lower the surface tension, resulting in efficient repelling ions, e.g., I₃–, in the electrolyte to decrease the electron recombination rate, and the role of F-SAM is characterized in detail by impedance spectroscopy using a diffusion–recombination model. In addition, the dye aggregates on the TiO₂ surface are relaxed by the F-SAM with large conformational perturbation (i.e., helix structure) seemingly because of steric hindrance developed during the SAM formation. Such multifunctional effects suppress the electron recombination as well as the intermolecular interactions of dye aggregates without the loss of adsorbed dyes, enhancing both the photocurrent density (11.9 → 13.5 mA cm–²) and open-circuit voltage (0.67 → 0.72 V). Moreover, the combined surface modification with the F-SAM and the classical coadsorbent further improves the photovoltaic performance in DSCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3asurface tension 3aions 3atitanium dioxide 3adielectric spectroscopy 3amodels 3achemical interactions 3adyes 3aenergy conversion 3aphotovoltaic cells 3aadsorption 0adye aggregation 0aelectrolytes 0afluorinated self-assembled monolayer 0aelectron recombination 0adye-sensitized solar cell 0asurface engineering1 aKim, Tea-Yon1 aSong, Donghoon1 aLee, Yong-Gun1 aLee, Tae Kyung1 aBergmann, Victor

The nanotubes having diameters between 70–130 nm and lengths between 4.5–17 μm are assembled in Na-ion test cells. Their sodium insertion properties and electrochemical behavior with respect to sodium insertion is studied by galvanostatic cycling with potential limitation and cyclic voltammetry. It is found that these materials are very resilient to cycling, some being able to withstand more than 300 cycles without significant loss of capacity. The mechanism of electrochemical storage of Na⁺ in the investigated titania nanotubes is found to present significant particularities and differences from a classical insertion reaction. It appears that the interfacial region between titania and the liquid electrolyte is hosting the majority of Na⁺ ions and that this interfacial layer has a pseudocapacitive behavior. Also, for the first time, the chemical diffusion coefficients of Na⁺ into the amorphous titania nanotubes is determined at various electrode potentials. The low values of diffusion coefficients, ranging between 4 × 10–²⁰ to 1 × 10–²¹ cm²/s, support the interfacial Na⁺ storage mechanism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3adiameter 3adiffusivity 3aelectrochemistry 3aethylene glycol 3aions 3ananotubes 3asodium 3atitanium dioxide 0aTiO2 nanotubes 0aNa-ion batteries 0ainterfaces 0afaradaic adsorption 0adiffusion1 aWilkening, Martin1 aHanzu, Ilie0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2015 Nov. 25, v. 7, no. 46 p.25757-25769dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.5b075083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03143naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003100150245009100181300001800272520135300290592002801643596009601671596009601767596009601863596007301959650001502032650001902047650001702066650001202083650001902095650001602114650000702130650002202137650002302159650001202182650002102194700006202215700006002277700005702337700002302394700006002417773011402477856008502591852000902676655001202685IND60776208720220503000000.0220503e20220127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077620872DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c023262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÖzbilgin, İrem Nur Gamze10aWater-Soluble Silicon Quantum Dots toward Fluorescence-Guided Photothermal Nanotherapy  ap. 5188-5196.  aWe report carboxy-terminated silicon quantum dots (SiQDs) that exhibit high solubility in water due to the high molecular coverage of surface monolayers, bright light emission with high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs), long-term stability in the PL property for monitoring cells, less toxicity to the cells, and a high photothermal response. We prepared water-soluble SiQDs by the thermal hydrosilylation of 10-undecenoic acid on their hydrogen-terminated surfaces, provided by the thermal disproportionation of triethoxysilane hydrolyzed at pH 3 and subsequent hydrofluoric etching. The 10-undecanoic acid-functionalized SiQDs (UA:SiQDs) showed long-term stability in hydrophilic solvents including ethanol and water (pH 7). We assess their interaction with live cells by means of cellular uptake, short-term toxicity, and, for the first time, long-term cytotoxicity. Results show that UA:SiQDs are potential candidates for theranostics, with their good optical properties enabling imaging for more than 18 days and a photothermal response having a 25.1% photothermal conversion efficiency together with the direct evidence of cell death by laser irradiation. UA:SiQDs have low cytotoxicity with full viability of up to 400 μg/mL for the short term and a 50% cell viability value after 14 days of incubation at a 50 μg/mL concentration.  aPublisher supplied data  a21H01743cJapan Society for the Promotion of Sciencedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001691  a21H01910cJapan Society for the Promotion of Sciencedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001691  a21K18942cJapan Society for the Promotion of Sciencedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001691  aNAcMurata Science Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100008662 3acell death 3acell viability 3acytotoxicity 3aethanol 3ahydrophilicity 3airradiation 3apH 3aphotoluminescence 3aprecision medicine 3asilicon 3awater solubility1 aYamazaki, Tomohiko1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2136-80421 aWatanabe, Junpei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6027-31991 aSun, Hong-Tao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0003-79411 aHanagata, Nobutaka1 aShirahata, Naoto1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1217-75890 tLangmuir.g2022 Jan. 27, v. 38, no. 17 p.5188-5196dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c023263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01836naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100002100161245008800182300001600270506002800286520055200314592002800866506003700894650001800931650001200949650001000961650003000971650001501001650001901016650001001035650001601045653001301061653001601074653001401090653001101104700002401115773019401139856009601333852000901429655001201438IND60757517020221207121458.0190609e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075751702DNAL7 aDOI:10.23885/1814-3326-2007-3-2-187-1912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNabozhenko, M.V.10aReview of the genus Nalassus Mulsant, 1854 (Coleoptera, Tenebrionidae) in Daghestan  ap. 187-191.  aResource is Open Access  aReview of the genus Nalassus Mulsant, 1854 fauna of Daghestan with geographic distribution and ecology of each species is give.

Soft actuators are expected to respond quickly; however, the response speed of gels is slow. To study this issue and overcome it, thermoresponsive soft actuators were prepared by the electrophoretic adhesion of cationic and anionic thermoresponsive microgels, comprising poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) and poly(styrenesulfonate) sodium salt, respectively. The kinetics of the prepared hydrogel architectures in response to temperature depended on the microgel diameter instead of the architecture size. We also prepared bilayered hydrogel architectures by adhesion of thermoresponsive and/or nonthermoresponsive microgels. These bent rapidly in response to temperature because these architectures consisted of microgel assemblies. In addition, specific bending motion was demonstrated by the adhesion of microgel layers of different sizes. The present study provides not only a guideline for the design of hydrogel actuators with quick response but also presents a method for the free-form fabrication of functional hydrogel materials that undergo complex motions in response to stimuli.  aPublisher supplied data  a19H02778cJapan Society for the Promotion of Sciencedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001691  a20H02797cJapan Society for the Promotion of Sciencedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001691  aNAcOgasawara Foundation for the Promotion of Science and Engineeringdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100008663  aNAcIzumi Science and Technology Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100010981 3aadhesion 3aelectrophoresis 3aguidelines 3ahydrogels 3amicrogels 3asodium 3atemperature1 aTakai, Shiho1 aUyama, Hiroshi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8587-25070 tLangmuir.g2021 Oct. 19, v. 38, no. 17 p.5183-5187dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c023303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02428naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245007200164300002000236520099700256592002801253650002401281650000901305650002101314650001501335650001701350650001801367650002201385650001501407650002201422650001601444653003601460653002901496653002401525653001801549653002001567653002101587700003001608700002301638700001801661700003001679700003401709773012601743856008001869852000901949655001201958IND60528491020221119184844.0160716e20151125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052849102DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.5b076362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalaga, Kaushik10aQuasi-Solid Electrolytes for High Temperature Lithium Ion Batteries  ap. 25777-25783.  aRechargeable batteries capable of operating at high temperatures have significant use in various targeted applications.

The brush under study, PiPOx₂₃₉-g-PnPrOx₁₄, features a relatively long poly(2-isopropenyl-2-oxazoline) (PiPOx) backbone and short poly(2-n-propyl-2-oxazoline) (PnPrOx) side chains. As a solvent, ethanol is used. By model fitting, the overall size and the persistence length as well as the interaction length and interaction strength are determined. At this, the interplay between form and structure factor is taken into account. The conformation of the molecular brush is traced upon increasing the solution concentration, and a rigid-to-flexible transition is found near the overlap concentration. Finally, the results of computer simulations of the molecular brush solutions confirm the experimental results.  aPublisher supplied data  aJOc, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaftdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001659  aPAc, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaftdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001659  a16QK10AcBundesministerium f?r Bildung und Forschungdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002347 3acomputers 3aethanol 3asmall-angle X-ray scattering 3asolvents1 aSachse, Clemens1 aKo, Chia-Hsin1 aSchroer, Martin A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0747-39651 aVela, Stefano Da1 aMolodenskiy, Dmitry1 aKohlbrecher, Joachim1 aBushuev, Nikita V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7872-81201 aGumerov, Rustam A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4214-81291 aPotemkin, Igor I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6687-77321 aJordan, Rainer1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9414-15971 aPapadakis, Christine M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7098-34580 tLangmuir.g2022 Feb. 15, v. 38, no. 17 p.5226-5236dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c025893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02440naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100001900185245008800204300002000292506007600312520093200388592002801320506003701348650002101385650000801406650001601414650001301430650001901443650001901462650001101481650001901492650001101511653001601522653002501538653002401563653001701587653001901604700002101623700002201644700002101666700002101687700002201708773012901730856007801859852000901937655001201946IND60528491220221207104418.0160716e20151125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052849122DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.5b077222doi7 aPMC46672762pmcid7 a265584102pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTricinci, Omar10a3D Micropatterned Surface Inspired by Salvinia molesta via Direct Laser Lithography  ap. 25560-25567.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBiomimetic functional surfaces are attracting increasing attention for their relevant technological applications. Despite these efforts, inherent limitations of microfabrication techniques prevent the replication of complex hierarchical microstructures. Using a 3D laser lithography technique, we fabricated a 3D patterned surface bioinspired to Salvinia molesta leaves. The artificial hairs, with crownlike heads, were reproduced by scaling down (ca. 100 times smaller) the dimensions of natural features, so that microscale hairs with submicrometric resolution were attained. The micropatterned surface, in analogy with the natural model, shows interesting properties in terms of hydrophobicity and air retention when submerged by water, even if realized with a hydrophilic material. Furthermore, we successfully demonstrated the capability to promote localized condensation of water droplets from moisture in the atmosphere.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSalvinia molesta 3aair 3abiomimetics 3adroplets 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aleaves 3amicrostructure 3amodels 0abiomimetics 0a3D laser lithography 0ahydrophobic surface 0aair trapping 0afog collecting1 aTerencio, Tercio1 aMazzolai, Barbara1 aPugno, Nicola

Herein, we report a fluorescent “switch-on” probe for the reliable detection and monitoring of amyloid fibrils. The probe consists of a peptide component for binding with amyloid structure and a color component with an aggregation-induced green emission property. This probe is nonfluorescent in the presence of amyloid forming monomer protein/peptide, but fluorescence “switch-on” occurs after binding with amyloid fibrils. Compared to conventionally used thioflavin T, this probe offers a high signal-to-noise ratio, which is unaffected by the quencher ion/nanoparticle. The proposed new probe has been used for the detection and monitoring of amyloid fibrils produced by a wide variety of amyloid protein/peptides and can be extended for in vitro diagnostic applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamyloid 3acolor 3aearly diagnosis 3afluorescence 3amonitoring 3ananoparticles 3apeptides 3atherapeutics 0aamyloid fibril 0afluorescence probe 0aAlzheimer’s 0aaggregation-induced emission 0atetraphenylethene 0aamyloid detection1 aJana, Debabrata1 aGhorai, Binay K.1 aJana, Nikhil R.0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2015 Nov. 25, v. 7, no. 46 p.25813-25820dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.5b077513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03596naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100003100144245014600175300001500321520194400336592002802280650001902308650001202327650001702339650002102356650001402377650001202391650002002403650001402423650001802437650002102455650001702476650001802493650001002511650003002521650001402551650001202565650001202577651001902589651001902608651001102627653001902638653002902657653001402686653002402700700002302724700002402747700002602771700001802797700002702815773010002842856007902942852000903021655001203030IND60776210420221121234607.0220503e20220504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077621042DNAL7 a10.2478/helm-2022-00032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodríguez-Santiago, M.

However, despite its importance, there is still little knowledge about its parasitic fauna for the Mexican coasts of the Gulf of Mexico. The aims of this research were to generate a list of the parasitic fauna present in juvenile gray snapper L. griseus from a coastal lagoon located in southeastern Mexico, to evaluate the infection levels of parasites and to determine the relationship between the abundance of parasites and the fish size and condition factor. Samples of L. griseus (12 – 29.2 mm) were obtained in two periods of the year (dry and rainy seasons) to examine the intra-annual variability of its parasitic fauna. A total of 17 parasite species were recorded belonging to six taxonomic groups (Myxozoa, Monogenea, Digenea, Cestoda, Nematoda and Acanthocephala). The highest levels of infection (abundance, prevalence and intensity of infection) were found for the monogeneans Euryhaliotrema griseus and Euryhaliotrema fastigatum. There were no significant correlations between the total abundance of parasites and the fish condition and size (total length) in not any of the two seasons studied, suggesting that the body size and the biological condition index of the host did not directly influence the abundance of parasites in early life stages of L. griseus. Moreover, the species of parasites found that could be zoonotic for humans through the consumption of raw or inadequately cooked fish were the nematodes Contracaecum sp. type 1, Contracaecum sp. type 2, Cucullanus pargi and Pseudoterranova sp. The presence of the monogeneans E. griseus and E. fastigatum was also highlighted because these ectoparasite species are known to cause harm to fish under culture systems.

Proteins carry important information not available from single-cell genomics and transcriptomics studies; however, due to the minute amount of proteins in single cells and the complexity of the proteome, quantitative protein analysis at the single-cell level remains challenging. Here, we report an integrated microfluidic platform in tandem with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF–MS) for the detection and quantification of targeted proteins from small cell ensembles (> 10 cells). All necessary steps for the assay are integrated on-chip including cell lysis, protein immunocapture, tryptic digestion, and co-crystallization with the matrix solution for MALDI-MS analysis. We demonstrate that our approach is suitable for protein quantification by assessing the apoptotic protein Bcl-2 released from MCF-7 breast cancer cells, ranging from 26 to 223 cells lysed on-chip (8.75 nL wells). A limit of detection (LOD) of 11.22 nM was determined, equivalent to 5.91 × 10⁷ protein molecules per well. Additionally, the microfluidic platform design was further improved, establishing the successful quantification of Bcl-2 protein from MCF-7 cell ensembles ranging from 8 to 19 cells in 4 nL wells. The LOD in the smaller well designs for Bcl-2 resulted in 14.85 nM, equivalent to 3.57 × 10⁷ protein molecules per well. This work shows the capability of our approach to quantitatively assess proteins from cell lysate on the MIMAS platform for the first time. These results demonstrate our approach constitutes a promising tool for quantitative targeted protein analysis from small cell ensembles down to single cells, with the capability for multiplexing through parallelization and automation.  aPublisher supplied data  aR21AG067488cNational Institutes of Health 3aanalytical chemistry 3aapoptosis 3aautomation 3abreast neoplasms 3adetection limit 3agenomics 3ahuman cell lines 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3aproteome 3atranscriptomics1 aKruithoff, Rory1 aEgatz-Gomez, Ana1 aColeman, Paul D.1 aRos, Robert1 aSandrin, Todd R.1 aRos, Alexandra1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7709-83310 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2022 May, v. 414, no. 13 p.3945-3958dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870029x1618-26427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-022-04038-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03055naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245010000158300002000258520160600278592002801884650001101912650001501923650001101938650002001949650002001969650002101989650001502010650000902025650001302034650001502047650001902062650002402081653004802105653001402153653004002167653002502207700001902232700001202251700001602263700001302279700001902292700001702311700001702328773012902345856007802474852000902552655001202561IND60528493720221119185933.0160717e20151125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052849372DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.5b088172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWan, Ying10aNanoprobe-Initiated Enzymatic Polymerization for Highly Sensitive Electrochemical DNA Detection  ap. 25618-25623.  aElectrochemical DNA (E-DNA) sensors have been greatly developed and play an important role in early diagnosis of different diseases. To determine the extremely low abundance of DNA biomarkers in clinical samples, scientists are making unremitting efforts toward achieving highly sensitive and selective E-DNA sensors. Here, a novel E-DNA sensor was developed taking advantage of the signal amplification efficiency of nanoprobe-initiated enzymatic polymerization (NIEP). In the NIEP based E-DNA sensor, the capture probe DNA was thiolated at its 3′-terminal to be immobilized onto gold electrode, and the nanoprobe was fabricated by 5′-thiol-terminated signal probe DNA conjugated gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). Both of the probes could simultaneously hybridize with the target DNA to form a “sandwich” structure followed by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-catalyzed elongation of the free 3′-terminal of DNA on the nanoprobe. During the DNA elongation, biotin labels were incorporated into the NIEP-generated long single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) tentacles, leading to specific binding of avidin modified horseradish peroxidase (Av-HRP). Since there are hundreds of DNA probes on the nanoprobe, one hybridization event would generate hundreds of long ssDNA tentacles, resulting in tens of thousands of HRP catalyzed reduction of hydrogen peroxide and sharply increasing electrochemical signals. By employing nanoprobe and TdT, it is demonstrated that the NIEP amplified E-DNA sensor has a detection limit of 10 fM and excellent differentiation ability for even single-base mismatch.  aPublisher supplied data 3aavidin 3abiomarkers 3abiotin 3adetection limit 3aearly diagnosis 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3agold 3ananogold 3aperoxidase 3apolymerization 3asingle-stranded DNA 0aterminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) 0ananoprobe 0aelectrochemical DNA (E-DNA) sensors 0asignal amplification1 aWang, Pengjuan1 aSu, Yan1 aWang, Lihua1 aPan, Dun1 aAldalbahi, Ali1 aYang, Shulin1 aZuo, Xiaolei0 tACS applied materials .g2015 Nov. 25, v. 7, no. 46 p.25618-25623dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.5b088173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02256naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001800161245017300179300001600352506002800368520083700396592002801233506003701261650001001298650001101308650001201319650001501331650001601346651001501362651002001377653001201397653001401409653001001423653001401433653001601447653001701463653001601480653000801496700001901504773019401523856009601717852000901813655001201822IND60757521620221207134421.0190420e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075752162DNAL7 aDOI:10.23885/1814-3326-2011-7-2-241-2512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKustov, S.Yu.14aThe review of dance-flies subgenus Leptempis Collin, 1926 of the genus Empis Linnaeus, 1758 (Diptera: Empididae) from the Caucasus with description of three new species  ap. 241-251.  aResource is Open Access  aCurrently the subgenus Leptempis Collin, 1926 of the genus Empis Linnaeus, 1758 includes 10 species known from the Caucasus, including 3 new species described in this paper: E.

Here, a three-dimensional (3D) porous g-C₃N₄/graphene oxide aerogel (CNGA) has been prepared by the hydrothermal coassembly of two-dimensional g-C₃N₄ and graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets, in which g-C₃N₄ acts as an efficient photocatalyst, and GO supports the 3D framework and promotes the electron transfer simultaneously. In CNGA, the highly interconnected porous network renders numerous pathways for rapid mass transport, strong adsorption and multireflection of incident light; meanwhile, the large planar interface between g-C₃N₄ and GO nanosheets increases the active site and electron transfer rate. Consequently, the methyl orange removal ratio over the CNGA photocatalyst reaches up to 92% within 4 h, which is much higher than that of pure g-C₃N₄ (12%), 2D hybrid counterpart (30%) and most of representative g-C₃N₄-based photocatalysts. In addition, the dye is mostly decomposed into CO₂ under natural sunlight irradiation, and the catalyst can also be easily recycled from solution. Significantly, when utilized for CO₂ photoreduction, the optimized CNGA sample could reduce CO₂ into CO with a high yield of 23 mmol g–¹ (within 6 h), exhibiting about 2.3-fold increment compared to pure g-C₃N₄. The photocatalyst exploited in this study may become an attractive material in many environmental and energy related applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3aadsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3acarbon nitride 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy conversion 3agraphene oxide 3airradiation 3amass transfer 3amethyl orange 3ananosheets 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aremediation 3asolar energy 3asolar radiation 0ag-C3N4 0agraphene oxide 0athree-dimensional aerogel 0avisible-light 0aphotocatalyst1 aYang, Dong1 aShi, Jiafu1 aNan, Yanhu1 aSun, Yuanyuan1 aJiang, Zhongyi0 tACS applied materials .g2015 Nov. 25, v. 7, no. 46 p.25693-25701dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.5b095033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01676naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100001300159245014400172300001400316506002800330520036000358592002800718506003700746650001800783650001600801651001000817653001500827653001800842653001900860653001300879653001600892653002200908653001200930653001000942700001700952700001400969773019200983856009401175852000901269655001201278IND60757522620221207123557.0190415e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075752262DNAL7 aDOI:10.23885/1814-3326-2013-9-1-89-942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Y.C.10aTwo new species of the genus Bioramix Bates, 1879 (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae: Platyscelidini), from the Chinese Provinces Sichuan and Tibet  ap. 89-94.  aResource is Open Access  aTwo new species of the genus Bioramix Bates, 1879 are described from China: Bioramix igori sp. n.

However, snowmelt effects on suspended sediment (SS) and phosphorus (P) loss are poorly documented in Canada. Using two agricultural watersheds in Eastern Canada, this study aimed to quantify SS and P loss during the snowmelt period and to investigate how snowmelt contributes SS and P loss. Water samples were collected from the outlets of the Bras d’Henri watershed (BHW, 2007–2009) and Black Brook watershed (BBW, 2008–2009) and measured for SS and P concentrations. Hydrological parameters (precipitation, snow water equivalent, and runoff discharge), soil frozen status and soil temperature were also measured. Results revealed inter-annual variation of snowmelt conditions and SS and P losses in each watershed. The 2008 snowmelt in BHW and BBW mainly occurred on unfrozen soils, while the 2007 and 2009 snowmelts in BHW and 2009 snowmelt in BBW mainly on frozen soils. In BHW, 2008 snowmelt caused much higher median concentrations of SS, total P (TP), dissolved P (DP) and particulate P (PP) in stream water than 2007 and 2009; ratios of PP fractions in TP were variable with events but the median values were similar, suggesting both DP and PP important contrubutors to TP loss. In BBW, the median concentration of dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) in stream water was greater in 2008 snowmelt than in 2009 snowmelt; PP dominated TP loss. This study also suggests that soil state (i.e. frozen status) and rainfall were the most important factors influencing SS and P losses during snowmelt. Furthermore, snowmelt P export represented more than 20% of the total annual P export in BHW, and more than 12% of the annual DRP export in BBW. Thus, we strongly recommend adopting Best Management Practices (BMPs) that specifically target sediment and P loss during snowmelt.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural watersheds 3abest management practices 3aexports 3afrozen soils 3aphosphorus 3arain 3arunoff 3asediments 3asnow 3asnowmelt 3asoil temperature 3aCanada1 avan Bochove, E.1 aThériault, G.1 aNovotna, B.1 aKhaldoune, J.1 aDenault, J.T.1 aZhou, J.1 aNolin, M.C.1 aHu, C.X.1 aBernier, M.1 aBenoy, G.1 aXing, Z.S.1 aChow, L.0 tAgricultural water management.g2011 Mar., v. 98, no. 5 p.867-876dElsevier B.V.x0378-37747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2010.12.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02452naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002300112245016700135300001600302506002800318520116100346592002801507506003701535650002801572650002801600650002301628650001901651650002501670650001701695650001501712650001101727650001301738650001701751650001901768653003101787653001101818653001101829653001101840653001301851700002101864773013601885852000902021655001202030IND60757523020221207123558.0211030e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075752302DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarshasbi, Mahdieh10aInvestigation of presence of folate on physicochemical and anticancer properties of beta-lactoglobulin nanocapsules against human colon cancer cell line of HTC116  ap. 173-182.  aResource is Open Access  aNanotechnology-based targeting drug delivery systems have a considerable potential in medicine. Therefore, the present study aimed to designe, synthesise and characterize a nanodrug with beta lactoglobulin coating including oxali-palladium with and without folate and to compare their anti-cancer effects. The physicochemical properties of nanocapsules were studied by Dynamic light scattering (DLS), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Finally, the anticancer activities of nanodrugs were investigated against human colorectal cancer cell line of HCT116 by MTT and flowcytometry methods. The results of Dynamic light scattering (DLS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) showed that the average size of nanocapsules with folate were less than 40 nm. Cytotoxicity results proved the dose- and time-dependent antiproliferation and anicancer activities of nanocapsules (with folate) against HCT116. Finally, it could be concluded that folate increase anticancer activity of nanodrugs and it might be considered as a new candidate in the design and synthesis of new drugs in cancer treatment.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantineoplastic activity 3aatomic force microscopy 3abeta-lactoglobulin 3acancer therapy 3acolorectal neoplasms 3acytotoxicity 3afolic acid 3ahumans 3amedicine 3ananocapsules 3aneoplasm cells 0abeta lactoglobulin protein 0ahct116 0afolate 0apectin 0ananodrug1 aDivsalar, Adeleh0 tYāftah/hā-yi nuvīn dar ̒ulūm-i zīstī.g2021 Oct., v. 8, no. 3 p.173-182dKharazmi UniversitywJournal:27935x2476-71157nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03157naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012100169300001600290520179200306592002802098650002702126650001502153650002602168650002702194650000902221650001402230650001402244650000902258650001902267653002702286653001702313653002302330653001902353653002202372653001402394700005902408700002202467773015102489856008602640852000902726655001202735IND60528495120221119190022.0190214e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052849512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2016.01.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHess, Sybille10aTerritorial aggression reduces vigilance but increases aggression towards predators in a cooperatively breeding fish  ap. 229-235.  aIn many species, aggressive individuals outcompete their less aggressive conspecifics for resources such as food and access to mates. Nevertheless, variation in aggression is maintained in populations, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here we tested the hypothesis that aggressive behaviours compromise the antipredator behaviour of prey, which would link aggressive behaviours to a cost of predation. We presented computer-animated images of predators to the cooperatively breeding cichlid fish Neolamprologus pulcher either during territorial contests with a group of territory intruders or when the test fish were alone. We investigated their response latencies and the behaviour directed towards predator images. We found that test fish responded to the predator images significantly later during territorial contests than when they were alone. Moreover, during territorial contests, response latencies of test fish increased with increasing levels of aggression towards conspecifics. Test fish also responded more aggressively to the predator images during territorial contests than when they were alone. During territorial contests, fish that responded later to the predator images were more aggressive towards these images. Our findings suggest that territorial contests compromised the ability of prey to respond quickly to predators. However, we propose that increased aggression towards predators might increase survival chances of prey during predator encounters in nature, and it may thus compensate for costs incurred by delayed predator responses during territorial contests. To test this hypothesis experiments under natural predation regimes that examine the relationship between predation risk, territorial and antipredator aggression are required.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNeolamprologus pulcher 3aaggression 3aalloparental behavior 3aantipredatory behavior 3afish 3apredation 3apredators 3arisk 3aterritoriality 0aantipredator behaviour 0acichlid fish 0acomputer animation 0apredation risk 0aterritory defence 0atrade-off1 aFischer, Stefan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8811-75181 aTaborsky, Barbara0 tAnimal behaviour.g2016 Mar., v. 113 p.229-235dElsevier LtdaThe Association for the Study of Animal BehaviourwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2016.01.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03063naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245009400166300001800260520182300278592002802101596004702129596004702176650001402223650002502237650001002262650001702272650001402289650002202303650001402325650001802339650001602357700001802373700005902391773014702450856008302597852000902680655001202689IND60776213720221122082539.0220503e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077621372DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-022-04047-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Scott T.10aPannexin1 channels regulate mechanically stimulated but not spontaneous adenosine release  ap. 3781-3789.  aFast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) is a rapid technique to measure neuromodulators, and using FSCV, two modes of rapid adenosine have been discovered. Spontaneous transients occur randomly in the brain, while mechanical stimulation also causes a rapid adenosine event. Pannexin1 channels are membrane channels that transport ions, including ATP, out of the cell where it is rapidly broken down into adenosine. Pannexin 1 channels (Panx1) have a flickering mode of rapid opening and are also mechanically stimulated. Here, we test the extent to which pannexin channels, specifically pannexin1 (Panx1) channels, are responsible for rapid adenosine events. Spontaneous adenosine release or mechanosensitive adenosine release were measured using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry in hippocampal (CA1) brain slices. In global Panx1KO mice, there is no significant difference in the frequency or concentration of spontaneous adenosine release, indicating Panx1 is not a release mechanism for spontaneous adenosine. Spontaneous adenosine frequency decreased slightly after administration of a large (100 µM) dose of carbenoxolone, a nonspecific inhibitor of many pannexin and connexin channels, suggesting other hemichannels only play a small role at most. For mechanically stimulated adenosine release, the concentration of each adenosine event significantly decreased 30% in Panx1KO mice and the frequency of stimulations that evoked adenosine also decreased. The response was similar in WT mice with carbenoxolone. Thus, Panx1 is a release mechanism for mechanically stimulated adenosine release, but not the only mechanism. These results demonstrate that pannexin channels differentially regulate rapid adenosine release and could be targeted to differentially affect mechanically stimulated adenosine due to brain damage.  aPublisher supplied data  aR01EB026497cNational Institutes of Health  aR01NS076875cNational Institutes of Health 3aadenosine 3aanalytical chemistry 3abrain 3abrain damage 3aconnexins 3aneurotransmitters 3apannexins 3arapid methods 3avoltammetry1 aChang, Yuanyu1 aVenton, B.

Yet little is known about contaminant levels in tropical seabird communities located in key biodiversity points. French Guiana is a hotspot of biodiversity and is one of the regions experiencing a rampant increase in mercury (Hg) contamination. This review has the objective to summarize the results of (i) previous work on Hg contamination in seabirds from French Guiana and (ii) already published work on other environmental contaminant sources as persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Furthermore, previous research on Grand Connétable island, a key breeding site for Caribbean seabirds, reported high blood Hg concentrations in several seabirds, reaching the threshold of possible health concern for some species, particularly for the magnificent frigatebird Fregata magnificens. Because frigatebirds are experiencing massive mortality events of chicks caused by a herpesvirus disease that first appeared in 2005, this review further discusses a potential synergistic or additive interaction between food availability and Hg exposure in determining the recurrent disease outbreaks, a topic that has been often neglected in the literature. Here, we (i) summarize already published results from several years of research on this topic and (ii) suggest a potential connection between the occurrence of infectious diseases and cumulative effects of environmental stressors in marine top predators including birds, which clearly deserves further investigations. We also highlight the lack of studies on other sources of local pollution rather than Hg, and the need to take into consideration the cumulative effects of stressors on the health status of organisms, rather than focus on individual stressors or specific contaminants.  aPublisher supplied data  aSENTINEL projectcCNRS 3aFregata 3abiodiversity 3abiodiversity conservation 3ablood 3adisease occurrence 3afood availability 3ahealth status 3amalnutrition 3amortality 3apollution 3aseabirds 3aCaribbean 3aFrench Guiana1 aCostantini, David1 aEens, Marcel1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7538-35421 aPineau, Kevin1 aBustamante, Paco1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3877-93901 aChastel, Olivier0 tRegional environmental change.g2022 June, v. 22, no. 2 p.63-63dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000000303x1436-37987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10113-022-01914-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01610naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001600161245018100177300001600358506002800374520031900402592002800721506003700749650001600786650001000802651000900812653001500821653001600836653000900852653001400861653001000875653001600885700002100901700001500922773019400937856009601131852000901227655001201236IND60757524120221207131411.0190418e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075752412DNAL7 aDOI:10.23885/1814-3326-2012-8-2-232-2392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhobari, H.10aContribution to the knowledge of the jewel beetles (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) fauna of Kurdistan Province of Iran.

In the guppy, Poecilia reticulata, a male approaching a female abandons his courtship when a rival male appears next to the focal female; however, the effect of the relative quality of the males on this behavioural change is unknown. We show here that male guppies abandon their approach to a female only when the rival male is phenotypically superior. Both natural and artificially induced brightly coloured males continued to approach a female even when the rival male was brightly coloured, but both natural and induced dull-coloured males abandoned their approach to a female when the rival was brightly coloured. Males decided their behaviours on the basis of their own appearance, not on their genotypes, because artificially induced brightly and dull-coloured brothers differed in their behaviour. Our results show that male mate choice behaviour is finely tuned to maximize the probability of acceptance by the approached female.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPoecilia reticulata 3aanimal behavior 3abehavior change 3abrothers 3acourtship 3afemales 3agenotype 3amales 3aprobability 0afemale preference 0aguppy 0amale preference 0amate choice 0asexual selection1 aOhkubo, Yusaku1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1847-80051 aKarino, Kenji1 aHasegawa, Eisuke0 tAnimal behaviour.g2016 Aug., v. 118 p.33-37dElsevier LtdaThe Association for the Study of Animal BehaviourwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2016.05.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04064naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100002300158245009100181300001600272506002800288520269000316592002803006506003703034650001103071650001803082650001203100650001003112650001603122650001003138650002103148653001803169653002103187653002003208653001803228653001703246653001903263653002803282653001003310700002303320773018503343856009303528852000903621655001203630IND60757524420221207131407.0211027e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075752442DNAL7 a10.30766/2072-9081.2021.22.5.725-7342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPodgaetskiy, M.

Nineteen previously created selected forms were studied for winter resistance components under controlled conditions, for resistance to major fungal diseases, productivity components, strength and biochemical composition of fruits. The zoned Gusar variety was used as the control. The work was carried out in 2018-2020 according to generally accepted techniques. Artificial freezing of raspberry stems was carried out in the climate chamber TH-6 JEIO TECH. According to the results of the studies, selected forms 8-10х-1, 6-125-4, which have an increased resistance to certain components of winter resistance, have been identified. Hybrids 2-115-1 and 1-188-1 have cumulative resistance to winter damage factors. Based on the integrated resistance of raspberry hybrids to the main fungal diseases, new sources have been revealed: forms 1-124-1, 2-115-1, 2-115-2, 1-111-21, 1-8-2, 2-35-1, 2-90-3, 6-125-4, 3-4-2, 8-10х-1, 4-33-21 and 4-122-2. The degree of their damage did not have a significant influence on winter hardiness, productivity and quality of berries. As the result of study of components of the raspberry productivity, selected forms (1-111-21, 2-90-2 and 2-90-3), forming fruits with an average weight of more than 4.0 g, and genotypes with large and one-dimensional fruits (1-176-21, 2-35-1, 4-33-21, 1-124-1) not growing smaller from picking to picking were identified. The highest potential productivity was noted for selections 2-115-1, 1-111-21, 1-188-1, 4-46-2, 2-90-2 and 2-90-3, capable to form a yield of more than 1.3 kg per bush. The selections 1-124-1, 2-90-2 and 2-90-3 are distinguished by an increased strength of the fruits. They form fruits with a crushing force exceeding 5.0 N, which ensures the safety of integrity and transportability when manually harvested. No complex sources of increased accumulation of biologically active substances have been identified. Genotypes with a high content of individual biochemical substances were selected. The highest accumulation of soluble solids and sugars was noted in the samples 2-90-3, 18-11-4 and 2-115-1. Highest accumulation o the vitamin C was observed in the samples 6-125-4 (59.8 mg/100 g) and 2-90-3 (61.5 mg/100 g). As new sources in breeding to improve the taste characteristics of raspberry, it is necessary to use selected forms 2-90-2, 2-115-1 and 6-125-4, approaching in taste to the standard variety Novost Kuzmina. Selected forms 2-90-2, 2-90-3 and 2-115-1 are new sources in raspberry breeding, combining a complex of economically valuable traits at a high level.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRussia 3aascorbic acid 3aclimate 3afungi 3araspberries 3ataste 3awinter hardiness 0aselected form 0awinter hardiness 0afungal diseases 0alarge-fruited 0aproductivity 0afruit strength 0abiochemical composition 0ataste1 aEvdokimenko, S.

Regardless of composition, groups generally have one nest at a time at which all individuals participate in provisioning offspring. We tested the hypothesis that provisioning behaviour serves a signalling function used to gain social advantages within groups by enhancing dominance or social prestige, or by reducing the likelihood of being expelled from the group (‘pay-to-stay’). We found that birds adjusted their provisioning behaviour based on the activities of other group members by clumping their visits and by alternating their visits with other group members, thus synchronizing and coordinating provisioning within groups. Despite this evidence that acorn woodpeckers respond to the provisioning behaviour of other group members, analyses of feeding rates and patterns of overlap revealed no support for the hypothesis that provisioning functions as a signal to other group members in any of three ways: breeder males signalling to breeder females to increase their probability of mating; helpers signalling to other helpers to enhance their dominance or social prestige; or helpers signalling to breeders to reduce the probability that they will be considered ‘lazy’ and be evicted from the group. Our results add to previous studies that have thus far failed to support a signalling function for provisioning behaviour in avian cooperative breeders.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMelanerpes formicivorus 3aalloparental behavior 3afeeding behavior 3afemales 3afruits 3amales 3anests 3aprobability 3aprogeny 3asiblings 3asocial dominance 3awoodpeckers 0acooperative breeding 0apay-to-stay 0aprovisioning behaviour 0asignalling 0asocial prestige1 aWalters, Eric L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9414-57580 tAnimal behaviour.g2016 Sept., v. 119 p.125-134dElsevier LtdaThe Association for the Study of Animal BehaviourwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2016.06.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02417naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245010500174300001600279520126800295592002801563596008601591650001401677650001301691650002001704650003301724650001501757700002601772700002601798700005801824773011701882856008301999852000902082655001202091IND60776214620221122082616.0220503e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077621462DNAL7 a10.1007/s10337-022-04153-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ados Santos, Rayssa A.10aMultivariate Optimization and Validation of HPLC Method for Determination of Spiramycin I in Tablets  ap. 421-431.  aSpiramycin (SPY) is an antibiotic belonging to the class of macrolides. Its main structurally related components are SPY I, SPY II and SPY III. The aim of this work was to optimize and validate a simple and fast method of quantification of SPY I in tablets in the presence of SPYs II and III by HPLC based on multivariate approach. Initially, different conditions were tested by means of a complete factorial design 2³. Afterward, the chromatographic parameters were optimized using the Doehlert Matrix and response surface methodology, which allowed to obtain an efficient separation for SPY I with relatively short retention time (16 min). The new method was validated using phosphoric acid 0.1% and methanol (67:33, v/v) as mobile phase, flow rate at 1.0 mL min⁻¹, C8 column (250 mm × 4.6 mm × 5 µm) as stationary phase and UV detection at 232 nm. The method proved to be selective, linear, accurate, with good reproducibility, robust, useful, simple, and efficient for the quantification of SPY I in pharmaceutical tablets. Thus, multivariate approach proved to be an excellent strategy for method optimization with a reduced number of experiments without the need for additional cost with expensive equipment or chromatographic columns.  aPublisher supplied data  aFinance Code 001cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior 3aequipment 3amethanol 3aphosphoric acid 3aresponse surface methodology 3aspiramycin1 ados Santos, Leonor A.1 ade Araújo, Magali B.1 aBonfilio, Rudy1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8884-36910 tChromatographia.g2022 May, v. 85, no. 5 p.421-431dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl1915x0009-58937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10337-022-04153-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03580naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005800151245009200209300001600301520192700317592002802244650002602272650002702298650001302325650001002338650003102348650001102379650002002390650001102410650001402421650001402435650001502449650001202464650002002476650000902496650002602505650001202531650001202543653001502555653002002570653002602590653001902616653003102635653002602666700005902692700002102751700003202772773015102804856008602955852000903041655001203050IND60528496420221117001204.0190214e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052849642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2016.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManenti, Raoul1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6071-819410aAmphibians breeding in refuge habitats have larvae with stronger antipredator responses  ap. 115-121.  aAntipredator responses are a key determinant of the successful persistence of prey, and behavioural modifications are a frequent antipredator strategy. However, conspecific populations often inhabit heterogeneous environments. This can determine local adaptations, and might also induce variation in antipredator responses. Nevertheless, there is limited information on whether heterogeneity of predation risk among populations determines variation in antipredator response. Here we studied the fire salamander, Salamandra salamandra, a species that can breed in both surface streams and caves, habitats that are predator-rich and predator-free, respectively, and measured differences in antipredator responses across populations with different predation risk. We combined field surveys and laboratory experiments to understand the role of predation risk on the activity patterns of larvae, while measuring behavioural differences between populations. We reared larvae from different habitats in safe and risky conditions and tested their response to predator cues before and after rearing. In the field, predation risk was much higher in surface streams than in caves; larvae moved more in the absence of predators and when the light intensity was low. During laboratory experiments, larvae were less active if reared in risky conditions, but cave larvae showed a stronger response to risk than stream larvae. Therefore, larvae from sites without predators showed higher antipredator responses than those from risky habitats. This response fits the predictions of the risk allocation model, in which prey from habitats with a high background level of risk need to be active even when predators are present, to satisfy their energetic demands. Our findings show that antipredator behaviour may differ strongly between populations and stress the importance of integrating this variability in studies on predatory responses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalamandra salamandra 3aantipredatory behavior 3abreeding 3acaves 3alaboratory experimentation 3alarvae 3alight intensity 3amodels 3apredation 3apredators 3aprediction 3arearing 3arefuge habitats 3arisk 3asalamanders and newts 3astreams 3asurveys 0aamphibians 0abackground risk 0abehavioural avoidance 0apredation risk 0arisk allocation hypothesis 0aSalamandra salamandra1 aMelotto, Andrea1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6783-15011 aDenoël, Mathieu1 aFicetola, Gentile Francesco0 tAnimal behaviour.g2016 Aug., v. 118 p.115-121dElsevier LtdaThe Association for the Study of Animal BehaviourwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2016.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02377naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245007700171300001600248520115200264592002801416650002001444650002001464650002001484650003501504650001101539650001501550650002001565653002801585653002301613653002801636653003001664653002301694700001701717700002201734700002801756773010001784856008601884852000901970655001201979IND60528496520221117002105.0190214e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052849652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2016.06.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrieur, Jacques10aGorillas are right-handed for their most frequent intraspecific gestures  ap. 165-170.  aInvestigations of intraspecific laterality of primates' gestural communication aim to shed light on the evolutionary origins of human handedness and language. Currently, little is known concerning laterality of gestures for purely intraspecific communication. As far as we know, this study is the first to assess laterality of gorillas' purely intraspecific gestures at the population level. We analysed hand use in dyadic interactions in 35 gorillas, Gorilla gorilla gorilla, living in three groups in captivity focusing on their most frequent communication gesture types. We revealed a right-hand bias at the population level for the majority of the most frequent gestures recorded. Our findings support the evolutionary theories predicting that population level asymmetry should be found in fitness-relevant social behaviours and could be explained by an evolutionarily stable strategy based on intraspecific interactions. They also agree with reports evidencing predominant right-hand use for gestural communication by nonhuman primates and suggesting that gestural laterality is a precursor of the left-hemispheric lateralization of language.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGorilla gorilla 3aanimal behavior 3acaptive animals 3aevolutionarily stable strategy 3ahumans 3aprediction 3asocial behavior 0acerebral lateralization 0agestural asymmetry 0aGorilla gorilla gorilla 0aintraspecific interaction 0alanguage evolution1 aPika, Simone1 aBarbu, Stéphanie1 aBlois-Heulin, Catherine0 tAnimal behaviour.g2016 Aug., v. 118 p.165-170dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2016.06.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03304naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245012800171300001400299520172800313592002802041650001102069650002102080650001502101650002502116650001902141650001602160650001302176650001202189650000902201650004102210650001402251650003702265650002302302650001002325650001602335650002202351650001802373651001002391653003002401653002502431653003102456653001702487653002102504653002102525700001602546700001602562773010002578856008702678852000902765655001202774IND60543007220221117234050.0190408e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054300722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2013.06.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEssumang, D.K.10aEffective reduction of PAH contamination in smoke cured fish products using charcoal filters in a modified traditional kiln  ap. 85-93.  aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) contaminations in Ghanaian smoke-cured fish are known to be in high levels. This may be linked to the recent upsurge of cancer cases among the population because PAHs are well-known carcinogens. A modified traditional kiln fitted with charcoal filters to remove PAHs by adsorption from the smoke before it contacted the fish being smoke-cured was designed. Smoke-curing was done for 4 h with three most used smoke wood types- in Ghana namely acacia, sugarcane bagasse and mangroves. The smoking was done with no charcoal filter and compared to smoking with two types of activated charcoals fitted to the designed traditionally modified kiln. PAHs in smoke-cured fish samples (n = 108) using the designed system were analysed using Varian GC/MS (3800-GC) system. The mean total PAHs levels in the experimental smoked fish samples analysed ranged from 212.56 to 472.98 μg/kg in samples smoke cured with – activated charcoal filters. The mean percent reductions (efficiency of Kiln) were 21–69%. The mean Benzo[a]pyrene levels in all fish cured using the modified traditional kiln with charcoal filters in place were below the Turkish Codex's maximum limit of 2.0 μg/kg. An ANOVA analysis conducted at 95% CL showed statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) in PAH levels between smoking with no charcoal filters and those with charcoal as filters. No statistical significant differences (P > 0.05) were obtained between the two smoking processes with charcoal filters. Fish obtained from the modified traditional kiln were of good organoleptic quality (moisture content < 65% as recommended) and the use of charcoal filters in fish smoking should be encouraged.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcacia 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3aanalysis of variance 3abenzo(a)pyrene 3acarcinogens 3acharcoal 3afilters 3afish 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aneoplasms 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3asensory properties 3asmoke 3asmoked fish 3asugarcane bagasse 3awater content 3aGhana 0aModified traditional kiln 0aPAHs level reduction 0aActivated charcoal filters 0aSmoke-curing 0aSmoke-cured fish 0aMoisture content1 aDodoo, D.K.1 aAdjei, J.K.0 tFood control.g2014 Jan., v. 35, no. 1 p.85-93dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2013.06.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02974naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100006000188245008300248300001100331506007600342520130700418592002801725506003701753650001701790650002101807650002601828650002201854650001501876650001301891650002601904650001701930650002901947650002801976650002402004650001902028650001702047650002102064650003202085650001602117650003702133650001702170650002902187650002202216700002002238773010702258856008202365852000902447655001202456IND60588679220221207073406.0180619e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058867922DNAL7 a10.1007/s13205-017-1044-72doi7 aPMC57350412pmcid7 a292766602pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbraham, Jayanthi1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5005-308810aProfiling of red pigment produced by Streptomyces sp.

The biologically active compound responsible for antimicrobial and anticancer activity of the strain JAR6 was elucidated by solid state fermentation followed by subsequent chromatographic and spectroscopic analysis. Extraction, purification and structural confirmation of red pigment metabolite viz undecylprodigiosin were established on the basis of spectroscopic studies and comparing the data from the literature. The biologically active compound was tested against Gram-positive and Gram-negative clinical isolates and its minimum inhibitory concentration was recorded. The antimicrobial activity of undecylprodigiosin is more prominent against Salmonella sp., Proteus mirabilis, Shigella sp. and Enterococcus sp. whereas, it was less effective against Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumonia and Escherichia coli. The anticancer activity of undecylprodigiosin was tested against HeLa cell lines and it exhibited commendable cytotoxicity effect with IC₅₀ value of 145 µg/ml. The present investigation reveals that undecylprodigiosin produced by Streptomyces strain JAR6 is a potent bioactive metabolite with effective pharmaceutical properties.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEnterococcus 3aEscherichia coli 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3aProteus mirabilis 3aSalmonella 3aShigella 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aStreptomyces 3aantimicrobial properties 3aantineoplastic activity 3abioactive compounds 3achromatography 3acytotoxicity 3ahuman cell lines 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3ametabolites 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3aplant litter 3asolid state fermentation 3aspectral analysis1 aChauhan, Ritika0 t3 Biotech.g2018 Jan., v. 8, no. 1 p.22-22dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:22884x2190-572X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-017-1044-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02496naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001900188245011600207300001100323506007600334520107900410592002801489506003701517650001601554650001201570650002001582650001001602650001501612650001901627650001201646650001001658650003001668650002501698650001101723700001801734700001601752700001401768700001501782700001401797700001701811773010701828856008201935852000902017655001202026IND60588679620221207062145.0180619e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058867962DNAL7 a10.1007/s13205-017-1041-x2doi7 aPMC57364982pmcid7 a292798192pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLong, Chuannan10aImprovement in xylooligosaccharides production by knockout of the β-xyl1 gene in Trichoderma orientalis EU7-22  ap. 26.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe goal of this study was to enhance the production of xylooligosaccharides (XOs) and reduce the production of xylose. We investigated β-xylosidases, which were key enzymes in the hydrolysis of xylan into xylose, in Trichoderma orientalis EU7-22. The binary vector pUR5750G/bxl::hph was constructed to knock out the β-xyl1 gene (encoding β-xylosidases) in T. orientalis EU7-22 by homologous integration, producing the mutant strain T. orientalis Bxyl-1. Xylanase activity for strain Bxyl-1 was 452.42 IU/mL, which increased by only 0.07% compared to that of parental strain EU7-22, whereas β-xylosidase activity was 0.06 IU/mL, representing a 91.89% decrease. When xylanase (200 IU/g xylan), produced by T. orientalis EU7-22 and T. orientalis Bxyl-1, was used to hydrolyze beechwood xylan, in contrast to the parental strain, the XOs were enhanced by 83.27%, whereas xylose decreased by 45.80% after 36 h in T. orientalis Bxyl-1. Based on these results, T. orientalis Bxyl-1 has great potential for application in the production of XOs from lignocellulosic biomass.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aTrichoderma 3abiomass 3aenzyme activity 3agenes 3ahydrolysis 3alignocellulose 3amutants 3axylan 3axylan 1,4-beta-xylosidase 3axylooligosaccharides 3axylose1 aCui, Jingjing1 aLi, Hailong1 aLiu, Jian1 aGan, Lihui1 aZeng, Bin1 aLong, Minnan0 t3 Biotech.g2018 Jan., v. 8, no. 1 p.26-26dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:22884x2190-572X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-017-1041-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02181naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002000188245011500208300001100323506007600334520096200410592002801372506003701400650000801437650002601445650001901471650001601490650003001506650001401536650001601550700005501566773010701621856008201728852000901810655001201819IND60588679720221207062216.0180619e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058867972DNAL7 a10.1007/s13205-017-1052-72doi7 aPMC57400382pmcid7 a292766632pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhong, Junliang10aDetection of viable but non-culturable Escherichia coli O157:H7 by PCR in combination with propidium monoazide  ap. 28.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe aim of this study was to evaluate the applicability of the conventional PCR detection method combined with propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment for the detection of viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state Escherichia coli O157:H7 in ground beef meatballs. Under low temperature, E. coli O157:H7 cells were induced into the VBNC state in ground beef meatballs at − 20 °C after 152 days. The optimal PMA concentration of 5 µg/mL was obtained in beef meatball samples, which could completely inhibit the DNA amplification on dead cells (10⁶ cells/mL) but with no inhibition on viable cells. The established PMA-PCR assay revealed that the VBNC counts exceeded 10⁷ CFU/mL in artificial contamination beef samples, which could be used for semi-quantitative detection of VBNC cells in beef meatball samples. This study indicated that the PMA-PCR assay might be a potential method for detection of VBNC state E. coli O157:H7 cells in food products.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aEscherichia coli O157 3acell viability 3aground beef 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apropidium 3atemperature1 aZhao, Xihong1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1491-78080 t3 Biotech.g2018 Jan., v. 8, no. 1 p.28-28dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:22884x2190-572X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-017-1052-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03179naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001400188245015700202300001100359506007600370520153000446592002801976506003702004650004102041650002302082650001302105650001902118650002402137650001902161650001802180650000902198650002102207650001302228650001402241650001802255650002502273650001402298650001102312650002102323650001002344650002402354700001702378700001702395700001802412700001702430773011102447856008202558852000902640655001202649IND60588680020221207070837.0180619e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058868002DNAL7 a10.1186/s13567-017-0494-62doi7 aPMC57409212pmcid7 a292687872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yuan,10aSalmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis vector delivering SaoA antigen confers protection against Streptococcus suis serotypes 2 and 7 in mice and pigs  ap. 89.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aStreptococcus suis is one of the major pathogens that cause economic losses in the swine industry worldwide. However, current bacterins only provide limited prophylactic protection in the field. An ideal vaccine against S. suis should protect pigs against the clinical diseases caused by multiple serotypes, or at least protect against the dominant serotype in a given geographic region. A new recombinant Salmonella enterica serotype Choleraesuis vaccine vector, rSC0011, that is based on the regulated delayed attenuation system and regulated delayed antigen synthesis system, was developed recently. In this study, an improved recombinant attenuated Salmonella Choleraesuis vector, rSC0016, was developed by incorporating a sopB mutation to ensure adequate safety and maximal immunogenicity. In the spleens of mice, rSC0016 colonized less than rSC0011. rSC0016 and rSC0011 colonized similarly in Peyer’s patches of mice. The recombinant vaccine rSC0016(pS-SaoA) induced stronger cellular, humoral, and mucosal immune responses in mice and swine against SaoA, a conserved surface protein that is present in many S. suis serotypes, than did rSC0011(pS-SaoA) without sopB or rSC0018(pS-SaoA), which is an avirulent, chemically attenuated vaccine strain. rSC0016(pS-SaoA) provided 100% protection against S. suis serotype 2 in mice and pigs, and full cross-protection against SS7 in pigs. This new vaccine vector provides a foundation for the development of a universal vaccine against multiple serotypes of S. suis in pigs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSalmonella choleraesuis Choleraesuis 3aStreptococcus suis 3aantigens 3across immunity 3afinancial economics 3aimmunogenicity 3alive vaccines 3amice 3amucosal immunity 3amutation 3apathogens 3apork industry 3arecombinant vaccines 3aserotypes 3aspleen 3asurface proteins 3aswine 3aveterinary medicine1 aJi, Zhenying1 aWang, Xiaobo1 aWang, Shifeng1 aShi, Huoying0 tVeterinary research.g2017 Dec., v. 48, no. 1 p.89-89dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4142873x1297-97167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13567-017-0494-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03173naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245015400177300001100331520174400342592002802086650001502114650001202129650002202141650001502163650002202178650000902200650002702209650001202236650001702248650001002265650001102275650001502286650001502301650001502316650001402331650002002345650001302365650003402378650001602412651001002428700002802438700002602466773010802492856008202600852000902682655001202691IND60588680220221116165705.0180619e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058868022DNAL7 a10.1186/s13570-017-0103-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKagunyu, AnastasiaWanjiku10aDevelopment agents and their role in cushioning the pastoralists of Isiolo Central Sub-County, Kenya, against negative effects of climate variability  ap. 33.  aClimate variability is a natural phenomenon, and of late, it is becoming more frequent and more intensive especially in the arid and semi-arid lands (ASALs). This has affected the livelihoods and the coping strategies of the pastoral communities of the ASALs of Kenya. As a result, there was need to conduct a study and assess the type of development agents existing in the region and the type of assistance they provided. This study applied household interviews, focus group discussions and key informant interviews to collect data. Quantitative data was analysed using SPSS software and descriptive statistics were run. The study revealed that there are various development agents who assist the pastoralists of Isiolo, namely government departments, NGOs and faith-based organizations. The type of assistance given included resettlements, human and livestock medicine, restocking, destocking, subsistence funds for the old people, relief foods and livestock feeds. The study findings also indicate that the assistance given was inadequate and this was attributed to poor leadership, selfishness and marginalization. In most cases inappropriate interventions were put in place such as providing maize to the community when what they really needed was livestock for restocking. For the pastoralists of Isiolo County to benefit from development agents there is need for proper coordination of development agents assisting livestock communities in Isiolo County. There is also need for government departments, NGOs and faith-based organizations to ensure full engagement and effective participation of the local communities in the conception, design and implementation of sustainable solutions to reverse the effects of climate variability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarid lands 3aclimate 3acomputer software 3aconception 3acoping strategies 3acorn 3adescriptive statistics 3aelderly 3afocus groups 3afoods 3ahumans 3ainterviews 3aleadership 3alivelihood 3alivestock 3alivestock feeds 3amedicine 3anongovernmental organizations 3apastoralism 3aKenya1 aThuranira, EliasGitonga1 aWanjohi, JosephGatura0 tPastoralism.g2017 Dec., v. 7, no. 1 p.33-33dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:2262x2041-71367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13570-017-0103-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03401naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003200151245011000183300001600293500001900309520166800328536012701996592002802123596009902151650001802250650001602268650003802284650001402322650001302336650001702349650001702366650001502383653001702398653002602415653001802441653003002459653003302489700001702522700002802539700002202567700002402589700002402613700002102637700002102658773013402679856008502813852000902898655001202907IND60692984120221119071828.0200504e20170704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069298412DNAL7 a10.1080/13102818.2017.13345922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMikhaĭlova, Bili︠a︡na,10aPlasma endothelin-1 and endothelin-A receptor concentrations in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma  ap. 782-787.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEndothelin-1 (ET-1) is a potent vasoconstrictor and is considered to have a key role in the regulation of ocular perfusion and glaucoma pathogenesis. High ET-1 and ETA-receptor levels are reported in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). We compared the mean plasma ET-1 and ETA-receptor concentration of controls and patients with early and advanced POAG stage, and assessed the correlation with the retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thickness. The study included a total of 75 participants, aged 45–83 years: 25 (controls), 22 (early glaucoma) and 28 (advanced glaucoma). The plasma concentration of ET-1 and ETA-receptor was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The RNFL thickness was evaluated with spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. The mean ET-1 concentration was lower in the control group (4.88 ± 1.75 pg/mL) than in the early and advanced POAG group (6.33 ± 2.38 and 6.34 ± 1.56 pg/mL). Statistically significant difference was found between the mean ET-1 concentrations in controls and glaucoma patients (p = 0.029 – early glaucoma, p = 0.018 – advanced glaucoma), and no significant difference was observed between the two POAG groups (p = 0.998). The mean ETA-receptor concentration was highest in the control group (1209.28 ± 314.48 pg/mL) and the differences between the three groups were significant. Significant relationship was found only between ET-1 and RNFL. This study demonstrated the role of ET-1 in glaucoma pathogenesis based on the observed significant high ET-1 and ETA-receptor plasma levels in POAG patients. A new therapeutical approach needs to be considered in some patients.  aThis work was supported by the Medical University of Sofia, Bulgaria [grant number 236/14.01.2015], [contract number 4-D].  aPublisher supplied data  a236/14.01.2015, 4-DcMedical University of Sofia, Bulgariadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100009086 3abiotechnology 3aendothelins 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aequipment 3aglaucoma 3anerve fibers 3apathogenesis 3atomography 0aendothelin-1 0aendothelin-A receptor 0aplasma levels 0aretinal nerve fibre layer 0aoptical coherence tomography1 aPetkova, Iva1 aRankova-Yotova, Charita1 aDimitrova, Galina1 aIvanov, Ivan Tanev,1 aIvanova, Stanislava1 aTsakova, Adelina1 aSvinarov, Dobrin0 tBiotechnology, biotechnological equipment.g2017 July 4, v. 31, no. 4 p.782-787dTaylor & FranciswJournal:21365x1314-35307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13102818.2017.13345923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03030naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245015900171300001600330500001900346520121700365536020701582592002801789596010401817596007701921650002101998650002502019650001202044650001802056650001802074650001402092650001902106650001902125650001102144650001302155650001302168650005202181653001602233653002002249653002002269653001202289700003102301773013402332856008502466852000902551655001202560IND60692984220221119071914.0200504e20170704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069298422DNAL7 a10.1080/13102818.2017.13345932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGunasegar, Shan10aInfluence of nicotine on the adherence of Candida albicans ATCC 14053 and Candida parapsilosis ATCC 22019 and expression of selected binding-related genes  ap. 807-814.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSmoking is considered one of the main factors for development of dental plaque. Yeasts have been described to contribute to the plaque community. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of nicotine on the growth of planktonic cells and biofilm, cell aggregation, surface hydrophobicity, cell adherence and binding-related genes expressed by Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis in vitro. The relative number of viable fungal cells was determined based on viable plate counts. The biofilm growth was quantified using the crystal violet assay. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to evaluate the regulation of selected genes associated with adherence. The results indicated that nicotine enhanced the growth of both planktonic and biofilm oral fungal cells. Cell surface hydrophobicity and the expression of Hyphal Wall Protein 1 (HWP1) and agglutinin-like sequences 3 (ALS3) of C. albicans and C. parapsilosis were found to increase relative to the nicotine concentrations. The results suggest that nicotine can enhance the growth of C. albicans and C. parapsilosis in vitro and influence their adherence to the surface of microplate wells that mimic as the tooth surface.  aThis study was supported by the High Impact Research Grant from the Ministry of Education, Malaysia [UM.C/625/1/HIR/MOE/DENT/017] and Postgraduate Research Grant from University of Malaya [PG200/2015B].  aPublisher supplied data  aUM.C/625/1/HIR/MOE/DENT/017cMinistry of Education, Malaysiadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003093  aPG200/2015BcUniversity of Malayadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004386 3aCandida albicans 3aCandida parapsilosis 3abiofilm 3abiotechnology 3adental plaque 3aequipment 3agentian violet 3ahydrophobicity 3ahyphae 3anicotine 3aplankton 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 0aAggregation 0agene expression 0atobacco smoking 0aCandida1 aHimratul-Aznita, Wan Harun0 tBiotechnology, biotechnological equipment.g2017 July 4, v. 31, no. 4 p.807-814dTaylor & FranciswJournal:21365x1314-35307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13102818.2017.13345933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03153naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245017200169300001400341520190100355592002802256650002102284650002302305650001802328650001402346650001202360650002202372650001602394650001602410650001102426651001402437653001702451653001402468653001302482653002002495653001602515700001602531773010002547856008702647852000902734655001202743IND60543008920221117233858.0190408e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054300892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2013.07.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLevsen, Arne10aAnisakis simplex (s.l.) in Grey gurnard (Eutrigla gurnardus) from the North Sea: Food safety considerations in relation to fishing ground and distribution in the flesh  ap. 15-19.  aPrevious studies have shown that Grey gurnard from the North Sea is comparatively heavily infected with the larvae of the parasitic and potentially consumer hazardous nematode Anisakis simplex (s.l.). Especially the high abundance of Anisakis larvae in the fish flesh is of concern regarding the possible intensified utilisation of Grey Gurnard as a food resource. To gain better knowledge of the nematode burden with emphasis on abundance and distribution in the fish flesh, various Grey gurnards from 6 localities across the North Sea, each representing either western, northern or eastern fishing grounds, were examined for anisakid nematodes during summer of 2010 and 2012. The overall prevalence of A. simplex (s.l.) larvae in the gurnards from all localities (n = 188) was nearly total, i.e. only a single fish from the northernmost locality (Viking Bank) was apparently not infected. GLM-analyses revealed that catching locality had by far the strongest effect on larval infection probability, both in total (flesh + viscera) and in the fish flesh, while body size (weight) was a weak but still significant predictor of overall A. simplex (s.l.) abundance, but not in the flesh. Thus, the overall larval abundance in the gurnards from the two western localities off the east-coast of British mainland was significantly higher compared to the other catching localities. In the former localities, the overall mean abundance of A. simplex (s.l.) larvae was 35.0 ± 23.9 and 92.2 ± 87.4, and ranged from 14 to 114 and 9 to 397, respectively. It was further shown that 93.8% of the larvae infecting the fish flesh were situated in the belly flaps, i.e. the ventral portion of each flesh side or fillet, independent of catching locality and fish size. However, trimming of the fillets by removing the belly flaps may reduce the abundance in the fillets to, on an average, 0.3 larvae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnisakis simplex 3aEutrigla gurnardus 3aanimal organs 3abody size 3afillets 3afishery resources 3afood safety 3aprobability 3asummer 3aNorth Sea 0aGrey gurnard 0aNorth Sea 0aAnisakis 0aFishing grounds 0aFood safety1 aKarl, Horst0 tFood control.g2014 Feb., v. 36, no. 1 p.15-19dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2013.07.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03809naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245013700171300001600308500001900324520156600343536024401909592002802153596016302181596006402344650001702408650001202425650001802437650002202455650001402477650004602491650002802537650001402565650001602579650000702595650001902602650001602621650003002637650001402667650002602681650000902707650001802716653001702734653001602751653005202767653002602819653001102845700002102856700002202877700001602899700002102915700002002936700002302956773013402979856008503113852000903198655001203207IND60692984720221119071905.0200504e20170704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069298472DNAL7 a10.1080/13102818.2017.13356132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKurata, Atsushi10aDegradation of ionic liquids by a UV/H₂O₂ process and CMCase from novel ionic liquid-tolerant alkaliphilic Nocardiopsis sp.

[BMIM]⁺ and [EtPy]⁺ were detected by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and electrospray ionization–mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). [BMIM]⁺ was harder to degrade than [EtPy]⁺. Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation with 0.2% (v/v) H₂O₂ for 16 h degraded 1 mmol/L [BMIM]⁺, whereas UV irradiation alone degraded 1 mmol/L [EtPy]⁺. Additionally, we isolated an ionic liquid-tolerant alkaliphilic actinomycete, Nocardiopsis sp. SSC4. Strain SSC4 produced carboxymethylcellulase (CMCase) in the presence of 1.0% (v/v, 48.1 mmol/L) 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulphonate ([EMIM]CF₃SO₃), which is useful for the extraction of cellulose-rich materials from wood. In the case of strain SSC4, CMCase was inducibly synthesized by more than 0.5% CMC. The addition of 0%–1.0% tryptone or 0%–2.0% yeast extract decreased the CMCase activity in a concentration-dependent manner. After cultivation of strain SSC4 with 1.0% (w/v) CMC medium (pH 9.0) for 48 h at 37 °C, the culture supernatant exhibited CMCase activity at 0.03 U/mg. The optimum reaction temperature of CMCase was 45 °C. CMCase was stable up to 37 °C for 20 h incubation. The degradation characteristics of [BMIM]⁺ and [EtPy]⁺ and the activity of CMCase in the presence of [EMIM]CF₃SO₃ may be useful for the development of a bioconversion system for biomass resources.  aThis work was supported by Japan Society for the Promotion of Science London (JSPS) under Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B) [grant number 26870731, to A.K.] and Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) [grant number 17K07736, to A.K.].  aPublisher supplied data  a26870731, to A.K.cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science London (JSPS) under Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B)dhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100000646  a17K07736, to A.K.cGrant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) 3aNocardiopsis 3abiomass 3abiotechnology 3abiotransformation 3achlorides 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aequipment 3airradiation 3apH 3asolubilization 3atemperature 3athin layer chromatography 3atryptones 3aultraviolet radiation 3awood 3ayeast extract 0aIonic liquid 0adegradation 0aionic liquid-tolerant alkaliphilic actinomycete 0aNocardiopsis sp.

Consequently, wetland protection and restoration often fails to preserve or restore adjacent uplands required by lentic-breeding amphibians. Inattention to the juxtaposition and connectivity of uplands to wetlands could locally extirpate lentic-breeding amphibians. The objective of this research is to identify the relative importance of juxtaposed terrestrial and aquatic habitats in a lentic-breeding amphibian, the northern red-legged frog (Rana aurora), by evaluating the relationship between its occurrence and abundance with its aquatic and terrestrial habitats. To accomplish this, egg mass counts were used to quantify R. aurora populations in 30 stillwater habitats across an urbanization gradient. Using a Geographic Information System, seven descriptors of aquatic and surrounding terrestrial habitats were measured to evaluate their relationships to R. aurora occurrence and abundance. RESULTS: Rana aurora occurrence and breeding abundance both reflect the forested area around wetland breeding sites and forest connectivity to those sites. Rana aurora breeding abundance also strongly reflects the percent of forested perimeter around wetland breeding sites. The forest habitat most important for R. aurora breeding abundance seems to be > 200 m from the breeding wetlands. The American bullfrog presence and the two aquatic parameters measured, wetland area and vegetated area, were unrelated to R. aurora occurrence and breeding abundance. CONCLUSIONS: Area and connectivity of juxtaposed forested terrestrial habitat may represent a basic control on R. aurora presence and population size. Urban development policies should consider preservation and restoration of upland forest habitats beyond current fixed-width buffers and wetland habitat area at landscape scales.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLithobates catesbeianus 3aRana aurora 3aaquatic habitat 3abreeding 3abreeding sites 3aconservation buffers 3adevelopment policy 3aforest habitats 3aforests 3afrogs 3ageographic information systems 3ahabitat conservation 3ahighlands 3alandscapes 3apopulation size 3aurbanization 3awetlands 3aNorth America1 aHayes, MarcP.1 aVogt, KristiinaA.1 aVogt, DanielJ.1 aYarnold, PaulR.1 aRichter, KlausO.1 aAnderson, ChristopherD.1 aOstergaard, ElissaC.1 aWilhelm, JoO.0 tEcological processes.g2017 Dec., v. 6, no. 1 p.44-44dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:22887x2192-17097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13717-017-0111-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03129naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245009700175300001600272500001900288520160200307536011001909592002802019596009502047650003002142650001802172650002102190650001402211650001802225650002602243650001302269650003102282651001302313653000902326653000902335653002402344653001802368700002102386700002602407700002202433773013402455856008502589852000902674655001202683IND60692985020221119071441.0200504e20170704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069298502DNAL7 a10.1080/13102818.2017.13356162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTachkov, Konstantin10aEvaluation of the economic and social burden of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  ap. 855-861.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe aim of this study was to calculate the economic and social burden of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in Bulgaria generated from the loss of productivity due to absence from work (absenteeism), due to premature retirement, due to reduced productivity (presenteeism), and the disability adjusted life years (DALY). An observational study among 426 Bulgarian COPD patients was conducted for the period 2014–2015. Human capital approach was used to calculate the productivity losses and the DALY methodology of the World Health Organization was applied. The patients with moderate (50%) and severe (48%) disease were absent from work more frequently than those with mild COPD (2%) and generated productivity losses of 521.45€ per patient per year. The average indirect costs per patient for the remaining working ages due to premature retirement account for 25,000€ (6250 per patient on average), while those due to presenteeism, for about 3750.64€ per year. Accordingly, the DALYs in the group of patients with mild severity were lowest due to the low disutility index and number of patients in this sample group. On average, a patient with mild COPD spends 0.62 years of his life in disability due to the disease, while those with moderate and severe disease spend 6.00 and 9.00 years, respectively. This amounted to the following indirect costs experienced by patients: 3596.52€; 34,204.01€; 51,332.20€, respectively. We demonstrated a significant indirect financial and societal burden of COPD in Bulgaria, which is in correlation with the severity of the disease.  aThis study was partly supported by the Bulgarian National Science Fund [grant number B 02-12/12.12.2014].  aPublisher supplied data  aB 02-12/12.12.2014cBulgarian National Science Funddhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003336 3aWorld Health Organization 3abiotechnology 3adisease severity 3aequipment 3ahuman capital 3aobservational studies 3apatients 3arespiratory tract diseases 3aBulgaria 0aCOPD 0aDALY 0aproductivity losses 0aindirect cost1 aKamusheva, Maria1 aPencheva, Ventsislava1 aMitov, Konstantin0 tBiotechnology, biotechnological equipment.g2017 July 4, v. 31, no. 4 p.855-861dTaylor & FranciswJournal:21365x1314-35307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13102818.2017.13356163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02706naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245014900171300001600320520132500336592002801661650001501689650001601704650002201720650001701742650001101759650002001770650001801790650001801808650001101826650001601837650001301853650001701866650001101883651001101894653002601905653001201931653002501943653001701968700001701985700002002002700001602022773010202038856008702140852000902227655001202236IND60543009320221117234030.0190408e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054300932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2013.07.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerreira, D.S.10aComparison and application of near-infrared (NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy for determination of quality parameters in soybean samples  ap. 227-232.  aGrain composition is directly related to maintenance of quality. Chemical analyses have been determined using traditional and laborious methods, which are time-consuming and generate chemical waste. This justifies the development of fast and accurate alternative methodologies to control the grain composition. Near-infrared (NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy techniques associated with chemometric tools have been applied in the development of several analytical methodologies for agricultural products. The aim of this study is to develop and compare these two spectroscopic techniques to determine the parameters of quality, such as moisture, protein, lipid and ash content, in 20 varieties of soybean, which are grown in the cities of Ponta Grossa and Londrina, Brazil, totally 40 samples. It was used near-infrared and mid-infrared spectroscopy, with diffuse reflectance measurements, associated with multivariate calibration methods based on partial least squares algorithm. The determination coefficient (R2) for moisture, ash, protein and lipid content were 0.72, 0.73, 0.88 and 0.81 for NIR and 0.63, 0.87, 0.91 and 0.67 for MIR, respectively, having an RMSECV (root mean square error of cross-validation) < 2.09%. The results show that both infrared (NIR and MIR) techniques have predictive abilities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aash content 3achemical analysis 3achemometrics 3acities 3acontrol methods 3aleast squares 3alipid content 3alipids 3areflectance 3asoybeans 3aspectroscopy 3awastes 3aBrazil 0aInfrared spectroscopy 0aSoybean 0aPartial least square 0aFood quality1 aGalão, O.F.1 aPallone, J.A.L.1 aPoppi, R.J.0 tFood control.g2014 Jan., v. 35, no. 1 p.227-232dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2013.07.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01577naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245013400171300001600305520055600321592002800877650002000905650001100925650002700936650002200963650001900985651002101004651001001025700001601035773012101051856008201172852000901254655001201263IND60588681220221116165647.0180619e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058868122DNAL7 a10.1007/s40009-017-0580-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMajumdar, Shuvadeep10aFirst Report of Anastrophyllum lignicola (Anastrophyllaceae, Marchantiophyta) from Arunachal Pradesh in Eastern Himalaya of India  ap. 439-444.  aAnastrophyllum lignicola Schill & D.G.

The changes in climate and environmental conditions have been gradually accelerating in the last decades. Since oleasters are more resistant to diseases, pests and unfavorable environmental conditions, they have become a very important source for resistance breeding studies that would be required in the future. Twelve inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) and 12 random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers were used; the effectiveness of these markers was studied and different parameters such as effective multiplex ratio, marker index, resolving power, and polymorphic information content, Shannon information index (I), effective allele number (ne), and Nei's genetic distance (h) were used in the determination of genetic varieties of 18 oleasters grown in Turkey. When both marker systems were analyzed in this study, it was observed that MI, RP and EMR parameters in ISSR gave higher values than RAPD while ne, I, and h were lower in ISSRs. Neighbour-joining dendrograms were developed by using Nei's genetic distance matrix, and principal coordinate analysis was performed.  aThis study was supported by the Scientific Research Projects Coordination Unit of Manisa Celal Bayar University under Project number: 2010-119.  aPublisher supplied data  a2010-119cCelal Bayar Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100006009 3aElaeagnus angustifolia 3aOlea europaea 3aalleles 3abiotechnology 3aclimate 3aequipment 3agenetic distance 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amultidimensional scaling 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3aMediterranean region 0aGenetic variation 0aISSR 0aRAPD 0awild olives1 aYegenoglu, Emine Dilsat0 tBiotechnology, biotechnological equipment.g2017 Sept. 3, v. 31, no. 5 p.897-904dTaylor & FranciswJournal:21365x1314-35307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13102818.2017.13441073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03004naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024003800113040001800151100003500169245009900204300001800303506017300321520126700494592002801761650001101789650001201800650001301812650001101825650002601836650002501862650001101887650002601898650001301924650001801937650001301955650001501968650001801983650001002001653001402011653001102025653001702036653001302053653002202066653001802088773011302106856011202219856005102331956008202382961001302464852000902477655001202486IND4463953220221119033947.0140412e20120701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446395322DNAL7 a10113/543002hdl7 a10.1080/01904167.2012.6909222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJaradat, A.

Relative growth rate and net assimilation rate were estimated as functions of growth stages, phenotypic traits and C:N:P ratios. Ontogenically, N:P ratios in reproductive and metabolic tissues were least variable and were mainly affected by allometric leaf mass and relative growth rate. Reproductive mass is best predicted by allometric stem mass and C:N ratio in structural and metabolic tissues; whereas, net assimilation rate is best predicted by allometric total branch length and relative growth rate. The conservative N:P ratios found in reproductive and metabolic tissues are important in determining reproductive allocation in Cuphea. Large antagonistic effects of C:N on N:P ratios found in different plant tissues suggest that maximum reproductive allocation can be attained by manipulating N:P ratio during ontogeny. A greater investment of resources in reproduction may be possible for this semi-domesticated crop if nutrient and mass allocation to supporting stems and roots can be altered for the benefit of reproductive biomass.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCuphea 3abiomass 3abranches 3acarbon 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3adevelopmental stages 3aleaves 3anet assimilation rate 3anitrogen 3aoilseed crops 3aontogeny 3aphosphorus 3aplant tissues 3aroots 0aallometry 0aCuphea 0aC:N:P ratios 0aontogeny 0areproductive mass 0astoichiometry0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2012 July 1, v. 35, no. 10 p.1579-1599dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-40877nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/543003Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01904167.2012.690922  aARIS submissionbhttp://parking.nal.usda.gov/shortterm/ind1/114553_114423.pdf  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03288naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002800186245005100214300001800265506007600283520154100359592002801900506003701928650002201965650001801987650002202005650001302027650002302040650001802063650002002081650001402101650001102115650001602126650001602142650001502158650001402173650003002187653003202217653001202249700001902261700002002280700002502300700001702325700001902342700002802361700002102389700002802410700002202438773017402460856007902634852000902713655001202722IND60173603520221207103956.0150603e20130319xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017360352DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.13009811102doi7 aPMC36069692pmcid7 a234172972pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalgado-Pabón, Wilmara10aShigella impairs T lymphocyte dynamics in vivo  ap. 4458-4463.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe Gram-negative enteroinvasive bacterium Shigella flexneri is responsible for the endemic form of bacillary dysentery, an acute rectocolitis in humans. S. flexneri uses a type III secretion system to inject effector proteins into host cells, thus diverting cellular functions to its own benefit. Protective immunity to reinfection requires several rounds of infection to be elicited and is short-lasting, suggesting that S. flexneri interferes with the priming of specific immunity. Considering the key role played by T-lymphocyte trafficking in priming of adaptive immunity, we investigated the impact of S. flexneri on T-cell dynamics in vivo. By using two-photon microscopy to visualize bacterium–T-cell cross-talks in the lymph nodes, where the adaptive immunity is initiated, we provide evidence that S. flexneri , via its type III secretion system, impairs the migration pattern of CD4 ⁺ T cells independently of cognate recognition of bacterial antigens. We show that bacterial invasion of CD4 ⁺ T lymphocytes occurs in vivo, and results in cell migration arrest. In the absence of invasion, CD4 ⁺ T-cell migration parameters are also dramatically altered. Signals resulting from S. flexneri interactions with subcapsular sinus macrophages and dendritic cells, and recruitment of polymorphonuclear cells are likely to contribute to this phenomenon. These findings indicate that S. flexneri targets T lymphocytes in vivo and highlight the role of type III effector secretion in modulating host adaptive immune responses.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aShigella flexneri 3aT-lymphocytes 3aadaptive immunity 3abacteria 3abacterial antigens 3acell movement 3adendritic cells 3adysentery 3ahumans 3alymph nodes 3amacrophages 3amicroscopy 3asecretion 3atype III secretion system 0ahost–pathogen cross-talks 0aimaging1 aCelli, Susanna1 aArena, Ellen T.1 aNothelfer, Katharina1 aRoux, Pascal1 aSellge, Gernot1 aFrigimelica, Elisabetta1 aBousso, Philippe1 aSansonetti, Philippe J.1 aPhalipon, Armelle0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 Mar. 19, v. 110, no. 12 p.4458-4463dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.13009811103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02593naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100003100142245014600173300001400319520133000333592002801663650002001691650001601711650002101727650001501748650001201763650001701775650001301792650001201805650001001817650002401827651001001851700003201861700003001893700002701923700003201950773012701982856007702109852000902186655001202195IND60765486520221121232024.0220615e20170228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076548652DNAL7 a10.17221/86/2016-jfs2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRafael M, Navarro-Cerrillo10aImpact of plot size and model selection on forest biomass estimation using airborne LiDAR: A case study of pine plantations in southern Spain  ap. 88-97.  aWe explored the usefulness of LiDAR for modelling and mapping the stand biomass of two conifer species in southern Spain. We used three different plot sizes and two statistical approaches (i.e. stepwise selection and genetic algorithm selection) in combination with multiple linear regression models to estimate biomass. 43 predictor variables derived from discrete-return LiDAR data (4 pulses per m<sup>2</sup>) were used for estimating the forest biomass of Pinus sylvestris Linnaeus and Pinus nigra Arnold forests. Twelve circular plots – six for each species – and three different fixed-radius designs (i.e. 7, 15, and 30 m) were established within the range of the airborne LiDAR. The Bayesian information criterion and R<sup>2</sup> were used to select the best models. As expected, the models that included the largest plots (30 m) yielded the highest R<sup>2</sup> value (0.91) for Pinus sp. using genetic algorithm models. Considering P. sylvestris and P. nigra models separately, the genetic algorithm approach also yielded the highest R<sup>2</sup> values for the 30-m plots (P. nigra: R<sup>2</sup> = 0.99, P. sylvestris: R<sup>2</sup> = 0.97). The results we obtained with two species and different plot sizes revealed that increasing the size of plots from 15 to 30 m had a low effect on modelling attempts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aPinus nigra 3aPinus sylvestris 3aalgorithms 3abiomass 3acase studies 3aconifers 3aforests 3alidar 3aregression analysis 3aSpain1 aEduardo, González-Ferreiro1 aJorge, García-Gutiérrez1 aCarlos J Ceacero, Ruiz1 aRocío, Hernández-Clemente0 tJournal of Forest Science.g, v. 63, no. 2 p.88-97dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21419x1212-48347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/86/2016-jfs3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02033naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245008500162300001600247520109900263592002801362650001001390650001101400650002201411650001801433650001001451650000901461651001401470700002101484773012601505856007901631852000901710655001201719IND60135907020221116225315.0150522e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013590702DNAL7 a10.1111/1467-8489.120702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLloyd, Peter10aRelative assistance to Australian agriculture and manufacturing since Federation  ap. 159-170.  aThis paper quantifies the levels of assistance received by producers of the major agricultural crops and animal products in Australia since Federation and compares this with the level of assistance provided to manufacturing producers.

Our results show that, from the time of Federation until the 1990s, the economy‐wide pattern of industry assistance discriminated persistently and heavily against the Agriculture sector. The policy of ‘protection all round’ pursued by the Country/National Party did not prevent this discrimination. In particular, producers of exportables, such as wool and wheat, were heavily discriminated against. Both the intersectoral bias and the differences in assistance among agricultural producers lowered the incomes of the Agriculture sector and the national income.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrops 3aincome 3aissues and policy 3amanufacturing 3awheat 3awool 3aAustralia1 aMacLaren, Donald0 tAustralian journal of agricultural and resource economics.g2015 Apr., v. 59, no. 2 p.159-170dBlackwellx1364-985X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1467-8489.120703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02784naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001800180245018300198506007600381520124500457592002801702506003701730650001601767650001501783650002501798650001101823650003401834650001501868650001801883650001301901650002801914650001201942650001701954650001401971650001401985650002701999650001202026700002802038700002202066700002302088773012102111856007302232852000902305655001202314IND60654649320221207114103.0190725e20190708xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065464932DNAL7 a10.3390/v110706262doi7 aPMC66695672pmcid7 a312884212pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFuruse, Yuki 10aEvolutionary and Functional Diversity of the 5′ Untranslated Region of Enterovirus D68: Increased Activity of the Internal Ribosome Entry Site of Viral Strains during the 2010s  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe 5&prime; untranslated region (UTR) of the RNA genomes of enteroviruses possesses an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) that directs translation of the mRNA by binding to ribosomes. Infection with enterovirus D68 causes respiratory symptoms and is sometimes associated with neurological disorders. The number of reports of the viral infection and neurological disorders has increased in 2010s, although the reason behind this phenomenon remains unelucidated. In this study, we investigated the evolutionary and functional diversity of the 5&prime; UTR of recently circulating strains of the virus. Genomic sequences of 374 viral strains were acquired and subjected to phylogenetic analysis. The IRES activity of the viruses was measured using a luciferase reporter assay. We found a highly conserved sequence in the 5&prime; UTR and also identified the location of variable sites in the predicted RNA secondary structure. IRES activities differed among the strains in some cell lines, including neuronal and respiratory cells, and were especially high in strains of a major lineage from the recent surge. The effect of mutations in the 5&prime; UTR should be studied further in the future for better understanding of viral pathogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEnterovirus 3acell lines 3afunctional diversity 3agenome 3ainternal ribosome entry sites 3aluciferase 3amessenger RNA 3amutation 3anervous system diseases 3aneurons 3apathogenesis 3aphylogeny 3aribosomes 3atranslation (genetics) 3aviruses1 aChaimongkol, Natthawan 1 aOkamoto, Michiko 1 aOshitani, Hitoshi 0 tViruses.g2019 July 08, v. 11, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v110706263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02647naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002400191245010100215506007600316520104600392592002801438506003701466650003301503650002101536650002301557650001701580650001401597650001901611650002801630650001901658650002401677650003301701650002801734653001801762653002501780653001801805653002801823700001701851700001501868700001501883700002001898700002101918773012001939856008502059852000902144655001202153IND60690166720221207130131.0200513e20150902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069016672DNAL7 a10.1080/15592324.2014.9985442doi7 aPMC48838692pmcid7 a263751842pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl-Shetehy, Mohamed10aNitric oxide and reactive oxygen species are required for systemic acquired resistance in plants  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSystemic acquired resistance (SAR) is a form of broad-spectrum disease resistance that is induced in response to primary infection and that protects uninfected portions of the plant against secondary infections by related or unrelated pathogens. SAR is associated with an increase in chemical signals that operate in a collective manner to confer protection against secondary infections. These include, the phytohormone salicylic acid (SA), glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P), azelaic acid (AzA) and more recently identified signals nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). NO, ROS, AzA and G3P function in the same branch of the SAR pathway, and in parallel to the SA-regulated branch. NO and ROS function upstream of AzA/G3P and different reactive oxygen species functions in an additive manner to mediate chemical cleavage of the C9 double bond on C18 unsaturated fatty acids to generate AzA. The parallel and additive functioning of various chemical signals provides important new insights in the overlapping pathways leading to SAR.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalpha-glycerophosphoric acid 3achemical bonding 3adisease resistance 3anitric oxide 3apathogens 3aplant hormones 3areactive oxygen species 3asalicylic acid 3asecondary infection 3asystemic acquired resistance 3aunsaturated fatty acids 0afree radicals 0aglycerol-3-phosphate 0aplant defense 0areactive oxgyen species1 aWang, Caixia1 aShine, M B1 aYu, Keshun1 aKachroo, Aardra1 aKachroo, Pradeep0 tPlant signaling & behavior.g2015 Sept. 2, v. 10, no. 9 p.e998544-dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2184x1559-23247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15592324.2014.9985443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02999naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245016900173500002200342520139300364592002801757650002601785650001501811650001301826650001901839650001601858650002001874650002101894650001601915650004801931650000901979650001701988650002202005650002502027650002502052650001802077650001602095653004802111653001002159653001402169653002302183653001202206700002402218700003602242700002602278700001902304773006502323856008402388852000902472655001202481IND60582816320221117165852.0171008s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058281632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molimm.2017.08.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaghighat, Setareh12aA novel recombinant vaccine candidate comprising PBP2a and autolysin against Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus confers protection in the experimental mice  aPre-press version  aThe methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection is a hot topic area in microbiology research. Here a novel vaccine candidate consisting of recombinant PBP2a and autolysin proteins were used. The proteins over expressed in E.coli BL21 (DE3) cells, and purified by the Ni-NTA affinity column and conjugated using EDAC and ADH as a linker and spacer, respectively. To investigate the immunogenicity and protective effects of recombinant proteins, 5 and 20μg of proteins in various formulations were subcutaneously injected in different groups. Two booster vaccinations were carried out in three-week intervals and blood samples were collected three weeks after each injection.To evaluate the immune response, total IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b were analyzed. Immunization of mice with r-autolysin and r-autolysin-PBP2a mixture raised total IgGantibody. Additionally, both IgG1 and IgG2a responses induced. Opsonophagocytosis assay showed that anti r-PBP2a and r-autolysin IgG not only promoted phagocytosis of S.aureus, but also decreased the number of viable bacterial cells. Furthermore, survival rate of experimental mice increased in the bacteremia infection. Our results demonstrated that active vaccination with a mixture of r-PBP2a/r-autolysin and conjugate form vaccine reduced the mortality rate and protected mice against lethal MRSA challenge as well as single proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteremia 3abacteria 3ablood sampling 3agametolysin 3aimmune response 3aimmunoglobulin G 3amethicillin 3amethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 3amice 3aphagocytosis 3aprotective effect 3arecombinant proteins 3arecombinant vaccines 3asurvival rate 3avaccination 0aMethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 0aPBP2a 0aautolysin 0aconjugated protein 0avaccine1 aSiadat, Seyed Davar1 aSorkhabadi, Seyed Mehdi Rezayat1 aSepahi, Abbas Akhavan1 aMahdavi, Mehdi0 tMolecular Immunology.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx0161-58907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2017.08.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03049naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245011400163300001600277520160400293592002801897650001001925650001801935650001501953650001801968650001101986650001401997650000902011650001402020650002402034650001002058650001202068650001202080650001302092650003002105650000902135650001902144700001502163700001802178700001402196700001302210700001602223700001402239700001502253700001502268700001202283773014802295856007902443852000902522655001202531IND60765486620221121232010.0220419e20181107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076548662DNAL7 a10.17221/86/2017-cjgpb2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Mingfang10aRegeneration and Agrobacterium-Mediated Transformation of Japonica Rice Varieties Developed for a Cold Region  ap. 161-167.  aSo far, a large number of transformation systems have been established for japonica rice, but only a few have been reported for cold-region varieties. In our study, we established highly efficient tissue culture systems for two cold-region rice cultivars, Dongnong 427 and Longdao 14. Plant growth regulator (PGR) levels were optimized by an orthogonal experimental design. The culture ability, constituted by induction and differentiation rate, served as the detection index of orthogonal experiments. The optimal combinations of PGRs for callus induction and regeneration of Dongnong 427 and Longdao 14 were 1 mg/l 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) + 2 mg/l 6-benzyladenine (BA) + 4 mg/l kinetin (KIN) + 0.2 mg/l α-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) and 1 mg/l 2,4-D + 4 mg/l 6-BA + 4 mg/l KIN + 0.5 mg/l NAA, respectively. Agrobacterium strain EHA 105 containing the plasmid pCAMBIA1301 was used for transformation. The frequency of transient transformation was expressed as the ratio between the number of calli showing GUS expression and the total number of calli kept for staining. The highest transformation efficiency in Dongnong 427 was obtained when calli were immersed in 0.272 OD<sub>600</sub> (optical density determined at 600 nm) for 10 min. While it was best for Longdao 14 calli to be infected with 0.592 OD<sub>600</sub> for 20 min. Infected calli of the two varieties were co-cultivated on two pieces of sterile filter paper moistened with 1 ml liquid co-cultivation medium for three days. The expression of the GUS gene was confirmed by PCR analysis of plants of both varieties.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4-D 3aAgrobacterium 3aabsorbance 3abenzyladenine 3acallus 3acoculture 3acold 3acultivars 3aexperimental design 3agenes 3akinetin 3aliquids 3aplasmids 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arice 3atissue culture1 aCang, Jing1 aWang, Junhong1 aSun, Jian1 aYu, Jing1 aXu, Qinghua1 aZhang, Da1 aYang, Ning1 aLu, Qiuwei1 aLv, Yan0 tCzech journal of genetics and plant breeding.g, v. 54, no. 4 p.161-167dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:12179x1212-19757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/86/2017-cjgpb3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02746naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245017800166300001800344520128000362592002801642650004401670650002201714650002201736650001601758650002201774650001901796650002101815650003701836650002801873650001301901650001601914650001401930650001901944650001801963650000701981650003301988700002202021700002702043700001802070773012902088856007402217852000902291655001202300IND60636980220221118072552.0190412e20190411xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063698022DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ay00146h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHassannezhad, Morassa12aA graphitic carbon nitride (g-C₃N₄/Fe₃O₄) nanocomposite: an efficient electrode material for the electrochemical determination of tramadol in human biological fluids  ap. 2064-2071.  aIn the present study, a graphitic carbon nitride/Fe₃O₄ (g-C₃N₄/Fe₃O₄) nanocomposite/carbon paste electrode was used as a highly sensitive sensor for the voltammetric determination of tramadol (Tr) in an aqueous solution. The g-C₃N₄/Fe₃O₄ nanocomposite was synthesized by simple calcination of g-C₃N₄ and ferrite (Fe₃O₄) magnetic nanoparticles, which was then utilized to fabricate a modified carbon paste electrode (g-C₃N₄/Fe₃O₄-CPE). The nanocomposite was thoroughly characterized by various techniques including field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The effects of some parameters, such as the solution pH, scan rate, accumulation time and potential, interferents and concentration of Tr, were studied to optimize the experimental conditions; under the optimized conditions, the proposed electrode showed significant detection efficiency for Tr determined using differential pulse voltammetry over the concentration ranges of 0.2–14.0 μM and 14.0–120.0 μM and a detection limit of 0.1 μM.

Scale-free community size spectra (i.e., size distributions regardless of species) are routinely observed in natural ecosystems and are the product of intra- and interspecies regulation of the relative abundance of organisms of different sizes. Intra- and interspecies distributions of body sizes are thus major determinants of ecosystems’ structure and function. We show experimentally that single-species mass distributions of unicellular eukaryotes covering different phyla exhibit both characteristic sizes and universal features over more than four orders of magnitude in mass. Remarkably, we find that the mean size of a species is sufficient to characterize its size distribution fully and that the latter has a universal form across all species. We show that an analytical physiological model accounts for the observed universality, which can be synthesized in a log-normal form for the intraspecies size distributions. We also propose how ecological and physiological processes should interact to produce scale-invariant community size spectra and discuss the implications of our results on allometric scaling laws involving body mass.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aallometry 3abody size 3aecosystems 3aeukaryotic cells 3amortality 0aprotist microcosms 0aallometry 0afinite size scaling 0abody mass 0acell counter1 aAltermatt, Florian1 aCarrara, Francesco1 aMaritan, Amos1 aRinaldo, Andrea0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 Mar. 19, v. 110, no. 12 p.4646-4650dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.13015521103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04421naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245007500165520306200240592002803302650002103330650002403351650001103375650001203386650001603398650001603414650001703430650001503447650001503462650001703477650001603494650001103510650001603521650001503537650003203552650002903584650002103613650000903634650001603643650001103659650001603670650001503686650002503701773012303726856008103849852000903930655001203939IND60748744220221118230603.0210827e20210728xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074874422DNAL7 a10.3390/resources100800782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, Carla 10aGreenhouse Gas Emission Assessment of Simulated Wastewater Biorefinery  aA wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) can be considered a system where dirty water enters and fresh water (by means of treatment processes) and other co-products such as sludge and biogas exit. Inside the system, typically, the following steps occur: preliminary treatment, primary treatment, secondary treatment, tertiary treatment, disinfection, and solids handling. The system transforms biomass into several energy and non-energy products, which fall into the definition of a biorefinery. This research compares three simulated WWTP in terms of their environmental greenhouse gas (GHG) emission release to the atmosphere: a generic one (without co-product valorization), one that converts co-products into fertilizer, heat, and electricity, and a third one that converts co-products into heat, electricity, fertilizer, and bioplastic. Heat and electricity are used to provide its energy needs. The chosen impact category is GHG, and the aim is to project the best scenario to the European context in terms of GHG avoidance (savings). The scope is the upstream electricity and natural gas production, the in-use emissions, and the avoided emissions by substituting equivalent fossil-based products. The functional unit is 1 L of sewage (“dirty water”). The GHG savings are evaluated by comparing a generic WWTP scenario, without co-product valorization, with alternative scenarios of co-product valorization. Conventional LCA assuming all the emissions occurs at instant zero is compared to a more realistic environment where for each year, the average of the variable emission pulses occurs. Variable emissions pulses are taken from variable inflows data publicly available from European COST actions (COST Action 682 “Integrated Wastewater Management” as well as within the first IAWQ (later IWA) Task Group on respirometry-based control of the activated sludge process), within the later COST Action 624 on “Optimal Management of Wastewater Systems”). The GHG uncertainty is estimated based on the inputs benchmark data from the WWTP literature and by having different available global warming potential dynamic models. The conventional LCA versus dynamic LCA approach is discussed especially because a WWTP is by nature a dynamic system, having variable inputs along time and therefore variable output GHG emission pulses. It is concluded that heat needs are fully covered by biogas production in the anaerobic digester and combustion, covering its own energy needs and with a potential for heat district supply. Only 30–40% of electricity needs are covered by combined heat and power. Bioplastics and/or fertilizer yields potentially represent less than 3% of current European needs, which suggests the need to reduce their consumption levels. In comparison to generic WWTP, GHG savings are 20%, considering the uncertainty in the benchmark input assumptions. The former is much higher than the uncertainty in the dynamic global warming potential model selection, which means that the model selection is not important in this case study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3aanaerobic digesters 3abiogas 3abiomass 3abioplastics 3abiorefining 3acase studies 3acombustion 3acoproducts 3adisinfection 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3afertilizers 3afreshwater 3agas production (biological) 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3aheat 3anatural gas 3asewage 3auncertainty 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment0 tResources.g2021 July 28, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21558x2079-92767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/resources100800783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03113naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245010300174300001400277500001500291520137000306592002801676650001401704650002401718650001201742650004201754650001701796650001501813650004301828650002101871650001701892650001501909650000701924650001401931650002201945650001001967650002701977650002102004650002002025653001202045653001502057653001202072653002002084653001002104653001002114653001102124653003802135653001102173700001402184700001902198700001902217700001702236700002702253700002102280773010202301856008702403852000902490655001202499IND60552575220221121111150.0161021e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055257522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2014.03.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDi Rago, Matthew10aFast targeted analysis of 132 acidic and neutral drugs and poisons in whole blood using LC–MS/MS  ap. 35-43.  a2019-12-06  aThe aim of this study was to develop an LC–MS/MS based screening technique that covers a broad range of acidic and neutral drugs and poisons by combining a small sample volume and efficient extraction technique with simple automated data processing. After protein precipitation of 100μL of whole blood, 132 common acidic and neutral drugs and poisons including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, barbiturates, anticonvulsants, antidiabetics, muscle relaxants, diuretics and superwarfarin rodenticides (47 quantitated, 85 reported as detected) were separated using a Shimadzu Prominence HPLC system with a C18 separation column (Kinetex XB-C18, 4.6mm×150mm, 5μm), using gradient elution with a mobile phase of 25mM ammonium acetate buffer (pH 7.5)/acetonitrile. The drugs were detected using an ABSciex® API 2000 LC–MS/MS system (ESI+ and −, MRM mode, two transitions per analyte). The method was fully validated in accordance with international guidelines. Quantification data obtained using one-point calibration compared favorably to that using multiple calibrants. The presented LC–MS/MS assay has proven to be applicable for determination of the analytes in blood. The fast and reliable extraction method combined with automated processing gives the opportunity for high throughput and fast turnaround times for forensic and clinical toxicology.  aPublisher supplied data 3ascreening 3ahypoglycemic agents 3abuffers 3anonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents 3abarbiturates 3aguidelines 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amuscle relaxants 3arodenticides 3atoxicology 3apH 3adiuretics 3aforensic sciences 3ablood 3ainformation processing 3aammonium acetate 3aanticonvulsants 0aPoisons 0aLC–MS/MS 0aNeutral 0adata processing 0aBlood 0aDrugs 0aScreen 0aSystematic toxicological analysis 0aAcidic1 aSaar, Eva1 aRodda, Luke N.1 aTurfus, Sophie1 aKotsos, Alex1 aGerostamoulos, Dimitri1 aDrummer, Olaf H.0 tForensic science international.g2014 Oct., v. 243 p.35-43dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0379-07387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2014.03.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03077naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245014100160300001600301520129400317592002801611596007401639596005901713596005901772650003401831650001401865650001401879650002301893650002501916650002401941650004901965650001402014650001102028650002302039650003202062650002102094650002002115650001402135650001802149650001802167650002902185700001602214700001402230700001702244700001502261700005502276773013602331856008302467852000902550655001202559IND60633763920221118183018.0190416e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063376392DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-018-01543-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, L.12aA high production of flavonoids and anthraquinones via adventitious root culture of Oplopanax elatus and evaluating antioxidant activity  ap. 173-179.  aAdventitious root (AR) culturing is an effective approach for obtaining bioactive compounds from the endangered plant species of Oplopanax elatus Nakai. In the present study, flavonoids and anthraquinones, both important bioactive compounds were identified via HPLC-ESI–MS/MS, and flavonoid monomers of quercetin and kaempferide and anthraquinone monomers of aloe-emodin, rhein, and emodin were detected in O. elatus AR cultures. To enhance synthesis of both compounds, methyl jasmonate (MeJA) was used as the elicitor to treat ARs. At 200 µM, MeJA significantly increased the contents of quercetin, aloe-emodin, rhein, and emodin, whereas 225 µM was the optimal concentration for kaempferide accumulation. The antioxidant property in ARs was evaluated by determining activities of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and alkyl radical scavenging using the an electron spin resonance spectrometer. The IC₅₀ of DPPH (6.2 µg/mL) and alkyl (20.2 µg/mL) radical scavenging activities with MeJA treatment were lower than that of the control, thereby indicating that ARs treated with MeJA possess stronger antioxidant activity. Hence, AR cultures can be deployed as raw materials or additives in the production of antioxidant-related O. elatus products using the MeJA as elicitor.  aPublisher supplied data  a20180101278JCcJilin Scientific and Technological Development Program  a31660080cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a21662038cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aOplopanax 3aadditives 3aadventitious roots 3aantioxidant activity 3abioactive compounds 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aelicitors 3aemodin 3aendangered species 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amethyl jasmonate 3aplants (botany) 3aquercetin 3araw materials 3aspectrometers 3atandem mass spectrometry1 aPiao, X.

Mice suffered from lymphopenia, a lack of T cells in the periphery, which attenuates their ability to fight against recurring and secondary infections during sepsis progression. Key players in thymus atrophy are IL-6, which is directly involved in thymus involution, and the sphingosine-1-phosphate − sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 signaling, influencing thymocytes emigration. In healthy individuals a sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) gradient from lymphoid organs to the circulatory system serves as signal for mature T cell egress. In the present study we investigated, whether inhibition of S1P generation improves thymus involution. In sepsis, induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), S1P in the thymus increased, while it decreased in serum, thus disrupting the naturally occurring S1P gradient. As a potential source of S1P we identified increased numbers of apoptotic cells in the thymic cortex of septic mice. Pharmacological inhibition of the S1P generating sphingosine kinases, by 4- [[4-(4-Chlorophenyl)-2-thiazolyl]amino]phenol (SK I–II), administered directly following CLP, prevented thymus atrophy. This was reflected by lymphocytosis, diminished apoptosis, decreased IL-6 expression, and an unaltered thymus weight. In addition SK I-II-treatment preserved the S1P balance and prevented S1P-dependent internalization of the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1. Our data suggest that inhibition of sphingosine kinase and thus, S1P generation during sepsis restores thymic T cell egress, which might improve septic outcome.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3aanimal models 3aapoptosis 3aatrophy 3ablood serum 3acortex 3ainterleukin-6 3amice 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3asecondary infection 3asepsis (infection) 3asphingosine 3athymocytes 3athymus gland 0asepsis 0athymus involution 0asphingosine-1-phosphate 0aT cells 0aapoptosis1 aSha, Lisa K.1 aGiegerich, Annika K.1 aKnape, Tilo1 aAngioni, Carlo1 aFerreirós, Nerea1 aSchmidt, Martina V.1 aWeigert, Andreas1 aBrüne, B.q(Bernhard),1 aKnethen, Andreas von0 tMolecular Immunology.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx0161-58907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2017.08.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02380naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245012400157300001600281520123000297592002801527650001401555650002301569650001801592650001901610650001201629650001301641650002201654700001301676700001801689700001801707700001301725700001701738700001601755700001901771773012001790856007501910852000901985655001201994IND60761952520221120081038.0220105e20211222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076195252DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ra05804e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yingxin10aHighly efficient selective hydrogenation of levulinic acid to γ-valerolactone over Cu–Re/TiO₂ bimetallic catalysts  ap. 602-610.  aHighly active and thermally stable Cu–Re bimetallic catalysts supported on TiO₂ with 2.0 wt% loading of Cu were prepared via an incipient wetness impregnation method and were applied for liquid phase selective hydrogenation of levulinic acid (LA) to γ-valerolactone (GVL) in H₂. The effect of the molar ratios of Cu : Re on the physico-chemical properties and the catalytic performance of the Cu–Re/TiO₂ catalysts was investigated. Moreover, the influence of various reaction parameters on the hydrogenation of LA to GVL was studied. The results showed that the Cu–Re/TiO₂ catalyst with a 1 : 1 molar ratio of Cu to Re (Cu–Re(1 : 1)/TiO₂) exhibited the highest performance for the reaction. Complete conversion of LA with a 100% yield of GVL was achieved in 1,4-dioxane solvent under the reaction conditions of 180 °C, 4.0 MPa H₂ for 4 h, and the catalyst could be reused at least 6 times with only a slight loss of activity. Combined with the characterization results, the high performance of the catalyst was mainly attributed to the well-dispersed Cu–Re nanoparticles with a very fine average size (ca. 0.69 nm) and the co-presence of Cu–Re bimetal and ReOₓ on the catalyst surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3ahydrogenation 3alevulinic acid 3aliquids 3asolvents 3athermal stability1 aLiu, Kai1 aZhang, Meihua1 aZhang, Kaiyue1 aMa, Jiao1 aXiao, Shuwen1 aWei, Zuojun1 aDeng, Shuguang0 tRSC advances.g2021 Dec. 22, v. 12, no. 1 p.602-610dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ra05804e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02173naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001500192245007400207506007600281520077100357592002801128506003701156650002601193650001501219650001701234650001801251650001701269650001701286650001601303650002601319650001901345650001701364650001101381650001601392653002901408653002901437700002501466700002201491773012001513856008501633852000901718655001201727IND60690167220221207124409.0200426e20150304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069016722DNAL7 a10.1080/15592324.2015.10109002doi7 aPMC46232432pmcid7 a258488892pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBao, Liang10aPhototropism in gametophytic shoots of the moss Physcomitrella patens  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aShoot phototropism enables plants to position their photosynthetic organs in favorable light conditions and thus benefits growth and metabolism in land plants. To understand the evolution of this response, we established an experimental system to study phototropism in gametophores of the moss Physcomitrella patens. The phototropic response of gametophores occurs slowly; a clear response takes place more than 24 hours after the onset of unilateral light irradiation, likely due to the slow growth rate of gametophores. We also found that red and far-red light can induce phototropism, with blue light being less effective. These results suggest that plants used a broad range of light wavelengths as phototropic signals during the early evolution of land plants.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPhyscomitrella patens 3ablue light 3aembryophytes 3afar-red light 3agametophores 3agametophytes 3airradiation 3amosses and liverworts 3aphotosynthesis 3aphototropism 3ashoots 3awavelengths 0aevolution of land plants 0agametophore phototropism1 aYamamoto, Kotaro T.,1 aFujita, Tomomichi0 tPlant signaling & behavior.g2015 Mar. 4, v. 10, no. 3 p.e1010900-dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2184x1559-23247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15592324.2015.10109003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02800naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245010500154300001600259520151900275592002801794650002201822650001201844650002101856650001201877650001801889650001701907650001901924650001201943650001201955650001301967650001901980650001801999650001702017700001502034700001102049700001402060700001702074700001702091700001502108700001502123773012002138856007502258852000902333655001202342IND60761952720221120081041.0220105e20211220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076195272DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ra06019h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Zhi10aOne-step fabrication of soft calcium superhydrophobic surfaces by a simple electrodeposition process  ap. 297-308.  aA simple, one-step electrodeposition process was rapidly performed on a metal substrate to fabricate calcium superhydrophobic surfaces in an electrolyte containing calcium chloride (CaCl₂), myristic acid (CH₃(CH₂)₁₂COOH), and ethanol, which can avoid the intricate post-processing of surface treatment. The morphology and surface chemical compositions of the fabricated superhydrophobic surfaces were systematically examined by means of SEM, XRD, and FTIR, respectively. The results indicate that the deposited surfaces were mainly composed of calcium myristate, which can dramatically lower surface free energy. The shortest process for constructing a superhydrophobic surface is about 0.5 min, and the maximum contact angle of the as-prepared surfaces can reach as high as 166°, showing excellent superhydrophobicity. By adjusting the electrodeposition time, the structure of the cathodic surface transforms from the turfgrass structure, loose flower structures, larger and dense flower structures, secondary flower structures, and then into tertiary or more flower structures. The superhydrophobic surfaces showed excellent rebound performance with a high-speed camera. After a pressing force, their hardness increases, but the superhydrophobic performance is not weakened. Inversely, the bouncing performance is enhanced. This electrodeposition process offers a promising approach for large areas of superhydrophobic surfaces on conductive metals and strongly impacts the dynamics of water droplets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3acalcium 3acalcium chloride 3acameras 3acontact angle 3aelectrolytes 3aelectroplating 3aethanol 3aflowers 3ahardness 3ahydrophobicity 3amyristic acid 3aturf grasses1 aHu, Yongbo1 aHe, Xu1 aXu, Yihao1 aLiu, Xuesong1 aZhou, Yizhou1 aHao, Limei1 aRuan, Ying0 tRSC advances.g2021 Dec. 20, v. 12, no. 1 p.297-308dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ra06019h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03506naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002500153245012400178300001400302520202600316592002802342650001402370650001802384650001302402650001602415650002002431650001002451650001902461650002502480650002002505650001502525650001802540650001502558650001102573650002402584650002002608650002502628650001202653651001102665653001902676653002802695653002302723653000802746700006002754773010202814856008702916852000903003655001203012IND60552575720221121220710.0161021e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055257572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2014.03.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBogstrand, Stig Tore10aWhich drugs are associated with highest risk for being arrested for driving under the influence? A case–control study  ap. 21-28.  aThe aim of this study was to determine the association between drug type and arrest for driving under the influence of drugs (DUID) by calculating odds ratios (ORs) using a case–control design. A DUID arrest is in most cases related to aberrant or risky driving and might therefore be regarded as a proxy for a drug related traffic crash. The ‘cases’ were 2738 drivers arrested on suspicion of drugged driving from April 2008 to March 2009 with blood alcohol concentrations below the legal limit of 0.2g/L; 794 were arrested due to involvement in road traffic crashes, whereas 1944 were arrested for other reasons, mainly dangerous driving, suspected impairment when stopped in traffic controls, or because of phone calls to the police from other road users or observers. The ‘controls’ were 9375 random drivers in normal traffic, also with alcohol concentrations below this limit. Blood samples from ‘cases’ and oral fluid samples from ‘controls’ were analyzed for 15 drugs that have legislative concentration limits in Norway, in addition to two other commonly detected psychoactive drugs. The most prevalent illicit drug in the control group was tetrahydrocannabinol (THC; 0.58%), which was also commonly found in samples from drivers arrested due to road crash (15.6%) or arrested for other reasons (21.8%). Amphetamine/methamphetamine was most prevalent among arrested drivers involved in crashes (30.6%) and drivers arrested for other reasons (56.9%), whereas only 0.18% of the control group was positive for amphetamine/methamphetamine. The single-use substances which gave highest OR for police arrest were amphetamine/methamphetamine, alprazolam, clonazepam and oxazepam. The majority of the alprazolam and clonazepam findings were probably due to non-therapeutic use of medicinal drugs purchased on the illegal market. Combinations of two or more drugs yielded higher ORs than the use of single substances; combinations of amphetamine/methamphetamine and benzodiazepines gave the highest risk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccidents 3aalcohol abuse 3aalcohols 3aamphetamine 3abenzodiazepines 3ablood 3ablood sampling 3acase-control studies 3adetection limit 3adrug abuse 3aillicit drugs 3aodds ratio 3apolice 3apsychotropic agents 3arisk assessment 3atetrahydrocannabinol 3atraffic 3aNorway 0aCase–control 0aPsychoactive substances 0aRoad traffic crash 0aDUI1 aGjerde, Hallvard1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1465-31280 tForensic science international.g2014 July, v. 240 p.21-28dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0379-07387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2014.03.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02551naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001400155245016100169520136500330592002801695650001401723650002401737650002601761650002201787650002201809650001601831653002201847653001801869653002201887653001201909700001601921700001701937700001601954700001701970773009101987856009002078852000902168655001202177IND60746099020221121155048.0211123e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074609902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2021.1065672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSourd, X.10aInfluence of the damage generated by abrasive water jet texturing on the tensile static and fatigue behaviour of 3D woven composite in the context of repair  aAbrasive water jet (AWJ) process has been certified in some aerospace companies for repair applications. However, there is no information in the literature on the influence of the induced damage on the mechanical behaviour of complex materials such as 3D woven CFRP composite. To fill this gap, three texturing levels have been produced and quantified using both surface roughness (Ra) and “crater volume” (Cv) criteria. The specimens have been subjected to tensile static and tension-tension fatigue tests. Contrarily to Ra measurements, a linear correlation was highlighted between the increase in Cv and the degradation of the specimens’ mechanical performances (ultimate tensile stress and fatigue limit). The damage scenario of the textured specimens has been identified via acoustic emission activity, thermal maps and X-ray tomography pictures. Wider cracks and a more intense acoustic activity leading to a greater rise in temperature have been observed when Cv increases (worse quality). However, the small alterations in mechanical properties consecutive to AWJ texturing prove that this technique can be used for surface preparation of 3D woven CFRP parts prior to bounding without damaging them. Moreover, an innovative method, based on the damage accumulation, has been proposed and accurately estimates the endurance limit of the specimens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3acomputed tomography 3amechanical properties 3amechanical stress 3asurface roughness 3atemperature 0aTexturing quality 0aCrater volume 0aTensile behaviour 0aFatigue1 aZitoune, R.1 aCrouzeix, L.1 aCoulaud, M.1 aLamouche, D.0 tComposites.g2021 Oct., v. 149 p.106567-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12034x1359-835X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesa.2021.1065673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02151naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245011200166300001600278520113600294592002801430650002001458650001201478650002401490650001801514650000901532650002001541650001301561651001501574700002201589773012601611856007901737852000901816655001201825IND60135907720221117162038.0150522e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013590772DNAL7 a10.1111/1467-8489.120582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWard, Patrick S.10aCapturing social network effects in technology adoption: the spatial diffusion of hybrid rice in Bangladesh  ap. 225-241.  aIn this paper, we demonstrate a method for measuring the effect of spatial interactions on the use of hybrid rice using a unique, nationally representative data set from Bangladesh. In order to circumvent the ‘reflection problem’, we consider an identification and estimation strategy employing a generalised spatial two‐stage least squares procedure with near‐ideal instruments to effectively identify causal influences. Results indicate that neighbour effects are a significant determinant of hybrid rice use. Further, using two specifications of spatial network systems, one based on same‐village membership (irrespective of distance) and the other based on geographical distance (irrespective of village boundary), we demonstrate that a network including nearby hybrid rice adopters is more influential than a network of more distant hybrid rice adopters, and merely having a network with a large number of adopters may be relatively meaningless if they are far away. Furthermore, we show that these network effects are much more important to hybrid cultivation than interactions with agricultural extension officers.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3ahybrids 3ainnovation adoption 3aleast squares 3arice 3asocial networks 3avillages 3aBangladesh1 aPede, Valerien O.0 tAustralian journal of agricultural and resource economics.g2015 Apr., v. 59, no. 2 p.225-241dBlackwellx1364-985X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1467-8489.120583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03134naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245010300168300001600271520139400287592002801681596004701709596006301756596010201819596005801921650001001979650001501989650001702004650001502021650002302036650001702059650001302076650001202089650001102101650001502112650001102127650001302138650001402151650001102165650000902176650001602185650001002201650001002211650001002221650001502231700001402246700001802260700001902278700005502297773013602352856008302488852000902571655001202580IND60633764320221118182941.0190416e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063376432DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-019-01557-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWong, Wai-ling,10aTissue-specific accumulation and subcellular localization of chalcone isomerase (CHI) in grapevine  ap. 125-137.  aFlavonoids are widely distributed secondary metabolic products with many biological functions in plants. Further elucidation of the accumulation and localization patterns of its biosynthesis enzymes will broaden our understanding of flavonoids biosynthesis and regulation. Chalcone isomerase (CHI, EC 5.5.1.6) is an early-step enzyme in the flavonoids biosynthesis pathway. In this study, using an antibody specifically developed against grapevine CHI enzyme, we found that the accumulation of CHI protein exhibited temporal and spatial specificity. In grape berries, CHI was investigated mainly in the outer hypodermis cells of exocarp tissues, in the vascular bundles of mesocarp; and in the integument and the cells around the raphe of seeds. At the subcellular level, CHI was visualized in the cytoplasm, nucleus, and plastids (chloroplasts) of the exocarp cells, while only in the cytoplasm of mesocarp vascular bundle cells. In grapevine vegetable organs, the leaf mesophyll and phloem of leaf veins, the pith ray and primary phloem of stems, the primary phloem and endoderm of roots, and the young leaves, leaf primordium, and the growth point of leaf buds were CHI signal-positive. In these tissue cells, CHI was primarily observed in the cytoplasm, cell wall, and nucleus. The distinct localization patterns of CHI suggested the complexity of flavonoids biosynthesis in grapevine.  aPublisher supplied data  aCARS-29cChina Agriculture Research System  a31601712cThe National Natural Science Foundation of China  aQNJJ201604cThe Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Science  a6182007cBeijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation 3aVitis 3aantibodies 3abiosynthesis 3acell walls 3achalcone isomerase 3achloroplasts 3aendoderm 3aexocarp 3agrapes 3aintegument 3aleaves 3amesocarp 3amesophyll 3aphloem 3apith 3aplant veins 3aroots 3aseeds 3astems 3avegetables1 aWang, Wei1 aZhan, Jicheng1 aHuang, Weidong1 aXu, Haiying1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6957-68120 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2019 Apr., v. 137, no. 1 p.125-137dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl33513x0167-68577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-019-01557-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02937naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245013300184300001600317520168000333592002802013650001202041650002902053650002302082650001002105650001502115650003302130650001502163650001602178650003802194650005302232650003302285650002902318651002502347651001102372773009902383856004802482852000902530655001202539IND50063342920221116195059.0130324e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006334292DNAL7 a233071392pmid7 a10.1007/s00267-012-0001-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlphan, Hakan10aBi-Temporal Analysis of Landscape Changes in the Easternmost Mediterranean Deltas Using Binary and Classified Change Information  ap. 541-554.  aThe aim of this study is (1) to quantify landscape changes in the easternmost Mediterranean deltas using bi-temporal binary change detection approach and (2) to analyze relationships between conservation/management designations and various categories of change that indicate type, degree and severity of human impact. For this purpose, image differencing and ratioing were applied to Landsat TM images of 1984 and 2006. A total of 136 candidate change images including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and principal component analysis (PCA) difference images were tested to understand performance of bi-temporal pre-classification analysis procedures in the Mediterranean delta ecosystems. Results showed that visible image algebra provided high accuracies than did NDVI and PCA differencing. On the other hand, Band 5 differencing had one of the lowest change detection performances. Seven superclasses of change were identified using from/to change categories between the earlier and later dates. These classes were used to understand spatial character of anthropogenic impacts in the study area and derive qualitative and quantitative change information within and outside of the conservation/management areas. Change analysis indicated that natural site and wildlife reserve designations fell short of protecting sand dunes from agricultural expansion in the west. East of the study area, however, was exposed to least human impact owing to the fact that nature conservation status kept human interference at a minimum. Implications of these changes were discussed and solutions were proposed to deal with management problems leading to environmental change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aanthropogenic activities 3aconservation areas 3adunes 3aecosystems 3aprincipal component analysis 3avegetation 2aAgriculture 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aGeographyxmethodsxstatistics & numerical data. 2aPrincipal Component Analysis 2aSatellite Communications 0aMediterranean Region 0aTurkey0 tEnvironmental management.g2013 Mar., v. 51, no. 3 p.541-554dSpringer-Verlagx0364-152X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-012-0001-9  aDNAL 7aarticle03092naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245014500164520154100309592002801850650002001878650001901898650000801917650003201925650002501957650001601982650001101998650001302009650001102022650001602033650002402049650001402073650005202087650001202139650001002151650001202161651001102173700002302184700002602207700002402233700002402257700002502281700002502306700002102331700003102352773012102383856007302504852000902577655001202586IND60711886820221118031149.0200928e20200827xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071188682DNAL7 a10.3390/v120909502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNery, Flávia  M. B.10aMolecular Characterization of Hovenia Dulcis-Associated Virus 1 (HDaV1) and 2 (HDaV2): New Tentative Species within the Order Picornavirales  aIn a systematic field survey for plant-infecting viruses, leaf tissues were collected from trees showing virus-like symptoms in Brazil. After viral enrichment, total RNA was extracted and sequenced using the MiSeq platform (Illumina). Two nearly full-length picorna-like genomes of 9534 and 8158 nucleotides were found associated with Hovenia dulcis (Rhamnaceae family). Based upon their genomic information, specific primers were synthetized and used in RT-PCR assays to identify plants hosting the viral sequences. The larger contig was tentatively named as Hovenia dulcis-associated virus 1 (HDaV1), and it exhibited low nucleotide and amino acid identities with Picornavirales species. The smaller contig was related to insect-associated members of the Dicistroviridae family but exhibited a distinct genome organization with three non-overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), and it was tentatively named as Hovenia dulcis-associated virus 2 (HDaV2). Phylogenetic analysis using the amino acid sequence of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) revealed that HDaV1 and HDaV2 clustered in distinct groups, and both viruses were tentatively assigned as new members of the order Picornavirales. HDaV2 was assigned as a novel species in the Dicistroviridae family. The 5′ ends of both viruses are incomplete. In addition, a nucleotide composition analysis (NCA) revealed that HDaV1 and HDaV2 have similarities with invertebrate-infecting viruses, suggesting that the primary host(s) of these novel virus species remains to be discovered.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDicistroviridae 3aHovenia dulcis 3aRNA 3aRNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aamino acid sequences 3aamino acids 3agenome 3agenomics 3aleaves 3anucleotides 3aopen reading frames 3aphylogeny 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asurveys 3atrees 3aviruses 3aBrazil1 aMelo, Fernando  L.1 aBoiteux, Leonardo  S.1 aRibeiro, Simone  G.1 aResende, Renato  O.1 aOrílio, Anelise  F.1 aBatista, Josiane  G.1 aLima, Mirtes  F.1 aPereira-Carvalho, Rita  C.0 tViruses.g2020 Aug. 27, v. 12, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v120909503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02655naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100007100140245009000211500001900301500002000320520153900340592002801879650002201907650001101929650001001940650002201950650000901972650001001981650001501991650001302006650001002019650001802029700002802047773013502075856007402210852000902284655001202293IND60722619820221120172231.0210106e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072261982DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpe.135912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaid, Prashant Pandharinath1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7011-427910aDevelopment of a decorticator for Buchanania lanzan nuts and its process optimization  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe study was aimed to develop a decorticator and to standardize the process for separation kernels from nuts. The developed machine was optimized using independent parameters, that is, cold water soaking, steaming, and sand roasting, different moisture levels (7 and 9%), cylinder speed (150 and 300 rpm), and concave clearances (7.5 and 8 mm). The optimum performance of a developed decorticator was obtained when sand roasted nuts (7% moisture content) fed at a cylinder speed of 300 rpm and a concave clearance of 8 mm. At this condition, decortication efficiency, capacity, and whole kernel recovery were 96.10, 64.15, and 12.60%, respectively. The decorticator produced 126 g whole kernels (56.71%) from 1 kg of nuts. The independent process parameters have significant effect on response variables. The machine had low labor requirement, high efficiency, and ease to operate; thus, the results will be useful for processing of nuts and in other studies. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The chironji nut decorticator has application to decorticate nuts to produce kernel at manufacturing site of food, flavor, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries. The kernels have very short shelf‐life because they are very soft and susceptible to mechanical damage and spoilage. The available decorticators have very limited efficiency and more breakage thus the results can be utilized to fill existing gap to obtain increased efficiency and less damage. The results of different treatments to nuts will assist future studies as well.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBuchanania lanzan 3aflavor 3alabor 3amechanical damage 3asand 3aseeds 3ashelf life 3aspoilage 3awater 3awater content1 aJadhav, Vinayak Shankar0 tJournal of food process engineering.g2021 Jan., v. 44, no. 1 p.e13591-dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl8651x0145-88767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpe.135913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02661naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002500155245011300180520152600293592002801819650002201847650001601869650001801885650001901903650001701922650001601939650002101955653003701976653003002013653002102043653000902064700001702073700001902090773009102109856009002200852000902290655001202299IND60746099320221121121209.0211123e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074609932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2021.1065702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarbhari, Vistasp M.10aEffect of thermal exposure on carbon fiber reinforced composites used in civil infrastructure rehabilitation  aIn this work, characteristics related to the thermo-oxidative resistance of a wet layup ambient cured carbon-epoxy composite are investigated using dynamic scanning calorimetry, dynamic mechanical thermal analysis, and thermo-gravimetric analysis. Specimens of the unidirectional composite are exposed to temperatures between 121℃ and 232℃ for periods of time between 1 and 72 h. Initial exposure results in post-cure and enhancement of thermal characteristics whereas higher temperatures and longer periods of exposure at the higher temperatures result in deterioration. Degradation is determined through DMTA based on decreases in both peak loss modulus height and activation energy, Eₐ, and through TGA based on decreases in apparent decomposition activation energy, Ed, using the Coats-Redfern method. In both cases, there appears to be no deterioration within the 72 h period at the two lower temperatures of exposure, and minimal deterioration at the next two levels, whereas initiation of deterioration can be noted as early as between 8 and 16 h of exposure at the highest temperature of exposure, 232 ℃. The reaction order determined using the Kissinger method is seen to remain fairly constant except at the highest temperature level wherein drops are noted after 24 h of exposure. This provides thermal data at the materials level to guide field use within the time–temperature combinations suggesting that residual integrity can be reasonably assumed at all except the highest temperature level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3acalorimetry 3acarbon fibers 3ainfrastructure 3aloss modulus 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 0aPolymer Matrix Composites (PMCs) 0aEnvironmental degradation 0aThermal Analysis 0aCure1 aXian, Guijun1 aHong, SoonKook0 tComposites.g2021 Oct., v. 149 p.106570-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12034x1359-835X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesa.2021.1065703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03237naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245010500161300001400266520200300280592002802283650001502311650001702326650001202343650001102355650001502366650001502381650002302396650001202419651001202431700002102443700002602464700002102490700002302511700002902534700002502563700002202588700002302610773010002633856007302733852000902806655001202815IND60135907920221116225705.0150522e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013590792DNAL7 a10.1111/ddi.122472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBucklin, David N.10aComparing species distribution models constructed with different subsets of environmental predictors  ap. 23-35.  aAIM: To assess the usefulness of combining climate predictors with additional types of environmental predictors in species distribution models for range‐restricted species, using common correlative species distribution modelling approaches. LOCATION: Florida, USA METHODS: We used five different algorithms to create distribution models for 14 vertebrate species, using seven different predictor sets: two with bioclimate predictors only, and five ‘combination’ models using bioclimate predictors plus ‘additional’ predictors from groups representing: human influence, land cover, extreme weather or noise (spatially random data).We use a linear mixed‐model approach to analyse the effects of predictor set and algorithm on model accuracy, variable importance scores and spatial predictions. RESULTS: Regardless of modelling algorithm, no one predictor set produced significantly more accurate models than all others, though models including human influence predictors were the only ones with significantly higher accuracy than climate‐only models. Climate predictors had consistently higher variable importance scores than additional predictors in combination models, though there was variation related to predictor type and algorithm. While spatial predictions varied moderately between predictor sets, discrepancies were significantly greater between modelling algorithms than between predictor sets. Furthermore, there were no differences in the level of agreement between binary ‘presence–absence’ maps and independent species range maps related to the predictor set used. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that additional predictors have relatively minor effects on the accuracy of climate‐based species distribution models and minor to moderate effects on spatial predictions. We suggest that implementing species distribution models with only climate predictors may provide an effective and efficient approach for initial assessments of environmental suitability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3abiogeography 3aclimate 3ahumans 3aland cover 3aprediction 3astatistical models 3aweather 3aFlorida1 aBasille, Mathieu1 aBenscoter, Allison M.1 aBrandt, Laura A.1 aMazzotti, Frank J.1 aRomañach, Stephanie S.,1 aSperoterra, Carolina1 aWatling, James I.1 aThuiller, Wilfried0 tDiversity & distributions.g2015 Jan., v. 21, no. 1 p.23-35dBlackwell Sciencex1366-95167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ddi.122473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02369naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002000192245008200212506007600294520104000370592002801410506003701438650001601475650002101491650002001512650003101532650001101563650001601574650001601590650001201606653001901618653002001637653001601657653002301673700001901696700001701715773012001732856008601852852000901938655001201947IND60690167820221207124403.0200513e20150603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069016782DNAL7 a10.1080/15592324.2015.10109332doi7 aPMC46220672pmcid7 a261768972pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShimizu, Hanako10aPhotoperiod sensitivity of the Arabidopsis circadian clock is tissue-specific  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTissue-specific functions of the circadian clock in Arabidopsis have recently been revealed. The vasculature clock shows distinctive gene expression profiles compared to the clock in other tissues under light-dark cycles. However, it has not yet been established whether the vasculature clock also shows unique gene expression patterns that correlate with temperature cycles, another important environmental cue. Here, we detected diel phase of TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1 (TOC1) expression in the vasculature and whole leaf under long-day light-dark cycles and temperature cycles. We found that the vasculature clock had advanced TOC1 phase under light-dark cycles but not under temperature cycles, suggesting that the vasculature clock has lower sensitivity against temperature signals. Furthermore, the phase advancement of TOC1 was seen only under long-day condition but not under short-day condition. These results support our previous conclusion that the circadian clock in vasculature preferentially senses photoperiodic signals.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3acircadian clocks 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3aleaves 3aphotoperiod 3atemperature 3atissues 0aambient signal 0acircadian clock 0aphase shift 0atissue-specificity1 aAraki, Takashi1 aEndo, Motomu0 tPlant signaling & behavior.g2015 June 3, v. 10, no. 6 p.e1010933-dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2184x1559-23247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15592324.2015.10109333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03506naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245012800165300001600293520202200309592002802331650003702359650002502396650001102421650001902432650001802451650001102469650001402480650002802494650001502522650002102537650001902558650001102577650001202588650001902600650002502619650001802644650001302662650001602675700001602691700001302707700001602720700001602736700001602752700002802768773012002796856007502916852000902991655001203000IND60761953220221120043056.0220105e20211220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076195322DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ra06473h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiller, Robert H. B.10aBioinspired super-hydrophobic fractal array via a facile electrochemical route: preparation and corrosion inhibition for Cu  ap. 265-276.  aSuper-hydrophobic surfaces (SHS) usually are formed from a combination of low surface energy materials and micro/nanostructures via two-step approaches, and they have promising applications in material corrosion protection. In this paper, the authors obtained a super-hydrophobic surface onto the copper plates through a rapid one-step electrodeposition process from the electrolytic solution containing cobalt nitrate (Co(NO₃)₂·6H₂O), myristic acid, and ethanol. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and polarization curve are adopted to evaluate a super-hydrophobic surface's durability and corrosion resistance. The results demonstrate that the super-hydrophobic cobalt myristate coating showed excellent corrosion inhibition in simulated seawater solution with a corrosion inhibition efficiency as high as 98.82%. Furthermore, the super-hydrophobic layer could be considered a barrier and thus require an ideal air-liquid interface that inhibits the diffusion of the corrosive species. The construction of super-hydrophobic characters with a self-cleaning property is significant and used widely, attracting numerous studies for obtaining surfaces with low surface energy and micro/nanostructures. The as-fabricated super-hydrophobic surfaces possess the external surface adhesive force to the water phase and excellent self-cleaning and antifouling ability. By adjusting processing time, the water contact angle of the coated copper surface reaches 152.9°, showing a superb superhydrophobicity. The morphology, chemical composition, and wettability characterization were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and contact angle measurements. In addition, a scanning Kelvin probe (SKP) usage in this work is to measure the atmospheric corrosion behavior of copper with the super-hydrophobic coating. Thus, this proposed method provides a simple way to rapidly equip super-hydrophobic coating onto the metal surface to realize corrosion inhibition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3achemical composition 3acobalt 3acobalt nitrate 3acontact angle 3acopper 3acorrosion 3adielectric spectroscopy 3adurability 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectroplating 3aenergy 3aethanol 3ahydrophobicity 3aliquid-air interface 3amyristic acid 3aseawater 3awettability1 aWei, Yinsha1 aMa, Cong1 aLi, Longyun1 aShao, Jihan1 aHu, Shugang1 aWeamie, Sonkarlay J.

We found that a nuclease-deficient Cas9 (dCas9) fused to a destabilization domain (DD) and 12 copies of the VP16 activation domain (VP192) triggered a more efficient KSHV lytic cycle and virus production when guided to two different sites on the ORF50 promoter, instead of only a single site. To our surprise, the virus reactivation induced by binding of the stable DD-dCas9-VP192 on the ORF50 promoter was even more efficient than reactivation induced by ectopic expression of ORF50. This suggests that recruitment of additional transcriptional activators to the ORF50 promoter, in addition to ORF50 itself, are needed for the efficient virus production. Further, we show that CRISPRa can be applied to selectively express the early lytic gene, ORF57, without disturbing the viral latency. Therefore, CRISPRa-based systems can be utilized to facilitate virus–host interaction studies by controlling the expression of not only cellular but also of specific KSHV genes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHuman gammaherpesvirus 8 3agene editing 3agenes 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3atransactivators 3aviruses1 aFalasco, Francesca 1 aGramolelli, Silvia 1 aNurminen, Veijo 1 aGünther, Thomas,1 aWeltner, Jere 1 aBalboa, Diego 1 aGrundhoff, Adam 1 aOtonkoski, Timo 1 aOjala, Päivi  M.0 tViruses.g2020 Aug. 27, v. 12, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v120909523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01443naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006000140245011700200300001700317520040100334592002800735650001000763650001700773650001400790650002200804700001600826700001800842700001600860700001300876700001900889773012600908856007401034852000901108655001201117IND60617335220221121012446.0181025e20180501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061733522DNAL7 a10.1039/c7bm01114h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiuThese authors contributed equally to this work., Lin10aLight-triggered release of drug conjugates for an efficient combination of chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy  ap. 997-1001.  aHerein, we present a series of light-triggered porphyrin-based polymeric drug conjugates PSDTD-m for combined chemo-photodynamic therapy of cancer.

However, contemporary methods for the analysis of RNA modifications are limited to the detection of highly abundant modifications in bulk tissue samples, potentially obscuring unique epitranscriptomes of individual cells with population averages. We developed an approach, single-neuron RNA modification analysis by mass spectrometry (SNRMA-MS), that enables the detection and quantification of numerous post-transcriptionally modified nucleosides in single cells. When compared to a conventional RNA extraction approach that does not allow detection of RNA modifications in single cells, SNRMA-MS leverages an optimized sample preparation approach to detect up to 16 RNA modifications in individual neurons from the central nervous system of Aplysia californica. SNRMA-MS revealed that the RNA modification profiles of identified A. californica neurons with different physiological functions were mostly cell specific. However, functionally homologous neurons tended to demonstrate similar modification patterns. Stable isotope labeling with CD₃-Met showed significant differences in RNA methylation rates that were dependent on the identity of the modification and the cell, with metacerebral cells (MCCs) displaying the fastest incorporation of CD₃ groups into endogenous RNAs. Quantitative SNRMA-MS showed higher intracellular concentrations for 2′-O-methyladenosine and 2′-O-methylcytidine in homologous R2/LPl1 cell pairs than in MCCs. Overall, SNRMA-MS is the first analytical approach capable of simultaneously quantifying numerous RNA modifications in single neurons and revealing cell-specific modification profiles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAplysia californica 3aRNA 3aanalytical chemistry 3acentral nervous system 3amass spectrometry 3amethylation 3anucleosides 3astable isotopes1 aRubakhin, Stanislav S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0437-14931 aSweedler, Jonathan V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3107-99220 tAnalytical chemistry.g2021 Oct. 21, v. 93, no. 43 p.14537-14544dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c035073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03056naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245017500168300001800343520143700361592002801798650004101826650002601867650001501893650001301908650001001921650002101931650001001952650002101962650002101983650000902004650001202013650001302025650002502038650000902063650001702072653001502089653001702104653001102121653001602132653000902148700001602157700001902173700001402192700001202206700001602218700001802234700001202252700001602264700001602280773009902296856008602395852000902481655001202490IND60534647120221122031900.0190319e20140310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053464712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.01.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Aixin10aEvaluation of efficacy, biodistribution and safety of antibiotic-free plasmid encoding somatostatin genes delivered by attenuated Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis  ap. 1368-1374.  aWe describe here a balanced-lethal system using an Asd+ expression plasmid pVGS/2SS-asd encoding two copies of somatostatin (SS) genes carried by Δasd/Δcrp double mutant Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis (named C501). The advantage of this novel system is the use of asd (aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase) gene as selection marker to replace the antibiotic resistance markers, thus eliminating the industrial cultivation and environmental problems. We then evaluated the efficacy, biodistribution and safety of antibiotic-free plasmid delivered by strains C501. Mice orally immunized with C501 (pVGS/2SS-asd) had significantly higher levels of anti-SS total IgG and IgA antibodies than control mice and demonstrated a bias toward Th2-associated responses (IgG1/IgG2a ratio>1). Safety evaluation indicated that vaccinated mice displayed no abnormal clinical signs and histological changes. Biodistribution result revealed that the GS/2SS message was detected in several examined tissues with the exception of ovary and brain, but was rapidly cleared from the body (approximately 10 days). Furthermore, the risk of integration of plasmid pVGS/2SS-asd into the host cellular genome was considered to be negligible. These results may have important implications for the use of vaccine strain C501 (pVGS/2SS-asd) in domestic animals and prompt new perspectives on the safety of DNA vaccines delivered by attenuated bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonella choleraesuis Choleraesuis 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibodies 3abacteria 3abrain 3adomestic animals 3agenes 3aimmunoglobulin A 3aimmunoglobulin G 3amice 3amutants 3aplasmids 3arecombinant vaccines 3arisk 3asomatostatin 0aSalmonella 0aSomatostatin 0aSafety 0aDNA vaccine 0aMice1 aRiaz, Hasan1 aDong, Fangxiao1 aLuo, Xuan1 aYu, Xue1 aHan, Yanguo1 aChong, Zhenlu1 aHan, Li1 aGuo, Aizhen1 aYang, Liguo0 tVaccine.g2014 Mar. 10, v. 32, no. 12 p.1368-1374dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.01.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04166naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003700113040001800150100002100168245013900189300001600328520174600344592002802090650002402118650001202142650001702154650001302171650002002184650001302204650002302217650001402240650001002254650001602264650001902280650002102299650001202320650002902332650001302361650005202374650002002426650001302446650003402459650003702493650007302530650006402603650005702667650001402724650005602738650006502794650004002859650002002899650003402919650002602953653002402979653002003003653002403023653001603047653002403063653002303087700002603110700002303136700001703159700002703176700002603203773012203229856008403351852000903435655001203444IND60113586020221120172409.0190318e20130101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011358602DNAL7 a230792422pmid7 a10.1016/j.jplph.2012.08.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMhadhbi, Haythem10aAlternative oxidase 1 (Aox1) gene expression in roots of Medicago truncatula is a genotype-specific component of salt stress tolerance  ap. 111-114.  aAlternative oxidase (AOX) is the central component of the non-phosphorylating alternative respiratory pathway in plants and may be important for mitochondrial function during environmental stresses. Recently it has been proposed that Aox can be used as a functional marker for breeding stress tolerant plant varieties. This requires characterization of Aox alleles in plants with different degree of tolerance in a certain stress, affecting plant phenotype in a recognizable way. In this study we examined Aox1 gene expression levels in Medicago truncatula genotypes differing in salt stress tolerance, in order to uncover any correlation between Aox expression and tolerance to salt stress. Results demonstrated a specific induction of Aox1 gene expression in roots of the tolerant genotype that presented the lowest modulation in phenotypic and biochemical stress indices such as morphologic changes, protein level, lipid peroxidation and ROS generation. Similarly, in a previous study we reported that induction of antioxidant gene expression in the tolerant genotype contributed to the support of the antioxidant cellular machinery and stress tolerance. Correlation between expression patterns of the two groups of genes was revealed mainly in 48h treated roots. Taken together, results from both experiments suggest that M. truncatula tolerance to salt stress may in part due to an efficient control of oxidative balance thanks to (i) induction of antioxidant systems and (ii) involvement of the AOX pathway. This reinforces the conclusion that differences in antioxidant mechanisms can be essential for salt stress tolerance in M. truncatula and possibly the corresponding genes, especially Aox, could be utilized as functional marker.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMedicago truncatula 3aalleles 3aantioxidants 3abreeding 3agene expression 3agenotype 3alipid peroxidation 3aphenotype 3aroots 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3astress tolerance 2aAlleles 2aAntioxidantsxmetabolism 2aBreeding 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxdrug effects 2aGenetic Markers 2aGenotype 2aHydrogen Peroxidexmetabolism 2aLipid Peroxidationxdrug effects 2aMedicago truncatulaxdrug effectsxenzymologyxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aMitochondrial Proteinsxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aOxidoreductasesxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPhenotype 2aPlant Proteinsxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Rootsxdrug effectsxenzymologyxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aReal-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSalt Tolerance. 2aSodium Chloridexpharmacology 2aStress, Physiological 0aAlternative oxidase 0aGene expression 0aMedicago truncatula 0aSalt stress 0aTolerance behaviour 0aFunctional markers1 aFotopoulos, Vasileios1 aMylona, Photini V.1 aJebara, Moez1 aAouani, Mohamed Elarbi1 aPolidoros, Alexios N.0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2013 Jan. 01, v. 170, no. 1 p.111-114dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl39020x0176-16177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2012.08.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04508naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245011900167300001200286520266100298592002802959596014202987650002103129650002103150650001803171650002103189650001103210650001403221650002203235650002503257650001603282650001603298650001203314650001003326650001603336650003303352650001203385650001503397650004303412650001703455650002003472650002303492650001003515650001803525700001903543700001703562700001803579700001303597700002103610700003803631700005603669773011303725856008303838852000903921655001203930IND60760393420221120090838.0220502e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076039342DNAL7 a10.1186/s13071-021-05052-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLü, Xiaojuan,14aThe ecdysteroid receptor regulates salivary gland degeneration through apoptosis in Rhipicephalus haemaphysaloides  ap. 612.  aBACKGROUND: It is well established that ecdysteroid hormones play an important role in arthropod development and reproduction, mediated by ecdysteroid receptors. Ticks are obligate hematophagous arthropods and vectors of pathogens. The salivary gland plays an essential role in tick growth and reproduction and in the transmission of pathogens to vertebrate hosts. During tick development, the salivary gland undergoes degeneration triggered by ecdysteroid hormones and activated by apoptosis. However, it is unknown how the ecdysteroid receptor and apoptosis regulate salivary gland degeneration. Here, we report the functional ecdysteroid receptor (a heterodimer of the ecdysone receptor [EcR] and ultraspiracle [USP]) isolated from the salivary gland of the tick Rhipicephalus haemaphysaloides and explore the molecular mechanism of ecdysteroid receptor regulation of salivary gland degeneration. METHODS: The full length of RhEcR and RhUSP open reading frames (ORFs) was obtained from the transcriptome. The RhEcR and RhUSP proteins were expressed in a bacterial heterologous system, Escherichia coli. Polyclonal antibodies were produced against synthetic peptides and were able to recognize recombinant and native proteins. Quantitative real-time PCR and western blot were used to detect the distribution of RhEcR, RhUSP, and RhCaspases in the R. haemaphysaloides organs. A proteomics approach was used to analyze the expression profiles of the ecdysteroid receptors, RhCaspases, and other proteins. To analyze the function of the ecdysteroid receptor, RNA interference (RNAi) was used to silence the genes in adult female ticks. Finally, the interaction of RhEcR and RhUSP was identified by heterologous co-expression assays in HEK293T cells. RESULTS: We identified the functional ecdysone receptor (RhEcR/RhUSP) of 20-hydroxyecdysone from the salivary gland of the tick R. haemaphysaloides. The RhEcR and RhUSP genes have three and two isoforms, respectively, and belong to a nuclear receptor family but with variable N-terminal A/B domains. The RhEcR gene silencing inhibited blood-feeding, blocked engorgement, and restrained salivary gland degeneration, showing the biological role of the RhEcR gene in ticks. In the ecdysteroid signaling pathway, RhEcR silencing inhibited salivary gland degeneration by suppressing caspase-dependent apoptosis. The heterologous expression in mammalian HEK293T cells showed that RhEcR1 interacts with RhUSP1 and induces caspase-dependent apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that RhEcR has an essential role in tick physiology and represents a putative target for the control of ticks and tick-borne diseases.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo. Y2021GH01-3cCentral Public-interest Scientific Institution Basal Research Fund for Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences 3aEscherichia coli 3aRNA interference 3aRhipicephalus 3aWestern blotting 3aadults 3aapoptosis 3aecdysone receptor 3aecdysteroid receptor 3aecdysterone 3aengorgement 3afemales 3agenes 3ahematophagy 3aheterologous gene expression 3amammals 3aproteomics 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areproduction 3asalivary glands 3asynthetic peptides 3aticks 3atranscriptome1 aZhang, Zhipeng1 aYuan, Dongqi1 aZhou, Yongzhi1 aCao, Jie1 aZhang, Houshuang1 ada Silva Vaz, Itabajara, Jr.cJr.1 aZhou, Jinlin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3383-10840 tParasites & vectors.g2021 Dec., v. 14, no. 1 p.612-612dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-021-05052-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02801naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002300155245008300178300001600261520137400277592002801651650002101679650002901700650002101729650002801750650002201778650001001800650002901810650001201839650001601851650001301867650005201880650001701932650001201949650001301961700002601974700002702000700002302027700002402050700002302074700003002097773011802127856008902245852000902334655001202343IND60099573220221118045811.0141105e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009957322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2012.07.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRangel, Luciana P.10aPutative role of an ABC transporter in Fonsecaea pedrosoi multidrug resistance  ap. 409-415.  aFonsecaea pedrosoi, a dematiaceous fungus, is the main agent responsible for chromoblastomycosis, a chronic and progressive mycosis of the skin and subcutaneous tissues. This disease can cause different types of lesions depending on the immune status of the host. Its treatment is complicated by the toxicity of available antifungal agents as well as drug resistance. In this work, an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter in this fungus was characterised, with the degree of expression related to the drug resistance of two strains (a patient isolated strain and a laboratory strain). A 150kDa protein was detected by western blotting. The ATPase activity of membrane preparations was also evaluated. The F. pedrosoi transporter appears to behave like Pdr5p, a well-studied multidrug resistance transporter in Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the ability to hydrolyse different triphosphate nucleotides, as well as its response to classical inhibitors tested. Finally, a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) approach was used and a 400bp product was detected, corresponding to the highly conserved ATP-binding domain of ABC transporters. We suggest that an ABC transporter must be involved in F. pedrosoi multidrug resistance, and a complete understanding of this protein could bring an important contribution to antifungal treatment of this disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aABC transporters 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aWestern blotting 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3aantifungal agents 3afungi 3amultiple drug resistance 3amycoses 3anucleotides 3apatients 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atherapeutics 3atissues 3atoxicity1 aMoreira, Otacílio C.1 aLivramento, Gustavo N.1 aBritto, Constança1 aAlviano, Daniela S.1 aAlviano, Celuta S.1 aFerreira-Pereira, Antonio0 tInternational journal of antimicrobial agents.g2012 Nov., v. 40, no. 5 p.409-415dElsevier B.V.x0924-85797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2012.07.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01986naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245007400161300001800235520096800253592002801221650001701249650001101266650001101277650002301288650001301311650001501324700001501339700005901354700002201413773013601435856008001571852000901651655001201660IND60744997720221120085017.0210723e20210707xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074499772DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.1c019862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Bin10aPhase Separation of Polyelectrolytes: The Effect of Charge Regulation  ap. 7863-7870.  aComplex coacervation, known as the liquid–liquid phase separation of solutions with oppositely charged polyelectrolytes, has attracted substantial interest in recent years. We study the effect of the charge regulation (CR) mechanism on the complex coacervation by including short-range interactions between the charged sites on the polymer chains as well as an association–dissociation energy parameter in the CR mechanism. We investigate the phase diagrams of two CR models: (i) the hopping CR model (HCR) and (ii) the asymmetric CR model (ACR). It is shown that during the phase separation that the polymers in the condensed phase are more charged than those in the dilute phase, in accordance with Le Chatelier’s principle. In addition, secondary CR effects also influence the change in the volume fraction of the two phases. The latter can cause the charge difference between the two phases to change nonmonotonically as a function of the CR parameters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3amodels 3aphysical chemistry 3apolymers 3aseparation1 aAvni, Yael1 aAndelman, David1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3185-84751 aPodgornik, Rudolf0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 July 07, v. 125, no. 28 p.7863-7870dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.1c019863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03211naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245010700168300001600275520144500291592002801736650002101764650002501785650001601810650002301826650002201849650001201871650002301883650002001906650001001926650001801936650002201954650001601976650001801992650000902010650002202019650001302041650005202054650002902106653002302135653002002158653001602178653000902194653002502203653002302228700002102251700003402272700002102306700001702327700001702344700001702361700002102378700002002399773010002419856008102519852000902600655001202609IND60600617320221118154956.0180703e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060061732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nut.2013.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNikolai, Sibylle10aR-α lipoic acid γ-cyclodextrin complex increases energy expenditure: A 4-month feeding study in mice  ap. 228-233.  aA high-fat diet (HFD) affects energy expenditure in laboratory rodents. R-α lipoic acid cyclodextrin (RALA-CD) complex is a stable form of lipoic acid (LA) and may improve energy expenditure. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of RALA-CD on energy expenditure and underlying molecular targets in female laboratory mice.Female C57BL/6J mice were fed a HFD containing 0.1% LA for about 16 wk. The effects on energy expenditure, gene and protein expression were assessed using indirect calorimetry, real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, and Western blot, respectively.Supplementing mice with RALA-CD resulted in a significant increase in energy expenditure. However, both RALA per se (without γ-cyclodextrin) and S-α lipoic acid cyclodextrin did not significantly alter energy expenditure. Furthermore RALA-CD changed expression of genes encoding proteins centrally involved in energy metabolism. Transcriptional key regulators sirtuin 3 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, coactivator 1 alpha, as well as thyroid related enzyme type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase were up-regulated in brown adipose tissue (BAT) of RALA-CD–fed mice. Importantly, mRNA and/or protein expression of downstream effectors uncoupling protein (Ucp) 1 and 3 also were elevated in BAT from RALA-CD-supplemented mice.Overall, present data suggest that RALA-CD is a regulator of energy expenditure in laboratory mice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3abrown adipose tissue 3acalorimetry 3aenergy expenditure 3aenergy metabolism 3afemales 3agamma-cyclodextrin 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahigh fat diet 3aiodide peroxidase 3alipoic acid 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteins 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atranscription (genetics) 0aEnergy expenditure 0aγ-cyclodextrin 0aLipoic acid 0aMice 0aBrown adipose tissue 0aUncoupling protein1 aHuebbe, Patricia1 aMetges, C.

This led to a rise in fuel consumption and to higher CO2 emissions. On this basis, and in order to meet the European regulatory requirements on CO2 emissions (less than 95 g CO2/km) by 2020, vehicle weight reduction is currently a privileged research axis. In this study, hollow microspheres (HM), used as lighter fillers, were incorporated to a high impact polypropylene (HIPP), a copolymer commonly used for car bumpers. We explored the impact of pilot-scale melt-processing on these HM and assessed the influence of their addition on the copolymer density and on its properties. We showed that two commercially available HM can better withstand the melt-processing and allow a significant reduction of the polymer density. Good agreement was found between experimental data of tensile strength and the Nicholais–Narkis model prediction on this parameter.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acomposite polymers 3aenergy use and consumption 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3amicroparticles 3apolypropylenes 3atensile strength 3aweight loss 0aHigh impact poly-(propylene) 0aHollow microspheres 0aDensity 0aWeight reduction 0aMechanical properties 0aMorphological properties1 aBourmaud, Alain1 aJouannet, Denis1 aFalher, Thierry1 aOrange, François1 aRetoux, Richard1 aLe Pluart, Loïc1 aCauret, Laurent0 tPolymer degradation and stability.g2015 Apr., v. 114 p.146-153dElsevier LtdwJournal:12486x0141-39107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2014.12.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03556naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005300151245016500204300002000369520174200389592002802131650002202159650001202181650001502193650001602208650001902224650001602243650002002259650001902279650002502298650001302323650002102336650001902357650002502376650001602401650002002417653003002437653002302467653002102490653002202511700006702533700001602600700005402616700001302670700001102683700002002694700001302714700001802727700001702745773014602762856008502908852000902993655001203002IND60672006720221122225708.0191007e20190826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067200672DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b041192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBao, Teng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5009-950X10aGreen Synthesis of Fe₃O₄@Carbon Filter Media for Simultaneous Phosphate Recovery and Nitrogen Removal from Domestic Wastewater in Biological Aerated Filters  ap. 16698-16709.  aDomestic wastewater depth processing and reclamation are essential in the alleviation of global water shortage. In this study, an innovative filter media (i.e., Fe₃O₄@Carbon filter media [FCM]) was synthesized and subsequently used in a biological aerated filter (BAF) for simultaneous phosphate recovery and nitrogen removal (SPN) from domestic wastewater. The performance of FCM was compared with the commercially available ceramsite (CAC). The results showed that the performance of FCMBAF was better than that of CACBAF; as far as SPN is concerned, the magnetic field of FCMBAF could accelerate the growth rate of biofilm. Moreover, the nitrospira and nirK gene copy numbers of FCMBAF were considerably higher than those of CACBAF. Interestingly, the interconnectivity and uniformity of pores were also suitable for the microdistribution of biofilm, where different aerobic and anaerobic zones of the FCM were formed. This facilitates the microinteraction between the key microorganisms and the filter media that successfully enhanced the nitrogen removal. The phosphate recovery was attained via hydroxyapatite (Ca₁₀(PO₄)₆(OH)₂) formation, which resulted from the reaction between phosphate (PO₄³–) and FCM. The average effluent concentrations of total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), ammonia nitrogen (NH₄⁺-N), and PO₄³– were 8.12, 6.18, 0.997, and 0.073 mg/L of FCMBAF, respectively, which were lower than those from the national standard (CODcᵣ ≤ 50 mg L–¹, NH₄⁺-N ≤ 5.0 mg L–¹, TN ≤ 15 mg L–¹, TP ≤ 0.5 mg L–¹, GB 18918–2002, first standard). Thus, FCM demonstrated a promising potential for SPN and wastewater recycling of BAF in domestic wastewater treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium nitrogen 3abiofilm 3abiofilters 3agene dosage 3ahydroxyapatite 3airon oxides 3amagnetic fields 3amicroorganisms 3amunicipal wastewater 3anitrogen 3asewage treatment 3atotal nitrogen 3atotal organic carbon 3awater reuse 3awater shortages 0aFe3O4@Carbon filter media 0aPhosphate recovery 0aNitrogen removal 0aMicrobial biofilm1 aDamtie, Mekdimu Mezemir1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4985-65741 aYu, Zhi Min1 aLiu, Yiwen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6677-79611 aJin, Jie1 aWu, Ke1 aDeng, Cheng Xun1 aWei, Wei1 aWei, Xing Lai1 aNi, Bing-Jie0 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2019 Aug. 26, v. 7, no. 19 p.16698-16709dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b041193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04030naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245016000176300001600336520256000352592002802912650002002940650002602960650001102986650001402997650001303011650001803024650001103042650001403053650001503067650001303082650001403095650003103109650002403140650000903164650002203173650001603195650001503211700002303226700002103249700002403270700002003294700001803314773011803332856008903450852000903539655001203548IND60099573720221118045900.0141105e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009957372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2012.08.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBally, Michèle,12aA network meta-analysis of antibiotics for treatment of hospitalised patients with suspected or proven meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection  ap. 479-495.  aInfections due to meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pose a serious health risk. Novel methods for assessing comparative effectiveness and safety may provide valuable insights into therapeutic choices. We did a systematic review searching electronic databases including the archives of FDA/CDER and performed a Bayesian network meta-analysis to compare parenteral antibiotics used for treating hospitalised adults with complicated skin and soft-tissue infections (cSSTIs) or hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated pneumonia (HAP/VAP). Models were adjusted for clinical heterogeneity due to between-arm differences in the proportion of patients with diabetes (for cSSTI) and in those requiring mechanical ventilation (for pneumonia). Treatments were ranked on efficacy, defined as clinical success in the modified intention-to-treat population (MITT) and in the MITT population with MRSA at baseline (MRSA m-MITT), on all-cause mortality (in pneumonia only), and on serious adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events. We identified 24 randomised controlled trials (17 for cSSTI and 10 for HAP/VAP) comparing one of six antibiotics with vancomycin. The network meta-analysis indicated that vancomycin ranked third (of six antibiotics) in cSSTI and second (of four) in pneumonia on both efficacy and safety. However, direct pairwise meta-analyses remained inconclusive as evidenced by the adjusted median odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% credible intervals. In cSSTI, linezolid and ceftaroline were non-significantly more effective than vancomycin. Linezolid ORs were 1.15 (0.74–1.71) and 1.01 (0.42–2.14) and ceftaroline ORs were 1.12 (0.78–1.64) and 1.59 (0.68–3.74) in the MITT and MRSA m-MITT populations, respectively. For HAP/VAP, linezolid was non-significantly better than vancomycin, with ORs of 1.05 (0.72–1.57) and 1.32 (0.71–2.48) in the MITT and MRSA m-MITT populations, respectively. We suspect performance and detection bias in cSSTI trials involving linezolid, but regression methods could not adjust for this potential bias. In these clinical trials, the preferred agents for treating serious MRSA infections were ceftaroline (for cSSTI, not studied in HAP/VAP) and linezolid. However, translation of these findings into practice should consider the small size of the evidence networks and the consequent uncertainty associated with the parameter estimates, the lack of evidence for ceftaroline in patients with severe renal impairment, and the lower internal validity of some of the linezolid trials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aadults 3adatabases 3adiabetes 3ameta-analysis 3amodels 3amortality 3aodds ratio 3apatients 3apneumonia 3arandomized clinical trials 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3asystematic review 3auncertainty 3avancomycin1 aDendukuri, Nandini1 aSinclair, Alison1 aAhern, Stéphane P.1 aPoisson, Michel1 aBrophy, James0 tInternational journal of antimicrobial agents.g2012 Dec., v. 40, no. 6 p.479-495dElsevier B.V.x0924-85797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2012.08.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01656naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245013900175300001800314520053200332592002800864650001300892650002100905650001900926651002200945653001200967653001600979653002200995653001901017653001401036700002801050700002401078773011101102856008401213852000901297655001201306IND60123022320221118005517.0150325e20141225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012302232DNAL7 a10.1080/00222933.2014.9581142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeñarís, Marcos P.10aMorphology of Falcidens vasconiensis (Mollusca, Caudofoveata, Chaetodermatidae), including a 3D reconstruction of the internal anatomy  ap. 2871-2884.  aThe morphology and internal anatomy of the caudofoveate Falcidens vasconiensis Salvini-Plawen, 1996, are described and a 3D reconstruction of its anatomy is made with the program AVIZO 6.3.1.

In this context, one crucial point concerns the comparison of the performance and accuracy of classical force fields (FFs), which sometimes remains elusive. To date, the assessments performed on different classical potentials are mostly based on the comparison with experimental observables, which typically regard average properties. However, local differences of the structure and dynamics, which are poorly captured by average measurements, can make a difference, but these are nontrivial to catch. Here, we propose an agnostic way to compare different FFs at different resolutions (atomistic, united-atom, and coarse-grained), by means of a high-dimensional similarity metrics built on the framework of Smooth Overlap of Atomic Position (SOAP). We compare and classify a set of 13 FFs, modeling 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) bilayers. Our SOAP kernel-based metrics allows us to compare, discriminate, and correlate different FFs at different model resolutions in an unbiased, high-dimensional way. This also captures differences between FFs in modeling nonaverage events (originating from local transitions), for example, the liquid-to-gel phase transition in dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayers, for which our metrics allows us to identify nucleation centers for the phase transition, highlighting some intrinsic resolution limitations in implicit versus explicit solvent FFs.  aPublisher supplied data 3alipid bilayers 3alipids 3amolecular dynamics 3aphase transition 3asolvents1 aGardin, Andrea1 aEmpereur-mot, Charly1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6972-82251 aDoni, Giovanni1 aPavan, Giovanni M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3473-84710 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 July 13, v. 125, no. 28 p.7785-7796dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.1c025033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02017naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245016100173300001800334520092500352592002801277650002101305650002501326650001301351650001701364650004901381650000901430650002201439650002101461700002501482773009101507856008401598852000901682655001201691IND60090226220221116154439.0141102e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009022622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biochi.2012.07.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAntipov, Alexey N.10aIsolation and preliminary characterization of new cytochrome c from autotrophic haloalkaliphilic sulfur-oxidizing bacterium Thioalkalivibrio nitratireducens  ap. 2577-2581.  aNew small cytochrome c (TniCYT) was purified from haloalkaliphilic sulfur-oxidizing bacterium Thioalkalivibrio nitratireducens. The protein was analyzed by mass spectrometry as well as using visible, CD and EPR spectroscopy. It was found that TniCYT is a monomer with a molecular mass of 9461 Da which contains two hemes per molecule. The data of CD and EPR spectroscopy showed that two hemes possess different optical activity and are in distinct, high and low spin states. TniCYT was also demonstrated to have unusual characteristics in the visible spectrum, namely, the splitting of characteristic peaks was observed in α- and β-bands of the heme spectrum when the reduced form of cytochrome was analyzed. The α-band has two peaks with maximum at 548 and 556 nm whereas the β-band showes ones at 520 and 528 nm. According to the MALDI finger-print analysis, the new cytochrome has a unique amino acid sequence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThioalkalivibrio 3aamino acid sequences 3abacteria 3acytochrome c 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aheme 3amass spectrometry 3amolecular weight1 aTishkov, Vladimir I.0 tBiochimie.g2012 Dec., v. 94, no. 12 p.2577-2581dElsevier Masson SASx0300-90847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2012.07.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02174naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002900154245007000183300001600253520097400269592002801243650001201271650002501283650001101308650001601319650002301335650001201358650001001370650001901380650001501399650003301414650000901447650001001456700003401466700003301500700002201533700003601555773010701591856005701698852000901755655001201764IND4468405920221121110558.0120521e200501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446840592DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.2005.tb09060.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSerrano‐Megías, Marta10aOptimization of Tropical Juice Composition for the Spanish Market  ap.

A nonverbal test, analyzed by proxscal, demonstrated that decreasing an amount of concentrate juice from 4% to 1% would have no statistically significant effect on flavor recognition by consumers. Internal preference map for flavor and color acceptability revealed that a commercial mix of pineapple with white grape juice mix (used as control) was the most accepted juice, closely followed by an experimental mix of passion fruit with white grape juice.

Melatonin is an effective antioxidant and free radical scavenger in various cells. In this study, therefore, the aim was to evaluate the post-thawed quality of spermatozoa after cryopreservation of rooster semen in freezing extender supplemented with melatonin. Semen samples from seven Green-legged Partridge roosters were pooled and diluted with EK extender supplemented with 10−3, 10−6, or 10−9 M melatonin (control sample was prepared without supplementation with melatonin), and the pooled sample was subjected to cryopreservation. Post-thawed sperm motility was determined using the IVOS system, whereas plasma membrane status, acrosome integrity, mitochondrial activity, lipid peroxidation, chromatin status, and apoptotic-like changes were determined using fluorochromes and flow cytometry. Results, indicate post-thaw motile sperm cell count was greater (P < 0.05) in the frozen samples supplemented with melatonin (10−3 and 10−6 M) than the control sample. Although no significant differences were observed in post-thawed acrosomal integrity, plasma membrane integrity and mitochondrial activity were greater (P < 0.05) in samples frozen with melatonin (10−3 and 10−6 M) than that of the control sample. In addition, with supplementation of melatonin there was a decrease (P < 0.05) in the amount of lipid peroxidation, DNA fragmentation, and apoptotic-like changes after thawing. These results indicate there is a positive effect of melatonin supplementation in rooster semen freezing extenders on post-thaw sperm quality.  aPublisher supplied data 0aMelatonin 0aCryopreservation 0aMotility 0aQuality 0aSperm 0aChicken1 aPartyka, Agnieszka1 aLigocka, Zuzanna1 aNiżański, Wojciech0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2020 Jan., v. 212 p.106238-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11636x0378-43207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2019.1062383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02663naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245009300175520122000268592002801488650002501516650001501541650002001556650001201576650002301588650001201611650001501623650001301638650001201651650001401663653000801677653000801685653001701693653001801710653000901728653001701737653001401754653001601768653001501784653001201799700002101811700001901832700001901851700001801870700002501888700002301913773011401936856008602050852000902136655001202145IND60753027320221120161214.0220404e20220215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075302732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1274362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarthou, Manon C.M.10aCalcium-permeable cation channels are involved in uranium uptake in Arabidopsis thaliana  aUranium (U) is a non-essential and toxic element that is taken up by plants from the environment. The assimilation pathway of U is still unknown in plants. In this study, we provide several evidences that U is taken up by the roots of Arabidopsis thaliana through Ca²⁺-permeable cation channels. First, we showed that deprivation of Arabidopsis plants with calcium induces a 1.5-fold increase in the capacity of roots to accumulate U, suggesting that calcium deficiency promotes the radionuclide import pathway. Second, we showed that external calcium inhibits U accumulation in roots, suggesting a common route for the uptake of both cations. Third, we found that gadolinium, nifedipine and verapamil inhibit the absorption of U, suggesting that different types of Ca²⁺-permeable channels serve as a route for U uptake. Last, we showed that U bioaccumulation in Arabidopsis mutants deficient for the Ca²⁺-permeable channels MCA1 and ANN1 is decreased by 40%. This suggests that MCA1 and ANN1 contribute to the absorption of U in different zones and cell layers of the root. Together, our results describe for the first time the involvement of Ca²⁺-permeable cation channels in the cellular uptake of U.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aabsorption 3abioaccumulation 3acalcium 3acalcium deficiency 3acations 3agadolinium 3atoxicity 3auranium 3averapamil 0aANN 0aMCA 0aRadionuclide 0aHigher plants 0aRoot 0aAccumulation 0aTransport 0aCompetition 0aInhibition 0aMutants1 aDevime, Fabienne1 aBaggio, Célia1 aFiguet, Sylvie1 aAlban, Claude1 aBourguignon, Jacques1 aRavanel, Stéphane0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 Feb. 15, v. 424 p.127436-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1274363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03028naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245009500152300001600247520173000263592002801993650003402021650001902055650001402074650003102088650001002119650002102129650001602150650001602166650001302182650001902195650001402214650001302228700001202241700001102253700001602264700001402280700001702294700001802311700001302329700001902342700001302361773011002374856004002484961001302524852000902537655001202546IND50061991120221120190125.0130320e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006199112DNAL7 a10.1111/aab.120112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Y.10aRole of gibberellic acid in tomato defence against potato purple top phytoplasma infection  ap. 191-199.  aInfection of tomato by potato purple top (PPT) phytoplasma causes disruption of gibberellin (GA) homeostasis in the plant host. Such pathologically‐induced GA deficiency can be partially reversed by exogenous application of GA. This study was designed to explore the role of GA in tomato defence response against phytoplasmal disease, and to determine whether pretreatment with GA would protect healthy tomato seedlings from subsequent phytoplasmal infection and disease development. Our results revealed that, following exogenous GA application and subsequent PPT phytoplasma graft inoculation, there was an apparently coordinated down‐regulation of the gene encoding a key GA signalling component and growth repressor known as DELLA protein (GAI) and up‐regulation of genes involved in salicylic acid (SA) synthesis (ICS1), signalling (NIM1) and downstream defence responses (PRP‐1). Our results also indicated that differential regulation of the above genes was correlated with an increase in activities of defence‐related enzymes β‐1,3‐glucanase and chitinase. The data presented in this communication provide evidence to suggest that GA may act via DELLA and SA signalling pathways to modulate host defence in response to PPT phytoplasma infection. Although the GA pretreatment‐induced defence was not sufficient to prevent a systemic infection, it reduced phytoplasma titre and significantly attenuated disease symptoms. While the actual molecular mechanism underlying the GA‐induced plant defence remains elusive, findings from the current study open new opportunities for in‐depth studies of the functional role of the GA signalling network during defence response against phytoplasmal infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPotato purple top phytoplasma 3abeta-glucanase 3achitinase 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agibberellic acid 3ahomeostasis 3ahost plants 3apotatoes 3asalicylic acid 3aseedlings 3atomatoes1 aWei, W.1 aWu, W.1 aDavis, R.E.1 aJiang, Y.1 aLee, I.‐M.1 aHammond, R.W.1 aShen, L.1 aSheng, J.‐P.1 aZhao, Y.0 tAnnals of applied biology.g2013 Mar., v. 162, no. 2 p.191-199dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0003-47467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aab.12011  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle01159naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002000138245008400158300001800242520016800260592002800428650002300456650002300479650001700502700002300519700002600542700001800568700002200586700002600608773012900634856007300763852000900836655001200845IND60658455020221118173742.0190817e20090630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065845502DNAL7 a10.1039/b907631j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVercaemst, Carl10aEthenylene-bridged periodic mesoporous organosilicas with ultra-large mesopores  ap. 4052-4054.  aE-configured ethenylene-bridged periodic mesoporous organosilicas with ultra-large mesopores and unprecedented pore volumes have been developed for the first time.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions 3aporous media1 ade Jongh, Petra E.1 aMeeldijk, Johannes D.1 aGoderis, Bart1 aVerpoort, Francis1 aVan Der Voort, Pascal0 tChemical communications.g2009 June 30, , no. 27 p.4052-4054dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b907631j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01840naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245009700152300001600249500002000265520078600285592002801071650002001099650002001119650001701139650002301156650001501179650001101194650001401205650001801219651001001237700001601247700002001263773011101283856007501394852000901469655001201478IND60760394220221120125852.0211221e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076039422DNAL7 a10.1111/biom.120502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCui, Na10aModeling Parasite Infection Dynamics when there Is Heterogeneity and Imperfect Detectability  ap. 683-692.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aUnderstanding the infection and recovery rate from parasitic infections is valuable for public health planning. Two challenges in modeling these rates are (1) infection status is only observed at discrete times even though infection and recovery take place in continuous time and (2) detectability of infection is imperfect. We address these issues through a Bayesian hierarchical model based on a random effects Weibull distribution. The model incorporates heterogeneity of the infection and recovery rate among individuals and allows for imperfect detectability. We estimate the model by a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm with data augmentation.

In this particular study, viticulture, vinification and bottling and packaging in a winery of the Ribeiro appellation were studied from a life cycle assessment perspective, with the main objective of identifying the largest environmental impacts for four different years of production (2007–2010). The selected functional unit was a 750 mL bottle of Ribeiro white wine, packaged for distribution. Inventory data was gathered mainly through direct communication using questionnaires. Results showed considerable annual variability in environmental performance, stressing the importance of including timeline analysis in the wine sector. Therefore, environmental scaling was proposed for the assessed wine based on the individual environmental impacts for each harvest year. Furthermore, the main hot spots identified were compost and pesticide production and emissions, in the agricultural phase and bottle production and electricity consumption, in the subsequent stages of wine production, in most of the selected impact categories. Suggested improvement opportunities included shifts in the compost transportation policy, recovery of natural resources for vineyard infrastructure, the introduction of new packaging formats in the bottling process and the use of pesticides with lower toxicity potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3abottles 3abottling 3acomposts 3aelectricity 3aemissions 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental impact statements 3ainfrastructure 3ainventories 3aissues and policy 3alife cycle assessment 3apackaging 3apesticides 3aquestionnaires 3atoxicity 3atransportation 3avineyards 3aviticulture 3awhite wines 3awine industry 3awinemaking 2aAgriculture 2aEnvironment 2aPesticides 2aRisk Assessment 2aWine 3aSpain 0aSpain1 aVillanueva-Rey, Pedro1 aMoreira, M(a) Teresa1 aFeijoo, Gumersindo0 tJournal of environmental management.g2012 May 15, v. 98 p.73-83dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2011.12.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02928naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001300146245015000159300001800309520165700327592002801984650001702012650001902029650001602048650001702064650001102081650001702092650002302109650003002132700005702162700001902219700001802238700005702256700001602313773013602329856008002465852000902545655001202554IND60744998620221123030023.0210723e20210709xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074499862DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.1c032282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShao, Qi10aAllosteric Mechanism of Human Mitochondrial Phenylalanyl-tRNA Synthetase: An Atomistic MD Simulation and a Mutual Information-Based Network Study  ap. 7651-7661.  aAminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs), a family of ubiquitous and essential enzymes, can bind target tRNAs and catalyze the aminoacylation reaction in genetic code translation. In this work, we explore the dynamic properties and allosteric communication of human mitochondrial phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (hmPheRS) in free and bound states to understand the mechanisms of its tRNAᴾʰᵉ recognition and allostery using molecular dynamics simulations combined with the torsional mutual information-based network model. Our results reveal that hmPheRS’s residue mobility and inter-residue motional coupling are significantly enhanced by tRNAᴾʰᵉ binding, and there occurs a strong allosteric communication which is critical for the aminoacylation reaction, suggesting the vital role of tRNAᴾʰᵉ binding in the enzyme’s function. The identified signaling pathways mainly make the connections between the anticodon binding domain (ABD) and catalytic domain (CAD), as well as within the CAD composed of many functional fragments and active sites, revealing the co-regulation role of them to act coordinately and achieve hmPheRS’s aminoacylation function. Besides, several key residues along the communication pathways are identified to be involved in mediating the coordinated coupling between anticodon recognition at the ABD and activation process at the CAD, showing their pivotal role in the allosteric network, which are well consistent with the experimental observation. This study sheds light on the allosteric communication mechanism in hmPheRS and can provide important information for the structure-based drug design targeting aaRSs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3aaminoacylation 3adrug design 3agenetic code 3ahumans 3amitochondria 3amolecular dynamics 3aphenylalanine-tRNA ligase1 aHan, Zhongjie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6088-24691 aCheng, Jingmin1 aWang, Qiankun1 aGong, Weikang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8797-784X1 aLi, Chunhua0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 July 09, v. 125, no. 28 p.7651-7661dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.1c032283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03730naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003700113040001800150100002600168245012600194300001600320520171200336592002802048650001602076650002002092650001102112650002502123650001602148650001002164650002202174650001102196650001202207650002602219650001502245650001402260650001702274650001502291650002102306650002502327650002202352650001302374650005702387650001302444650002702457650004302484650003102527650007102558650004002629653001102669653002102680653001102701653002802712653001402740700002702754700002702781700001702808700002002825700002002845773012202865856008402987852000903071655001203080IND60113586720221120182448.0190318e20130115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011358672DNAL7 a232185462pmid7 a10.1016/j.jplph.2012.09.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKwasniewski, Miroslaw10aAccumulation of peroxidase-related reactive oxygen species in trichoblasts correlates with root hair initiation in barley  ap. 185-195.  aRoot hairs are an important model in studies of cell differentiation and development in higher plants. The function of NADPH oxidase-related reactive oxygen species (ROS) in root hair development has been reported extensively in studies on Arabidopsis. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of the initiation of root hair formation, mediated by the peroxidase-dependent production of the highly reactive hydroxyl radical in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). The distribution of ROS, including the hydroxyl radical (OH) and superoxide (O2−) was assessed using hydroxyphenyl fluorescein and nitroblue tetrazolium chloride, respectively, in the roots of wild-type plants and two root-hair mutants: root-hairless (rhl1.a) and with root hair growth blocked at the primordium stage (rhp1.b). Peroxidase-dependent OH accumulation was linked to root hair initiation and growth in plants where root hair formation was at least initiated, whereas OH was not detectable in the epidermis of the root-hairless mutant rhl1.a. O2− distribution in the roots of rhl1.a and rhp1.b mutants was not impaired and did not influence the root hair phenotype. Peroxidase inhibitor treatments of wild-type roots dramatically reduced the ability of growing roots to form root hairs and thus phenocopied the root-hairless phenotype. Expression of two candidate peroxidase genes, HvPRX45 and HvPRX2, was analyzed and their possible role in root hair-specific production of hydroxyl radicals was discussed. We propose a model of a two-step, coordinated ROS formation process in root hair cells that involves root hair-specific peroxidase(s) and root hair-specific NADPH oxidase necessary for a proper root hair formation in barley.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aHordeum vulgare 3abarley 3acell differentiation 3afluorescein 3agenes 3ahydroxyl radicals 3amodels 3amutants 3anitroblue tetrazolium 3aperoxidase 3aphenotype 3aplant growth 3aroot hairs 3asuperoxide anion 2aCell Differentiation 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenotype 2aHordeumxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aMutation 2aPeroxidasexmetabolism 2aPlant Epidermisxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aPlant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aPlant Rootsxcytologyxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aReactive Oxygen Speciesxmetabolism 0aBarley 0aHydroxyl radical 0aMutant 0aReactive oxygen species 0aRoot hair1 aChwialkowska, Karolina1 aKwaśniewska, Jolanta,1 aKusak, Julia1 aSiwinski, Kamil1 aSzarejko, Iwona0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2013 Jan. 15, v. 170, no. 2 p.185-195dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl39020x0176-16177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2012.09.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02928naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245016600206300001200372506007600384520116600460592002801626506003701654650002601691650002201717650002701739650001201766650001301778650001201791650001101803650002001814650002301834650002801857650001201885650001501897650002101912650000701933650003001940650003901970650002202009650001402031650001202045650001102057650002902068650001602097650001102113700002002124700001802144773010902162856008202271852000902353655001202362IND60555685720221207114224.0180619e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055568572DNAL7 a10.1007/s13205-016-0517-42doi7 aPMC50337732pmcid7 a283302732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnand, Gautam10aPurification and characterization of polygalacturonase from Aspergillus fumigatus MTCC 2584 and elucidating its application in retting of Crotalaria juncea fiber  ap. 201.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPolygalacturonases represents an important member of pectinases group of enzymes with diverse industrial applications and is widely distributed among fungi, bacteria, yeasts, plants and some plant parasitic nematodes. An endo-polygalacturonase from a new fungal source Aspergillus fumigatus MTCC 2584 was produced under solid-state fermentation conditions and was purified simply by acetone precipitation and gel-filtration chromatography technique. The approximate molecular weight of the purified PG was found to be 43.0 kDa as revealed by SDS-PAGE. The pH optimum of the purified enzyme was found to be 10.0 and was stable in the pH range of 7–10. The optimum temperature of purified PG was found to be 30 °C. The Km and Kcat of the purified enzyme were 2.4 mg/ml and 44 s⁻¹, respectively, and the metal ions Cu²⁺ and K⁺ were found to enhance the enzyme activity while Ag⁺, Ca²⁺ and Hg²⁺ were inhibitory in nature. Based on its alkaline nature, the potential of purified PG in retting of natural fiber Crotalaria juncea was elucidated in the absence of EDTA. This is probably the first report of alkaline PG from Aspergillus fumigatus.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAspergillus fumigatus 3aCrotalaria juncea 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aacetone 3abacteria 3acalcium 3acopper 3aenzyme activity 3agel chromatography 3aindustrial applications 3amercury 3ametal ions 3amolecular weight 3apH 3aplant parasitic nematodes 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3apolygalacturonase 3apotassium 3aretting 3asilver 3asolid state fermentation 3atemperature 3ayeasts1 aYadav, Sangeeta1 aYadav, Dinesh0 t3 Biotech.g2016 Dec., v. 6, no. 2 p.201-201dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:22884x2190-572X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-016-0517-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02464naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245008500167300001800252520127100270592002801541650002101569650001901590650001301609650003101622650001801653650001301671650001701684650002501701650002301726700002001749700001801769700002501787700005301812773013601865856008002001852000902081655001202090IND60744998820221123012626.0210723e20210712xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074499882DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.1c034132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorris, Clifford10aEffects of the Hydrophilic N-Terminal Region on Aβ-Mediated Membrane Disruption  ap. 7671-7678.  aAmyloidogenesis of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides is intimately related to pathological neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s disease. Here, we investigated the membrane damage activity of Aβ40 and its derivatives that contain mutation at the N-terminal charged residues using a membrane leakage assay. A model 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) phospholipid vesicle encapsulating the fluorescent dye carboxyfluorescein was used in the study. Our results show that the mutations of the N-terminal charged residues of Aβ40 significantly affect the peptide-induced membrane leakage. The results suggest that favorable electrostatic interactions of the N-terminal charged residues and the phosphatidylcholine membrane surface are crucial in Aβ-mediated membrane permeation. The flexible and charge-rich N-terminal region may play a critical role in directing Aβ self-association on the membrane surface and in anchoring and stabilizing the peptide aggregates inserted in the phospholipid membrane, which are closely related with membrane disruption activity of Aβ. The results provide new mechanistic insight into the Aβ-mediated membrane damage process, which may be critical for understanding the mechanism of Aβ neurotoxicity in Alzheimer’s disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3afluorescent dyes 3ahydrophilicity 3amutation 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aneurotoxicity 3apeptides 3apermeability 3aphosphatidylcholines 3aphysical chemistry1 aKent, Thomas W.1 aShen, Fengyun1 aWojcikiewicz, Ewa P.1 aDu, Deguo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8701-82080 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 July 12, v. 125, no. 28 p.7671-7678dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.1c034133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01263naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245011100159300001800270520031700288592002800605650001800633650001600651650002200667650003000689700002000719700002400739773012900763856007200892852000900964655001200973IND60658455420221118181308.0190817e20091028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065845542DNAL7 a10.1039/b907653k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLatorre, Alfonso10aDynamic kinetic resolution in the asymmetric synthesis of atropisomeric biaryl[4] and [5]helicene quinones  ap. 6652-6654.  aTotal control of axial and helical chirality elements of a (2-biphenyl)-substituted tetrahydro[5]helicene quinone and the configurationally stable dihydro[4]helicene analogue was achieved in a dynamic kinetic resolution process of an axially chiral racemic diene promoted by an enantiopure sulfinyl benzoquinone.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzoquinones 3aenantiomers 3aoptical isomerism 3astereoselective synthesis1 aUrbano, Antonio1 aCarreño, M.

We designed a recombinant analog of lactaptin (RL2) and tested its antitumor activity. The sensitivity of hepatocarcinoma A-1 (HA-1), Lewis lung carcinoma, and Ehrlich carcinoma to RL2 were tested to determine the most reliable in vitro animal model. HA-1 cells, which had the highest sensitivity to RL2, were transplanted into A/Sn mice to investigate RL2 antitumor activity in vivo. Investigation of the molecular effects of RL2 shows that RL2 induces apoptotic transformation of HA-1 cells in vitro: phosphatidylserine translocation from inner side of the lipid bilayer to the outer one and dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential. Repetitive injections of RL2 (5–50 mg/kg) for 3–5 days effectively inhibited ascites and solid tumor transplant growth when administered intravenously or intraperitoneally, without obvious side effects. The solid tumor inhibitory effect of RL2 (5 i.v. injections, cumulative dose 125 mg/kg) was comparable with that of cyclophosphamide at a therapeutic dose (5 i.v. injections, cumulative dose 150 mg/kg). In combination therapy with cyclophosphamide, RL2 had an additive antitumor effect for ascites-producing tumors. Histomorphometric analysis indicated a three-fold reduction of spontaneous metastases in the liver of RL2-treated mice with solid tumor transplants in comparison with control animals. Repeated RL2 treatment substantially prolonged the lifespan of mice with intravenously injected tumor cells. Recombinant analog of lactaptin effectively induced apoptosis of tumor cells in vitro and suppressed the growth of sensitive tumors and metastases in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data 3aphosphatidylserines 3amitochondrial membrane 3aliver 3alongevity 3ahumans 3aintravenous injection 3alung neoplasms 3aascites 3amembrane potential 3acarcinoma 3atin 3ametastasis 3amice 3aanimal models 3aneoplasm cells 3acyclophosphamide 3aadverse effects 3aapoptosis 3aanticarcinogenic activity 0atherapeutics1 aFomin, Alexandr S.1 aKaledin, Vasily I.1 aSemenov, Dmitry V.1 aPotapenko, Miraslava O.1 aKuligina, Elena V.1 aNikolin, Valery P.1 aNikitenko, Eugeny V.1 aRichter, Vladimir A.0 tBiochimie.g2012 Dec., v. 94, no. 12 p.2467-2474dElsevier Masson SASx0300-90847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2012.08.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05774naa a2201069 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245022600168300001600394520272800410592002803138650002503166650002103191650002303212650001803235650003103253650001803284650001603302650001603318650001603334650004403350650003803394650001203432650002003444650002003464650001803484650001503502650002903517650001803546650004303564650001203607650001803619650003003637650002403667650001603691650002203707650001803729650000903747650002603756650004303782650003003825650002003855650002403875650002503899650002103924650003203945650001603977653000703993653000704000653000804007653000704015653000804022653000804030653000704038653000704045653000804052653000804060653001104068653000904079653000804088653001004096653000904106653000804115653000704123653001004130653000904140653001204149653000804161653000804169653002304177653002904200653001504229653002504244653004304269700002004312700002304332700001704355700001904372700001704391700002004408700001804428700002204446700001704468773011604485856008204601852000904683655001204692IND60676725620221118154645.0200210e20190612xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067672562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2019.02.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Chang-hua14aThe anti-diabetic activities, gut microbiota composition, the anti-inflammatory effects of Scutellaria–coptis herb couple against insulin resistance-model of diabetes involving the toll-like receptor 4 signaling pathway  ap. 202-214.  aScutellaria–coptis herb couple (SC) is one of the well-known herb couples in many traditional Chinese compound formulas used for the treatment of diabetes mellitus (DM), which has been used to treat DM for thousands of years in China.Few studies have confirmed in detail the anti-diabetic activities of SC in vivo and in vitro. The present investigations aimed to evaluate the anti-diabetic activity of SC in type 2 diabetic KK-Ay mice and in RAW264.7 macrophages to understand its possible mechanism.High-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV) and LC-LTQ-Orbitrap Pro mass spectrometry were used to analyze the active ingredients of SC extracts and control the quality. A type 2 diabetic KK-Ay mice model was established by high-fat diet. Body weight, fasting blood glucose levels, fasting blood insulin levels, glycosylated hemoglobin and glycosylated serum protein were measured. The effects of SC on total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and triglyceride (TG) levels were examined. The lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) levels were measured. Gut microbial communities were assayed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) methods. The expressions of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and MyD88 protein in the colons were measured by western blot. In RAW264.7 macrophages, IL-6, TNF-α, TLR4 and MyD88 protein levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits or western blot, and the mRNA expression of IL-6, TNF-α and TLR4 was examined by the real time PCR.The present results showed that the SC significantly increased blood HDL and significantly reduced fasting blood glucose, fasting blood insulin, glycosylated hemoglobin, glycosylated serum protein, TC, TG, LPS, IL-6 and TNF-α levels (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01) in type-2 diabetic KK-Ay mice. Furthermore, SC could regulate the structure of intestinal flora. Additionally, the expressions of TLR4 and MyD88 protein in the colons were significantly decreased in the model group (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). However, SC had no significant effect on weight gain. In RAW264.7 macrophages, SC containing serum (SC-CS) (5%, 10% and 20%) significantly decreased IL-6, TNF-α, TLR4 and MyD88 protein levels and the mRNA expression of IL-6, TNF-α and TLR4 (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01).The anti-diabetic effects of SC were attributed to its regulation of intestinal flora and anti-inflammation involving the TLR4 signaling pathway. These findings provide a new insight into the anti-diabetic application for SC in clinical settings and display the potential of SC in the treatment of DM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aToll-like receptor 4 3aWestern blotting 3aactive ingredients 3aanimal models 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3ablood glucose 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3acholesterol 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afasting 3agene expression 3aglycemic effect 3aglycosylation 3ahemoglobin 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3ahigh fat diet 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ainsulin 3ainterleukin-6 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alipopolysaccharides 3amacrophages 3amass spectrometry 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3amicrobial communities 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprotein content 3asignal transduction 3atraditional medicine 3atriacylglycerols 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3aweight gain 0aDM 0aSC 0aT2D 0aIR 0aTCM 0aHFD 0aTG 0aTC 0aHDL 0aLPS 0aTNF-α 0aIL-6 0aINS 0aELISA 0aDGGE 0aTLR 0aGM 0aGGQLD 0aHPLC 0aHPLC-UV 0aRDP 0aPCR 0aScutellaria-coptis 0aAnti-diabetic activities 0aKK-Ay mice 0aRAW264.7 macrophages 0aToll-like receptor 4 signaling pathway1 aSheng, Jun-qing1 aSarsaiya, Surendra1 aShu, Fu-xing1 aLiu, Tong-tong1 aTu, Xiu-ying1 aMa, Guang-qiang1 aXu, Guo-Liang1 aZheng, Hong-xiang1 aZhou, Li-fen0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2019 June 12, v. 237 p.202-214dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2019.02.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02319naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245006100168300001800229520089100247592002801138650002401166650002201190650001201212650003601224650003201260700001801292700001401310700001501324700001801339700001601357700005501373700001601428700001801444700001601462700001801478700001601496700001901512700001701531700005801548773017401606856008401780852000901864655001201873IND60614612620221118022808.0181002e20180912xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061461262DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jnatprod.7b010502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQi, Changxing10aBACE1 Inhibitory Meroterpenoids from Aspergillus terreus  ap. 1937-1945.  aSixteen 3,5-dimethylorsellinic acid–based (DMOA-based) meroterpenoids, including 10 new compounds, asperterpenes D–M (1–10), were obtained from Aspergillus terreus.

Recent breeding improvements in terms of salt resistance of maize have lead to a genotype with improved growth under saline conditions. By comparing this salt-resistant hybrid with a sensitive hybrid, it was possible to show differences in hormone concentrations in expanding leaves and roots. In response to salinity, the salt-resistant maize significantly increased IBA concentrations in growing leaves and maintained IAA concentration in roots. These hormonal adaptations may help to establish favorable conditions for growth-promoting agents such as β-expansins and maintain growth of resistant maize hybrids under salt stress. Moreover, ABA concentrations significantly increased in resistant maize leaves under salt stress, which may contribute to acidifying the apoplast, which in turn is a prerequisite for growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabscisic acid 3aapoplast 3abreeding 3acorn 3acultivars 3agenotype 3ahybrids 3aindole acetic acid 3aindole butyric acid 3aleaves 3aplant response 3aroots 3asalinity 3asalt stress 2aAbscisic Acidxmetabolism 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenotype 2aIndoleacetic Acidsxmetabolism 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxmetabolism 2aPlant Leavesxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPlant Rootsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPlant Shootsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSalinity 2aSalt-Tolerant Plantsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSodium Chloridexmetabolism 2aStress, Physiological 2aZea maysxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 0aMaize 0aSalt stress 0aABA 0aIBA 0aIAA 0aAuxin 0aGrowth1 aGeilfus, Christoph-Martin1 aMühling, Karl H.1 aLudwig-Müller, Jutta,0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2013 Jan. 15, v. 170, no. 2 p.220-224dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl39020x0176-16177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2012.09.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02337naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245008000186300001600266500001500282520099400297592002801291650001401319650001101333650002401344650003001368650001601398650001101414650001501425650001701440650001401457650001701471650001601488650002401504650001101528650001201539651002201551651001001573653001501583700002801598700003501626700002301661773011401684856004801798852000901846655001201855IND4476325720221119163155.0121003e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447632572DNAL7 a214487702pmid7 a10.1007/s00484-011-0423-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSabariego, Silvia10aModels for forecasting airborne Cupressaceae pollen levels in central Spain  ap. 253-258.  a2019-12-06  aThe influence of meteorological variables on airborne Cupressaceae pollen levels in central Spain was analyzed, and prediction models based on polynomial and multiple regressions were used to predict pollen counts throughout the pollen season. The Cupressaceae pollen type was selected in view of both its abundance in the atmosphere of the central Iberian Peninsula (particularly from January to March) and its allergenic importance. Sampling was performed uninterruptedly over a 5-year period, using a Hirst volumetric sampler and the sampling method established by the Spanish Aerobiology Network. Temperature displayed the strongest (positive) correlation with Cupressaceae pollen counts. Polynomial and multiple regression analysis showed that maximum temperature was the most influential variable included in prediction models. The prediction equations obtained for the study period were reasonably satisfactory, accounting for 48% and 59% of the variation in airborne pollen levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequations 3amodels 3aregression analysis 3ameteorological parameters 3atemperature 3apollen 3aprediction 3aCupressaceae 2aAllergens 2aCupressaceae 2aForecasting 2aModels, Theoretical 2aPollen 2aWeather 3aIberian Peninsula 3aSpain 0aatmosphere1 aCuesta Escudero, Pedro,1 aFernández-González, Federico1 aPérez-Badia, Rosa0 tInternational journal of biometeorology.g2012 Mar., v. 56, no. 2 p.253-258dSpringer-Verlagx0020-71287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00484-011-0423-8  aDNAL 7aarticle02840naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100001500159245007900174300001400253520154200267592002801809650000801837650001301845650002601858650001501884650002101899650000901920650001501929650001501944650001701959650001501976650003301991650001602024650002202040650001102062653003102073653002302104653002002127653001802147700001502165773011202180856009302292852000902385655001202394IND60602619620221122180605.0180711e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060261962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2015.01.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Kai10aRigid and steric hindering bisphosphate flame retardants for polycarbonate  ap. 86-94.  aRigid steric hindering spiro-bisphosphates (PDMPDP and PDBPDP) were synthesized from spiro-pentaerythritol chlorophosphate and 2,6-dimethylphenol and o-tert-butylphenol respectively in order to investigate the effect of steric hindering groups on the flame retardant mechanism of bisphosphates and the effect of rigid spiro-pentaerythritol structure on the heat distortion temperature (HDT) of polycarbonate. A comparison of the steric hindering spiro-bisphosphates with the simplest phenyl spiro-bisphosphate (PDPDP) and commercial resorcinol bis(diphenyl phosphate) (RDP) on the flame retardancy of polycarbonate reveals that the presence of a thermally stable steric hindering group not only changes the efficiency but also shifts the mode of flame retardancy. In spite of low phosphorus content, PDMPDP and RDP show the highest efficiency of flame retardancy toward polycarbonate as evidenced by UL-94 combustion results with RDP exhibiting the strongest vapor phase action, PDMPDP the second, and PDPDP the least as judged from the phosphorus distribution in the vapor and the condensed phase. This is parallel to the tendency of chemical interactions between polycarbonate and flame retardants with PDPDP demonstrating the greatest interaction as proven by TGA study in air. It is suggested that the charring process of PDPDP interferes with that of polycarbonate and leads to microporous char that is seen in SEM and partially responsible for the poor flame retardancy of PDPDP. Compared to PC/RDP, PC/PDMPDP has a high HDT value.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abiphenyl 3achemical interactions 3acombustion 3aflame retardants 3aheat 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3aporous media 3aresorcinol 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3avapors 0aSteric hindering phosphate 0aSpiro-bisphosphate 0aFlame retardant 0aPolycarbonate1 aYao, Qiang0 tPolymer degradation and stability.g2015 Mar., v. 113 p.86-94dElsevier LtdwJournal:12486x0141-39107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2015.01.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02366naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245012200170300001600292500001400308520066000322592002800982596005701010596014201067596009401209596004201303596014601345596008401491650001401575650001301589650001001602650001201612650001301624700001701637700002101654700002001675700005301695773011701748856008201865852000901947655001201956IND60723847520221117223242.0210117e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072384752DNAL7 a10.1007/s10228-020-00760-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshinaga, Shohei10aFeeding habits of the mesopelagic fish Sigmops gracilis larvae in the Kuroshio and its adjacent water, southern Japan  ap. 171-176.  aNAL-light  aWe examined the feeding habits of the dominant mesopelagic fish Sigmops gracilis larvae across the Kuroshio Current, southern Japan. The feeding incidence tended to decrease toward the offshore area. Copepods, amphipods, ostracods, and appendicularians were microscopically observed in the guts. Larvae fed substantially on copepods such as calanoids and appendicularians. Appendicularians were more frequently ingested toward the offshore area and were the most preferential prey item in all areas. The microbial production integrated by appendicularians would support mesopelagic fish larvae in addition to the ordinary trophic pathway through copepods.  aPublisher supplied data  a20K06186cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  aFunctional Enhancement Expenses in Kagoshima University Operating Cost (Advanced Research Infrastructure of BiologycKagoshima University  aPhysiology of Eel Species Inhabiting Southern Kyushu, Japan, TaiwancKagoshima University  aSouth East AsiacKagoshima University  athe Creation of Industry–Academia–Government Network to Induce the Social Implementation of those Research Results)cKagoshima University  aJPMXD0511102330cMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology 3aAmphipoda 3aCopepoda 3aJapan 3aSigmops 3aresearch1 aKobari, Toru1 aTanonaka, Norika1 aYamanoue, Kaori1 aKume, Gen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2467-175X0 tIchthyological research.g2021 Jan., v. 68, no. 1 p.171-176dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl4124684x1341-89987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10228-020-00760-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02746naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001300146245008000159300001800239520144300257592002801700650001201728650002301740650001701763650001601780700005701796700001801853700005901871700001801930700001801948700001401966700005201980700006102032700005402093773013602147856008002283852000902363655001202372IND60744999220221122030612.0210723e20210713xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074499922DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.1c038492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Wen10aMolecular Structure of the Surface-Immobilized Super Uranyl Binding Protein  ap. 7706-7716.  aRecently, a super uranyl binding protein (SUP) was developed, which exhibits excellent sensitivity/selectivity to bind uranyl ions. It can be immobilized onto a surface in sensing devices to detect uranyl ions. Here, sum frequency generation (SFG) vibrational spectroscopy was applied to probe the interfacial structures of surface-immobilized SUP. The collected SFG spectra were compared to the calculated orientation-dependent SUP SFG spectra using a one-excitonic Hamiltonian approach based on the SUP crystal structures to deduce the most likely surface-immobilized SUP orientation(s). Furthermore, discrete molecular dynamics (DMD) simulation was applied to refine the surface-immobilized SUP conformations and orientations. The immobilized SUP structures calculated from DMD simulations confirmed the SUP orientations obtained from SFG data analyzed based on the crystal structures and were then used for a new round of SFG orientation analysis to more accurately determine the interfacial orientations and conformations of immobilized SUP before and after uranyl ion binding, providing an in-depth understanding of molecular interactions between SUP and the surface and the effect of uranyl ion binding on the SUP interfacial structures. We believe that the developed method of combining SFG measurements, DMD simulation, and Hamiltonian data analysis approach is widely applicable to study biomolecules at solid/liquid interfaces.  aPublisher supplied data 3aliquids 3amolecular dynamics 3aspectroscopy 3auranyl ions1 aZou, Xingquan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9716-97711 aJiang, Hanjie1 aKoebke, Karl J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2198-26671 aHoarau, Marie1 aCrisci, Ralph1 aLu, Tieyi1 aWei, Tao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6888-16581 aMarsh, E.

Mating was carried out, and pregnancy was determined by examining sperm in vaginal smears. Pregnant rats were arranged into three groups; control, diabetic (single intraperitoneal injection [i.p.] of 60 mg streptozotocin/kg) and hypercholesterolemic groups (fed on a diet containing 3% cholesterol for 6 wk before conception and throughout gestation) (n = 20). Pregnant rats were sacrificed and 13-, 15-, 17-, and 19-d-old embryos and livers were incised and subjected to histological and transmission electronic microscopical (TEM) investigations, assessments of alkaline phosphatase (Al-Pase) isoenzymes electrophoresis, DNA fragmentation, and comet assay. Flow cytometric analysis of apoptosis and caspases 3 and 9 in the livers of mother rats and their 19-d-old fetuses was determined.Histologic findings of diabetic and hypercholesterolemic mothers revealed apparent damage of hepatocytes, accumulation of lipid-laden cells, and vascular steatosis, while the 13-, 15-, 17- or 19-d-old fetuses of either diabetic or hypercholesterolemic mothers revealed disorganized hepatic architecture and massive cell damage. TEM of diseased mothers and their fetuses possessed increased incidence of pyknotic hepatocytes with massive vesicuolation of rough endoplasmic reticulum and degeneration of mitochondria. Al-Pase isoenzymes were altered and genomic DNA of both double and single helical structures were markedly damaged, especially in fetuses of maternally diabetic and hypercholesterolemic mothers. Flow cytometry revealed an increase in apoptosis and caspases 3 and 9 in diabetic and hypercholesterolemic mothers and their 19-d-old fetuses.These results suggested that maternal diabetes and hypercholesterolemia predicted early hepatitis and increased apoptosis in mothers and their fetuses as a result of oxidative stress and elevated apoptic markers caspases 3 and 9.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA fragmentation 3aalbino 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aapoptosis 3abody weight 3acaspases 3acholesterol 3acomet assay 3aconception 3adiabetes 3adiet 3aembryo (animal) 3afemales 3afetus 3aflow cytometry 3ahepatitis 3ahepatocytes 3ahistology 3ahypercholesterolemia 3aintraperitoneal injection 3aisozymes 3aliver 3amales 3amitochondria 3amothers 3aoxidative stress 3apregnancy 3arats 3arough endoplasmic reticulum 3aspermatozoa 3astreptozotocin 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aDiabetes 0aHypercholesterolemia 0aFetus 0aLiver 0aLight and ultrastructure 0aDNA damage 0aAlkaline phosphatase electrophopresis 0aFlow cytometry 0aApoptosis 0aCaspases 3 and 91 aAl-Haggar, Mohamed M.S.1 aEl-Ghawet, Heba A.1 aBakr, Iman H.M.0 tNutrition.g2014 Mar., v. 30, no. 3 p.326-336dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2013.08.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02293naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006500150245014800215300001800363520090600381592002801287650002301315650002401338650002601362650001501388650001001403650001301413650001201426650001801438650001601456650001101472650001101483650004401494650001901538700002001557700002101577700001901598773017301617856008401790852000901874655001201883IND60614612820181121000000.0181002e20180823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061461282DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jnatprod.7b010692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCicchetti, Esméralda1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0664-214610aUpregulation of Skin-Aging Biomarkers in Aged NHDF Cells by a Sucrose Ester Extract from the Agroindustrial Waste of Physalis peruviana Calyces  ap. 1946-1955.  aAs part of a search for new sustainable plant sources of valuable compounds, the EtOAc extract of the discarded calyces of Physalis peruviana fruit was selected for its significant antiaging activity. Eight new sucrose esters (SEs), named peruvioses F–M (1–8), along with three known SEs, peruvioses A (9), peruviose B (10), and nicandrose D (11), were isolated. Their structures were elucidated by comprehensive analyses of their NMR and MS data. A global fragmentation pattern of these SEs was established from their MS data. The SE extract (SEE) at a concentration of 0.5 mg L–¹ upregulated multiple skin-aging biomarkers, namely, collagen I, elastin, and fibrillin-1, in aged normal human dermal fibroblast cells. A 36% increase in collagen I was observed. The elastin and fibrillin-1 contents were fully recovered, and an increase of at least 10% in the production of elastin was observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhysalis peruviana 3aagricultural wastes 3aanti-aging properties 3abiomarkers 3acalyx 3acollagen 3aelastin 3aethyl acetate 3afibroblasts 3afruits 3ahumans 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asucrose esters1 aDuroure, Leslie1 aLe Borgne, Erell1 aLaville, Rémi0 tJournal of natural products.g2018 Aug. 23, v. 81, no. 9 p.1946-1955dAmerican Chemical Society and American Society of PharmacognosywJournal:jnl11422x1520-60257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jnatprod.7b010693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01821naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245008800171300001000259500001400269520080100283592002801084650001201112650001701124650002001141650002501161650001301186650001301199700001801212700002001230700001901250700002401269773008801293856008101381852000901462655001201471IND60555686320221120164202.0170724e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055568632DNAL7 a10.1186/s40317-015-0096-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampbell, Hamish A.12aA plea for standards in reporting data collected by animal-borne electronic devices  ap. 1.  aNAL-light  aIn recent years, there has been significant investment in collaborative e-infrastructures to support biotelemetry research.

C.10aCompetition Between Phosphate and the Plant for Fe from Fe2+ Ferrozine  ap. 240-243.  aepub  aMuch has been written about how phosphate accentuates Fe deficiency in plants; but little attention has been given to the genotype of rootstock as a controlling factor in Fe uptake. The important role of the plant was studied in these experiments. Competition between phosphate, the plant, and ferrofine for Fe in nutrient solution was examined. Fe inefficient and Fe efficient varieties of soybeans [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) were used as test plants because they differ, respectively, in their ability to tolerate P and to reduce Fe³⁺ to Fe²⁺ at the root. Within 2 days after adding 16 ppm of P to the nutrient solution, only about 10% of the Fe²⁺ferrozine was colorimetrically detected in solution. The Fe was removed from Fe²⁺ferrozine, and it appeared in the solution as a suspension of iron-phosphate. Phosphate was dominating the system for Fe. Four days later, the plants developed Fe deficiency (Fe stress). Fe-efficient plants responded to Fe stress by releasing more H⁺ into solution and reducing more Fe³⁺ to Fe²⁺ than was reduced by Fe-inefficient plants. As this occurred, Fe²⁺ferrozine reappeared in solution. The Fe-efficient plants now dominated the system for Fe. On day 17 (final harvest), the green top leaves of Fe-efficient HA soybeans contained 86 ppm of Fe, whereas the chlorotic top leaves of Fe-inefficient PI soybeans contained only 36 ppm Fe. In the latter, phosphate still dominated the system for Fe because the reducing capacity (Fe³⁺ to Fe²⁺) of the Fe-inefficient plants was not great enough to overcome the effects of phosphate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3agenotype 3airon 3airon phosphates 3aleaves 3anutrient deficiencies 3anutrient solutions 3aprotons 3arootstocks 3asoybeans0 tAgronomy journal.g1972 Mar., v. 64, no. 2 p.240-243dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj1972.00021962006400020033x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03353naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245009700170300001600267520168100283592002801964650004001992650002002032650001802052650001502070650001902085650001602104650001502120650002202135650002102157650001802178650002102196650001002217650000902227650001102236650001602247650001302263653001602276653002202292653001802314653002402332653002802356653004802384700002802432700001602460700001502476700001902491700001502510700002002525700001602545700002302561773009602584856008602680852000902766655001202775IND60534644020221122011027.0190319e20140212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053464402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2013.12.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJain-Gupta, N.10aImmunotherapeutics to prevent the replication of Brucella in a treatment failure mouse model  ap. 918-923.  aOuter membrane vesicles (OMVs) from Brucella melitensis and irradiated Brucella neotomae have been shown to be effective vaccines against a B. melitensis challenge in a mouse model. The present study evaluates the efficacy of these two vaccines as immuno-therapeutics in combination with conventional antibiotics against a B. melitensis infection. BALB/c mice chronically infected with B. melitensis were treated for 4 weeks with doxycycline and gentamicin and vaccinated twice during the course of therapy. Antibiotics in sub-therapeutic concentrations were chosen in such a way that the treatment would result in a therapeutic failure in mice. Although no additive effect of vaccines and antibiotics was seen on the clearance of B. melitensis, mice receiving vaccines along with antibiotics exhibited no Brucella replication post-treatment compared to mice treated only with antibiotics. Administration of irradiated B. neotomae along with antibiotics led to higher production of IFN-γ ex vivo by splenocytes upon stimulation with heat inactivated B. melitensis while no such effect was seen by splenocytes from mice vaccinated with OMVs. OMV vaccinated mice developed significantly higher anti-Brucella IgG antibody titers at the end of the treatment compared to the mice that received only antibiotics. The mice that received only vaccines did not show any significant clearance of Brucella from spleens and livers compared to non-treated control mice. This study suggests that incorporating OMVs or irradiated B. neotomae along with conventional antibiotics might be able to improve therapeutic efficacy and control the progression of disease in treatment failure cases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrucella melitensis biovar Neotomae 3aadditive effect 3aanimal models 3aantibodies 3adisease course 3adoxycycline 3agentamicin 3aheat inactivation 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aimmunotherapy 3ainterferon-gamma 3aliver 3amice 3aspleen 3asplenocytes 3avaccines 0aBrucellosis 0aTreatment failure 0aImmunotherapy 0aTherapeutic vaccine 0aOuter membrane vesicles 0aCell mediated immunity and humoral immunity1 aContreras-Rodriguez, A.1 aSmith, G.P.1 aGarg, V.K.1 aWitonsky, S.G.1 aIsloor, S.1 aVemulapalli, R.1 aBoyle, S.M.1 aSriranganathan, N.0 tVaccine.g2014 Feb. 12, v. 32, no. 8 p.918-923dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2013.12.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02833naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100003400146245009500180300001600275520162000291592002801911650002301939650001301962650001301975650001501988650001902003650002202022650001402044651001102058653002602069653001702095653003002112653001402142653001202156700002502168700002202193773013002215856008102345852000902426655001202435IND60636977120221118072830.0190419e20190501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063697712DNAL7 a10.2478/prolas-2019-00262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVinogradova, Vineta Viktorija10aLatvian Family Physicians’ Experience and Attitude in Diagnosing and Managing Depression  ap. 164-170.  aDepression is among the most common mental disorders in primary care. Despite high prevalence rates it remains to be under-diagnosed in primary care settings over the world. This study was aimed to identify Latvian family physicians’ (FPs) experience and attitude in diagnosing and managing depression. It was carried out within the framework of the National Research Programme BIOMEDICINE 2014–2017. After educational seminars on diagnosing and managing depression, FPs were asked to complete a structured questionnaire. In total 216 respondents were recruited. Most of the doctors, or 72.2% (n = 156), agreed with the statement that patients with depression use primary care facilities more often than other patients. More than a half of physicians, or 66.3% (n = 143) quite often asked their patients about their psycho-emotional status and 65.7% (n = 142) of clinicians thought that they can successfully assess a patient’s psychoemotional status and possible mental disorders. The majority, or 91.6 % (n = 198), supposed that routine screening for depression is necessary in Latvia. Despite the fact that a significant number, or 62.6% (n = 135) of FPs thought that their practice was well suitable for the treatment of depressive patients, half of the respondents, or 50.9% (n = 110), assessed their ability to build a trustful contact and to motivate patients for treatment as moderate. Although FPs acknowledged the importance and necessity to treat depression, current knowledge and management approaches were far from optimal. This justifies the need to provide specific training programmes for FPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abehavior disorders 3amedicine 3apatients 3aphysicians 3aquestionnaires 3aresearch programs 3ascreening 3aLatvia 0ageneral practitioners 0aprimary care 0amajor depressive disorder 0atreatment 0aopinion1 aVrubļevska, Jeļena1 aRancāns, Elmārs0 tProceedings of the Latvian Academy of Sciences.g2019 May 01, v. 73, no. 2 p.164-170dSciendowJournal:21686x1407-009X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/prolas-2019-00263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02985naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245011600206300001600322520158300338592002801921596005301949650002502002650002002027650002402047650001502071650003102086650002302117650002202140650001402162650002002176650000902196650002002205650002302225650002202248700002002270700002802290700002602318773012802344856008202472852000902554655001202563IND60633761520221118183404.0190321e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063376152DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-018-03917-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDierks, Janina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4287-557210aCheatgrass-associated AMF community negatively affects sagebrush root production but not C transfer to the soil  ap. 381-396.  aAIM: Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) invasion can alter community structure of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in the sagebrush-steppe ecosystem. The feedbacks and underlying mechanisms of a changed AMF community on sagebrush (Artemisia tridentate ssp. wyomingensis) remain unclear. We assessed how ‘own’ versus ‘foreign’ AMF impact plant biomass, C transfer to AMF, and decomposition rates. METHODS: To evaluate the impact of different AMF communities on plant biomass and C transfer, sagebrush and cheatgrass were grown in sterilized soil amended with ‘own’ or ‘foreign’ AMF. Sagebrush plants were labeled with ¹³C-CO₂ to assess changes in allocation of C belowground (¹³C-PLFA & NLFA) and decomposition (soil respired ¹³C-CO₂). Community structure and alpha-diversity of AMF were examined in native and cheatgrass-invaded communities. RESULTS: Cheatgrass invasion changed AMF community structure and decreased AMF taxon richness. Sagebrush C transfer and decomposition were not altered, but sagebrush root and cheatgrass shoot production was reduced with ‘foreign’ AMF and no AMF, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our results from the greenhouse experiment suggest that sagebrush performance declines with cheatgrass invasion. This may be caused by a disadvantageous AMF community shift, where ‘foreign’ AMF received the same amount of C but provided fewer benefits to sagebrush, as shown by decreased root biomass. These findings provide insight into the feedback mechanism that may contribute to decreasing native plant performance upon invasion.  aPublisher supplied data  aEPS-0814387cDirectorate for Biological Sciences 3aArtemisia tridentata 3aBromus tectorum 3acommunity structure 3aecosystems 3agreenhouse experimentation 3aindigenous species 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aphytomass 3aplants (botany) 3asoil 3asoil amendments 3asoil sterilization 3aspecies diversity1 aDenef, Karolien1 avan Diepen, Linda T.

We quantified and compared the presence of lymphocytes and macrophages in myocardial autopsy specimens from 112 deceased individuals who had been diagnosed with myocarditis according to the Dallas criteria and 86 control subjects with morphologically normal hearts.We found the mean number to be 52.7lymphocyte profiles/mm2 (range 3.7–946; standard deviation 131) in the myocarditis group and 9.7 (range 2.1–25.9; standard deviation 4.6) in the control group. The cut-off value for the diagnosis of myocarditis was determined by calculating sensitivity plus specificity, which reached the highest combination at 13lymphocyte profiles/mm2 (sensitivity 68%; specificity 83%). A considerable proportion of subjects in both the myocarditis and control groups had lymphocyte profile counts below 30/mm2, representing a diagnostic challenge due to the increased risk of creating false negative or false positive results. We found it practically impossible to obtain a reliable macrophage count.The present data add new important information on lymphocyte counts in inflamed and non-inflamed myocardium. We suggest a cut-off value in the range of 11–16lymphocyte profiles/mm2 for a reliable diagnosis of lymphocytic myocarditis from autopsy samples. To evaluate small inflammatory changes at low lymphocyte counts, a multidisciplinary approach should be implemented, in which diagnostic tools are used ancillary to histological examination. We advise against semi-quantification of macrophages based on cell profile counting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aforensic sciences 3ahistology 3alymphocytes 3amacrophages 3amedicine 3amyocarditis 3amyocardium 3anecropsy 3arisk 3astatistical analysis 0aLymphocytic myocarditis 0aQuantitative microscopy 0aImmunohistochemistry 0aForensic pathology1 aNyengaard, Jens Randel1 aMøller, Jesper1 aBanner, Jytte1 aNielsen, Lars Peter1 aBaandrup, Ulrik Thorngren0 tForensic science international.g2014 May, v. 238 p.9-15dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0379-07387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2014.02.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02492naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001300143245012600156300001600282520139400298592002801692650001201720650002801732650001901760650001401779650001101793650001501804650002201819651002801841700002101869700001401890700001601904773013501920856007802055852000902133655001202142IND60765485520221121223443.0220422e20100616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076548552DNAL7 a10.17221/86/2009-cjas2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHakl, J.14aThe use of indirect methods for the prediction of lucerne quality in the first cut under the conditions of Central Europe  ap. 258-265.  aThe goal of this study was to compare the growing degree-days (GDD) and predictive equations for alfalfa quality (PEAQ) for the prediction of lucerne quality and to test their accuracy and suitability in the first cut period in Central Bohemia. Several additional stand parameters were verified in order to increase the accuracy of the quality estimate under these environmental conditions. In 2004&ndash;2007, the measurement and sampling were repeatedly realized from the late vegetative to the early bloom stage in six replications. For the GDD model across the years, the obtained R<sup>2</sup> for NDF, ADF and CP were 0.40, 0.57 and 0.65, respectively. It seems that the forage quality response to accumulated GDD was related to the stand development and it could be the reason for low R<sup>2</sup> across all the years. For the PEAQ model, R<sup>2</sup> were 0.62, 0.92, and 0.85, respectively. Similarly like in the GDD model, the effect of stand development across the years on changes in the slopes of equations was observed. The accuracy of the model combination was not higher in comparison with the PEAQ model. The count of stems per plant, density of stems per m<sup>2</sup>, dry matter yield and average stem weight improved the NDF content prediction within a four-year period. In these models, variables which represent the stand development should be taken into account.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalfalfa 3adry matter accumulation 3aforage quality 3aheat sums 3amodels 3aprediction 3astand development 3aCentral European region1 aŠantrùèek, J.1 aFuksa, P.1 aKrajíc, L.0 tCzech Journal of Animal Science.g, v. 55, no. 6 p.258-265dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:14567x1212-18197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/86/2009-cjas3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03368naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005200140245009800192500001900290500002000309520171000329592002802039596010702067596005902174596008302233596011302316596008902429650001602518650001202534650002602546650001102572650001102583650002802594650000802622700001302630700001502643700001702658700005302675773013502728856007402863852000902937655001202946IND60722617020221120050451.0210106e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072261702DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpe.135842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Bing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0719-386710aIdentification of tea white star disease and anthrax based on hyperspectral image information  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aHyperspectral images were used to identify the two similar diseases of tea white star disease and anthrax in this research. The average spectra of healthy leaves, white star disease, and anthrax leaves were collected, respectively. It was found that the average spectrum of white star disease and anthrax had strong morphological correlation and poor classification results. Then, the mask technology was used to segment the diseased region of leaves in order to get the best region of interest. After that, the average spectral separability of diseased region was significantly improved. Finally, through the comparison of the classification results between support vector machine and extreme learning machine (ELM), it was found that the ELM model based on neural network structure got the best identification results, and its classification accuracy reached 95.77%. This study provides a new method to identify similar diseases of leaf plants. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: There is a certain similarity in disease characteristics between white star disease and anthracnose disease of tea. The similarity leads to a low accuracy in the classification and identification of diseases using hyperspectral technology. In order to solve this problem, this research proposed a spectrum extraction method based on the region of interest of the spots region. The experimental results showed that the average spectrum obtained from the leaf spots region could significantly improve the characterization of tea white star disease and anthrax, and the classification accuracy of the prediction model was significantly improved. This study provides a theoretical reference for the identification of tea similar diseases.  aPublisher supplied data  cA Project Funded by the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions  a31971788cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a4121680001cProject of Agricultural Equipment Department of Jiangsu University  a4091600002cProject of Synergistic Innovation Center of Jiangsu Modern Agricultural Equipment and Technology  aCE20185029cScience and Technology Support Project of Changzhou (Social Development) 3aanthracnose 3aanthrax 3ahyperspectral imagery 3aleaves 3amodels 3asupport vector machines 3atea1 aJun, Sun1 aNing, Yang1 aXiaohong, Wu1 aXin, Zhou1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7496-75860 tJournal of food process engineering.g2021 Jan., v. 44, no. 1 p.e13584-dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl8651x0145-88767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpe.135843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03305naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001600142245008000158300001600238520176000254592002802014650002002042650001702062650001902079650002102098650002302119650001302142650001202155650002002167650001802187650001302205650001202218650002002230650002202250650001702272650001102289650002002300650002902320650000902349650001202358650001902370650000702389650001302396650001702409650001202426650001902438651001102457700001802468700001602486700002202502773012902524856007702653852000902730655001202739IND60765485620221121223438.0220904e20100726xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076548562DNAL7 a10.17221/86/2009-jfs2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRejšek, K.10aSoil characteristics under selected broadleaved tree species in East Norway  ap. 295-306.  aComprehensive analyses of soil properties of sites of native Scandinavian broadleaved tree species were performed in 36 habitats in East Norway. The material consisted of stands of silver birch (Betula pendula Roth.), white birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh.), black alder (Alnus glutinosa Gaertn.), speckled alder (Alnus incana Moench.), European ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.), pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) and sessile oak (Quercus petraea [Matt.] Liebl.). The main objective was to describe the vertical characteristics and variations in some selected soil variables of the soil profiles. Particular soil horizons of 15 Brunisolic soils, 11 Regosolic soils, 6 Gleysolic and 4 Podzolic were sampled and analyzed for soil texture, bulk density, specific density, porosity, oxidizable carbon, total nitrogen content, pH in water, exchangeable acidity, exchangeable cations and anions (Mg, Ca, Mn, Al, S, Fe, B, P and K), cation exchange capacity and base saturation. No regular patterns were found in selected soil properties when tested between various soil units in silver birch stands. Furthermore, silver birch stands were found on sites, which topsoil (i) significantly differed in their cation exchange capacities, (ii) did not differ significantly in their pH values, and (iii) mostly differed in their clay contents and (iv) mostly did not differ in BS. Differences among the Humic Regosols, Luvic Gleysols, Sombric Brunisols, Eutric Brunisols and Humo-Ferric Podzols for silver birch stands in their topmost horizons of humified organic matter intimately mixed with the mineral fraction horizons and differences among particular soil horizons for the main soil properties under all the selected broadleaved tree species stands are discussed. &nbsp;  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlnus glutinosa 3aAlnus incana 3aBetula pendula 3aBetula pubescens 3aFraxinus excelsior 3aGleysols 3aPodzols 3aQuercus petraea 3aQuercus robur 3aRegosols 3aacidity 3abase saturation 3abroadleaved trees 3abulk density 3acarbon 3acation exchange 3acation exchange capacity 3aclay 3aforests 3aorganic matter 3apH 3aporosity 3asoil texture 3atopsoil 3atotal nitrogen 3aNorway1 aHaveraaen, O.1 aSandnes, A.1 aSomerlíková, K.0 tJournal of Forest Science.g, v. 56, no. 7 p.295-306dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21419x1212-48347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/86/2009-jfs3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03010naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003500150245012000185500002200305520163900327592002801966650002701994650002002021650002302041650001402064650001502078650001802093650001602111650002802127650002702155650001602182651000902198651001102207651001102218653002402229653001802253653002602271653001602297700001802313700002802331700001602359773008402375856008402459852000902543655001202552IND60582814720221118010304.0171008s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058281472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoenv.2017.08.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález-Pérez, Brenda Karen10aMultigenerational effects of triclosan on the demography of Plationus patulus and Brachionus havanaensis (ROTIFERA)  aPre-press version  aTriclosan is a personal care product widely used in North America, Europe and Asia as antimicrobial ingredient in many consumer chemical products. In Mexico concentrations of triclosan have been reported in aquatic systems. However, there is no law regulating the presence of chemicals such as triclosan, in aquatic systems. The scarce data about this chemical has increased concern among ecotoxicologists regarding possible effects on aquatic organisms. Moreover, multigenerational studies are rarely studied and the results vary depending on the contaminant. Rotifers, are a dominant group of zooplankton, and have been used in aquatic risk assessments of personal care products due to their sensitivity and high reproductive rates. Plationus patulus and Brachionus havanaensis are common rotifers distributed in aquatic ecosystems of Mexico and have been used in ecotoxicological bioassays. In this study, the median lethal concentration (LC50, 24h) of P. patulus and B. havanaensis exposed to triclosan was determined. Based on the LC50, we tested three sublethal concentrations of triclosan to quantify the demographic responses of both rotifers for two successive generations (F0, and F1). The 24h LC50 of triclosan for P. patulus and B. havanaensis were 300 and 500µgL−1 respectively. Despite the concentration, triclosan had an adverse effect on both Plationus patulus and Brachionus havanaensis in both generations exposed. Experiments show that P. patulus was more sensitive than B. havanaensis when exposed to triclosan. When exposed to triclosan the parental generation (F0) of P. patulus was far more affected than F1.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrachionus havanaensis 3aadverse effects 3aaquatic ecosystems 3abioassays 3ademography 3aecotoxicology 3aingredients 3alethal concentration 50 3apersonal care products 3azooplankton 3aAsia 3aEurope 3aMexico 0aendocrine disruptor 0aecotoxicology 0alife table demography 0azooplankton1 aSarma, S.S.S.1 aCastellanos-Páez, M.E.1 aNandini, S.0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2017, dElsevier Inc.x0147-65137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2017.08.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02832naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001100150245013700161300002000298520145200318592002801770650002501798650001501823650002501838650003601863650002101899650001601920650001801936700002001954700005501974700001402029700001602043700005302059700005502112700005402167773013102221856008502352852000902437655001202446IND60755445020221119211929.0211102e20211021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075544502DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.1c024602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Le12aA Bio-inspired Extended-Gate Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect-Transistor for Highly Sensitive Amino Acid Enantiodiscrimination  ap. 14425-14431.  aAs the most important small molecules revealing the origins of life, amino acids (AAs) play essential roles in living organisms and their facile enantiodiscrimination has long been a great challenge for analytical chemists. Inspired by the specific stereomatching effect between biomolecules and AA enantiomers, herein, we first developed a bio-inspired highly sensitive platform based on an extended-gate metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect-transistor (EG-MOSFET) for highly sensitive AA enantiodiscrimination. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was self-assembled on deposited Au surfaces to afford the extended gate (EG) sensing unit, and its enantiorecognition ability was initially verified using common electrochemical techniques. The EG was thereafter installed to a MOSFET to build the desired BSA-EG-MOSFET highly sensitive chiral sensing platform, which realized the efficient enantiodiscrimination of essential AAs with high sensitivity, where effective chiral resolution was achieved at the femtomole level to phenylalanine (Phe). Combining molecular docking and circular dichroism spectroscopy, the weak intermolecular interactions between BSA and AAs enantiomers were investigated and the mechanism for signal amplification was proposed. Our results demonstrate that the as-fabricated biosensor has great potential in highly sensitive chiral sensing fields and can also afford a potential tool for biomolecular interaction investigations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3abiosensors 3abovine serum albumin 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3aenantiomers 3aphenylalanine1 aZhang, Jingjing1 aDai, Haitao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1994-31351 aCai, Deyu1 aGuo, Caijun1 aXiao, Yin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6582-261X1 aMa, Xiaofei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8047-51931 aWang, Yong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4666-20530 tAnalytical chemistry.g2021 Oct. 21, v. 93, no. 43 p.14425-14431dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c024603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02828naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245008100169520160600250592002801856650002301884650001701907650001001924650001201934650002101946650002401967650001501991650000902006650001002015650001202025650001802037650001002055650001202065650001802077653001302095653001102108653002502119653001902144700001802163773012102181856008302302852000902385655001202394IND60746096120221121043853.0210911e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074609612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbpa.2021.1110422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGlover, Chris N.10aHypoxia modifies calcium handling in the Pacific hagfish, Eptatretus stoutii  aHagfishes may encounter low dissolved oxygen in their natural habitats, a consequence of association with hypoxic sediments and their feeding behaviour. In teleost fish, hypoxia exposure decreases ion uptake, speculated to be a mechanism for energy conservation. Although hagfishes osmoconform, they do regulate extracellular fluid concentrations of divalent cations such as calcium. The current study hypothesised that exposure of hagfish to hypoxia (0.4 kPA, 24 h) would reduce calcium uptake (determined via in vitro isolated skin and gut epithelial transport assays) and calcium accumulation (determined by in vivo whole animal exposures, using radiolabelled calcium (⁴⁵Ca) to assess newly acquired calcium). A decrease in in vitro epidermal uptake was observed at sub-environmental calcium levels (10 μM), but not at environmental calcium levels (10 mM). No changes in gut calcium uptake were determined. Conversely, hypoxia led to a more rapid in vivo accumulation of calcium in tissues (skin, muscle, liver, heart, plasma, brain), mediated mostly by a significant increase in accumulation at the gill. These differences were only apparent after 1-h of exposure to the radiolabel (i.e., the last hour of the 24-h hypoxia exposure) and were not observed after 3 and 24 h periods of radiolabel exposure. This outcome was the opposite of the hypothesised effect. The reasons for a more rapid accumulation of calcium in hypoxic hagfish are unknown but may relate to roles for calcium in enhancing hypoxia tolerance in hagfishes or could be a consequence of changes in ventilatory frequency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEptatretus stoutii 3abiochemistry 3abrain 3acalcium 3adissolved oxygen 3aenergy conservation 3aepithelium 3afish 3aheart 3ahypoxia 3aion transport 3aliver 3amuscles 3aradiolabeling 0aAgnathan 0aAnoxia 0aEpithelial transport 0aIon regulation1 aGoss, Greg G.0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2021 Nov., v. 261 p.111042-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12014x1095-64337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpa.2021.1110423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02208naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100007700140245012600217300001600343520092800359592002801287650001601315650001501331650002001346650001401366650001001380650002301390650001401413650001401427650001101441650001901452650002301471700002001494700002001514700002001534700001401554700002001568773012701588856007401715852000901789655001201798IND60617333520221122061735.0181025e20180227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061733352DNAL7 a10.1039/c7bm01050h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdel FattahThese authors contributed equally to the work., Abdel Rahman10a3D cellular structures and co-cultures formed through the contactless magnetic manipulation of cells on adherent surfaces  ap. 683-694.  aA magnet array is employed to manipulate diamagnetic cells that are contained in paramagnetic medium to demonstrate for the first time the contactless bioprinting of three-dimensional (3D) cellular structures and co-cultures of breast cancer MCF-7 and endothelial HUVEC at prescribed locations on tissue culture treated well plates.

Nine frozen sauries were placed in the RF chamber and tempered under different input power (200, 400, 800, 1,600 W), electrode gaps (7, 8, 9 cm) under batch and continuous tempering mode. With a target end‐point tempering temperature of −4°C. Results showed 200 W/9 cm resulted in the longest tempering time (16.44, 15.43 min) and 1,600 W/7 cm was the shortest (2.95, 3.54 min) under batch mode tempering, respectively. The processing conditions of 200 W/9 cm and 200 W/7 cm under batch mode, and 200 W/8 cm, 200 W/9 cm, 400 W/9 cm, 800 W/8 cm under continuous mode all produced a final sample surface temperature distribution within the range of −10°C to 20°C, which indicated a reasonable tempering process. The area of the high temperature zone (10°C < T ≤ 20°C) of tempered sauries under 200 W/9 cm decreased from 0.28% to 0.23% when switching from batch to continuous mode. This implies that continuous RF tempering could reduce overheating and improve tempering uniformity of sauries. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Tempering rate, temperature distribution, and energy consumption are the most important concerns to researchers and the industry since tempering temperature and time are highly correlated to fish product quality. Results in this study showed both batch and continuous mode RF tempering could achieve reasonable tempering effect to a pack of frozen sauries. The application of continuous tempering system is more desirable than the batch ones, which can be applied to the tempering industry with higher throughput and connect to the following continuous processing unit operations. This study will broaden the knowledge of food engineers and provide an alternative technology of aquatic product tempering, and the parameters used in this study can assist technologists for the development of commercial equipment.  aPublisher supplied data  a31801613cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2018M632299cChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation  aQD2016055cShanghai Institutions of Higher Learning  a16PJ1404100cShanghai Pujiang Program 3aCololabis saira 3aelectrodes 3aenergy 3aequipment 3afish products 3aindustry 3aproduct quality 3aradio waves 3asurface temperature1 aZhu, Yali1 aHe, Jialing1 aLi, Feng1 aTang, Juming1 aKoral, Tony1 aWongsa‐Ngasri, Pisit1 aJiao, Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1355-880X0 tJournal of food process engineering.g2021 Jan., v. 44, no. 1 p.e13595-dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl8651x0145-88767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpe.135953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02453naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002500146245008100171300001600252520093700268592002801205650002801233650001701261650001301278650001001291650001301301650001901314650000901333650001701342650002301359650001701382650001601399650001201415650001401427650001501441650002501456653001701481653001701498653003101515653001201546653001401558700002501572700002601597700002201623700001601645700001901661700002301680773013001703856008101833852000901914655001201923IND60636977420221118072835.0190419e20190501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063697742DNAL7 a10.2478/prolas-2019-00292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnanjevs, Vladislavs10aGeneral Influence of Biphasic Calcium Phosphate on Osteoporotic Bone Density  ap. 185-188.  aBone density of the femur body of rabbit was determined in vivo. Experimental osteoporosis was induced by ovariectomy and subsequent injections of methylprednisolone. In the greater trochanter region of right femur, defects were created and filled with granules of hydroxyapatite and tricalcium phosphate (HAP/TCP 70/30) or HAP/TCP 70/30 together with 5% strontium. After three months, the animals were euthanized. The bone mass density of the right and left body of femur was measured by cone beam computed tomography (CT) scan. The results of the study showed that the right femur of the rabbit, where biomaterials had been implanted, and the left femur, where no biomaterial implantation occurred, became denser after filling the defect with HAP/TCP 70/30 ceramic granules or 5% Sr modified HAP/TCP ceramic granules. There was no difference between operated and non-operated legs and HAP/TCP and HAP/TCP with 5% strontium groups.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatible materials 3abone density 3aceramics 3afemur 3agranules 3ahydroxyapatite 3alegs 3amass density 3amethylprednisolone 3aosteoporosis 3aovariectomy 3arabbits 3astrontium 3atomography 3atricalcium phosphate 0abone density 0aosteoporosis 0abiphasic calcium phosphate 0ain vivo 0astrontium1 aAnanjeva, Aleksandra1 aVētra, J.q(Jānis),1 aSkaģers, Andrejs1 aSalma, Ilze1 aNeimane, Laura1 aKasyanov, Vladimir0 tProceedings of the Latvian Academy of Sciences.g2019 May 01, v. 73, no. 2 p.185-188dSciendowJournal:21686x1407-009X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/prolas-2019-00293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02600naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005600150245013400206300002000340520123300360592002801593650002501621650001201646650001401658650001201672650002001684650001501704650002301719650001301742650001501755650002201770650001201792650002201804650000901826650002101835700002101856700002101877700002401898700001901922773013101941856008502072852000902157655001202166IND60755445120221119211953.0211102e20211020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075544512DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.1c024742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWojcik, Roza1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3670-565410aMapping Glyceride Species in Biodiesel by High-Temperature Gas Chromatography Combined with Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometry  ap. 14432-14439.  aAccurate and comprehensive identification of residual glycerides in biodiesel is an important part of fuel characterization due to the impact of glycerides on the fuel physicochemical properties. However, analysis of bound glycerol in biodiesel samples faces challenges due to lack of readily available standards of structurally complex glyceride species in nontraditional biodiesel feedstocks and a risk of misannotation in the presence of impurities in gas chromatographic separations. Here, we evaluate methane and isobutane chemical ionization–single quadrupole mass spectrometry combined with high-temperature gas chromatography separations for mapping monoacylglycerols, diacylglycerols, and triacylglycerols in biodiesel. Unlike electron impact ionization, which produces mostly in-source fragments, isobutane chemical ionization spectra of tetramethylsilyl-derivatized monoacylglycerols and diacylglycerols are dominated by molecular ions and M-SiO(CH₃)₃⁺ ions, which provide important diagnostic information. We demonstrate the utility of isobutane chemical ionization in identifying structurally complex glycerolipid standards as well as species in biodiesel samples from different plant and animal feedstocks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3aanimals 3abiodiesel 3abutanes 3adiacylglycerols 3afeedstocks 3agas chromatography 3aglycerol 3aionization 3amass spectrometry 3amethane 3amonoacylglycerols 3arisk 3atriacylglycerols1 aOxford, Tessa L.1 aMelville, Angela1 aWright, Cherylyn W.1 aWright, Bob W.0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2021 Oct. 20, v. 93, no. 43 p.14432-14439dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c024743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03551naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006300140245011300203500001900316500002000335520230600355592002802661650001502689650001102704650001402715650002602729650000902755650001802764650002002782650002002802650002002822650001502842650002302857650000902880650002302889700002302912773013502935856007403070852000903144655001203153IND60722617220221120042854.0210106e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072261722DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpe.135772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDash, Kshirod Kumar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5520-214X10aModeling and optimization of microwave puffing of rice using artificial neural network and genetic algorithm  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA genetic algorithm based on artificial neural network (ANN) modeling was developed for the microwave puffing of preconditioned rice. The microwave puffing method was analyzed in order to find out the effect of microwave power, puffing time, butter level, and sodium bicarbonate level on the expansion ratio and puffing percentage of puffed rice. ANN modeling was applied between the independent and dependent variables and 4‐7‐2 architecture was selected as the best ANN architecture with mean squared error value ranging between 1.138 and 1.839. The optimized conditions obtained from the hybrid ANN‐GA approach were 850 W of microwave power, 35 s of puffing time, 5.26% of butter, and 1.46% of sodium bicarbonate. The optimum combination of independent variables resulted in maximum expansion ratio and percentage puffing of 8.4 and 94.37%, respectively. The relative deviations between the experimental and ANN‐GA model predicted values for expansion ratio and percentage puffing were 1.42 and 1.04%, respectively. The micrograph analysis showed that the parboiled rice had closely packed swollen starch granules with a fused endosperm, while large porous structured vacuoles were found in puffed rice. This study would provide a simple and efficient way to obtain crispy puffed rice by using a domestic microwave oven. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Microwave puffing produces low fat ready to eat healthy products than the deep fat fried product. The microwave generates rapid heat and mass transfer in the food product resulting in the puffed product of desirable porous structure. Evaluation of optimal microwave puffing conditions will produce puffed rice with high sensory value and nutritional value. On this basis, the present study emphasized the effects of processing parameters and the potential of two additives, that is, butter and sodium bicarbonate, for microwave puffing of rice. The impact of various processing and operating conditions of microwave puffing of rice was analyzed. This research would make a way to make puffed rice at the domestic level in a quicker and easier process. This process would develop a suitable package containing preconditioned rice kernel with butter and sodium bicarbonate to obtain ready to eat puffed rice by using a domestic microwave oven.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3abutter 3aendosperm 3ahealthy eating habits 3aheat 3amass transfer 3amicrowave ovens 3aneural networks 3anutritive value 3aparboiling 3aready-to-eat foods 3arice 3asodium bicarbonate1 aDas, Sushant Kumar0 tJournal of food process engineering.g2021 Jan., v. 44, no. 1 p.e13577-dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl8651x0145-88767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpe.135773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02111naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100001600150245011200166300001300278520106300291592002801354650002401382650001401406650002601420650001901446650001101465650002401476650002301500700001701523700002301540700001901563773009601582856008601678852000901764655001201773IND4462208720221119071359.0141101e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446220872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodqual.2011.06.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Min-a,10aDiscriminations of the A–Not A difference test improved when “A” was familiarized using a brand image  ap. 3-12.  aThe A–Not A difference test can be used to measure the overall sensory difference of two or more products from a reference product. It is an economically efficient method for difference testing because it is more statistically powerful and less prone to working memory problems than the triangle or duo–trio tests. With the A–Not A test, subjects are required to be familiar with the reference product to stabilize their cognitive decision criteria. An effective familiarization procedure is needed. In the present study, the effects of four different familiarization procedures were investigated: (1) 2-AFCR, (2) no-additional familiarization, (3) repeated tastings of the reference, and (4) repeated tastings of the reference with a brand image provided. Two products were discriminated from a reference using 12 subjects over repeated sessions. Comparisons of the test performances, analyzed with d′ estimates, showed that there was a tendency toward better discrimination when repeated tastings of the reference were accompanied by a brand image.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrand name products 3acognition 3adiscriminant analysis 3aimage analysis 3amemory 3areference standards 3asensory evaluation1 aChae, Ji-Eun1 avan Hout, Danielle1 aLee, Hye-Seong0 tFood quality and preference.g2012 Jan., v. 23, no. 1 p.3-12dElsevier Ltdx0950-32937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodqual.2011.06.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03183naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100004700181245012700228300001800355506007600373520158500449592002802034506003702062650001702099650002502116650002302141650002202164650003102186650003902217650002002256650001802276650001302294650001802307650001202325700001802337700001902355700002502374700009602399700002002495773012702515856007402642852000902716655001202725IND60617333720221207125246.0181025e20180501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061733372DNAL7 a10.1039/c7bm01052d2doi7 aPMC59301182pmcid7 a295958482pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZbindenAuthors contributed equally., Aline10aMultivalent conjugates of basic fibroblast growth factor enhance in vitro proliferation and migration of endothelial cells  ap. 1076-1083.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGrowth factors hold great promise for regenerative therapies. However, their clinical use has been halted by poor efficacy and rapid clearance from tissue, necessitating the delivery of extremely high doses to achieve clinical effectiveness which has raised safety concerns. Thus, strategies to either enhance growth factor activity at low doses or to increase their residence time within target tissues are necessary for clinical success. In this study, we generated multivalent conjugates (MVCs) of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), a key growth factor involved in angiogenesis and wound healing, to hyaluronic acid (HyA) polymer chains. Multivalent bFGF conjugates (mvbFGF) were fabricated with minimal non-specific interaction observed between bFGF and the HyA chain. The hydrodynamic radii of mvbFGF ranged from ∼50 to ∼75 nm for conjugation ratios of bFGF to HyA chains at low (10 : 1) and high (30 : 1) feed ratios, respectively. The mvbFGF demonstrated enhanced bioactivity compared to unconjugated bFGF in assays of cell proliferation and migration, processes critical to angiogenesis and tissue regeneration. The 30 : 1 mvbFGF outperformed the 10 : 1 conjugate, which could be due to either FGF receptor clustering or interference with receptor mediated internalization and signal deactivation. This study simultaneously investigated the role of both protein to polymer ratio and multivalent conjugate size on their bioactivity, and determined that increasing the protein-to-polymer ratio and conjugate size resulted in greater cell bioactivity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aangiogenesis 3abioactive properties 3acell proliferation 3aendothelial cells 3afibroblast growth factor 2 3afibroblast growth factor receptors 3ahyaluronic acid 3ahydrodynamics 3apolymers 3atissue repair 3atissues1 aBrowne, Shane1 aAltiok, Eda I.1 aSvedlund, Felicia L.1 aJacksonCurrent Address: Valitor Inc., 820 Heinz Avenue, Berkeley, CA 94710, USA., Wesley M.1 aHealy, Kevin E.0 tBiomaterials science.g2018 May 1, v. 6, no. 5 p.1076-1083dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7bm01052d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02208naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001600145245009900161300001600260520099200276592002801268650002201296650001101318650001401329650001301343650001001356650001301366650000901379650001901388650001801407650002401425650002101449650001601470650001201486700004001498700001801538700002701556773012701583856007901710852000901789655001201798IND60135905720221116230227.0150522e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013590572DNAL7 a10.1111/1471-0307.121872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumari, Anu10aEffects of baking conditions on colour, texture and crumb grain characteristics of Chhana Podo  ap. 270-280.  aBaking, the key step in the preparation of Chhana Podo, involves simultaneous heat and mass transfer that induces physicochemical and structural changes in the product. The effects of baking conditions on colour, texture and crumb grain development in the product were evaluated. The browning index of baked Podo increased from the initial value of 15.7 to 95, 101 and 112, at baking temperatures of 120, 135 and 150 °C, respectively. Browning kinetics followed the logistic model (R² > 0.98) with an activation energy of 17.81 kJ/mol. In general, crumb grain characteristics such as mean cell area, cell density and cell‐to‐total area ratio increased with increase in baking time and temperature. Textural attributes such as hardness, chewiness and gumminess increased with baking time and temperature while springiness, cohesiveness and resilience increased up to 40 min due to the filling‐up of pores water and liquid by fat and expanding water, but decreased thereafter.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3abaking 3achewiness 3acohesion 3acolor 3ahardness 3aheat 3alogit analysis 3amass transfer 3aproduct development 3aseed development 3atemperature 3atexture1 aEljeeva Emerald, Franklin Magdaline1 aSimha, Vikram1 aPushpadass, Heartwin A0 tInternational journal of dairy technology.g2015 May, v. 68, no. 2 p.270-280dSociety of Dairy Technologyx1364-727X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1471-0307.121873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02307naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001600143245013400159520125500293592002801548650001701576650001601593650001901609650002001628650001301648650001001661650002201671700001601693700001701709700001901726700001801745773011901763856007801882852000901960655001201969IND60784063720221121061704.0220726e20220630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078406372DNAL7 a10.3390/genes130711772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKong, Ying 10aEffect of Developmental Stages on Genes Involved in Middle and Downstream Pathway of Volatile Terpene Biosynthesis in Rose Petals  aTerpenoids are economically and ecologically important compounds, and they are vital constituents in rose flower fragrance and rose essential oil. The terpene synthase genes (TPSs), trans-prenyltransferases genes (TPTs), NUDX1 are involved in middle and downstream pathway of volatile terpene biosynthesis in rose flowers. We identified 7 complete RcTPTs, 49 complete RcTPSs, and 9 RcNUDX1 genes in the genome of Rosachinensis. During the flower opening process of butterfly rose (Rosachinensis ‘Mutabilis’, MU), nine RcTPSs expressed in the petals of opening MU flowers exhibited two main expression trends, namely high and low, in old and fresh petals. Five short-chain petal-expressed RcTPTs showed expression patterns corresponding to RcTPSs. Analysis of differential volatile terpenes and differential expressed genes indicated that higher emission of geraniol from old MU petals might be related to the RcGPPS expression. Comprehensive analysis of volatile emission, sequence structure, micro-synteny and gene expression suggested that RcTPS18 may encode (E,E)-α-farnesene synthase. These findings may be useful for elucidating the molecular mechanism of terpenoid metabolism in rose and are vital for future studies on terpene regulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosynthesis 3abutterflies 3aessential oils 3agene expression 3ageraniol 3aodors 3aterpene synthases1 aWang, Huan 1 aLang, Lixin 1 aDou, Xiaoying 1 aBai, Jinrong 0 tGenes.g2022 June 30, v. 13, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes130711773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02449naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245009900160300001600259520120400275592002801479650002001507650001001527650001701537650001901554650003601573650001401609650002201623650001101645650001601656650001701672700002601689700002001715700002901735700005501764700002201819773012701841856007401968852000902042655001202051IND60617333920221122083250.0181025e20180227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061733392DNAL7 a10.1039/c7bm01056g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMauri, Emanuele10aEvaluation of RGD functionalization in hybrid hydrogels as 3D neural stem cell culture systems  ap. 501-510.  aThe use of neural stem cells (NSCs) in cell therapy has become a powerful tool used for the treatment of central nervous system diseases, including traumatic brain and spinal cord injuries. However, a significant drawback is related to the limited viability after transplantation in situ. The design of three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds that are capable of resembling the architecture and physico-chemical features of an extracellular environment could be a suitable approach to improve cell survival and preserve their cellular active phase over time. In this study, we investigated NSC adhesion and proliferation in hydrogel systems. In particular, we evaluated the effect of RGD binding domains on cell fate within the polymeric scaffold. The introduction of a tripeptide via hydrogel chemical functionalization improved the percentage of proliferating cells until 8 days after seeding when compared to the unmodified scaffold. The beneficial effects of this 3D culture system was further evident when compared to a NSC monolayer (2D) culture, resulting in an approximately 40% increase in cells in the active phases at 4 and 8 days, and maintained a difference of 25% until 21 days after seeding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal injuries 3abrain 3acell culture 3acell viability 3acentral nervous system diseases 3ahydrogels 3aneural stem cells 3asowing 3aspinal cord 3atherapeutics1 aSacchetti, Alessandro1 aVicario, Nunzio1 aPeruzzotti-Jametti, Luca1 aRossiThese authors share last authorship., Filippo1 aPluchino, Stefano0 tBiomaterials science.g2018 Feb. 27, v. 6, no. 3 p.501-510dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7bm01056g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02905naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245012600173300002000299520157600319592002801895650002501923650001501948650002101963650001701984650001702001650001002018650001202028650001102040650003602051650002602087650003302113650002902146650002602175650001702201700006402218773013102282856008502413852000902498655001202507IND60755445520221119212014.0211102e20211022xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075544552DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.1c029232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJanssens, Liesl K.10aSensing an Oxygen Sensor: Development and Application of Activity-Based Assays Directly Monitoring HIF Heterodimerization  ap. 14462-14470.  aConventionally, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) activation by prolyl hydroxylase domain enzyme (PHD) inhibition is monitored by gene reporter assays. The principle relies on the monitoring of an upstream event (HIF stabilization) by the downstream transcriptional activity. Here, we developed a novel approach to directly sense HIF activation by monitoring the heterodimerization of the HIFα/HIFβ subunits, constituting the functional HIF transcription factor. Two live cell-based biosensor assay setups were designed, utilizing functional complementation of split-nanoluciferase as a tool to measure HIFα/HIFβ protein–protein interaction resulting from the stabilization of HIF1α or HIF2α. The assay setup in a 96-well format was optimized for a duration of 2 h, and a HEK293T transfection protocol was introduced for the optimal configuration of HIFα/HIFβ-fusion proteins. These new bioassays outperformed hypoxia response element-based gene reporter assay, the current state-of-the-art assay, in terms of sensitivity. Applicability was demonstrated using a panel of PHD inhibitors, including roxadustat, molidustat, daprodustat, desidustat, vadadustat, and FG-2216, for which concentration–response curves were generated, allowing for the derivation of potency (EC₅₀) and efficacy (Eₘₐₓ) data. The broad applicability of the biosensors was established via applying hypoxia mimetic CoCl₂, iron chelator desferrioxamine, proteasome inhibitor MG-132, and 2-OG mimetic dimethyloxalylglycine on the assays, indicating concentration-dependent effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3abiosensors 3achelating agents 3adeferoxamine 3adimerization 3agenes 3ahypoxia 3aoxygen 3aprocollagen-proline dioxygenase 3aproteasome inhibitors 3aprotein-protein interactions 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atransfection1 aStove, Christophe P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7126-348X0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2021 Oct. 22, v. 93, no. 43 p.14462-14470dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c029233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02566naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245011400160520136000274592002801634650001301662650002201675650000901697650001901706650001701725650001901742650001001761650001101771650004301782650000901825650001101834650001501845650001501860651001001875651002101885700002101906700001701927773012901944856007402073852000902147655001202156IND60748741920221118231121.0210827e20210808xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074874192DNAL7 a10.3390/rs131631392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCho, Jeong Hoon10aImprovements of ADAM3 by Incorporating New Dust Emission Reduction Formulations Based on Real-Time MODIS NDVI  aDust events in Northeast Asia have several adverse effects on human health, agricultural land, infrastructure, and transport. Wind speed is the most important factor in determining the total dust emission at the land surface; however, various land-surface conditions must be considered as well. Recently, the Korea Meteorological Administration updated the dust emission reduction factor (RF) in the Asian Dust Aerosol Model 3 (ADAM3) using data from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). We evaluated the improvements of ADAM3 according to soil types. We incorporated new RF formulations in the evaluation based on real-time MODIS NDVI data obtained over the Asian dust source regions in northern China during spring 2017. This incorporation improved the simulation performance of ADAM3 for the PM₁₀ mass concentration in Inner Mongolia and Manchuria for all soil types, except Gobi. The ADAM3 skill scores for sand, loess, and mixed types in a 24 h forecast increased by 6.6%, 20.4%, and 13.3%, respectively, compared with those in forecasts employing the monthly RF based on the NDVI data. As surface conditions in the dust source regions continually change, incorporating real-time vegetation data is critical to improving performance of dust forecast models such as ADAM3.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aagricultural land 3adust 3adust emissions 3ahuman health 3ainfrastructure 3aloess 3amodels 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3asand 3aspring 3avegetation 3awind speed 3aChina 3aKorean Peninsula1 aRyoo, Sang-Boom 1 aKim, Jinwon 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Aug. 08, v. 13, no. 16dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs131631393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03370naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001600191245012300207506007600330520164800406592002802054506003702082650001802119650001802137650001702155650000902172650002402181650001902205650000902224650000902233650000902242650001002251650001302261650001602274650001902290650001102309650001102320650002102331650001202352650002202364653002102386653003202407653003002439653002902469653003202498700001702530700002402547700002102571773011902592856008402711852000902795655001202804IND60690165120221207102624.0200426e20150403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069016512DNAL7 a10.4161/15592324.2014.9922892doi7 aPMC46233072pmcid7 a258308632pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNath, Manoj10aPDH45 overexpressing transgenic tobacco and rice plants provide salinity stress tolerance via less sodium accumulation  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSalinity stress negatively affects the crop productivity worldwide, including that of rice. Coping with these losses is a major concern for all countries. The pea DNA helicase, PDH45 is a unique member of helicase family involved in the salinity stress tolerance. However, the exact mechanism of the PDH45 in salinity stress tolerance is yet to be established. Therefore, the present study was conducted to investigate the mechanism of PDH45-mediated salinity stress tolerance in transgenic tobacco and rice lines along with wild type (WT) plants using CoroNa Green dye based sodium localization in root and shoot sections. The results showed that under salinity stress root and shoot of PDH45 overexpressing transgenic tobacco and rice accumulated less sodium (Na⁺) as compared to their respective WT. The present study also reports salinity tolerant (FL478) and salinity susceptible (Pusa-44) varieties of rice accumulated lowest and highest Na⁺ level, respectively. All the varieties and transgenic lines of rice accumulate differential Na⁺ ions in root and shoot. However, roots accumulate high Na⁺ as compared to the shoots in both tobacco and rice transgenic lines suggesting that the Na⁺ transport in shoot is somehow inhibited. It is proposed that the PDH45 is probably involved in the deposition of apoplastic hydrophobic barriers and consequently inhibit Na⁺ transport to shoot and therefore confers salinity stress tolerance to PDH45 overexpressing transgenic lines. This study concludes that tobacco (dicot) and rice (monocot) transgenic plants probably share common salinity tolerance mechanism mediated by PDH45 gene.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA helicases 3aMagnoliopsida 3aOryza sativa 3adyes 3agene overexpression 3ahydrophobicity 3aions 3apeas 3arice 3aroots 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3ashoots 3asodium 3astress tolerance 3atobacco 3atransgenic plants 0aCoroNa Green dye 0apea DNA helicase 45 (PDH45) 0asalinity stress tolerance 0asodium ions accumulation 0atransgenic tobacco and rice1 aGarg, Bharti1 aSahoo, Ranjan Kumar1 aTuteja, Narendra0 tPlant signaling & behavior.g2015 Apr. 3, v. 10, no. 4 p.e992289-dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2184x1559-23247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/15592324.2014.9922893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02459naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245009100163300001400254520114600268592002801414650000901442650002101451650002301472650001601495650001901511650002601530650001601556650001901572650002301591650002601614650001201640650001401652653001701666653001101683653001401694653002301708700001901731700002001750700001901770700001301789773011301802856007701915852000901992655001202001IND60636978120221118072857.0190412e20190301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063697812DNAL7 a10.2478/sab-2019-00062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPebriansyah, A.14aThe Effect of Natural Phytoadditive Silybum Marianum on Performance of Broiler Rabbits  ap. 40-45.  aThe effect of different label and processing methods of milk thistle on growth performance in broiler rabbits (HYLA, n = 255) fed with different concentration of milk thistle (Silybum marianum) was studied.

Rabbits were fed with different concentrations of 1% non-fermented milk thistle (experimental group E1) and 0.5% fermented milk thistle (experimental group E2), and the results were compared with a control group C (standard feed ration without any supplementation). Each experiment started at 42 days of rabbits’ age and finished at 85 days of age. Observed parameters were: average daily gain, average daily feed consumption, total feed consumption, slaughter live weight, and carcass weight. The best results were showed in experimental group E2 (supplement of 0.5% fermented milk thistle). Significant differences (P<0.05) were recorded in average daily feed consumption, total feed consumption, slaughter live weight, and carcass weight. The results show that 0.5% fermented milk thistle extract supplemented in the feed ration for broiler rabbits has a positive effect on fattening performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHyla 3aSilybum marianum 3aaverage daily gain 3abody weight 3acarcass weight 3afattening performance 3afeed intake 3afermented milk 3agrowth performance 3aprocessing technology 3arabbits 3aslaughter 0amilk thistle 0arabbit 0afattening 0agrowth performance1 aLukešová, D.1 aKnížková, I.1 aSilberová, P.1 aKunc, P.0 tScientia Agriculturae Bohemica.g2019 Mar. 01, v. 50, no. 1 p.40-45dSciendowJournal:23174x1805-94307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/sab-2019-00063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03230naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245018200173300001800355520186900373592002802242650001302270650002302283650002402306650001202330650001602342650001302358651001202371653001202383653003602395653001602431653001302447653001102460653002402471700001802495700002702513700001702540700002402557700002102581773009902602856008602701852000902787655001202796IND60534644820221122010922.0190319e20140226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053464482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLe Menach, Arnaud10aIncreased measles–mumps–rubella (MMR) vaccine uptake in the context of a targeted immunisation campaign during a measles outbreak in a vaccine-reluctant community in England  ap. 1147-1152.  aFollowing a measles outbreak in a vaccine-rejecting community between April and September 2011 in South-East England, local health agencies implemented a two-pronged measles–mumps–rubella (MMR) immunisation campaign from August to October offered at the local general practice where most cases were registered. The campaign included (a) accelerated vaccination of children earlier than scheduled (1st dose at 6–11 months, or 2nd dose at 18–39 months), (b) catch-up of those aged over 18 months who had had no MMR immunisations or were late for second MMR. We investigated the impact of the outbreak and campaign on the number of MMR doses given.In January 2012, we collected information on MMR vaccination for children registered at the practice aged 6 months–16 years on 1 August 2011, through the child health information system. We counted the number of MMR doses administered in 2011 and compared it to 2008–2010 data. We estimated the proportion vaccinated among the children eligible for the accelerated and catch-up campaign.The local practice administered 257 MMR doses in 2011, a 114% increase on the average for 2008–2010. Among children eligible for earlier MMR vaccination 5/26 (19%) received a first dose, and 34/57 (60%) a second dose. Among children eligible for catch-up, 20/329 (6%) received their first MMR and 39/121 (32%) their second. Of 1538 children, the proportion completely unimmunised for MMR declined by 3 percentage-points after the outbreak.Uptake of MMR vaccination significantly increased during the outbreak following the immunisation campaign. Those amenable to MMR vaccination seem to have benefited from the campaign more than those with no previous vaccinations. Future evaluations should address what made a few parents change their mind and have their children vaccinated for the first time during the outbreak.  aPublisher supplied data 3achildren 3ahealth information 3ainformation systems 3aparents 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aEngland 0aMeasles 0aMMR (measles–mumps–rubella) 0aVaccination 0aOutbreak 0aUptake 0aVaccination refusal1 aBoxall, Naomi1 aAmirthalingam, Gayatri1 aMaddock, Liz1 aBalasegaram, Sooria1 aMindlin, Miranda0 tVaccine.g2014 Feb. 26, v. 32, no. 10 p.1147-1152dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.01.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02840naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100001800176245013000194300001500324520135500339592002801694650001001722650001101732650001401743650001101757650003501768650002201803650001301825650002601838650001401864650001201878650001201890700002501902700002501927700002401952700002201976700003001998773015202028856006902180856010102249990002302350852000902373655001202382IND60643838220221120222444.0190514e20151010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064383822DNAL7 a10.3791/531972doi7 aPMC46926472pmcid7 a264847912pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGouder, Laura10aThree-dimensional quantification of dendritic spines from pyramidal neurons derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells  ap. e53197.  aDendritic spines are small protrusions that correspond to the post-synaptic compartments of excitatory synapses in the central nervous system. They are distributed along the dendrites. Their morphology is largely dependent on neuronal activity, and they are dynamic. Dendritic spines express glutamatergic receptors (AMPA and NMDA receptors) on their surface and at the levels of postsynaptic densities. Each spine allows the neuron to control its state and local activity independently. Spine morphologies have been extensively studied in glutamatergic pyramidal cells of the brain cortex, using both in vivo approaches and neuronal cultures obtained from rodent tissues. Neuropathological conditions can be associated to altered spine induction and maturation, as shown in rodent cultured neurons and one-dimensional quantitative analysis 1. The present study describes a protocol for the 3D quantitative analysis of spine morphologies using human cortical neurons derived from neural stem cells (late cortical progenitors). These cells were initially obtained from induced pluripotent stem cells. This protocol allows the analysis of spine morphologies at different culture periods, and with possible comparison between induced pluripotent stem cells obtained from control individuals with those obtained from patients with psychiatric diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrain 3acortex 3adendrites 3ahumans 3ainduced pluripotent stem cells 3aneural stem cells 3apatients 3aquantitative analysis 3areceptors 3arodents 3asynapse1 aTinévez, Jean-Yves,1 aGoubran-Botros, Hany1 aBenchoua, Alexandra1 aBourgeron, Thomas1 aCloëz-Tayarani, Isabelle0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2015 Oct. 10, , no. 104 p.e53197-e53197dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/531973Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/53197/three-dimensional-quantification-dendritic-spines-from-pyramidal  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02986naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002000171245008600191300001600277520151400293592002801807650001101835650002401846650002601870650002301896650001801919650002201937650002101959650001001980650001401990650001602004650002702020650002302047650002802070650005302098650003202151650002402183651001202207700001502219700002702234700002702261700001802288700002202306773010002328856005502428852000902483655001202492IND4468761320221119024916.0120727e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446876132DNAL7 a219550962pmid7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.2011.03913.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJacquemyn, Hans10aNonrandom spatial structuring of orchids in a hybrid zone of three Orchis species  ap. 454-464.  a• Nonrandom species–species associations may arise from a range of factors, including localized dispersal, intra‐ and interspecific interactions and heterogeneous environmental conditions. Because seed germination and establishment in orchids are critically dependent upon the availability of suitable mycorrhizal fungi, species–species associations in orchids may reflect associations with mycorrhizal fungi. • To test this hypothesis, we examined spatial association patterns, mycorrhizal associations and germination success in a hybrid zone containing three species of the genus Orchis (Orchis anthropophora, Orchis militaris and Orchis purpurea). • Hybridization occurred predominantly between O. purpurea and O. militaris. The spatial distribution patterns of most pure species and hybrids were independent from each other, except that of O. purpurea and its hybrids. The fungal community composition of established individuals differed significantly between pure species, but not between hybrids and O. purpurea. Seed germination experiments using pure seeds showed that the highest number of protocorms were found in regions where adult individuals were most abundant. In the case of hybrid seeds, germination was restricted to areas where the mother plant was most abundant. • Overall, these results suggest that the observed nonrandom spatial distribution of both pure and hybrid plants is dependent on the contingencies of the spatial distribution of suitable mycorrhizal fungi.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOrchis 3acommunity structure 3aenvironmental factors 3afungal communities 3ahybridization 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aseed germination 3aseeds 2aGeography 2aGermination 2aHybridization, Genetic 2aModels, Biological 2aMycorrhizaexphysiology 2aOrchidaceaexgeneticsxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aSeedsxgrowth & development 2aSpecies Specificity 0aBelgium1 aBrys, Rein1 aHonnay, O.q(Olivier),1 aRoldán‐Ruiz, Isabel1 aLievens, Bart1 aWiegand, Thorsten0 tnew phytologist.g2012 Jan., v. 193, no. 2 p.454-464dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2011.03913.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03398naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245018400167520163200351592002801983650002502011650002302036650003102059650001102090650002502101650001302126650001302139650001402152650002902166650001902195650002802214650001302242650002002255650002202275650001402297650001002311653000802321653000702329653000702336653000802343653000702351653000802358653000602366653000802372653000902380653001002389653000702399653002402406653002302430653003002453653001102483653001202494700002102506700002002527700002102547773011302568856008202681852000902763655001202772IND60746097020221120174544.0210911e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074609702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eja.2021.1263642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndueza, Donato10aRelationship between the chemical composition, nutritive value and the maturity stage of six temperate perennial grasses during their first growth cycle along an altitude gradient  aThis work addresses the dynamic of phenological development on mean stage weight (MSW), chemical composition, (ash, nitrogen (N), neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and acid detergent fibre (ADF) contents, and pepsin-cellulase dry matter digestibility (PCDMD) for cultivars of six perennial grass species (timothy, ryegrass, cocksfoot, sheep’s fescue, red fescue and meadow foxtail), during their first growth cycle. The study was performed over two years along 3 sites distributed along an altitudinal gradient. The dynamics of MSW, N, NDF, ADF and PCDMD for the species differed according to the environment. For a given sum of temperatures, at Clermont-Ferrand (CL; 350 m), MSW was delayed (note of 2.37) compared with Saint-Genès-Champanelle (SG; 850 m; note of 2.97) and Laqueuille (LA; 1100 m; note of 3.02). Consequently, the NDF and ADF contents were lower and the PCDMD value was higher in the cultivars established at CL (575 g/kg dry matter (DM), 287 g/kg DM and 0.64 respectively) than in those at SG (653 g/kg DM, 349 g/kg DM and 0.51 respectively) and LA (653 g/kg DM, 343 g/kg DM and 0.52 respectively). In all sites, and for the two years, the PCDMD content of timothy (0.60), ryegrass (0.63) and cocksfoot (0.59) cultivars were higher than that of sheep’s fescue (0.47), red fescue (0.53), and meadow foxtail (0.51). The only exception was identified for CL site in the first year of the study, when the dynamic of PCDMD was similar for all cultivars. Sum of temperatures and MSW were closely related to nutritive value of forage, but neither indicator fully described the nutritive value of perennial grasses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlopecurus pratensis 3aDactylis glomerata 3aFestuca rubra subsp. rubra 3aLolium 3aacid detergent fiber 3aagronomy 3aaltitude 3acultivars 3adry matter digestibility 3amaturity stage 3aneutral detergent fiber 3anitrogen 3anutritive value 3aperennial grasses 3aphenology 3asheep 0aADF 0aCL 0aDM 0aGDD 0aLA 0aMSW 0aN 0aNDF 0aNIRS 0aPCDMD 0aSG 0aSum of temperatures 0aPhenological stage 0aPerennial temperate grass 0aForage 0aQuality1 aPicard, Fabienne1 aNote, Priscilla1 aCarrère, Pascal0 tEuropean journal of agronomy.g2021 Oct., v. 130 p.126364-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49616x1161-03017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2021.1263643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02388naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245006400163300001400227520112700241592002801368650001001396650002301406650002001429650002001449650002301469650001101492650001201503650001101515650001401526650002501540651001901565653001601584653002501600653002301625653001601648653001301664653001001677653001001687700001801697700001601715773011301731856007701844852000901921655001201930IND60636978520221118072850.0190412e20190301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063697852DNAL7 a10.2478/sab-2019-00102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRumánková, L.10aBeer Consumption in the Czech Republic and its Determinants  ap. 64-69.  aThe study identifies the main beer consumption determinants in the Czech Republic and quantifies their influence on the beer consumption. The analysis covers three areas – identification of the main determinants of Czech beer consumption, quantification of the influence of these factors on beer consumption, and examination of beer consumption forecasting possibilities. Time series of selected variables containing annual data of the 1994–2014 period are analysed. The main determinants are defined in accord with the general economic theory, their influence is measured using an econometric model, and quality of the model for prognostic purposes is verified using an ex-post prognosis. Based on empirical analysis, the price of lager beer, income, and influence of financial crisis were determined as the main determinants of Czech beer consumption. In addition, inelastic reaction of beer consumption on their changes was proven. The estimated model may be considered suitable for prognostic purposes. The Czech beer market and/or beer consumption in the examined period can be considered as specific, but stable.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeers 3aeconometric models 3aeconomic crises 3aeconomic theory 3aempirical research 3aincome 3amarkets 3aprices 3aprognosis 3atime series analysis 3aCzech Republic 0aOLSM method 0amarket relationships 0abrewering industry 0atime series 0aforecast 0aprice 0amodel1 aŠánová, P.1 aKolář, P.0 tScientia Agriculturae Bohemica.g2019 Mar. 01, v. 50, no. 1 p.64-69dSciendowJournal:23174x1805-94307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/sab-2019-00103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03059naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245008800169300002000257500001900277520196700296592002802263650001002291650000702301650001302308650001702321650002302338650001102361650001702372650001902389700005802408700001602466773013802482856008002620852000902700655001202709IND60710491820221118070956.0200910e20200810xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071049182DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c046022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYakin, Fetiye Esin10aPore Size and Porosity Dependent Zeta Potentials of Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles  ap. 19579-19587.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNPs) are synthesized in the various forms of porous structures according to an application’s needs, while their zeta potentials play a major role in their function. We show that variation in pore size and/or porosity yields a substantial decrease in MSNP zeta potential up to 25% lower than the theoretical zeta potential predictions for a flat surface at the corresponding ionic conditions in moderate pH range. By considering surface chemistry as a function of local ionic conditions (charge regulation), we calculated local zeta potentials around the MSNP which showed variation between pore openings and solid surfaces. Through a systematic study, we evaluated an average three-dimensional zeta potential for MSNPs with various conditions, based on the ratio of the area covered by pore openings to the rest of the MSNP surface area as a function of three-dimensional porosity and pore size. Results show that the high overlap of ionic layers inside the pores creates electric potentials close to zeta potential of the remaining surface, but large pore size and/or high ionic salt concentration yields divergence. We characterized the variation of MSNP zeta potential in terms of porosity (ε₃D), pore size (Dₚₒᵣₑ), and ionic condition quantified by Debye length (λ) and obtained unified behavior as a function of the nondimensional group of ε₃D(Dₚₒᵣₑ/λ). For ε₃D(Dₚₒᵣₑ/λ) < 0.01, MSNP zeta potential remains similar to flat plate predictions, but it decreases by increasing ε₃D(Dₚₒᵣₑ/λ) value. The influence of pore entrances on surface zeta potential increases nonlinearly by the increase of porosity and/or decrease of EDL overlap, similar to a change of area to volume ratio. The current findings are important for the understanding and further control of mesoporous particle transport in various promising and groundbreaking applications such as targeted drug delivery.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrugs 3apH 3aporosity 3aporous media 3asalt concentration 3asilica 3asurface area 3azeta potential1 aBarisik, Murat1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2413-19911 aSen, Tumcan0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2020 Aug. 10, v. 124, no. 36 p.19579-19587dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c046023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03533naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245014700170520192800317592002802245650003102273650001602304650001602320650000902336650002302345650001202368650003402380650001302414650001502427650000902442650001902451650003002470650001202500650001602512650002502528651001002553653004602563653000902609653002402618653002102642653002002663700001402683700001502697700001502712700001602727700001602743700001702759700001702776773009902793856009002892852000902982655001202991IND60731347120221123043230.0220124e20210630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073134712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.7366482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Ying10aGenome-wide association study reveals genomic regions and candidate genes for head size and shape in bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis)  aHead-related traits are economically important in fish because they will essentially affect fillet yields. Bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) is an important aquaculture fish, and interestingly its head has higher culinary and market values than its fillet in China. In this study, using 776 bighead carp individuals and high-throughput SNP genotyping technology, we performed genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify genomic regions and candidate genes potentially associated with head-size and head-shape traits such as head length (HL), head width (HW), head height (HH), head length/head height ratio (HL/HH), head length/head width ratio (HL/HW) and head length/body length ratio (HL/BL). The morphometrics of most of these traits were significantly correlated (P < 0.01). GWAS detected eleven significant SNPs and twelve suggestive SNPs associated with head size of bighead carp, which were mainly located on linkage group (LG) 16 and four of these SNPs were commonly shared among three head-size traits. For HL, four significant and three suggestive SNPs were on LG16. For HW, five significant and four suggestive SNPs were identified on LG3, LG16 and LG21, respectively. For HH, two significant and five suggestive SNPs were detected on LG11 and LG16. Genes involved in cell proliferation and bone development, such as cc2b, prdm1b, fndc5b, lbr, bmp8a and ATP6v1cb, were found surrounding SNPs in the QTL regions. For head shape, seventeen and six SNPs were significantly related to HL/HH and HL/HW, respectively, and underlying candidate genes were identified from genomic regions of bighead carp surrounding these SNPs, including ptch1, col9a1a, tgfbr2, hecw2a, zbtb42 and sema7a. This study shed lights on understanding genetic architecture of head size/shape traits in fish and facilitated to identify candidate genes for marker-assisted selection towards breeding bigger headed carp in future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHypophthalmichthys nobilis 3aaquaculture 3abody length 3acarp 3acell proliferation 3afillets 3agenome-wide association study 3agenomics 3agenotyping 3ahead 3alinkage groups 3amarker-assisted selection 3amarkets 3amorphometry 3askeletal development 3aChina 0aBighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) 0aGWAS 0aHead-related traits 0aBone development 0aCandidate genes1 aFu, Beide1 aYu, Xiaomu1 aChen, Geng1 aWang, Junru1 aLuo, Weiwei1 aFeng, Yizhao1 aTong, Jingou0 tAquaculture.g2021 June 30, v. 539 p.736648-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.7366483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03215naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245012000172300001600292520168300308592002801991650001502019650002202034650001202056650002702068650001302095650002402108650003102132650002602163650000902189650001302198650001102211650001302222650000702235650001802242650001302260650001702273653002102290653001102311653001402322653001502336653001802351700001802369700005802387700001602445700001702461700001702478773009102495856009002586852000902676655001202685IND60621650920221119194518.0190129e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062165092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.11.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Shuai12aA novel biochar supported CMC stabilized nano zero-valent iron composite for hexavalent chromium removal from water  ap. 686-694.  aIn this study, novel biochar supported nano-scale zero-valent iron (biochar-CMC-nZVI) stabilized by carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) was developed and used for the removal of hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI) from aqueous solution. With the stabilization of CMC, nZVI particles (about 80 nm) were effectively dispersed onto the surface of biochar, which inhibited the aggregation of nZVI and resulted in the smaller particle size of nZVI on the surface of biochar. The results showed that the specific surface area of the composite was 11.1 m2/g, lower than that of pristine biochar. The basic element composition was C, O, and Fe with a large number of oxygen-containing functional groups (−COOH, OH, and OCO) observed on the surface. Cr(VI) was reduced to Cr(III) by the composite material, mainly due to the reduction of nZVI on the biochar surface. Upon reaction with Cr(VI), CrxFe1-x(OH)3 and FexCryO4 were deposited on the surface of biochar-CMC-nZVI composite. Electrostatic attraction, reduction, and surface complexation were the dominant removal mechanisms. The results showed that the 100 mg/L Cr(VI) could be removed completely by biochar-CMC-nZVI within 18 h, at a dosage of 1.25 g/L and an initial pH of 5.6. Cr(VI) removal by biochar-CMC-nZVI was favored by lower pH. The pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the Langmuir isothermal adsorption model fitted well with the sorption kinetic and isotherm data, indicated Cr(VI) adsorption mechanism was a chemisorption based multi-layer adsorption. The present study demonstrated the promise of biochar-CMC-nZVI composite as a low-cost, “green”, and effective sorbent for removal of Cr(VI) in the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3abiochar 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3achromium 3acomposite materials 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aelemental composition 3airon 3akinetics 3amodels 3amoieties 3apH 3aparticle size 3asorbents 3asurface area 0aBiochar-CMC-nZVI 0aCr(VI) 0aReduction 0aAdsorption 0aStabilization1 aLyu, Honghong1 aTang, Jingchun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7633-17011 aSong, Benru1 aZhen, Meinan1 aLiu, Xiaomei0 tChemosphere.g2019 Feb., v. 217 p.686-694dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.11.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02368naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100003000184245007900214506007600293520108600369592002801455506003701483650002101520650001901541650001701560650001501577650001601592650001101608650001201619650002401631650001401655650001001669650001101679700003001690700003301720773011901753856007701872852000901949655001201958IND60651303020221207134457.0190711e20190122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065130302DNAL7 a10.3390/plants80200272doi7 aPMC64102442pmcid7 a306782672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChaves Lobón, Natividad 10aAutotoxicity of Diterpenes Present in Leaves of <i>Cistus ladanifer</i> L.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCistus ladanifer has been described as an allelopathic and autoallelopathic species, and the compounds that could be involved in its autotoxicity are the flavonoids and diterpenes present in the exudate of its leaves. The aim of this study was to determine which family of compounds, either phenols or terpenes, are responsible for the autoallelopathic activity quantified in C. ladanifer. These compounds were extracted from the exudate of young leaves collected in spring and separated by column chromatography into two fractions: diterpenes and flavonoids. The obtained results showed that flavonoids, at the tested concentrations, did not have a negative effect on any of the parameters quantified in the germination process of C. ladanifer seeds. On the other hand, the germination, seedling size and seedling establishment, quantified through the germination index and rate, were negatively affected by the tested diterpene solutions. In view of the obtained results, it was concluded that the compounds involved in the autoallelopathy process of C. ladanifer are diterpenes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCistus ladanifer 3achromatography 3aditerpenoids 3aflavonoids 3agermination 3aleaves 3aphenols 3aplant establishment 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3aspring1 aFerrer de la Cruz, Irene 1 aAlías Gallego, Juan  Carlos0 tPlants.g2019 Jan. 22, v. 8, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants80200273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03007naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245013400163300001600297520167000313592002801983650001502011650002702026650001202053650001002065650001002075650001302085650001402098650001402112650001402126650001202140650001802152653001002170653002302180653001502203653001802218653001402236653001402250653002702264700002002291700002702311773012402338856007802462852000902540655001202549IND60130408720221119223955.0151127e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013040872DNAL7 a10.2983/035.032.01232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRead, Kaitlyn D.10aImproving Outplanting Designs for Northern Abalone (Haliotis kamtschatkana): The Addition of Complex Substrate Increases Survival  ap. 171-180.  aHatchery-reared abalone outplanted into the wild at higher than ambient densities often experience very high levels of mortality as a result of density-dependent predation by natural predators. We conducted 2 experiments to assess the effectiveness of different methods of reducing predation on outplanted northern abalone (Haliotis kamtschatkana). During the first experiment, we removed small predators from brick-filled habitat cages that excluded large predators. The survival rates of juvenile abalone (mean shell length (SL), 22 mm) were greater in cages from which sea stars and other predators were removed periodically than in control cages. During the second experiment, we constructed 30 fenced 1 -m² outplanting plots and assigned 10 randomly to be controls and 20 to be filled with 1 of 4 complex substrates (0.3-m layer of cobbles, 0.3-m layer of boulders, 0.9-m layer of cobbles, and 0.9-m layer of boulders). We then released 30 large juvenile abalone (mean SL, 51.5 mm) into each plot. The number of live outplanted abalone remaining in the complex substrate plots was significantly greater than in the control plots during the first 6 days. Surveys of a 4-m radius around each plot showed that emigration was lower from complex substrate plots than from control plots, and fewer shell fragments were found. The addition of complex substrate to plots provided crypsis from large predators but also resulted in significantly higher densities of small predators. Outplanting lower densities of abalone into larger plots of natural high-substrate complexity might attract fewer predatory sea stars and crabs, and thus result in higher survival rates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAsteroidea 3aHaliotis kamtschatkana 3aabalone 3acages 3acrabs 3ahabitats 3ajuveniles 3apredation 3apredators 3asurveys 3asurvival rate 0acrabs 0adensity dependence 0aemigration 0apinto abalone 0apredation 0asea stars 0aHaliotis kamtschatkana1 aLessard, Joanne1 aBoulding, Elizabeth G.0 tJournal of shellfish research.g2013 Apr., v. 32, no. 1 p.171-180dNational Shellfisheries Associationx0730-80007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2983%2F035.032.01233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02999naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245007300169520155700242592002801799650002201827650002201849650002101871650002501892650002601917650002701943650001401970650001501984650001401999650001402013650001002027650001602037650001202053650001802065650002302083650002102106650001402127650002202141650001202163700001602175700001602191700002102207700001602228700001402244700002102258773012302279856008202402852000902484655001202493IND60768471720221121093151.0220225e20220211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076847172DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens110202372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChan, Renee W. Y.10aInhibition of Influenza Virus Replication by Oseltamivir Derivatives  aCharacterized by the high morbidity and mortality and seasonal surge, the influenza virus (IV) remains a major public health challenge. Oseltamivir is commonly used as a first-line antiviral. As a neuraminidase inhibitor, it attenuates the penetration of viruses through the mucus on the respiratory tract and inhibits the release of virus progeny from infected cells. However, over the years, oseltamivir-resistant strains have been detected in the IV surveillance programs. Therefore, new antivirals that circumvent the resistant strains would be of great importance. In this study, two novel secondary amine derivatives of oseltamivir CUHK326 (6f) and CUHK392 (10i), which bear heteroaryl groups of M2-S31 proton channel inhibitors, were designed, synthesized and subjected to biological evaluation using plaque assay. Influenza A virus (A/Oklahoma/447/2008, H1N1), influenza B viruses (B/HongKong/CUHK33261/2012), an oseltamivir-resistant influenza A virus (A/HongKong/CUHK71923/2009, H1N1) and an oseltamivir-resistant influenza B virus (B/HongKong/CUHK33280/2012) were included in the antiviral effect assessment compared to oseltamivir carboxylate (OC). Both novel compounds significantly reduced the plaque size of seasonal IV A and B, and performed similarly to OC at their corresponding half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC₅₀). CUHK392 (10i) functioned more effectively than CUHK326 (6f). More importantly, these compounds showed an inhibitory effect on the oseltamivir-resistant strain under 10 nM with selective index (SI) of >200.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfluenza A virus 3aInfluenza B virus 3aantiviral agents 3aantiviral properties 3abiological assessment 3aheterocyclic compounds 3ainfluenza 3amonitoring 3amorbidity 3amortality 3amucus 3aoseltamivir 3aprogeny 3apublic health 3arespiratory system 3asecondary amines 3asialidase 3avirus replication 3aviruses1 aTao, Kin P.1 aYe, Jiqing 1 aLui, Kevin K.

In general terms, the larger the instantaneous field of view (IFOV), the greater the overestimation of cloud amount – assuming that data are collected with exactly the same methodology, and processed with exactly the same algorithms. While most meteorological imagers collect data at a spatial resolution of 1km, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) offers cloud amount estimates at both 1km (the standard product) and 250m (additional, high-resolution products). However, these datasets are produced using different methodological approaches, which impacts the quality and reliability of the product. This study compared 250m data with 1km data over elevated terrain with complex orography. Results showed significant discrepancies between the datasets, with 250m data reporting mean seasonal (June–August) cloud amount 15.8% lower, than 1km dataset. This was not related to the presence of snow, or to the increased spatial resolution of the cloud mask. On the other hand, both 1km and 250m data described similar spatial variability in mean monthly cloud amount (correlation coefficients of 0.85–0.98, p<0.01).  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acloud cover 3adata collection 3alandscapes 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3asnow 0aCloud amount 0aMODIS 0aHigh resolution 0aCloud mask 0a250m mask 0a1km mask0 tAtmospheric research.g2016 Nov. 15, v. 181 p.54-62dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11823x0169-80957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2016.06.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02192naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245014200175300001400317520092500331592002801256650001501284650001201299650001101311650001801322650001901340650001201359650001801371650001501389650001101404650001601415650001101431650001101442650002201453700006801475700003401543773012601577856008201703852000901785655001201794IND60687057020221122003506.0200324e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068705702DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-019-01957-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahman, Delicia Yunita10aBiomass and phycocyanin content of heterotrophic Galdieria sulphuraria 074G under maltodextrin and granular starches–feeding conditions  ap. 51-57.  aA major disadvantage of microalgal cultivation is limited biomass yields due to the autotrophic lifestyle of most microalgal species. Heterotrophic growth on a suitable carbon source and oxygen can overcome such limitations. The red microalga Galdieria sulphuraria strain 074G grows heterotrophically on glucose and a number of other carbon sources while constitutively producing photopigments, including the blue-colored phycocyanin, a natural food colorant. Galdieria sulphuraria strain 074G grew well on maltodextrins as well as on granular starch in combination with the enzyme cocktail Stargen002. The maltodextrin cultures produced 2 mg phycocyanin per gram substrate, being slightly more than on glucose. The phycocyanin extracted from maltodextrin-grown cultures was thermostable up to 55 °C.

To be able to measure directly those storages and investigate how they evolve with time and precipitation, it is necessary to isolate the impact of the micro-topography from the infiltration. Therefore we developed a fast and cheap in-situ molding method (+/−85€/m²) that combines alginate, plaster and lacquer. It allows creating stable and impermeable artificial micro-topographies that reproduce real field situations and that can be submitted to various laboratory runoff simulations. Both the surface of a specific soil and its artificial reproduction were measured with a laser scanner in order to assess the quality of the molding method. This method is shown to be precise with a standard deviation of 0.55mm, which is also the spatial resolution of the laser scanner method. This novel molding method was applied to get ten footprints of the micro-topography of a loamy bare soil, at different levels of cumulative rainfall erosivity value (R), starting with a tilled soil, and letting it evolve with natural rain events. We studied the evolution of the bulk values of depression storage and surface detention at the interrill scale, considering that these bulk values may provide useful input to hillslope models for which the size of the single grid cell corresponds to the size of our entire molds. We related the hydraulic properties to R, assuming that R would help explain the change in hydraulic parameters of micro-topographies over time. We found a general decrease of maximum depression storage and steady state surface detention with R. We finally parametrized surface detention by an effective friction factor, using a classical equation for an equivalent laminar sheet flow. A simple model to compute the surface detention as a function of the discharge per unit width and the cumulative rainfall erosivity was proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequations 3afriction 3amodels 3aplaster 3arain 3arunoff 3asoil water storage 3asurface storage1 aChalon, Claire1 aDarboux, Frédéric,1 aJavaux, Mathieu1 aBielders, Charles0 tCatena.g2012 Apr., v. 91 p.10-20dElsevier B.V.x0341-81627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2010.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02238naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002300176245007700199300001500276520100100291592002801292650002701320650001001347650001101357650001701368650001101385650001201396650001901408650003101427650002301458700002301481773015201504856006901656856009501725990002301820852000901843655001201852IND60644625220221118035120.0190517e20190223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064462522DNAL7 a10.3791/592772doi7 aPMC65380372pmcid7 a308555632pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarasija, Shaarika10aMeasurement of oxygen consumption rates in intact Caenorhabditis elegans  ap. e59277.  aOptimal mitochondrial function is critical for healthy cellular activity, particularly in cells that have high energy demands like those in the nervous system and muscle. Consistent with this, mitochondrial dysfunction has been associated with a myriad of neurodegenerative diseases and aging in general. Caenorhabditis elegans have been a powerful model system for elucidating the many intricacies of mitochondrial function. Mitochondrial respiration is a strong indicator of mitochondrial function and recently developed respirometers offer a state-of-the-art platform to measure respiration in cells. In this protocol, we provide a technique to analyze live, intact C. elegans. This protocol spans a period of ~7 days and includes steps for (1) growing and synchronization of C. elegans, (2) preparation of compounds to be injected and hydration of probes, (3) drug loading and cartridge equilibration, (4) preparation of worm assay plate and assay run, and (5) post-experiment data analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3adrugs 3aenergy 3amitochondria 3amodels 3amuscles 3anervous system 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aoxygen consumption1 aNorman, Kenneth R.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2019 Feb. 23, , no. 144 p.e59277-e59277dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/592773Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/59277/measurement-oxygen-consumption-rates-intact-caenorhabditis  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03249naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005900147245008200206300001000288500001400298520181000312592002802122650001802150650001702168650001902185650001202204650002802216650001702244650001902261650001202280650002002292650001102312650001302323650001502336650001102351650001502362650001402377650001202391651001702403700002402420700002002444700002302464700001902487700002402506700001902530773010302549856008202652852000902734655001202743IND60572506320221118200358.0180619e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057250632DNAL7 a10.1186/s40317-017-0121-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFehlmann, Gaelle1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7981-572810aIdentification of behaviours from accelerometer data in a wild social primate  ap. 6.  aNAL-light  aBACKGROUND: The use of accelerometers in bio-logging devices has proved to be a powerful tool for the quantification of animal behaviour. While bio-logging techniques are being used on wide range of species, to date they have only been seldom used with non-human primates. This is likely due to three main factors: the long tradition of direct field observations, a difficulty of attaching bio-logging devices to wild primates and the challenge of deciphering acceleration signals in species’ with remarkable locomotor and behavioural diversity. Here, we overcome these aforementioned obstacles and provide methodology for identification of behaviours from accelerometer data of wild chacma baboons (Papio ursinus) in Cape Town, South Africa. RESULTS: We apply machine learning techniques to process complex accelerometer data, collected by bespoke tracking collars to quantify a range of behaviours (focusing on locomotion and foraging behaviour). We successfully identify six broad state behaviours that represent 93.3% of the time budget of the baboons. Resting, walking, running and foraging were all identified with high recall and precision representing the first classification of multiple behavioural states from accelerometer data for a wild primate. CONCLUSION: Our ‘end to end’ process—from collar design and build to the collection and quantification of acceleration data—provides advantages over gathering data by traditional observation, not least because it affords data collection without the presence of an observer which may affect an animal’s behaviour. Furthermore, our methodology and findings open new possibilities for the fine-scale study of movement and foraging ecology in wild primates, and in particular our baboon study population which is in conflict with people.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPapio ursinus 3aacceleration 3aaccelerometers 3aanimals 3aartificial intelligence 3abiotelemetry 3aclassification 3acollars 3adata collection 3adesign 3aforaging 3alocomotion 3apeople 3apopulation 3aprecision 3awalking 3aSouth Africa1 aO’Riain, M.Justin1 aHopkins, PhilW.1 aO’Sullivan, Jack1 aHolton, MarkD.1 aShepard, EmilyL.

(Burseraceae) is an aromatic plant. The leaves are used for beverage flavouring. Objective: This study investigates the chemical composition and biological activities of various extracts. Materials and methods: The essential oil was prepared via hydrodistillation. Identification and quantification were realized via GC-MS and GC-FID. Consecutive extractions (cyclohexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate and methanol) were carried out and various chemical groups (phenolics, flavonoids, tannins, antocyanins and sugar) were quantified. The volatile compounds of organic extracts were identified before and after derivatization. Antioxidant, antihyperuricemia, anti-Alzheimer, anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities were evaluated. Results: In the essential oil, 50 compounds were identified, including 3-carene (27.72%) and α-pinene (15.18%). 2,5-Dihydroxy acetophenone and β-d-xylopyranose were identified in the methanol extract. Higher phenolic (315.97 g GAE/kg dry mass) and flavonoid (37.19 g QE/kg dry mass) contents were observed in the methanol extract. The methanol extract has presented remarkable IC₅₀ = 6.10 mg/L for antiDPPH, 35.10 mg/L for antixanthine oxidase and 28.01 mg/L for anti-5-lipoxygenase. For acetylcholinesterase inhibition, the best IC₅₀ (76.20 and 67.10 mg/L) were observed, respectively, with an ethyl acetate extract and the essential oil. At 50 mg/L, the dichloromethane extract inhibited OVCAR-3 cell lines by 65.10%, while cyclohexane extract inhibited IGROV-1 cell lines by 92.60%. Discussion and conclusion: Biological activities were fully correlated with the chemical groups of the extracts. The ethyl acetate and methanol extracts could be considered as potential alternatives for use in dietary supplements for the prevention or treatment of diseases because of these extracts natural antioxidant, antihyperuricemic and anti-inflammatory activities.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBoswellia 3aacetophenones 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aalpha-pinene 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantineoplastic activity 3aantioxidants 3abeverages 3acarene 3acell lines 3achemical composition 3acyclohexanes 3aderivatization 3adietary supplements 3aenzyme inhibition 3aessential oils 3aethyl acetate 3aflavonoids 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahydrodistillation 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aleaves 3amethanol 3amethylene chloride 3asugars 3atannins 3avolatile compounds 0aGC-MS 0aantioxidant 0aanti-Alzheimer 0aanti-inflammatory 0aanticancer1 aGbaguidi, Fernand1 aAgbani, Pierre1 aAyedoun, Marc-Abel1 aCazaux, Sylvie1 aBouajila, Jalloul0 tPharmaceutical biology.g2017 Jan. 1, v. 55, no. 1 p.33-42dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2153x1744-51167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13880209.2016.12263563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03285naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002300138245013100161300001600292500002000308520161100328592002801939596018001967650002402147650002402171650001902195650002602214650002002240650001402260650002202274650002402296650001102320650001402331650001502345650002802360650001202388650001102400650001402411650001102425650001902436650002702455650001502482700002502497700002302522700001902545773013402564856007202698852000902770655001202779IND60626790620221122045426.0181228e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062679062DNAL7 a10.1002/etc.42522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorris, Jeffrey M.10aCopper toxicity in Bristol Bay headwaters: Part 1—Acute mortality and ambient water quality criteria in low‐hardness water  ap. 190-197.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe world‐class Alaskan Bristol Bay salmon fishery and vast deposits of copper (Cu) and other metals in the watershed warrant further investigation into the potential toxicity of Cu to salmonids under the low water‐hardness conditions that occur in the watershed. Therefore we investigated the acute toxicity of Cu to rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) in low‐hardness water (∼ 30 mg/L as CaCO₃) formulated in the laboratory and collected from the Bristol Bay watershed. The median lethal concentration (LC50) for rainbow trout exposed to Cu in low‐hardness laboratory water was 16 μg Cu/L (95% confidence intervals [CIs]: 12, 21; dissolved Cu, filtered to 0.45 μm). The LC50 values for fathead minnows exposed to Cu in low‐hardness laboratory water or site water were 29 and 79 μg Cu/L (95% CIs: 23, 35 and 58, 125; dissolved Cu), respectively. The biotic ligand model (BLM) LC50 estimates for these bioassays were 1.3 to 2.3 times higher than the actual LC50 values. We also calculated and analyzed acute Cu water quality criteria, also known as criterion maximum concentration (CMC), using hardness‐based methods and the BLM for water samples collected throughout the Bristol Bay watershed in 2007. Biotic ligand model CMCs ranged from 0.05 to 17.5 μg Cu/L and hardness‐based CMCs ranged from 2.3 to 6.1 μg Cu/L for the 65 samples analyzed. Our results show the need for site‐specific research and subsequent water quality guidelines in low‐hardness aquatic habitats.

Viral load monitoring by single-target quantitative PCRs (qPCR) is the current cornerstone for virus quantification. In this study, a metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) approach was used for the identification and load monitoring of transplantation-related DNA viruses. Methods: Longitudinal plasma samples from six patients that were qPCR-positive for cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), BK polyomavirus (BKV), adenovirus (ADV), parvovirus B19 (B19V), and torque teno-virus (TTV) were sequenced using the quantitative metagenomic Galileo Viral Panel Solution (Arc Bio, LLC, Cambridge, MA, USA) reagents and bioinformatics pipeline combination. Qualitative and quantitative performance was analysed with a focus on viral load ranges relevant for clinical decision making. Results: All pathogens identified by qPCR were also identified by mNGS. BKV, CMV, and HHV6B were additionally detected by mNGS, and could be confirmed by qPCR or auxiliary bioinformatic analysis. Viral loads determined by mNGS correlated with the qPCR results, with inter-method differences in viral load per virus ranging from 0.19 log₁₀ IU/mL for EBV to 0.90 log₁₀ copies/mL for ADV. TTV, analysed by mNGS in a semi-quantitative way, demonstrated a mean difference of 3.0 log₁₀ copies/mL. Trends over time in viral load determined by mNGS and qPCR were comparable, and clinical thresholds for initiation of treatment were equally identified by mNGS. Conclusions: The Galileo Viral Panel for quantitative mNGS performed comparably to qPCR concerning detection and viral load determination, within clinically relevant ranges of patient management algorithms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aHuman gammaherpesvirus 4 3aHuman polyomavirus 1 3abioinformatics 3ametagenomics 3apatients 3atorque 3aviral load 3aviruses1 aRusscher, Anne 1 aKraakman, Margriet E.

In particular silage has been identified as a source of different microbial toxins, which may impair animal health and productivity. The aim of the current study was to identify functional and descriptive biomarkers for the mouldy silage syndrome in dairy cattle. Such biomarkers should also serve as indicators of the beneficial effects of intervention strategies. In a field trial, a total of 87 cows from three different farms were enrolled in the study. From these animals blood samples were collected at three different time points and subjected to multiple biochemical analyses. Within this group, fine needle liver biopsies were obtained from 43 animals and subjected to biochemical analyses and targeted gene expression profiles. The measured parameters represent biomarkers of inflammation, oxidative stress, gluconeogenesis and lipids. In the affected animals, oxidative stress and a dysfunction in lipid metabolism were observed, marked by significantly decreased levels of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity, glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G6PD) concentrations and trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) and significantly increased concentrations of free cholesterol in plasma, together with a decreased activity of phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) and lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT). When a glucomannan mycotoxin absorbent was added to the daily ration for a period of 8 weeks most of these biochemical markers gradually improved to normal levels, and body condition and milk yield improved. The obtained results contribute to the understanding of the pathophysiological changes associated with multiple mycotoxin exposure in dairy cows and allow a refined assessment of intervention strategies under field conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aphosphatidylcholine-choline acyltransferase 3aglucomannans 3agluconeogenesis 3aanimal health 3afield experimentation 3aoxidative stress 3adairy cows 3abiomarkers 3ablood sampling 3afarms 3agene expression 3amycotoxins 3abody condition 3aphospholipids 3aNADP-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 3abiopsy 3alipid metabolism 3aantioxidant activity 3amilk yield 3aliver 3ainflammation 3acholesterol 3aglutathione peroxidase 3asilage 0abiomarkers 0aoxidative stress 0alipid metabolism 0agene profiles1 aFink-Gremmels, J.0 tWorld mycotoxin journal.g2014 Jan. 1, v. 7, no. 3 p.357-366dWageningen Academic PublisherswJournal:jnl4395724x1875-07967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3920/WMJ2013.15773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03881naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245013700207500001900344520204900363592002802412650002402440650001802464650001202482650001902494650002202513650001402535650002802549650001102577650001302588650001502601650001402616650002402630650001202654650002102666650002302687650002202710650001902732650001002751650001802761651002102779653002302800653001902823653001802842653002602860700003002886700002602916700006002942700001803002700001903020700002203039700001903061700001803080773008703098856008503185852000903270655001203279IND60696071220221118011724.0201104e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069607122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2020.1046712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRawat, Monika1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1223-400210aRelative contribution of plant traits and soil properties to the functioning of a temperate forest ecosystem in the Indian Himalayas  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPlant-soil interactions are a major determinant of changes in forest ecosystem processes and functioning. We conducted a trait-based study to quantify the contribution of plant traits and soil properties to above- and below-ground ecosystem properties in temperate forest in the Indian Himalayas. Nine plant traits (leaf area, specific leaf area, leaf water content, leaf dry matter content, leaf carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), leaf C/N, and leaf N/P) and eight soil properties (pH, moisture, available N, P, potassium (K), total C, N, P) were selected for determination of their contribution to major ecosystem processes (above-ground biomass C, soil organic C, soil microbial C, soil microbial N, soil microbial P, and soil respiration) in temperate forest. Among the plant traits leaf C, N, P, and leaf N/P ratio proved to be the main contributors to above-ground biomass, explaining 20–27% of variation. Leaf N, P, and leaf N/P were the main contributors to below-ground soil organic C, soil microbial C, soil microbial N, soil microbial P, and soil respiration (explaining 33% of variation). Together, the soil properties, pH, available P, total N and C explained 60% of variation in above-ground biomass, while pH and total C explained 56% of variation in soil organic C. Other soil properties (available P, total C and N) also explained much of the variation in soil microbial C (52%) and soil microbial N (67%), while soil pH explained some of variation in soil microbial N (14%). Available P, total N, and pH explained soil microbial P (81%), while soil respiration was only explained by soil total C (70%). Thus, leaf traits and soil characteristics significantly explaining variations in above- and below-ground ecosystem processes and functioning in temperate forest in the Indian Himalayas. Consequently, tree species for afforestation, restoration, and commercial forestry should be carefully selected, as they can influence the climate change mitigation potential of forest in terms of C stocks in biomass and soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaboveground biomass 3aafforestation 3acatenas 3aclimate change 3aforest ecosystems 3aleaf area 3aleaf dry matter content 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil pH 3asoil respiration 3aspecific leaf area 3atemperate forests 3atotal nitrogen 3atrees 3awater content 3aHimalayan region 0aEcosystem services 0aBiomass carbon 0aLeaf nitrogen 0aSoil microbial carbon1 aArunachalam, K.q(Kusum),1 aArunachalam, Ayyandar1 aAlatalo, Juha M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5084-850X1 aKumar, Ujjwal1 aSimon, Barbara1 aHufnagel, Levente1 aMicheli, Erika1 aPandey, Rajiv0 tCatena.g2020 Nov., v. 194 p.104671-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2020.1046713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02001naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006500147245007900212300001400291520084500305592002801150650001101178650001601189650002501205650001001230650001101240650002301251653001801274653002301292653001101315653002701326700002601353700002901379700001901408773011001427856008101537852000901618655001201627IND60610838920221116165247.0180830e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061083892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jas.2017.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMödlinger, Marianne,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7813-784610aQuantitative comparisons of the color of CuAs, CuSn, CuNi, and CuSb alloys  ap. 14-23.  aThe colors of copper alloys are of particular interest in archaeology and can be characterized quantitatively and systematically. The CIELAB color system can determine different color parameters such as a*, b*, and L* by means of a spectrophotometer that describes the surface color. Additional information such as C* and h values can be calculated from these parameters which allows one to build a set of color-composition diagrams that connects chromaticity and alloy composition. With such data it is possible to estimate the color of prehistoric metal artifacts with similar chemical composition. A better understanding of the association between metallurgical composition and color will aid the research of prehistoric metalwork because choices in production and use of metal were likely influenced by this particular quality of metal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3aarchaeology 3achemical composition 3acolor 3acopper 3aspectrophotometers 0aCopper alloys 0aColor measurements 0aCIELAB 0aPrehistoric metal work1 aKuijpers, Maikel H.G.1 aBraekmans, D.q(Dennis),1 aBerger, Daniel0 tJournal of archaeological science.g2017 Dec., v. 88 p.14-23dElsevier LtdwJournal:3403x0305-44037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2017.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02092naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002700145245005700172300001800229520092900247592002801176650001601204650001201220650001601232650002601248650002301274650001701297650001601314650000901330650002201339650001101361650002101372700002401393700002401417700002101441700002301462773011901485856008101604852000901685655001201694IND60576393220221119013825.0170804e20170721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057639322DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.7b012252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMostafa, Mohamed
A. B.10aIron(III)-Catalyzed Chlorination of Activated Arenes  ap. 7529-7537.  aA general and regioselective method for the chlorination of activated arenes has been developed. The transformation uses iron(III) triflimide as a powerful Lewis acid for the activation of N-chlorosuccinimide and the subsequent chlorination of a wide range of anisole, aniline, acetanilide, and phenol derivatives. The reaction was utilized for the late-stage mono- and dichlorination of a range of target compounds such as the natural product nitrofungin, the antibacterial agent chloroxylenol, and the herbicide chloroxynil. The facile nature of this transformation was demonstrated with the development of one-pot, tandem, iron-catalyzed dihalogenation processes allowing highly regioselective formation of different carbon–halogen bonds. The synthetic utility of the resulting dihalogenated aryl compounds as building blocks was established with the synthesis of natural products and pharmaceutically relevant targets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3aaniline 3aantibiotics 3aaromatic hydrocarbons 3achemical structure 3achlorination 3achloroxynil 3airon 3aorganic chemistry 3aphenol 3aregioselectivity1 aBowley, Rosalind M.1 aRacys, Daugirdas T.1 aHenry, Martyn C.1 aSutherland, Andrew0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2017 July 21, v. 82, no. 14 p.7529-7537dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.joc.7b012253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03748naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003900135040001800174100002100192245009000213300001800303506007600321520179100397592002802188596021802216506003702434650001702471650001602488650001602504650001002520650001702530650002402547650001402571650002102585650001802606650001502624650000702639650001402646650001702660650001902677650001702696650001102713650001402724651001002738653001302748653001502761653001202776653001902788653001402807653001702821700001802838700001902856700001702875700003102892773011602923856008603039852000903125655001203134IND60689903320221207060750.0200708e20170101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068990332DNAL7 a275951602pmid7 aPMC61304792pmcid7 a10.1080/13880209.2016.12263672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNandi, Suranjana10aAnthelmintic efficacy of Clerodendrum viscosum on fowl tapeworm Raillietina tetragona  ap. 1401-1406.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aContext: Clerodendrum viscosum Vent. (Verbenaceae) is a shrub, widely used amongst the natives of India against various diseases. Objective: Crude extract of the plant was tested in vitro on a tapeworm Raillietina tetragona Molin (Davaineidae) to evaluate its potential anthelmintic efficacy and ultrastructural changes in the parasite. Materials and methods: Parasites were exposed to different concentrations of ethanolic leaf extract (10–80 mg/mL) and praziquantel (0.0005–0.005 mg/mL) and incubated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The pH was 7.4 at 37 °C, while one set of worms was incubated only with PBS as a control. Permanent immobilization of worms was determined visually when no motility occurred on physically disturbing them. The parasites exposed to high concentrations of leaf extract and praziquantel treatments were processed for histological and electron microscopic studies, as these concentrations took the least time for paralysis and death to occur. Result: With an increase in the concentration of the leaf extract from 10 to 80 mg/mL and praziquantel from 0.0005 to 0.005 mg/mL, the time for the onset of paralysis and death was shortened. The treated parasites lost their spontaneous movement rapidly followed by death. Electron microscopic observations revealed disruptions in the tegument and parenchymal layer, accompanied by deformities in cell organelles. Discussion and conclusion: Extensive structural alterations in the tegument indicate that the plant-derived components cause permeability changes in the parasite leading to paralysis and subsequent death. These observations suggest that phytochemicals present in C. viscosum have vermifugal or vermicidal activity, and thus may be exploited as alternative chemotherapeutic agents.  aPublisher supplied data  aUGC-BSR G/R/-6.3/1285/2011-2012cUniversity Grants Commission, New Delhi, India, is gratefully acknowledged for supporting the research work to the first author through Basic Scientific Research Fellowship Program0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aClerodendrum 3aRaillietina 3aVerbenaceae 3adeath 3adrug therapy 3aelectron microscopy 3ahistology 3ain vitro studies 3aleaf extracts 3aorganelles 3apH 3aparalysis 3apermeability 3aphytochemicals 3apraziquantel 3ashrubs 3atapeworms 3aIndia 0aTegument 0avermifugal 0acestode 0aultrastructure 0amortality 0amicrotriches1 aUkil, Bidisha1 aRoy, Saptarshi1 aKundu, Suman1 aLyndem, Larisha Mawkhlieng0 tPharmaceutical biology.g2017 Jan. 1, v. 55, no. 1 p.1401-1406dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2153x1744-51167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13880209.2016.12263673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02780naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245009600163520160300259592002801862650002301890650005201913650001001965650001101975650001701986650001102003650001302014650002102027650002302048650000702071650002702078700001702105700002602122700001902148700001302167773012302180856008202303852000902385655001202394IND60768471920221121064624.0220225e20220211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076847192DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens110202382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Yixin 14aThe pH Effects on SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Spike Proteins in the Process of Binding to hACE2  aCOVID-19 has been threatening human health since the late 2019, and has a significant impact on human health and economy. Understanding SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses is important to develop effective treatments for COVID-19 and other coronavirus-caused diseases. In this work, we applied multi-scale computational approaches to study the electrostatic features of spike (S) proteins for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. From our results, we found that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have similar charge distributions and electrostatic features when binding with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). Energy pH-dependence calculations revealed that the complex structures of hACE2 and the S proteins of SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 are stable at pH values ranging from 7.5 to 9. Three independent 100 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed using NAMD to investigate the hydrogen bonds between S proteins RBD and hACE2 RBD. From MD simulations, we found that SARS-CoV-2 forms 19 pairs (average of three simulations) of hydrogen bonds with high occupancy (>50%) to hACE2, compared to 16 pairs between SARS-CoV and hACE2. Additionally, SARS-CoV viruses prefer sticking to the same hydrogen bond pairs, while SARS-CoV-2 tends to have a larger range of selections on hydrogen bonds acceptors.

Due to the rapid climate change, actual plant defence mechanisms may be less effective against increased drought stress and other related or co-occurring abiotic stresses such as salt and high temperature. Thus, genetic engineering approaches may be an important tool for improving drought tolerance in crops. This mini-review focuses on the responses to drought stress of the woody crop species Olea europaea and Citrus sp., selecting in particular five main strategies adopted by plants in response to drought stress: aquaporin (AQPs) expression, antioxidant activity, ABA signalling, and trehalose and proline accumulation. Transgenic studies on both the herbaceous Arabidopsis and woody Populus plant models showed an improvement in drought resistance with increasing expression of these drought-inducible genes. Outcomes from the present study suggest the overexpression of the gene families associated with AQPs and ABA biosynthesis, mainly involved in regulating water transport and in preventing water loss, respectively, as candidate targets for improving drought resistance; antioxidants-, trehalose- and proline-related genes remain valid candidates for resistance to a wider spectrum of abiotic stressors, including drought. However, the contribution of an increased stiffness of the modulus elasticity of leaf parenchyma cell walls to the rapid recovery of leaf water potential, delaying by this way the stress onset, is not a secondary aspect of the transgenic optimization, in particular for Olea cultivars.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aCitrus 3aOlea europaea 3aPopulus 3aantioxidant activity 3aaquaporins 3abiosynthesis 3abiotechnology 3aclimate change 3acrop yield 3acrops 3acultivars 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3agenes 3agenetically modified organisms 3aleaf water potential 3aparenchyma (plant tissue) 3aproline 3atemperature 3atrehalose 3awater stress1 aDi Iorio, Antonio,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8998-76940 tPlant biotechnology reports.g2022 June, v. 16, no. 3 p.265-282dSpringer Nature SingaporewJournal:jnl4237782x1863-54667nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11816-021-00733-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02208naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245014100170300001600311520105600327592002801383650001801411650001901429650002001448650001501468650001001483650001101493650001401504650001201518650001201530650001701542650001201559700002301571700001901594773013101613856008101744852000901825655001201834IND60549089420221119210534.0160906e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054908942DNAL7 a10.1007/s40071-016-0140-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTheodorou, John A.10aOrigin of broodstock and effects on the deformities of gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata L. 1758) in a Mediterranean commercial hatchery  ap. 275-282.  aThe use of broodstock of different origin as a method to improve fry production performance and consequently to minimize deformities was examined at industrial scale in a commercial gilthead sea bream hatchery. The outcome of fry production from three different broodstock groups (BA: broodfish (Mediterranean) with multiannual hatchery presence, BB: selected offspring originating from the BA group, and BC: broodfish of Atlantic origin) was investigated in the same rearing conditions and feeding protocol. Performance factors assessed were the survival and weaning of the larvae; the mortality rates from the “weaning until the end of the hatchery stage” of the larvae/fry; the percentage of fry without swim bladder; the percentage of fry with skeletal deformities and the feed conversion ratio. In all factors, no statistical differences among the experimental groups were detected. However, due to early rejection of the deformed individuals, benefits are expected from the decrease of the supplied amount of food and the reduced labor cost.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSparus aurata 3abreeding stock 3afeed conversion 3ahatcheries 3alabor 3alarvae 3amortality 3aprogeny 3arearing 3aswim bladder 3aweaning1 aPerdikaris, Costas1 aVenou, Barbara0 tInternational aquatic research.g2016 Sept., v. 8, no. 3 p.275-282dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:21528x2008-49357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40071-016-0140-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01291naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003400133040001800167100001800185245006700203300001300270506007600283520016700359592002800526506003700554650002500591650001900616650002200635650002500657700002400682700002000706700002000726773010600746856008000852852000900932655001200941IND4482699920221207114823.0141214e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448269992DNAL7 a227383062pmid7 aPMC34463082pmcid7 a10.1186/gb-2012-13-6-1602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlock, Tilman10aDeciphering membrane protein structures from protein sequences  ap. 2870.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCo-evolving positions within protein sequences have been used as spatial constraints to develop a computational approach for modeling membrane protein structures.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aamino acid sequences 3abioinformatics 3amembrane proteins 3aprotein conformation1 aVenkatakrishnan, AJ1 aVinothkumar, KR1 aBabu, M.

This study presents an analysis of topsoil biogeochemistry within three floodplain forest stands with different levels of human alteration. Decreasing contents of soil organic carbon (OC) and microbial biomass were observed along the gradient from natural to plantation forest. High annual variations were observed in soil N contents and in microbial biomass, while comparable spatial variations were observed within the natural forest. High ground-water levels resulted in increased accumulation of available Na⁺ and SO₄²⁻ in the natural forest soil, yet the concentrations of ions were at sub-saline levels. The increasing contents of available Mn, SO₄²⁻ or Cl⁻ had mostly positive effects on soil microbial activity across the sites, though the results indicate the existence of a certain ecological limit for soil microorganisms. Reintroduction of surface-water flooding should be considered in future forest and water management to promote the dilution of ions accumulated in soils and natural deposition of sediments rich in organic matter (OM) at the sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogeochemistry 3afloodplains 3aforest management 3aforest plantations 3aforest soils 3aforests 3agroundwater 3ahumans 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobial biomass 3asoil organic carbon 3asurface water 3atopsoil 3awater management1 aVolánek, Jiří 1 aHolík, Ladislav 1 aPecina, Václav 1 aNovotná, Jitka 1 aSlezák, Vojtěch 1 aJuřička, David 0 tForests.g2021 Feb. 26, v. 12, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f120302703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02624naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245015300172520125900325592002801584650001501612650002201627650002001649650001201669650002101681650001501702650001701717650001701734650001501751650001501766650002401781650001401805650002001819653002001839653001501859653003001874653002001904700002301924700001801947773013301965856008302098852000902181655001202190IND60690708920221120105245.0200517e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069070892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enmm.2020.1002972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ades Ligneris, Elise10aNanofibers for heavy metal ion adsorption: Correlating surface properties to adsorption performance, and strategies for ion selectivity and recovery  aThe bioaccumulation of heavy metals and their biomagnification throughout the food chain raises a concern for both the environment and human health. When compared to other water treatment techniques, adsorption offers opportunities for high yields of heavy metal ion capture without secondary pollution, in a sustainable process and at low to moderate operational and capital costs. Among adsorbent choices, nanomaterials were shown to yield outstanding capacities from their enhanced reactivity, with nanofiber adsorbents attracting interest for their stability in water, practicability and customizable surface properties. This review examines the application of nanofiber materials as adsorbents for the removal of heavy metal ions in aqueous solutions. The correlations between physical properties, test conditions, and ion removal performance of the adsorbent materials are here investigated, to provide guidance on the design of nanofiber adsorbents. The performance of nanofiber adsorbents was benchmarked to that of bulk and other nanostructured materials with varying compositions. Finally, ion removal strategy and routes to recycle nanofiber adsorbents are discussed towards the development of a circular economy in metal extraction and reuse.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aaqueous solutions 3abioaccumulation 3acapital 3acircular economy 3afood chain 3aheavy metals 3ahuman health 3ametal ions 3ananofibers 3aphysical properties 3apollution 3awater treatment 0aHeavy metal ion 0aAdsorption 0aNanostructured adsorbents 0aIon selectivity1 aDumée, Ludovic F.1 aKong, Lingxue0 tEnvironmental nanotechnology, monitoring & management.g2020 May, v. 13 p.100297-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23256x2215-15327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enmm.2020.1002973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02578naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006400146245015900210300002000369500001900389520140800408592002801816650002201844650002201866650001101888650002301899650001501922650001401937650001501951700005901966773013802025856008002163852000902243655001202252IND60710492220221118070946.0200910e20200818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071049222DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c046332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoopamootoo, Kumaran1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1441-329810aSimulations of Crystal Dissolution Using Interacting Particles: Prediction of Stress Evolution and Rates at Defects and Application to Tricalcium Silicate  ap. 19603-19615.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA kinetic Monte Carlo framework is employed to simulate dissolution at the site of screw dislocations at the nanoscale. The rate equations, which govern dissolution, combine together chemical potentials, interfacial free energy, and mechanical stresses arising from a position-dependent interaction potential. The simulations are applied to tricalcium silicate dissolution, over a range of solution saturations ranging from pure water to near-equilibrium conditions. The results predict the evolution of topography and stress field during dissolution as well as a sigmoidal relationship between dissolution rates and a solution saturation index, which is compared to experimental results from the literature. The simulations capture the experimentally observed transition between different dissolution mechanisms at a critical saturation index and link it to dissolution at terrace ledge defect sites. Additional results clarify how the critical saturation index depends on the solid–solution interfacial energy of tricalcium silicate. Best fitting of experimental results is achieved with an interfacial energy of 280–350 mJ/m², a standard state activation energy of 20–40 kJ/mol, and an apparent activation energy of 25–45 kJ/mol. With their ability to investigate chemomechanical effects, the simulations presented here can help to understand and engineer the dissolution rates of materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aactivation energy 3aenergy 3aphysical chemistry 3aprediction 3asilicates 3atopography1 aMasoero, Enrico1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1791-66400 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2020 Aug. 18, v. 124, no. 36 p.19603-19615dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c046333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02029naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245010400170300001400274520095400288592002801242650002001270650001901290650002701309650001201336650001201348650001501360650001201375650001201387700002201399700002601421700002301447700001801470700002201488773008801510856004801598852000901646655001201655IND50061787720221119100840.0130320e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006178772DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-012-2058-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSnover, Melissa L.10aAge and growth rates of Hawaiian hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata) using skeletochronology  ap. 37-46.  aThe Hawaiian hawksbill population has fewer than 20 females nesting per year; hence, there is a need to monitor this population closely and basic biological information on individual growth and age to maturity is critical. We present a skeletochronology analysis of Hawaiian hawksbills using humeri recovered from 30 dead stranded hawksbills, plus 10 dead hatchlings. Growth mark morphology shows readily distinguishable marks similar in appearance to other species, though some animals displayed more diffuse marks. Growth rates remained high (average 2.24–4.77 cm year⁻¹) from 20 to 80 cm straight carapace length (SCL). Hawksbills larger than 80 cm SCL had average growth rates of 0.3 cm year⁻¹. There were few adult turtles in the sample; however, results indicate hawksbills have faster growth rates than loggerhead or green turtles, with probable average age to maturity (at size 78.6 cm SCL) occurring between 17 and 22 years.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaretta caretta 3aChelonia mydas 3aEretmochelys imbricata 3afemales 3ahumerus 3amonitoring 3anesting 3aturtles1 aBalazs, George H.1 aMurakawa, Shawn K.

Nicolson (Araceae), commonly called Suran or Jimmikand, has high medicinal value and is used ethnomedicinally for the treatment of different gastrointestinal and inflammatory disorders. Objective: The present study evaluated the effects of extracts of Amorphophallus paeoniifolius tubers on acetic acid-induced ulcerative colitis (UC) in rats. Materials and methods: Wistar rats were orally administered methanol extract (APME) or aqueous extract (APAE) (250 and 500 mg/kg) or standard drug, prednisolone (PRDS) (4 mg/kg) for 7 days. On 6th day of treatment, UC was induced by transrectal instillation of 4% acetic acid (AA) and after 48 h colitis was assessed by measuring colitis parameters, biochemical estimations and histology of colon. Results: APME or APAE pretreatment significantly (p < .05–.001) prevented AA-induced reduction in body weight and increase in colitis parameters viz. stool consistency, colon weight/length ratio and ulcer score, area and index. Extracts treatment attenuated (p < .001) increase in alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase in serum and myeloperoxidase activity and cytokines in colon tissue due to AA administration. Extracts treatment prevented AA-induced elevation in lipid peroxidation and decline in activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase and reduced-glutathione content (p < .05–.001) along with histopathological alterations. PRDS also showed similar ameliorative effect on colitis. Discussion and conclusion: APME and APAE showed a preventive effect on UC, and ameliorated inflammation and oxidative damage in colon. The effects may be attributed to presence of phytochemicals, betulinic acid, β-sitosterol, and glucomannan. In conclusion, the tuber of Amorphophallus paeoniifolius exhibited an anticolitic effect through anti-inflammatory and antioxidant action.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAmorphophallus paeoniifolius 3aacetic acid 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aantioxidant activity 3abeta-sitosterol 3abetulinic acid 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3acatalase 3acolon 3acytokines 3adrugs 3aenzyme activity 3afeces 3aglucomannans 3ahistology 3ahistopathology 3ainflammation 3alaboratory animals 3alactate dehydrogenase 3alipid peroxidation 3amethanol 3amyeloperoxidase 3aoral administration 3aprednisolone 3arats 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atubers 3aulcerative colitis 0aSuran 0aantioxidant 0aanti-inflammatory1 aSharma, Garima1 aWanjari, Manish M.1 aKumar, Dharmendra1 aLomash, Vinay1 aJadhav, Ankush D.0 tPharmaceutical biology.g2017 Jan. 1, v. 55, no. 1 p.53-62dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2153x1744-51167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13880209.2016.12269043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03097naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245018900164300001400353520124200367592002801609650001101637650002201648650001501670650001001685650001101695650001401706650002301720650001801743650000901761650001701770650001301787650001801800650001301818650001301831650001401844650000701858650001401865650001401879650001501893653002901908653002901937653002501966653002801991653003402019653002802053700001602081700001602097700001502113700001902128700001302147700002002160700001802180700001402198700006202212773010302274856008502377852000902462655001202471IND60637938620221121165342.0200103e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063793862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2019.04.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Hao10aInsights into the oxidation of organic contaminants by iron nanoparticles encapsulated within boron and nitrogen co-doped carbon nanoshell: Catalyzed Fenton-like reaction at natural pH  ap. 77-88.  aIron nanoparticles encapsulated within boron and nitrogen co-doped carbon nanoshell (B/N-C@Fe) were synthesized through a novel and green pyrolysis process using melamine, boric acid, and ferric nitrate as the precursors. The surface morphology, structure, and composition of the B/N-C@Fe materials were thoroughly investigated. The materials were employed as novel catalysts for the activation of potassium monopersulfate triple salt (PMS) for the degradation of levofloxacin (LFX). Linear sweep voltammograms and quenching experiments were used to identify the mechanisms of PMS activation and LFX oxidation by B/N-C@Fe, where SO₄⁻ as well as HO were proved to be the main radicals for the reaction processes. This study also discussed how the fluvic acid and inorganic anions in the aqueous solutions affected the degradation of LFX and use this method to simulate the degradation in the real wastewater. The synthesized materials showed a high efficiency (85.5% of LFX was degraded), outstanding stability, and excellent reusability (77.7% of LFX was degraded in the 5th run) in the Fenton-like reaction of LFX. In view of these advantages, B/N-C@Fe have great potentials as novel strategic materials for environmental catalysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanions 3aaqueous solutions 3aboric acid 3aboron 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3afree radicals 3airon 3alevofloxacin 3amelamine 3ananoparticles 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3aoxidation 3apH 3apotassium 3apyrolysis 3awastewater 0aIron-based nanomaterials 0aPotassium monopersulfate 0aFenton-like reaction 0aAntibiotics degradation 0aGreen/sustainable remediation 0aEnvironmental catalysts1 aWu, Shikang1 aZhou, Yaoyu1 aYang, Yuan1 aZhang, Jiachao1 aLuo, Lin1 aDuan, Xiaoguang1 aWang, Shaobin1 aWang, Lei1 aTsang, Daniel C.W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6850-733X0 tEnvironment international.g2019 July, v. 128 p.77-88dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2019.04.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02079naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002500145245010600170300001800276520092000294592002801214650001301242650002301255650001301278650002001291650001801311650001301329650002201342650001301364650002401377650001101401650001101412700001901423700002001442700002201462773011901484856008101603852000901684655001201693IND60576393420171214000000.0170804e20170721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057639342DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.7b012722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaumruck, Andreas
C.10aReactions of Sulfur-Containing Organic Compounds and Peptides in 1-Ethyl-3-methyl-imidazolium Acetate  ap. 7538-7545.  aThe neat ionic liquid (IL) [C₂mim][OAc] is not just capable of dissolving thiol- and disulfide-containing compounds, but is able to chemically react with them without addition of any catalytic reagent. Through the analysis of four small organic molecules and a cysteine-containing peptide we could postulate a general reaction mechanism. Here, the imidazolium-carbenes preferentially react with the disulfide bond, but not thiol group. Moreover, the imidazole moiety was found to abstract the sulfur atom from the cysteine residue, providing an alternative way to transform Cys residues, which were artificially inserted into a peptide sequence in order to perform native chemical ligation (NCL) of two peptide fragments. Finally, the chemical reaction of [C₂mim][OAc] with a cysteine-containing biomolecules can be tuned or even suppressed through the addition of at least 30% of water to the reaction mixture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3achemical reactions 3acysteine 3adisulfide bonds 3aionic liquids 3amoieties 3aorganic chemistry 3apeptides 3areaction mechanisms 3asulfur 3athiols1 aTietze, Daniel1 aStark, Annegret1 aTietze, Alesia A.0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2017 July 21, v. 82, no. 14 p.7538-7545dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.joc.7b012723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02514naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245011500171300001600286520121200302592002801514650001601542650003001558650001801588650001101606650001101617650002401628650001601652650002501668653002901693653002301722653001801745653001601763653002301779653001601802700005701818700002201875773011601897856008202013852000902095655001202104IND60583254620221120204658.0180904e20171015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058325462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bej.2016.09.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorchain, Jérôme,12aA population balance model for bioreactors combining interdivision time distributions and micromixing concepts  ap. 135-145.  aThe present paper focuses on the development of a population balance model (PBM) accounting for microbial population dynamics in a fluctuating environment. Heterogeneity within the cell population has two origins: extrinsic/intrinsic noises (cell to cell variability due to biological processes) and external noise (due to fluctuations in the cell environment). Modelling the effects of concentration gradients on the population heterogeneity was addressed in previous works using a population balance model based on the specific growth rate. However that model was unable to predict the distribution of specific growth rates experimentally observed at steady state. Using recent experimental data, we now propose a suitable law for the probability that cells growing at a given specific rate produce daughter cells with a different growth rate. Characteristic times of substrate assimilation and mixing at the cell scale are then combined to produce a generic model for substrate uptake limited by micromixing. The simulated results compare favorably to experimental observations leading to a robust multiscale model for bioreactor dynamics combining liquid-cell mass transfer and population heterogeneity.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioreactors 3acellular microenvironment 3amass transfer 3amixing 3amodels 3apopulation dynamics 3aprobability 3aspecific growth rate 0aPopulation balance model 0aInterdivision time 0aKinetic model 0aMicromixing 0aDynamic simulation 0aBioreactors1 aPigou, Maxime1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6997-25001 aLebaz, Noureddine0 tBiochemical engineering journal.g2017 Oct. 15, v. 126 p.135-145dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12044x1369-703X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bej.2016.09.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02196naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001500154245012200169300001600291520101100307592002801318650002201346650001801368650001701386650001701403650002401420650000701444650001701451650001901468650001501487650001301502650000901515700001901524700001301543700001801556700001601574773011101590856008801701852000901789655001201798IND60085381420221116185957.0141101e20121205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008538142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2012.09.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Daojin10aProbing the influences of urea on the interaction of sinomenine with human serum albumin by steady-state fluorescence  ap. 126-131.  aThe binding of sinomenine to human serum albumin (HSA) in aqueous solution in the absence and presence of urea has been studied by fluorescence and the three-dimensional (3D) fluorescence at pH 7.40. Subdomain IIA binding site of human serum albumin (HSA) was characterized by examining the change in HSA fluorescence. The quenching rate constants and binding constants were calculated in the absence and presence of the denaturant. The results point to a static quenching mechanism operating in the complexes. However, the binding ability of sinomenine to denatured HSA is weaker than that of sinomenine to native HSA. Denaturation of HSA in the presence of urea is almost complete at [urea]⩾8.0M. Upon unfolding, two fluorescence peaks were observed. One peak was assigned to the fluorescence of Trp-214 residue in a polar environment, and the other peak was assigned to the fluorescence of tyrosine residues. Compared to the free HSA, the HSA-sinomenine complex is more stable in the presence of urea.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3abinding sites 3adenaturation 3afluorescence 3ahuman serum albumin 3apH 3aphotobiology 3aphotochemistry 3asinomenine 3atyrosine 3aurea1 aHong, Dongfeng1 aGuo, Han1 aChen, Jianjun1 aJi, Baoming0 tJournal of photochemistry and photobiology.g2012 Dec. 5, v. 117 p.126-131dElsevier B.V.x1011-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2012.09.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02509naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245007800172300001600250520134100266592002801607650001301635650002501648650001201673650001101685650001501696650001101711650002501722650001501747650001201762653001801774653001501792653001601807653002801823700001601851700002101867700002201888773009601910856008402006852000902090655001202099IND60123359420221119051459.0150325e20140704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012335942DNAL7 a10.1080/08920753.2014.9231412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoelting, Kristin10aCollaboration within the Puget Sound Marine and Nearshore Science Network  ap. 332-354.  aThis article presents results of a study intended to paint a broad picture and uncover general trends in collaboration within the Puget Sound marine and nearshore research community. Survey results showed that natural scientists dominate the network, representing 80% of all actors in the sample. Relational contingency analysis revealed high internal rates of collaboration among social scientists and among interdisciplinary scientists. The lowest rates of collaboration were observed between natural scientists and social scientists (p <.001). Cohesion metrics were examined within sub-networks of individuals working on a variety of topical focus areas. In general, sub-networks focused on human dimensions–related topics had higher fragmentation scores (lower cohesion) than sub-networks focused on ecological, biological, or physical processes. These less cohesive sub-networks are identified as areas of opportunity for strategic network interventions to support and foster new collaborations. Results of qualitative analysis highlight factors that facilitate or inhibit success of collaborative research efforts, such as leadership, incentives, and long-term adequate funding. Additionally, the degree to which a collaborative research model can be linked to “high-impact,” policy-informing research outcomes is addressed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acohesion 3acooperative research 3afunding 3ahumans 3aleadership 3amodels 3aqualitative analysis 3ascientists 3asurveys 0acollaboration 0aincentives 0aPuget Sound 0asocial network analysis1 aMoore, Beth1 aPollnac, Richard1 aChristie, Patrick0 tCoastal Management.g2014 July 4, v. 42, no. 4 p.332-354dTaylor & Francisx1521-04217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08920753.2014.9231413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03232naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100005600138245015600194300001800350500002000368520168900388592002802077596010502105596010502210650002802315650002002343650002002363650003502383650001602418650001502434650001102449650001302460650001902473650000902492650001402501650002502515651001002540700001802550700001502568773013402583856007202717852000902789655001202798IND60644713420221119090119.0190520e20190530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064471342DNAL7 a10.1002/ldr.32962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Tongxin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7679-687210aSpatial variation in the frequency and magnitude of mass movement in a semiarid, complex‐terrain agricultural watershed on the Loess Plateau of China  ap. 1095-1106.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe previous inventory datasets of mass movement typically include large‐sized mass movements (e.g., landslides), whereas small ones are often missing due to either being too small to be interpreted from remote sensing images or too time‐consuming to measure them in the field. Thus, the relative significance of different‐sized mass movement in sediment production remains unknown. In this study, first, a total of 547 recent mass movements, with a volume ranging from 0.3 to 19,000 m³, are surveyed in a small complex‐terrain watershed on the Loess Plateau of China; then, sediment contributions by mass movement of different magnitude and frequency are evaluated; furthermore, the effects of causative factors on both mass movement frequency and magnitude are examined and compared; finally, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and statistical methods are employed to assess mass movement susceptibility and erosion risk. The results showed that majority of the mass movements are very small (<10 m³). Even though a large mass movement can produce a disproportionally high amount of debris on a per event basis, small‐ and medium‐sized mass movements (<1,000 m³) are overall more important in sediment production in the watershed. The GIS‐based modeling results also demonstrate that there is significant difference in spatial variation between the susceptibility and erosion risk of mass movements. Therefore, although the mass movement susceptibility map is very useful in prioritizing hazard prevention and mitigation, it should be combined with the mass movement erosion risk map in erosion control planning and design, which has not been done in the past.  aPublisher supplied data  aIWHR‐SKL‐201707cState Key Laboratory of Simulation and Regulation of Water Cycle in River Basin  cGraduate School of the University of Minnesota and the Shanxi Bureau of Soil and Water Conservation. 3aagricultural watersheds 3adata collection 3aerosion control 3ageographic information systems 3ainventories 3alandslides 3amodels 3aplanning 3aremote sensing 3arisk 3asediments 3astatistical analysis 3aChina1 aXu, Xiangzhou1 aZhu, Axing0 tLand degradation & development.g2019 May 30, v. 30, no. 9 p.1095-1106dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54628x1085-32787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.32963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03882naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245011900204300001000323500001400333520219600347592002802543650002002571650001102591650001102602650001402613650001702627650001202644650001102656650000902667650003402676650001202710650001602722650001202738650001402750650001202764650001202776650001302788650001902801650001502820651001702835651001602852651001402868700001702882700002202899700001602921700002502937700002102962700002202983700001703005700002503022700002203047700001703069773010303086856008203189852000903271655001203280IND60572506620221118195427.0180619e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057250662DNAL7 a10.1186/s40317-017-0124-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWiig, Øystein1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0395-525110aPerformance and retention of lightweight satellite radio tags applied to the ears of polar bears (Ursus maritimus)  ap. 9.  aNAL-light  aBACKGROUND: Satellite telemetry studies provide information that is critical to the conservation and management of species affected by ecological change. Here we report on the performance and retention of two types (SPOT-227 and SPOT-305A) of ear-mounted Argos-linked satellite transmitters (i.e., platform transmitter terminal, or PTT) deployed on free-ranging polar bears in Eastern Greenland, Baffin Bay, Kane Basin, the southern Beaufort Sea, and the Chukchi Sea during 2007–2013. RESULTS: Transmissions from 142 out of 145 PTTs deployed on polar bears were received for an average of 69.3 days. The average functional longevity, defined as the number of days they transmitted while still attached to polar bears, for SPOT-227 was 56.8 days and for SPOT-305A was 48.6 days. Thirty-four of the 142 (24%) PTTs showed signs of being detached before they stopped transmitting, indicating that tag loss was an important aspect of tag failure. Furthermore, 10 of 26 (38%) bears that were re-observed following application of a PTT had a split ear pinna, suggesting that some transmitters were detached by force. All six PTTs that were still on bears upon recapture had lost the antenna, which indicates that antenna breakage was a significant contributor to PTT failure. Finally, only nine of the 142 (6%) PTTs—three of which were still attached to bears—had a final voltage reading close to the value indicating battery exhaustion. This suggests that battery exhaustion was not a major factor in tag performance. CONCLUSIONS: The average functional longevity of approximately 2 months for ear-mounted PTTs (this study) is poor compared to PTT collars fitted to adult female polar bears, which can last for several years. Early failure of the ear-mounted PTTs appeared to be caused primarily by detachment from the ear or antenna breakage. We suggest that much smaller and lighter ear-mounted transmitters are necessary to reduce the risk of tissue irritation, tissue damage, and tag detachment, and with a more robust antenna design. Our results are applicable to other tag types (e.g., iridium and VHF systems) and to research on other large mammals that cannot wear radio collars.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUrsus maritimus 3aadults 3abasins 3abatteries 3abiotelemetry 3acollars 3adesign 3aears 3aelectric potential difference 3afemales 3ainformation 3airidium 3alongevity 3amammals 3areading 3aresearch 3arisk reduction 3asatellites 3aBeaufort Sea 3aChukchi Sea 3aGreenland1 aBorn, ErikW.1 aLaidre, KristinL.1 aDietz, Rune1 aJensen, MikkelVillum1 aDurner, GeorgeM.1 aPagano, AnthonyM.1 aRegehr, Eric1 aSt. Martin, Michelle1 aAtkinson, Stephen1 aDyck, Markus0 tAnimal biotelemetry.g2017 Dec., v. 5, no. 1 p.9-9dBioMed CentralwJournal:21547x2050-33857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40317-017-0124-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02515naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002300180245007300203300001800276506007600294520126000370592002801630506003701658650002501695650001201720650001701732650002201749650001801771650002101789650001701810650001201827700002101839700002201860700002501882773012801907856007302035852000902108655001202117IND60529573420221207052423.0160717e20130205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052957342DNAL7 a10.1021/ac303787p2doi7 aPMC35650402pmcid7 a232863832pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHunter, Rebecca A.10aInaccuracies of Nitric Oxide Measurement Methods in Biological Media  ap. 1957-1963.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDespite growing reports on the biological action of nitric oxide (NO) as a function of NO payload, the validity of such work is often questionable due to the manner in which NO is measured and/or the solution composition in which NO is quantified. To highlight the importance of measurement technique for a given sample type, NO produced from a small-molecule NO donor (N-diazeniumdiolated l-proline, PROLI/NO) and a NO-releasing xerogel film were quantified in a number of physiological buffers and fluids, cell culture media, and bacterial broth by the Griess assay, a chemiluminescence analyzer, and an amperometric NO sensor. Despite widespread use, the Griess assay proved to be inaccurate for measuring NO in many of the media tested. In contrast, the chemiluminescence analyzer provided superb kinetic information in most buffers but was impractical for NO analysis in proteinaceous media. The electrochemical NO sensor enabled greater flexibility across the various media with potential for spatial resolution, albeit at lower than expected NO totals versus either the Griess assay or chemiluminescence. The results of this study highlight the importance of measurement strategy for accurate NO analysis and reporting NO-based biological activity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abioactive properties 3abuffers 3acell culture 3achemiluminescence 3aculture media 3aelectrochemistry 3anitric oxide 3aproline1 aStorm, Wesley L.1 aConeski, Peter N.1 aSchoenfisch, Mark H.0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2013 Feb. 05, v. 85, no. 3 p.1957-1963dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ac303787p3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04341naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094024002300135024003800158040001800196100001700214245014900231300001600380506007600396506003100472520223900503592002802742596004502770506003702815650002602852650003202878650001502910650002102925650001502946650001502961650002002976650003802996650002203034650001703056650001403073650001503087650001803102650000903120650000903129650002003138653001103158653001203169653000903181653003203190653001703222653001903239700002503258700001203283700002203295700001803317700001303335700001403348700001603362773010503378856008503483856011403568852000903682655001203691IND60637938720221207123244.0200103e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063793872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2019.04.0432chorus7 a10113/63793872hdl7 a10.1016/j.envint.2019.04.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Chaoqi10aEffect of antibiotic use and composting on antibiotic resistance gene abundance and resistome risks of soils receiving manure-derived amendments  ap. 233-243.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aManure-derived amendments are commonly applied to soil, raising questions about whether antibiotic use in livestock could influence the soil resistome (collective antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs)) and ultimately contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistance to humans during food production. Here, we examined the metagenomes of soils amended with raw or composted manure generated from dairy cows administered pirlimycin and cephapirin (antibiotic) or no antibiotics (control) relative to unamended soils. Initial amendment (Day 1) with manure or compost significantly increased the diversity (richness) of ARGs in soils (p < 0.01) and resulted in distinct abundances of individual ARG types. Notably, initial amendment with antibiotic-manure significantly increased the total ARG relative abundances (per 16S rRNA gene) in the soils (2.21 × unamended soils, p < 0.001). After incubating 120 days, to simulate a wait period before crop harvest, 282 ARGs reduced 4.33-fold (median) up to 307-fold while 210 ARGs increased 2.89-fold (median) up to 76-fold in the antibiotic-manure-amended soils, resulting in reduced total ARG relative abundances equivalent to those of the unamended soils. We further assembled the metagenomic data and calculated resistome risk scores, which was recently defined as a relative index comparing co-occurrence of sequences corresponding to ARGs, mobile genetic elements, and putative pathogens on the same scaffold. Initial amendment of manure significantly increased the soil resistome risk scores, especially when generated by cows administered antibiotics, while composting reduced the effects and resulted in soil resistomes more similar to the background. The risk scores of manure-amended soils reduced to levels comparable to the unamended soils after 120 days. Overall, this study provides an integrated, high-resolution examination of the effects of prior antibiotic use, composting, and a 120-day wait period on soil resistomes following manure-derived amendment, demonstrating that all three management practices have measurable effects and should be taken into consideration in the development of policy and practice for mitigating the spread of antibiotic resistance.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotic resistance genes 3acephapirin 3acomposted manure 3acomposting 3adairy cows 3afood production 3ainterspersed repetitive sequences 3aissues and policy 3ametagenomics 3apathogens 3apirlimycin 3aribosomal RNA 3arisk 3asoil 3asoil amendments 0aManure 0aCompost 0aSoil 0aAntibiotic resistance genes 0aMetagenomics 0aResistome risk1 aPankow, Christine A.1 aOh, Min1 aHeath, Lenwood S.1 aZhang, Liqing1 aDu, Pang1 aXia, Kang1 aPruden, Amy0 tEnvironment international.g2019 July, v. 128 p.233-243dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2019.04.0433Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/63793873Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aDNAL 7aarticle02101naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100003400153245009500187300001200282506002800294520083400322592002801156506003701184650000801221650001301229650001901242650002101261650001301282650002601295650001301321650001701334653002601351653001001377653001301387653001701400700002501417700002101442773013101463856008801594852000901682655001201691IND60774910120221207141256.0181029e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077491012DNAL7 a10.20961/carakatani.v30i1.118262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnindita Dwi Yogi Sapta Ratri10aEfek naungan dan cekaman air terhadap pertumbuhan dan hasil kunyit di kismantoro, wonogiri  ap. 1-6.  aResource is Open Access  aTurmeric is a medicinal plant that has largest secondary metabolites (curcumin).

Mean size of cells was not different, but the cell number and overall cell mass was 3× larger in transwell in spite of a smaller surface area. The difference between both models was the accessibility in transwells of both sides of the cells to the medium (and oxygen). Cells were counted, and their size estimated using a handheld cell counter, Scepter™, designed for blood cells, but adjusted to the larger size of adipocytes. Finally, the effect of nitric oxide was tested using spermineNONOate, a nitric oxide (NO·) donor. The product was released to cultures at a constant 1 μl/h rate for up to 3 days using osmotic Alzet™ minipumps held in wells with water and discharging their contents to the cultured cell-laden wells through a short capillary tube. A rate of 0.3 pmol/min/ml of medium did not affect the cells’ size, but 0.4 pmol/min/ml significantly increased cell mass. The methodological improvements presented here allow for more uniform cultured cell yields and a more flexible environment for control of cell size and administration of signaling agents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipocytes 3ablood cells 3acultured cells 3afibroblasts 3amodels 3anitric oxide 3aoxygen 3asurface area1 aFernández-López, José-Antonio1 aRemesar, Xavier1 aAlemany, Marià0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2013 June, v. 405, no. 16 p.5605-5610dSpringer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-013-6970-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01954naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002400112245006800136300001400204500001900218520101800237592002801255650002301283650002301306650001601329650001001345650002601355650001501381650001601396650002301412650000901435650001001444653002601454773012701480852000901607655001201616IND60716703620221118052936.0201224e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071670362DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBabu, M.B.B.

With increasing population density of E. colona from 50 to 400 plants/m², there was a significant reduction in LAI, biomass production as well as grain yield of rice due to competition from weed plants for growth factors like light, nutrients and space etc. The reduction in dry matter was to the tune of 32% with a E. colona density of 400 plants/m² as compared to pure rice crop. Though the chlorophyll content of rice decreased with increasing density of E. colona but it maintained a higher chlorophyll content than E. colona. The increasing densities of E. colona significantly decreased various yield attributes of rice with the effect being more drastic on effective tillers/m². The reduction in grain yield varied from 48 to 86% as the density of E. colona increased from 50 to 400 plants/m².  aPublisher supplied data 3aEchinochloa colona 3abiomass production 3achlorophyll 3afarms 3afield experimentation 3agovernance 3agrain yield 3apopulation density 3arice 3aweeds 0aCrop-weed competition0 tIndian journal of weed science.g2012, v. 44, no. 1 p.43-45dIndian Society of Weed SciencewJournal:2005x0974-81647nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle01740naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005400094040001800148100001800166245010400184300001400288520061900302592002800921653001100949653001600960653002200976653001600998653001401014653001701028653001901045653002001064653001701084653002001101653001801121773012801139856011401267852000901381655001201390IND60125491120221120203236.0150428e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012549112DNAL7 a10.2988/0097-0298(2008)15[75:CPRRFP]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLill, John T.10aCaterpillar-Host Plant Relationships Recorded from Plummers Island, Maryland (Insecta: Lepidoptera)  ap. 75-79.  aDuring the summers of 2004 and 2005 host plant associations of larvae of Lepidoptera were studied on Plummers Island, Maryland, with an emphasis on the family Limacodidae (slug caterpillars).

However, the nutrient content of standard databases is based on food weight. The goal of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of the United States Department of Agriculture National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference (USDA-SR) estimates of volume and the corresponding macronutrient content of the foods. The weights of 35 individual food volumes were measured (on trial) and compared to the USDA-SR-determined weight for the food volume. Macronutrient content corresponding to the trial weight and the USDA-SR weight for the food volume (USDA) were determined using the USDA-SR, and the differences were calculated. There were statistically significant differences between the USDA and trial weights for 80% of foods measured. Calorie estimates by USDA weight were significantly lower than that of trial weight for 54% of foods but were significantly greater for 26% of foods. Differences in macronutrient estimates by trial and USDA weight varied by food type. These findings suggest that nutrient databases based on food weight may not provide accurate estimates of dietary intake when assessed using food volumes. Further development of image-assisted dietary assessment methods which measure food volumes will necessitate evaluation of the accuracy of the processes used to convert weight to volume in nutrient databases.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aUSDA 3afood intake 3afoods 3anutrient content 3anutrient databanks 3anutrition assessment1 aNeuhouser, Marian L.,1 aBreymeyer, Kara1 aSchenk, Jeannette  M.0 tNutrients.g2018 July 27, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu100809733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02925naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245010400166300001800270520156600288592002801854650001601882650001301898650001601911650002001927650001201947650001201959650001901971650001401990650000902004650001002013653002502023653002002048653002602068653001602094700001902110700002802129700002502157700002702182700002002209700001902229700003402248773008402282856008002366852000902446655001202455IND60555490920221122165053.0170407e20160917xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055549092DNAL7 a10.1515/biolog-2016-01192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBartík, Martin10aRainfall interception in a disturbed montane spruce (Picea abies) stand in the West Tatra Mountains  ap. 1002-1008.  aIn our paper we deal with the changes in the rainfall interception process of a climax spruce forest in the growing season (approximately from May to October) during its die-back. Experimental data were collected at the research plot of Červenec situated in the West Tatras at an elevation of 1,420 m a.s.l. in the years from 2013 to 2015. Net precipitation was monitored at three localities in both living and dead forests: canopy gap, dripping zone at crown periphery and central zone of a crown. Gross precipitation was recorded at an open forest area (with a diameter of 1–2 tree heights). The comparison of net precipitation in the stands revealed the highest values in the dripping zone at crown periphery of the living forest due to its increase by occult (horizontal) precipitation and transport of rainfall captured in the crown to its periphery. The values in the growing season of 2014 exceeded also gross precipitation. The total interception loss (total gross – net precipitation in % of gross precipitation) the canopy gap during the monitored period was 10.1% in the living and 18.3% in the dead stand, in the dripping zone at crown periphery it was 1.7% in the living and 20.5% in the dead stand, and in the central zone of a crown it was 70.6% in the living and 59.9% in the dead stand. Forest die-back had an effect on the distribution of precipitation under canopy. The comparison of mean interception values at three localities of the living and dead stands revealed significant differences between the stands in all cases (α < 0.001).  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea abies 3aaltitude 3acanopy gaps 3adata collection 3adieback 3aforests 3agrowing season 3amountains 3arain 3atrees 0aclimax spruce forest 0aforest die-back 0arainfall interception 0aWest Tatras1 aJančo, Martin1 aStřelcovà, Katarína,1 aŠkvareninová, Jana1 aŠkvarenina, Jaroslav,1 aMikloš, Michal1 aVido, Jaroslav1 aDagsson Waldhauserová, Pavla0 tBiologia.g2016 Sept. 17, v. 71, no. 9 p.1002-1008dDe Gruyterx1336-95637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/biolog-2016-01193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02587naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245002100163300001600184506002800200520139300228592002801621506003701649650002201686650001501708650002701723650001301750650001501763650002401778650002801802650001701830650001401847650001801861653001901879653000901898653002601907653002601933773013101959856007802090852000902168655001202177IND60774392620221207052919.0180511e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077439262DNAL7 a10.19159/tutad.2949912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDAĞHAN, Hatice10aNano Fertilizers  ap. 197-203.  aResource is Open Access  aAgricultural land is decreasing day by day due to erosion, environmental pollution, unconscious irrigation and fertilization. On the other hand, it is necessary to increase agricultural production in order to meet the needs of the developing industry as well as the nutritional needs of the growing population. In the recent years, nano fertilizers have begun to be produced to obtain the highest amount and quality of production from the unit area. Previous research shows that nano fertilizers cause an increase in the use efficiency of plant nutrients, reduce soil toxicity, minimize the potential adverse effects of excessive chemical fertilizer use, and reduce fertilizer application frequency. Nano fertilizers are important in agriculture to increase crop yield and nutrient use efficiency, and to reduce excessive use ofchemical fertilizers. The most important properties of these fertilizers are that they contain one or more of macro and micronutrients, they can be applied frequently in small amounts and are environmentally friendly. However, when applied at high doses, they exhibit decreasing effects on plant growth and crop yields, similar to chemical fertilizers. In this review, the definition, importan ce, and classification of nano fertilizers, their application in plant production, advantages and disadvantages and the results obtained in this field were discussed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagricultural land 3acrop yield 3afertilizer application 3aindustry 3airrigation 3amineral fertilizers 3anutrient use efficiency 3aplant growth 3apollution 3asoil toxicity 0aNanotechnology 0asoil 0amacro nano fertilizer 0amicro nano fertilizer0 tTürkiye tarımsal araştırmalar dergisi.g2017 June, v. 4, no. 2 p.197-203dSiirt UniversitywJournal:27812x2528-858X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.19159/tutad.2949913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03953naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100005800188245012000246300001200366506007600378520238200454592002802836596004802864506003702912650002402949650001102973650002602984650001003010650001103020650001503031650001503046650001603061650002003077650002003097700002303117700002103140700002003161700002203181700002103203700002203224700002103246773011303267856008203380852000903462655001203471IND60666683620221207123557.0211015e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066668362DNAL7 a315226902pmid7 aPMC67457862pmcid7 a10.1186/s13071-019-3611-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aToor, Jaspreet1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1510-397X10aDetermining post-treatment surveillance criteria for predicting the elimination of Schistosoma mansoni transmission  ap. 437.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) has set elimination (interruption of transmission) as an end goal for schistosomiasis. However, there is currently little guidance on the monitoring and evaluation strategy required once very low prevalence levels have been reached to determine whether elimination or resurgence of the disease will occur after stopping mass drug administration (MDA) treatment. METHODS: We employ a stochastic individual-based model of Schistosoma mansoni transmission and MDA impact to determine a prevalence threshold, i.e. prevalence of infection, which can be used to determine whether elimination or resurgence will occur after stopping treatment with a given probability. Simulations are run for treatment programmes with varying probabilities of achieving elimination and for settings where adults harbour low to high burdens of infection. Prevalence is measured based on using a single Kato-Katz on two samples per individual. We calculate positive predictive values (PPV) using PPV ≥ 0.9 as a reliable measure corresponding to ≥ 90% certainty of elimination. We analyse when post-treatment surveillance should be carried out to predict elimination. We also determine the number of individuals across a single community (of 500–1000 individuals) that should be sampled to predict elimination. RESULTS: We find that a prevalence threshold of 1% by single Kato-Katz on two samples per individual is optimal for predicting elimination at two years (or later) after the last round of MDA using a sample size of 200 individuals across the entire community (from all ages). This holds regardless of whether the adults have a low or high burden of infection relative to school-aged children. CONCLUSIONS: Using a prevalence threshold of 0.5% is sufficient for surveillance six months after the last round of MDA. However, as such a low prevalence can be difficult to measure in the field using Kato-Katz, we recommend using 1% two years after the last round of MDA. Higher prevalence thresholds of 2% or 5% can be used but require waiting over four years for post-treatment surveillance. Although, for treatment programmes where elimination is highly likely, these higher thresholds could be used sooner. Additionally, switching to more sensitive diagnostic techniques, will allow for a higher prevalence threshold to be employed.  aPublisher supplied data  aOPP1184344cBill & Melinda Gates Foundation0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSchistosoma mansoni 3aadults 3adiagnostic techniques 3adrugs 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aprediction 3aprobability 3aschistosomiasis 3aschool children1 aTruscott, James E.1 aWerkman, Marleen1 aTurner, Hugo C.1 aPhillips, Anna E.1 aKing, Charles H.1 aMedley, Graham F.1 aAnderson, Roy M.0 tParasites & vectors.g2019 Dec., v. 12, no. 1 p.437-437dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-019-3611-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01426naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245008900155300001800244520046200262592002800724650001500752650002100767650001500788650001900803650002600822700001400848700001700862700001700879773013200896856007501028852000901103655001201112IND60538481420221117160509.0160815e20120314xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053848142DNAL7 a10.1021/ja210484t2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Jing10aSynthesis and Facet-Dependent Photoreactivity of BiOCl Single-Crystalline Nanosheets  ap. 4473-4476.  aBiOCl single-crystalline nanosheets with exposed {001} and {010} facets were selectively synthesized via a facile hydrothermal route.

This post-translational modification and the ADP-ribosyltransferases (also known as PARPs) responsible for its synthesis have been found to play a role in nearly all major cellular processes, including DNA repair, transcription, translation, cell signaling, and cell death. Furthermore, dysregulation of ADP-ribosylation has been linked to diseases including cancers, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders, and heart failure, leading to the development of therapeutic PARP inhibitors, many of which are currently in clinical trials. The study of this therapeutically important modification has recently been bolstered by the application of mass spectrometry-based proteomics, arguably the most powerful tool for the unbiased analysis of protein modifications. Unfortunately, progress has been hampered by the inherent challenges that stem from the physicochemical properties of ADP-ribose, which as a post-translational modification is highly charged, heterogeneous (linear or branched polymers, as well as monomers), labile, and found on a wide range of amino acid acceptors. In this Perspective, we discuss the progress that has been made in addressing these challenges, including the recent breakthroughs in proteomics techniques to identify ADP-ribosylation sites, and future developments to provide a proteome-wide view of the many cellular processes regulated by ADP-ribosylation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA repair 3aamino acids 3acell death 3aclinical trials 3aconjugated proteins 3adiabetes 3aheart failure 3amass spectrometry 3aneoplasms 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aphysicochemical properties 3apolymers 3apost-translational modification 3aproteomics 3atranslation (genetics)1 aOng, Shao-En1 aLeung, Anthony K.L.0 tMolecular cell.g2015 June 18, v. 58 p.911-924dElsevier Inc.x1097-27657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2015.06.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02648naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245010700176300001600283520131300299592002801612650002201640650000801662650002001670650001801690650001201708650002001720650001001740650002701750650000701777650002401784650005201808650001201860651001301872651001001885700002201895700002301917700002001940700002001960700002301980773010402003856008602107852000902193655001202202IND60087733720221120045233.0141102e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008773372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jviromet.2011.10.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeboosere, Nathalie10aViral elution and concentration method for detection of influenza A viruses in mud by real-time RT-PCR  ap. 148-153.  aThe role of environmental reservoirs in avian influenza virus (AIV) transmission has been investigated during AIV-associated outbreaks. To date, no method has been defined for detection of AIV from mud samples. A procedure using elution and polyethylene glycol (PEG) concentration steps was designed to detect AIV by RT-PCR from 42g of raw mud, corresponding to 30g of the solid fraction of mud. RNA was recovered with MagMAX AI/ND Viral RNA Isolation kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Three elution buffers were studied and viral recoveries higher than 29% were yielded by elution with a 10% beef extract solution (pH 7). The overall method showed that, under some conditions, virus was not detectable in PEG samples, whereas viruses were detected in the elution fractions. PCR curves were improved significantly by running the amplification reaction with a mixture containing a PCR additive for inhibitor removal, such as T4 gene 32 protein (Gp32), although PCR inhibitors from mud were removed partially from PEG samples. A theoretical detection threshold of 5×10⁵ RNA copies of H5N1 virus per 30g of solid mud could be obtained by elution. The overall method has proved successful for detecting H5N1 virus contamination of mud specimens collected during outbreak investigations of avian influenza in Cambodia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfluenza A virus 3aRNA 3aavian influenza 3abeef extracts 3abuffers 3adetection limit 3agenes 3aoutbreak investigation 3apH 3apolyethylene glycol 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aviruses 3aCambodia 3aTexas1 aHorm, Srey Viseth1 aDelobel, Alexandre1 aGachet, Jessica1 aBuchy, Philippe1 aVialette, Michèle0 tJournal of virological methods.g2012 Jan., v. 179, no. 1 p.148-153dElsevier B.V.x0166-09347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2011.10.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03295naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245019000171300001600361520176500377592002802142650002902170650001402199650001202213650001502225650001102240650001702251650001002268650000902278650001502287650003102302650001402333650001102347650001402358650001402372650000802386650000902394651001702403653001402420653001402434653002402448653001902472700001902491700001802510700001902528700002002547700002302567773007702590856008902667852000902756655001202765IND60558408020221117213218.0170105e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055840802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.10.1342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSondi, Ivan10aGeochemistry of recent aragonite-rich sediments in Mediterranean karstic marine lakes: Trace elements as pollution and palaeoredox proxies and indicators of authigenic mineral formation  ap. 786-797.  aThis study investigates the geochemical characteristics of recent shallow-water aragonite-rich sediments from the karstic marine lakes located in the pristine environment on the island of Mljet (Adriatic Sea). Different trace elements were used as authigenic mineral formation, palaeoredox and pollution indicators. The distribution and the historical record of trace elements deposition mostly depended on the sedimentological processes associated with the formation of aragonite, early diagenetic processes governed by the prevailing physico-chemical conditions and on the recent anthropogenic activity. This study demonstrated that Sr could be used as a proxy indicating authigenic formation of aragonite in a marine carbonate sedimentological environment. Distribution of the redox sensitive elements Mo, Tl, U and Cd was used to identify changes in redox conditions in the investigated lake system and to determine the geochemical cycle of these elements through environmental changes over the last 100 years. The significant enrichment of these elements and the presence of early formed nanostructured authigenic framboidal pyrite in laminated deeper parts of sediment in Malo Jezero, indicate sporadic events of oxygen-depleted euxinic conditions in the recent past. Concentrations of trace elements were in the range characteristic for non-contaminated marine carbonates. However, the increase in the concentrations of Zn, Cu, Pb, Sn, Bi in the upper-most sediment strata of Veliko Jezero indicates a low level of trace element pollution, resulting from anthropogenic inputs over the last 40 years. The presence of butyltin compounds (BuTs) in the surface sediment of Veliko Jezero additionally indicates the anthropogenic influence in the recent past.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aaragonite 3acadmium 3acarbonates 3acopper 3ageochemistry 3alakes 3alead 3amolybdenum 3aphysicochemical properties 3apollution 3apyrite 3asediments 3astrontium 3atin 3azinc 3aAdriatic Sea 0aAragonite 0aSediments 0aPalaeoredox proxies 0aTrace elements1 aMikac, Nevenka1 aVdović, Neda1 aIvanič, Maja,1 aFurdek, Martina1 aŠkapin, Srečo D.0 tChemosphere.g2017 Feb., v. 168 p.786-797dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.10.1343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02971naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245014500170300001300315520174700328592002802075650001702103650001502120650002302135650001502158650002602173650001202199650002202211650001302233700002002246700001702266700002402283700002102307700001902328700001702347773013002364856008202494852000902576655001202585IND50067120420221119125220.0220206e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006712042DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-013-1548-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRăileanu, Mălina10aTiO2-based Nanomaterials with Photocatalytic Properties for the Advanced Degradation of Xenobiotic Compounds from Water. A Literature Survey  ap. 1548.  aIn recent years, the photochemistry of nano-semiconductor particles has been one of the fastest growing research areas in the physical chemistry field. TiO₂ is considered as the most thoroughly investigated semiconductor in the literature, due to its photocatalytic activity, excellent functionality, thermal stability, and non-toxicity. It seems to be the most promising for the photocatalytic destruction of organic pollutants. The challenge for scientific materials is to find a processing method in which the crystalline phase as well as the size and morphology of TiO₂ nanocrystals can be controlled. The concept of the present paper consists of a comprehensive study regarding the level of knowledge in the synthesis of TiO₂-based nanopowders and their application in the advanced degradation of aromatic nitrocompounds. The objectives are related to: critical analysis of the synthesis techniques of the TiO₂-based nanopowders, underlining the importance of using the sol–gel method evaluation of the morphological and structural specific characterization of these techniques; and a comprehensive study of the operational parameters of the pollutant photocatalytic degradation. The relative simple sol–gel method is the most widely used, being considered as a versatile means of developing catalytic materials, as well as an important experimental tool in understanding their physical and chemical properties. In order to enhance TiO₂ photocatalysis and to extend the response into the visible domain, titanium has been doped with metals, nonmetals, and ionic components. A recent literature survey concerning some transition metals-doping (Fe, Co, and Ni) of TiO₂ nanopowders by the sol–gel method was also included.  aPublisher supplied data 3ananocrystals 3aphotolysis 3aphysical chemistry 3apollutants 3aprocessing technology 3asurveys 3athermal stability 3atitanium1 aCrișan, Maria,1 aNiţoi, Ines1 aIanculescu, Adelina1 aOancea, Petruţa1 aCrişan, Dorel1 aTodan, Ligia0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2013 June, v. 224, no. 6 p.1548-1548dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl4876x0049-69797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-013-1548-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02055naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002400112245007000136300001400206500001900220520113300239592002801372650001901400650001901419650002001438650002901458650001301487650001901500650001001519653002201529653002601551700001601577773012701593852000901720655001201729IND60716703920221118053024.0201224e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071670392DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBabu, M.B.B.

Results revealed that total dry weight of wheat was significantly lower in mixture than in monoculture. Wheat was more competitive than P. minor at high N, but less competitive at low N. A. ludoviciana, was more competitive than crop at both N levels. Wheat reduced photosynthesis of weeds to a greater extent as compared to pure weed population. A. ludoviciana exhibited higher values of Pₙ as compared to P. minor at both N levels in both stand (monoculture and mixture) types.

Amending the field-contaminated soil using 0.5 wt.% CMC-CAP and 0.1 wt.% CaO was most effective in immobilizing the four metals, which decreased the leachabilities by 98.2%, 98.3%, 96.3%, and 96.2% for Pb, Zn, Cu, and Cd, respectively, after 1 day of treatment. The acid-leached metals fluctuated in the first 60 days, and then approached to steady state after 180 days, where the acid-leachable concentrations all met the regulation levels, and the immobilization was further consolidated when further aged for 365 days. Column elution tests showed that the soil amendment lowered the peak metal concentrations by > 92.5%, and the total eluted masses by >71.9%. Sequential extraction revealed that the soil amendment converted the exchangeable fractions to the much less available Fe-Mn oxides bound and residual forms, and thus, lowered the risk levels to “low risk” for all the metals. The immobilization of the metals was facilitated through formation of stable metal (chloro)phosphates, surface complexation, and/or ion exchange reactions. Combined CMC-CAP and CaO may serve as an effective formulation for simultaneous and long-term immobilization of multiple heavy metals in acidic soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid soils 3acalcium oxide 3aion exchange 3arisk 3asoil amendments 0aHeavy metal 0aMetal contamination 0aContaminant immobilization 0aSoil remediation 0aGroundwater quality1 aGong, Yanyan1 aZhao, Dongye1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7153-29421 aDang, Zhi1 aLin, Zhang0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Apr. 05, v. 407 p.124786-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1247863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02635naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245008200173300001600255520122000271592002801491650001801519650001501537650001901552650001701571650001701588650003101605650001201636650001001648650001801658650002101676650001701697650002001714650001101734653001701745653001801762653003601780653001101816653001301827700001901840700002101859700002201880700002201902773013401924856008602058852000902144655001202153IND60552866420221120115559.0161021e20150320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055286642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2015.01.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiyazaki, Jumpei10aCytotoxicity and behavior of polystyrene latex nanoparticles to budding yeast  ap. 287-293.  aThe cytotoxicity and behavior of positively charged amine-modified polystyrene latex nanoparticles (NPs) toward budding yeast cells were examined in different environments. The yeast cells, dispersed in either 27.8mM glucose or low-ionic strength aqueous electrolyte solution, were covered with NPs regardless of the ionic species or diameter of the NPs. The NPs that adhered to the cell surface showed high toxicity. The cell viability following NP exposure increased with the NaCl concentration independently of the glucose concentration in the dispersion medium. Therefore, the strong electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged yeast cells and positively charged NPs resulted in NP adhesion to the cell surface and subsequent cell death. However, the amount of endocytosis-like NPs inside the cell, dispersed in the hypertonic solution, was lower than that in the isotonic solution. These results indicate that the osmotic pressure affects the uptake of NPs rather than the cell viability. In contrast, NPs dispersed in a high-ionic strength electrolyte solution with a diameter of ∼100nm or less were absorbed by the yeast cells. NPs incorporated in the living yeast cells showed little toxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell adhesion 3acell death 3acell viability 3acytotoxicity 3aelectrolytes 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aglucose 3alatex 3ananoparticles 3aosmotic pressure 3apolystyrenes 3asodium chloride 3ayeasts 0aCytotoxicity 0aBudding yeast 0aPolystyrene latex nanoparticles 0aUptake 0aAdhesion1 aKuriyama, Yuta1 aTokumoto, Hayato1 aKonishi, Yasuhiro1 aNomura, Toshiyuki0 tColloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects.g2015 Mar. 20, v. 469 p.287-293dElsevier B.V.x0927-77577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2015.01.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02940naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100006900187245013200256300001800388506007600406520154000482592002802022506003702050650001302087650001102100650004402111650002202155650001302177650001202190650002002202700006602222700005302288773013602341856008002477852000902557655001202566IND60645121820221207093153.0190523e20190429xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064512182DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.9b038122doi7 aPMC70125362pmcid7 a310342302pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShcherbakov, Alexander A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5728-717510aHigh-Sensitivity Detection of Nanometer ¹H–¹⁹F Distances for Protein Structure Determination by ¹H-Detected Fast MAS NMR  ap. 4387-4391.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aProtein structure determination by solid-state NMR requires the measurement of many interatomic distances through dipole–dipole couplings. To obtain multiple long-range distance restraints rapidly and with high sensitivity, here we demonstrate a new ¹H-detected fast magic-angle-spinning NMR technique that yields many long distances in a two-dimensional (2D)-resolved fashion. The distances are measured up to ∼15 Å, with an accuracy of better than 10%, between ¹H and ¹⁹F, two nuclear spins that have the highest gyromagnetic ratios. Exogenous fluorines are sparsely introduced into the aromatic residues of the protein, which is perdeuterated and back-exchanged to give amide protons. This ¹H–¹⁹F distance experiment, termed 2D heteronuclear single-quantum coherence rotational-echo double-resonance (HSQC-REDOR), is demonstrated on the singly fluorinated model protein, GB1. We extracted 33 distances between 5-¹⁹F-Trp43 and backbone amide protons, using 2D spectral series that were measured in less than 3 days. Combining these ¹H–¹⁹F distance restraints with ¹³C–¹⁹F distances and chemical shifts, we calculated a GB1 structure with a backbone root-mean-square deviation of 1.73 Å from the high-resolution structure. This ¹H-detected ¹H–¹⁹F distance technique promises to provide a highly efficient tool for constraining the three-dimensional structures of proteins and protein–ligand complexes, with not only precise and fast measurements but also access to truly long-range distances.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3afluorine 3amodels 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aprotein structure 3aproteins 3aprotons 3astable isotopes1 aMandala, Venkata Shiva1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6358-06421 aHong, Mei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5255-58580 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Apr. 29, v. 123, no. 20 p.4387-4391dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.9b038123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02212naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245007700166520114200243592002801385650001601413650003001429650002001459650002701479650001601506650001801522653003201540653001701572653003801589653001401627653002401641700001201665773009401677856008201771852000901853655001201862IND60725306720221119064151.0210223e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072530672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2020.1064372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xueliang10aAntecedents of adolescent students’ ICT self-efficacy: The ICT dataset  aBased on the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2015 dataset, the information and communication technology (ICT) dataset focuses specifically on ICT-related constructs in the context of educational technology. It includes a wide range of student-level variables collected from 30 Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, which pertain to students’ motivational and behavioural characteristics in relation to their ICT self-efficacy. In total, it comprises 201, 652 students from 7708 schools. As technology has become an integral component of education, the ICT dataset can serve as a handy resource for studying ICT-related constructs. Besides, the ICT dataset holds advantages over the original PISA dataset for its intensive focus and easy readability. With this important resource, researchers can undertake their own research in the neighbouring fields of ICT, developing their own theories or validating existing theoretical frameworks and statements. The focus of this study is to identify the antecedents of adolescent students’ ICT self-efficacy and illuminate potential mechanisms at work.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescents 3acommunications technology 3adata collection 3aeducational technology 3areadability 3aself-efficacy 0aComputer-mediated education 0aICT literacy 0aInteractive learning environments 0aPISA 2015 0aSecondary education1 aHu, Jie0 tData in Brief.g2020 Dec., v. 33 p.106437-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23203x2352-34097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2020.1064373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03695naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245015500169300002000324520177700344592002802121650002702149650002002176650001802196650002402214650001402238650002102252650001602273650001902289650001102308650002202319650001502341650001402356650003002370650000902400650001702409650001802426650001402444650001702458650001402475650000902489650002802498650001302526650001302539650002102552653002502573653001902598653001702617700001502634700001602649700001502665700001702680700001802697700005702715700005702772773014602829856008502975852000903060655001203069IND60677659320221116232207.0191202e20191104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067765932DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b043652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Xiujuan10aToxicity Evaluation of One-Dimensional Nanoparticles Using Caenorhabditis elegans: A Comparative Study of Halloysite Nanotubes and Chitin Nanocrystals  ap. 18965-18975.  aIn this study, the toxicity of two one-dimensional (1D) nanoparticles, halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) and chitin whiskers (ChNCs), was investigated in detail. Both in vitro and in vivo models were applied to evaluate the toxicity by cell viability staining, apoptosis assay, and reactive oxygen species generation. Particularly, the toxicity of HNTs and ChNCs was compared using an in vivo model Caenorhabditis elegans; their toxicity was assessed using the in vitro models, mouse bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (mBMSCs) and rat osteosarcoma cells (UMR-106). In vitro, both HNTs and ChNCs exhibited low toxicity at concentrations lower than 50 μg/mL, but HNTs showed higher toxicity than ChNCs at higher concentrations such as 200 μg/mL. Cell viabilities of mBMSCs and UMR-106 were 73.4 and 77.1% at the HNT concentration of 200 μg/mL, while these were 96.2 and 99.8% at the ChNC concentration of 200 μg/mL, respectively. In vivo, HNTs exhibited a side effect on the C. elegans reproduction but did not influence the lifespan and other phenotypes, which suggested that HNTs had no long-term toxicity effects. While ChNCs did not result in obvious alterations in the phenotype of worms below the concentration of 2.5 mg/mL, the brood size of C. elegans decreased at ChNC concentrations of 10 and 50 mg/mL. Moreover, ChNCs had the side effect on the development of C. elegans at the high level. However, ChNC exposure at the concentrations of 10 and 50 mg/mL induced the longer fast movement periods and extended lifespan of C. elegans. It demonstrated that both HNTs and ChNCs had good biocompatibility below the concentration of 2.5 mg/mL. The toxicity studies of these two 1D nanoparticles contributed to their great significance for various biomedical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3aadverse effects 3aanimal models 3aanimal reproduction 3aapoptosis 3abiocompatibility 3abone marrow 3acell viability 3achitin 3acomparative study 3ahalloysite 3alongevity 3amesenchymal stromal cells 3amice 3ananocrystals 3ananoparticles 3ananotubes 3aosteosarcoma 3aphenotype 3arats 3areactive oxygen species 3astaining 3atoxicity 3atoxicity testing 0ahalloysite nanotubes 0achitin whisker 0ananotoxicity1 aWan, Qinli1 aFu, Xiaodie1 aMeng, Xiao1 aOu, Xianfeng1 aZhong, Ruowei1 aZhou, Qinghua1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0468-92661 aLiu, Mingxian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5466-30240 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2019 Nov. 04, v. 7, no. 23 p.18965-18975dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b043653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03208naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002300184245011200207506007600319520147900395592002801874506003701902650001701939650001401956650001901970650002601989650002002015650001802035650001002053650001302063650001602076650000902092650001902101650001902120650002002139650000902159650001702168650001602185650003502201650001802236650001202254650002102266700003002287700002402317700001702341700002502358700002802383700002602411773011902437856007702556852000902633655001202642IND60660486720221207105610.0190823e20190725xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066048672DNAL7 a10.3390/genes100805622doi7 aPMC67229162pmcid7 a313496932pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLekklar, Chakkree 10aComparative Genomic Analysis of Rice with Contrasting Photosynthesis and Grain Production under Salt Stress  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aUnfavourable environmental conditions, including soil salinity, lead to decreased rice (Oryza sativa L.) productivity, especially at the reproductive stage. In this study, we examined 30 rice varieties, which revealed significant differences in the photosynthetic performance responses under salt stress conditions during the reproductive stage, which ultimately affected yield components after recovery. In rice with a correlation between net photosynthetic rate (P<inf>N</inf>) and intercellular CO<inf>2</inf> concentration (C<inf>i</inf>) under salt stress, P<inf>N</inf> was found to be negatively correlated with filled grain number after recovery. Applying stringent criteria, we identified 130,317 SNPs and 15,396 InDels between two &ldquo;high-yield rice&rdquo; varieties and two &ldquo;low-yield rice&rdquo; varieties with contrasting photosynthesis and grain yield characteristics. A total of 2089 genes containing high- and moderate-impact SNPs or InDels were evaluated by gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis, resulting in over-represented terms in the apoptotic process and kinase activity. Among these genes, 262 were highly expressed in reproductive tissues, and most were annotated as receptor-like protein kinases. These findings highlight the importance of variations in signaling components in the genome and these loci can serve as potential genes in rice breeding to produce a variety with salt avoidance that leads to increased yield in saline soil.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOryza sativa 3aapoptosis 3acarbon dioxide 3aenvironmental factors 3aenzyme activity 3agene ontology 3agenes 3agenomics 3agrain yield 3aloci 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant breeding 3aprotein kinases 3arice 3asaline soils 3asalt stress 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3asoil salinity 3atissues 3ayield components1 aSuriya-arunroj, Duangjai 1 aPongpanich, Monnat 1 aComai, Luca 1 aKositsup, Boonthida 1 aChadchawan, Supachitra 1 aBuaboocha, Teerapong 0 tGenes.g2019 July 25, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes100805623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02173naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002700142245011200169300001600281520103800297592002801335650001301363650001101376650001201387650001501399650001601414650001001430650001501440650002001455650001101475651001201486700002501498700001801523700002301541700002001564773011601584856007801700852000901778655001201787IND60219822620221120115700.0160303e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6021982262DNAL7 a10.1656/058.014.02072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcEachern, Michelle A.10aBrumation of Introduced Black and White Tegus, Tupinambis merianae (Squamata: Teiidae), in Southern Florida  ap. 319-328.  aAn established population of Tupinambis merianae (Black and White Tegu) in southeastern Florida threatens the Everglades ecosystem. Understanding the behavioral ecology of Black and White Tegus could aid in management and control plans. Black and White Tegus are seasonally active and brumate during the winter in their native range, but brumation behavior is largely unstudied in either the native or the invasive range. We describe the first observations of Black and White Tegu brumation in southeastern Florida after monitoring 5 free-ranging, adult male Black and White Tegus through an inactive season using radiotelemetry and automated cameras. Duration of brumation averaged 137 days, beginning in September and ending by February. One of the 5 Black and White Tegus emerged to bask regularly during brumation, which to our knowledge represents the first documented instance of a free-ranging Black and White Tegu basking during brumation. These preliminary findings provide a basis for future research of brumation behavior.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSquamata 3aadults 3acameras 3aecosystems 3ahibernation 3amales 3amonitoring 3aradio telemetry 3awinter 3aFlorida1 aAdams, Amy A.

To assess the physical, chemical and biological properties of NAM were used biotesting by the Spirotox-method, direct and indirect optical methods (microscopy, laser diffraction), infrared spectroscopy, pH-metry. The results of the study showed an increase in biological activity, expressed in changes in the energy of activation of cell transition to the “dead cell” state on the example of biosensor Spirostomum ambiguum. Also we indicated an increase in the rate of the chemical process of dissolution of mechanoactivated molecular crystals of nicotinamide (NAM) expressed in the values of the first order rate constant. Mechanical activation at a high rate of NAM substance powder deformation has led to changes in physical, chemical and biological properties of the drug, which can be used in medicine to increase efficiency and reduce doses of pharmacotherapy.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abioactive properties 3abiosensors 3adeformation 3adrug therapy 3adrugs 3aenergy 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3amedicine 3amicroscopy 3aneoplasms 3anicotinamide 3aphotoaging 0anicotinamide (nam) 0abasal cell carcinoma (bcc) 0amechanical activation (ma) 0alaser diffraction 0aspirotox method1 aTatyana, Pleteneva1 aAnton, Syroeshkin1 aIlaha, Kasymova1 aNataliya, Zakharova0 tBIO web of conferences.g2020, v. 22 p.01005-dEDP ScienceswJournal:27810x2117-44587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1051/bioconf/202022010053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02664naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245009900166300001800265520133500283592002801618650001601646650002001662650001001682650003501692650001601727650002101743650001801764650001601782650001001798650001401808653003801822653001601860653002701876653002401903700001401927700001901941700001701960700002101977700001601998700001902014773008402033856008002117852000902197655001202206IND60555491020221123044755.0170407e20160917xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055549102DNAL7 a10.1515/biolog-2016-01202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeng, Lai-Sheng10aASL16 gene, a member of AS2/LOB family, is essential for lateral root formation in Arabidopsis  ap. 1009-1016.  aASYMMETRIC LEAVES2-LIKE16 gene of Arabidopsis is a member of the ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2 (AS2)/LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES (LOB) domain gene family. Current reports have indicated that overexpression of ASL16 induces lateral root formation in the absence of ARF7 and ARF19; whereas lateral root formation is severely reduced in the arf 7 and arf 19 double knockout mutants. Antisense mRNA has testified to be a useful tool to inhibit the expression of specific genes in plants; more significantly, it is specific in the sense that only the mRNA level of the desired protein being changed, while other members of the gene family remain unaffected. To further explore ASL16 function in lateral root growth and development, we introduced an antisense-expression construct of the ASL16 gene to Arabidopsis (Col-0); and acquired some 35S:ASL16 Arabidopsis plants. With 11 day after germination (DAG), many lateral roots in wild-type seedlings were well developed, whereas a few lateral roots in these antisense 35S:ASL16 seedlings were produced. However, with 5, 8 and 16 DAG, the lateral roots in these transgenic seedlings were not distinct with those of wild-type plants. A series of data indicate that primary root formation of these antisense 35S:ASL16 plants was not affected; whereas their lateral root formation was severely inhibited.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3agene expression 3agenes 3agenetically modified organisms 3agermination 3aknockout mutants 3amessenger RNA 3aroot growth 3aroots 3aseedlings 0aASYMMERTIC LEAVES2-LIKE16 (ASL16) 0aArabidopsis 0alateral root formation 0aantisense 35S:ASL161 aBizhu, He1 aCao, Xiao-Ying1 aYang, Xu-Qin1 aSong, Jiang-Ping1 aWang, Yi-Bo1 aJiang, Ji-Hong0 tBiologia.g2016 Sept. 17, v. 71, no. 9 p.1009-1016dDe Gruyterx1336-95637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/biolog-2016-01203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03562naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100002600146245017300172300001600345520195600361592002802317650001202345650003002357650002102387650002302408650002402431650001702455650002202472650001102494650000802505650001702513650001602530650001202546650001302558650001202571650001202583650000902595650001902604650001402623650001102637650002802648650001002676650001602686650002402702650001002726650001302736650001302749700002002762700002802782773010702810856008202917852000902999655001203008IND4460194220221119164308.0141111e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446019422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jspr.2011.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuthisut, Duangsamorn10aFumigant toxicity of essential oils from three Thai plants (Zingiberaceae) and their major compounds against Sitophilus zeamais, Tribolium castaneum and two parasitoids  ap. 222-230.  aFumigant toxicity of essential oils from rhizomes of Alpinia conchigera, Zingiber zerumbet, Curcuma zedoaria and their major compounds; camphene, camphor, 1,8-cineole, Î±-humulene, isoborneol, Î±-pinene, Î²-pinene and terpinen-4-ol was investigated with adults of Sitophilus zeamais, Tribolium castaneum, Anisopteromalus calandrae and Trichogramma deion larvae. The last two insects are parasitoids commonly used to control stored-product weevils and moths. The trial was evaluated at 0, 37, 74, 148, 296, 444, 593Â Î¼L/L in air after 12, 24 and 48Â h for S.Â zeamais, T.Â castaneum and A.Â calandrae, and 24Â h for T.Â deion. Alpinia conchigera oils were toxic to S.Â zeamais, T.Â castaneum and T.Â deion, while the other two plant oils had low toxicity. Adults of S.Â zeamais and T.Â castaneum were more susceptible to A.Â conchigera oils than their eggs, larvae or pupae. Sitophilus zeamais adults (LCââ 85Â Î¼L/L in air) were slightly more tolerant of A.Â conchigera oils than T.Â castaneum (LCââ 73Â Î¼L/L in air) after 48Â h exposure. Synthetic essential oils, a mixture of pure compounds in the same ratios of the extracted essential oils, were tested with S.Â zeamais and T.Â castaneum adults. Synthetic essential oils were more toxic than the extracted essential oils to both insects. Zingiber zerumbet oils (LCââ 26Â Î¼L/L in air) and C.Â zedoaria oils (LCââ 25Â Î¼L/L in air) were significantly more toxic to adults of A.Â calandrae than A.Â conchigera oils (LCââ 37Â Î¼L/L in air) whereas T.Â deion larvae were more sensitive to A.Â conchigera oils (LCââ 62Â Î¼L/L in air) than Z.Â zerumbet and C.Â zedoaria oils (LCââÂ >Â 593Â Î¼L/L in air).

Depending on the context, biofilms are beneficial or detrimental to macroorganisms. Two groups of decapod crustaceans, sand fiddler crabs (Uca pugilator) and blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus), were investigated to test whether externally secreted enzymes were present and if they were used to remove or prevent biofilm formation in the environment and on their surfaces. Three hydrolytic enzymes were of interest because of their ability to degrade biofilm components: amylase, trypsin and lysozyme. The role of these enzymes was investigated in two contexts, removal of biofilms from the environment for food detection and processing and prevention of biofilm formation on the macroorganism surface itself. To test this, enzyme activity was measured on feeding appendages of fiddler crabs, which feed on biofilms, and on egg masses externally brooded by blue crabs. All three enzyme activities were found on feeding appendages of fiddler crabs and in egg masses of blue crabs. For the context of removal of biofilms from the environment, the combined data of the enzymes present in fiddler crab saliva and the high diatom extraction efficiency (60–90% removal in less than 9s), suggests a role in separation of organic content from sand particles. Secondly, the data of enzymes present on fiddler crab legs (the main location of their chemoreceptors) and that leg exposure to a human amylase inhibitor significantly decreased fiddler crab feeding responses, suggests a role of the enzymes on fiddler crab legs in generating phagostimulants. For the context of prevention of microfouling, it was found that the same enzymes are present in blue crab egg mass fluids and that the activity levels increase as the eggs mature, particularly amylase, which increased dramatically in clutches with late stage embryos. These findings of enzymes present in egg mass fluid throughout maturation inform a large body of work on pheromones and hatching cues for blue crabs. Detachment of brooded eggs and incubation with enzymes at levels found in egg masses resulted in survival and hatching while detachment without addition resulted in death. These findings suggest that the same suite of enzymes is important to biochemically manage biofilms in two ecologically relevant contexts. Biochemical management of biofilms may be more prevalent in macroorganisms than previously thought.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aCallinectes sapidus 3aUca 3aamylases 3aappendages 3abiofilm 3achemoreceptors 3acrabs 3adeath 3aegg masses 3aeggs 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme inhibitors 3ahatching 3ahumans 3alegs 3alysozyme 3amicroorganisms 3aphagostimulants 3apheromones 3asaliva 3asand 3atrypsin 0aBiofilm 0aMicrofouling 0aDecapod crustaceans 0aEnzymes 0aChemical ecology 0aFouling management1 aWepprich, Anna1 aThompson, Ali1 aRittschof, Dan0 tJournal of experimental marine biology and ecology.g2016 June, v. 479 p.106-113dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11705x0022-09817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2016.03.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02959naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245016300163500001400326520138800340592002801728650001801756650002001774650001701794650001001811650002401821650001001845650002801855650000701883650001501890650001601905650001201921650002301933650001401956650004401970650003402014700002202048700002802070700002602098700002002124700002202144700001902166700002002185700002402205700002002229773011902249856007602368852000902444655001202453IND60715246120221119080307.0201026e20201016xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071524612DNAL7 a10.3390/foods91014802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastrica, Marta 10aImpact of Dietary Supplementation with Goji Berries (Lycium barbarum) on Microbiological Quality, Physico-Chemical, and Sensory Characteristics of Rabbit Meat  aNAL-light  aForty-two New Zealand White rabbits (n = 21/group) were fed with two different diets: a commercial diet (control group) and a diet supplemented with goji berries (3% w/w). After slaughtering, the effect of dietary supplementation on microbiological, physico-chemical, and sensory characteristics of the rabbit loins, packed in an oxygen-permeable package, was evaluated at 6 h post mortem (day 0), after 4 and 10 days of refrigerated storage. No relevant results were obtained for pH and total volatile basic Nitrogen (TVBN) values but with regards to the color, some significant differences were observed between the groups. The goji berries (GBs) dietary supplementation had positive effects by reducing thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) values in all the observations (p < 0.001). Moreover, microbiological results showed that the supplementation had a significant impact on Lactobacillus spp. (p < 0.001) prevalence, indeed the goji group had higher means on day 0 (p < 0.05) and on day 4 (p < 0.001) than the control group. Lastly, with regards to the consumer’s test, the tasters assigned a higher score to GBs rabbit meatballs and the purchase interest increased when the rabbit diet was known. Overall, these results indicate that the goji berries inclusion in the rabbit diet could represent a valuable strategy to improve quality and sensory traits of meat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus 3aLycium barbarum 3acold storage 3acolor 3adietary supplements 3aloins 3amicrobiological quality 3apH 3aprevalence 3arabbit meat 3arabbits 3asensory properties 3aslaughter 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 3atotal volatile basic nitrogen1 aMenchetti, Laura 1 aBalzaretti, Claudia  M.1 aBranciari, Raffaella 1 aRanucci, David 1 aCotozzolo, Elisa 1 aVigo, Daniele 1 aCurone, Giulio 1 aBrecchia, Gabriele 1 aMiraglia, Dino 0 tFoods.g2020 Oct. 16, v. 9, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods91014803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03118naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245017300158300001600331520181600347592002802163650002402191650002602215650001402241650001502255650001402270650001802284650002502302650001402327650003302341650002202374650001002396650001602406650001802422651001202440700001802452700002502470700001802495773010102513856007302614852000902687655001202696IND60477632620221122064423.0151231e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047763262DNAL7 a10.1111/jvs.123262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeßel, Carola10aRelationship between species diversity, biomass and light transmittance in temperate semi‐natural grasslands: is productivity enhanced by complementary light capture?  ap. 144-155.  aQUESTION: A positive plant diversity–above‐ground productivity relationship is often demonstrated in synthetic grassland stands established for functional biodiversity research, but this relationship is rarely found along diversity gradients in natural and semi‐natural grasslands. One of the key mechanisms proposed to cause a positive species diversity–above‐ground productivity relationship is increased complementarity in resource use. Using light transmittance to the ground as a measure of resource use intensity in semi‐natural grasslands, we tested the hypothesis that peak above‐ground biomass (as a proxy for productivity) increases and light transmittance decreases with increasing species richness, which would reflect higher complementarity in light capture. LOCATION: Semi‐natural temperate grasslands in Lower Saxony, Germany. METHODS: We investigated 31 grasslands with variable species richness on three different geological substrates (greywacke, limestone and sandstone) at two spatial scales (sub‐regional and regional). RESULTS: Structural equation modelling (SEM) and generalized linear models (GLM) revealed that species richness (5–22 species · 0.09 m⁻²) was negatively related to above‐ground biomass (AGB; 200–1350 g·m⁻²) and sward cover. The most influential determinant of AGB at the regional scale was temperature. Light transmittance was determined by sward cover, the cover of competitive species and AGB at the regional, and in part also at the sub‐regional level. We found no evidence for increased light capture complementarity with higher species richness. CONCLUSION: This suggests that competitive exclusion, but not complementarity in above‐ground resource use, mediates above‐ground productivity in species‐rich plant assemblages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaboveground biomass 3acompetitive exclusion 3aequations 3agrasslands 3alimestone 3alinear models 3aprimary productivity 3asandstone 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aspecies diversity 3asward 3atemperature 3atransmittance 3aGermany1 aMeier, Ina C.1 aLeuschner, Christoph1 aGoslee, Sarah0 tJournal of vegetation science.g2016 Jan., v. 27, no. 1 p.144-155dOpulus Pressx1100-92337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jvs.123263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03269naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002200184245014600206506007600352520144800428592002801876506003701904650002101941650001501962650002701977650002402004650001702028650004202045650001702087650001502104650001702119650001302136700002202149700002802171700002402199700002402223700002802247700002202275700002102297700002702318700002302345700002302368700002802391700002202419700002802441700002002469700002102489773011902510856007702629852000902706655001202715IND60660486820221207105607.0190823e20190819xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066048682DNAL7 a10.3390/genes100806252doi7 aPMC67233602pmcid7 a314310022pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchibler, Manuel 10aViral Sequences Detection by High-Throughput Sequencing in Cerebrospinal Fluid of Individuals with and without Central Nervous System Disease  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMeningitis, encephalitis, and myelitis are various forms of acute central nervous system (CNS) inflammation, which can coexist and lead to serious sequelae. Known aetiologies include infections and immune-mediated processes. Despite advances in clinical microbiology over the past decades, the cause of acute CNS inflammation remains unknown in approximately 50% of cases. High-throughput sequencing was performed to search for viral sequences in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples collected from 26 patients considered to have acute CNS inflammation of unknown origin, and 10 patients with defined causes of CNS diseases. In order to better grasp the clinical significance of viral sequence data obtained in CSF, 30 patients without CNS disease who had a lumbar puncture performed during elective spinal anaesthesia were also analysed. One case of human astrovirus (HAstV)-MLB2-related meningitis and disseminated infection was identified. No other viral sequences that can easily be linked to CNS inflammation were detected. Viral sequences obtained in all patient groups are discussed. While some of them reflect harmless viral infections, others result from reagent or sample contamination, as well as index hopping. Altogether, this study highlights the potential of high-throughput sequencing in identifying previously unknown viral neuropathogens, as well as the interpretation issues related to its application in clinical microbiology.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHuman astrovirus 3aanesthesia 3acentral nervous system 3acerebrospinal fluid 3aencephalitis 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ainflammation 3ameningitis 3amicrobiology 3apatients1 aBrito, Francisco 1 aZanella, Marie-Céline 1 aZdobnov, Evgeny  M.1 aLaubscher, Florian 1 aL’Huillier, Arnaud  G1 aAmbrosioni, Juan 1 aWagner, Noémie 1 aPosfay-Barbe, Klara  M1 aDocquier, Mylène 1 aSchiffer, Eduardo 1 aSavoldelli, Georges  L.1 aFournier, Roxane 1 aLenggenhager, Lauriane 1 aCordey, Samuel 1 aKaiser, Laurent 0 tGenes.g2019 Aug. 19, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes100806253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02317naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002500142245013600167300001600303520124400319592002801563650002101591650002301612650000901635650001401644650002101658650002301679650001301702650001401715700002301729700002401752773011601776856007801892852000901970655001201979IND60219822920221120115710.0160303e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6021982292DNAL7 a10.1656/058.014.02082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStephens, Jessica D.10aDistinctions in Pitcher Morphology and Prey Capture of the Okefenokee Variety within the Carnivorous Plant Species Sarracenia minor  ap. 254-266.  aMorphological differences in trapping mechanisms of carnivorous plants may be a response to selection pressure to reduce competition among species and even conspecifics. However, few studies have investigated whether variation in plant morphology is related to prey capture. Here, we measured height, peristome width, and outer-trichome density in pitchers of Sarracenia minor (Hooded Pitcher Plant) and its variety, S. minor var. okefenokeensis (S. m. var. okefenokeensis). In addition, we compared arthropod-prey contents of pitchers between the typical short form and the tall Okefenokee variety and across seasons and sampling locations. Similar to findings in previous studies, we found that S. minor was an ant specialist with no influence of season or location. In contrast, S. m. var. okefenokeensis had a more generalist diet, and prey content varied across season and location. Pitchers of S. m. var. okefenokeensis were also significantly larger in height and peristome width with fewer outer trichomes than S. minor. Overall, differences in pitcher morphology appear to be correlated with prey contents. These results have important implications for our understanding of the evolution and diversification of carnivorous plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSarracenia minor 3acarnivorous plants 3adiet 3aevolution 3aplant morphology 3aselection response 3atrapping 3atrichomes1 aGodwin, Rebecca L.1 aFolkerts, Debbie R.0 tSoutheastern naturalist.g2015 June, v. 14, no. 2 p.254-266dHumboldt Field Research Institutex1528-70927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1656%2F058.014.02083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02911naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001800181245005800199506007600257520142200333592002801755506003701783650002501820650001601845650001401861650002401875650001301899650000901912650001901921650002401940650002801964650001301992650001802005650001702023650003102040650002702071650001702098650001402115700002102129700002002150700002202170700002002192773012202212856007402334852000902408655001202417IND60650333920221207083214.0190709e20180727xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065033392DNAL7 a10.3390/nu100809752doi7 aPMC61157942pmcid7 a300604742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTana, Claudio10aUric Acid and Cognitive Function in Older Individuals  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHyperuricemia has been recognized as an independent cardiovascular risk factor in epidemiological studies. However, uric acid can also exert beneficial functions due to its antioxidant properties, which may be particularly relevant in the context of neurodegenerative diseases. In this paper, we critically revise the evidence on the relationship between serum uric acid levels and cognitive function in older individuals, focusing on the etiology of cognitive impairment (Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, Parkinson&rsquo;s dementia, and vascular dementia) and on the interactive connections between uric acid, dementia, and diet. Despite high heterogeneity in the existing studies, due to different characteristics of studied populations and methods of cognitive dysfunction assessment, we conclude that serum uric acid may modulate cognitive function in a different way according to the etiology of dementia. Current studies indeed demonstrate that uric acid may exert neuroprotective actions in Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease and Parkinson&rsquo;s dementia, with hypouricemia representing a risk factor for a quicker disease progression and a possible marker of malnutrition. Conversely, high serum uric acid may negatively influence the disease course in vascular dementia. Further studies are needed to clarify the physio-pathological role of uric acid in different dementia types, and its clinical-prognostic significance.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantioxidant activity 3ablood serum 3acognition 3acognitive disorders 3adementia 3adiet 3adisease course 3adisease progression 3aepidemiological studies 3aetiology 3ahyperuricemia 3amalnutrition 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aneuroprotective effect 3arisk factors 3auric acid1 aTicinesi, Andrea1 aPrati, Beatrice1 aNouvenne, Antonio1 aMeschi, Tiziana0 tNutrients.g2018 July 27, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu100809753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02199naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245006900173506002800242520113600270592002801406506003701434650001101471650002801482650001401510650002001524650001301544650001701557700002201574700002301596700002201619700002001641773009601661856008301757852000901840655001201849IND60740039720221207062133.0200302s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074003972DNAL7 a10.1051/bioconf/202017002282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNezhmetdinova, F.T.10aDigital economy and transformation of personnel training for AIC  aResource is Open Access  aThe article presents the results of research into the impact of the digital economy and Industry 4.0 on the education system as a global mechanism and on the tangible segment of the sectoral economy – agriculture. The aim of this study is to determine the main directions of education system transformation both structurally and substantively under the influence of the digital economy and Industry 4.0. According to the results obtained, Russia’s entry into the digital world system is hindered by a number of factors, including the lag of the Russian Federation from world’s major economies in breakthrough technologies, the shortage of staff with specialization in “Industry 4.0” and the level of digital culture development. The development of agro-industrial complex’s digital economy, provided by modern technologies, including robotics and artificial intelligence, entail high productivity, increased efficiency, safety and convenience. But on the other hand, it also raises complex questions about the broader impact of digitalization on the labor market in the agro-industrial complex, skills and competencies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRussia 3aartificial intelligence 3aeducation 3ahuman resources 3aindustry 3alabor market1 aFassakhova, G.

As a result, there has been intense study of the mechanisms that regulate both the differentiation and bone resorbing function of osteoclast cells. Calcium (Ca²⁺) signaling appears to play a critical role in the differentiation and functions of osteoclasts. Cytoplasmic Ca²⁺ oscillations occur during RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis. Ca²⁺ oscillations provide a digital Ca²⁺ signal that induces osteoclasts to up-regulate and autoamplify nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1), a Ca²⁺/calcineurin-dependent master regulator of osteoclastogenesis. Here we review previous studies on Ca²⁺ signaling in osteoclasts as well as recent breakthroughs in understanding the basis of RANKL-induced Ca²⁺ oscillations, and we discuss possible molecular players in this specialized Ca²⁺ response that appears pivotal for normal bone function.

Herein, we report a template-free and valid approach to prepare a ferrous ion (Fe²⁺) anchored onto the surface of the MoO₃ nanosheet (Fe²⁺/MoO₃) through coordination interaction between Fe²⁺ and hydroxyl groups of MoO₃. The resulting Fe²⁺/MoO₃ shows the peroxidase-like activity, and it can be utilized for catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) to generate hydroxyl radicals (•OH) that oxidize various chromogenic substrates, generating distinct color change and strong ultraviolet–visible absorption. The Fe²⁺/MoO₃ peroxidase mimic exhibits a good thermal stability and works well at a high reaction temperature (95 °C) and has higher affinity for substrates than for natural horseradish peroxidase. Theoretical calculation results imply that the strong electrostatic field from the polarization charges between Fe²⁺ and the MoO₃ nanosheet improves the reaction activity, which boosts the generation of •OH from H₂O₂. Using the Fe²⁺/MoO₃ peroxidase mimic-involved chromogenic system, we construct visual colorimetric assays for H₂O₂ and triacetone triperoxide (TATP) explosives, which realize the visual detection of H₂O₂ and TATP at concentrations of 40 and 60 μM, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acatalytic activity 3acolor 3acolorimetry 3aexplosives 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydroxyl radicals 3airon 3amoieties 3amolybdenum 3ananosheets 3aperoxidase 3atemperature 3athermal stability 0aFe2+ catalyst 0aartificial peroxidase 0avisual detection 0atriacetone triperoxide 0aMoO3 nanosheet1 aXie, Zhenyang1 aZhang, Hongping1 aLi, Hua1 aCai, Yanhua1 aWang, Jinhu1 aDu, Jiayan1 aYu, Haili1 aHe, Yi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9324-33050 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2019 Oct. 31, v. 7, no. 23 p.18985-18991dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b044623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03904naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100003200144245011300176520235400289592002802643650003002671650002502701650001802726650001502744650002102759650002402780650001502804650001602819650001302835650002202848650001302870650002002883650002402903650001902927650001302946650001602959650001302975700003302988700003003021700003003051700003403081700002503115700002903140700003203169773012103201856007903322852000903401655001203410IND60787865820221121015326.0220811e20220730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078786582DNAL7 a10.3390/plants111519842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález-García, Yolanda 10aSeed Priming with Carbon Nanomaterials Improves the Bioactive Compounds of Tomato Plants under Saline Stress  aThe consumption of food with a high content of bioactive compounds is correlated with the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases. Tomato is a food with exceptional nutraceutical value; however, saline stress severely affects the yield, the quality of fruits, and the agricultural productivity of this crop. Recent studies have shown that seed priming can mitigate or alleviate the negative effects caused by this type of stress. However, the use of carbon nanomaterials (CNMs) in this technique has not been tested for this purpose. In the present study, the effects of tomato seed priming with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene (GP) (50, 250, and 500 mg L⁻¹) and two controls (not sonicated and sonicated) were evaluated based on the content of photosynthetic pigments in the leaves; the physicochemical parameters of the fruits; and the presence of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant compounds, carotenoids, and stress biomarkers such as hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the leaves and fruits of tomato plants without saline stress and with saline stress (50 mM NaCl). The results show that saline stress in combination with CNTs and GP increased the content of chlorophylls (9.1–21.7%), ascorbic acid (19.5%), glutathione (≈13%), proteins (9.9–11.9%), and phenols (14.2%) on the leaves. The addition of CNTs and GP increased the activity of enzymes (CAT, APX, GPX, and PAL). Likewise, there was also a slight increase in the content of H₂O₂ (by 20.5%) and MDA (3.7%) in the leaves. Salinity affected the quality of tomato fruits. The physico-chemical parameters and bioactive compounds in both the stressed and non-stressed tomato plants were modified with the addition of CNTs and GP. Higher contents of total soluble solids (25.9%), phenols (up to 144.85%), flavonoids (up to 37.63%), ascorbic acid (≈28%), and lycopene (12.4–36.2%) were observed. The addition of carbon nanomaterials by seed priming in tomato plants subjected to saline stress modifies the content of bioactive compounds in tomato fruits and improves the antioxidant defense system, suggesting possible protection of the plant from the negative impacts of stress by salinity. However, analysis of the mechanism of action of CNMs through seed priming, in greater depth is suggested, perhaps with the use of omics sciences.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural productivity 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbic acid 3abiomarkers 3acarbon nanotubes 3adietary supplements 3aflavonoids 3aglutathione 3agraphene 3ahydrogen peroxide 3alycopene 3amalondialdehyde 3amechanism of action 3aphotosynthesis 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3atomatoes1 aLópez-Vargas, Elsy Rubisela1 aPérez-Álvarez, Marissa 1 aCadenas-Pliego, Gregorio 1 aBenavides Mendoza, Adalberto,1 aValdes-Reyna, Jesus,1 aPérez-Labrada, Fabián 1 aJuárez-Maldonado, Antonio 0 tPlants.g2022 July 30, v. 11, no. 15dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants111519843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03193naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245012500163520176600288592002802054650002402082650002102106650002502127650001702152650001302169650002502182650001402207650001302221650001402234650001402248650002102262650001302283650002702296651001202323700002002335700002302355700001902378700003102397700002202428700002102450700002102471700002302492773012002515856007902635852000902714655001202723IND60766912520221119085429.0220211e20220129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076691252DNAL7 a10.3390/plants110303812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarkat, Hamza 10aAssessment of Biochemical Composition and Antioxidant Properties of Algerian Date Palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) Seed Oil  aDate palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) trees are largely cultivated across the Algerian oases; they are principal sources of remuneration and the economic basis for residents of these areas. Date palm fruits are rich sources of essential nutrients, vitamins, minerals, and dietary fibers, with many potential health benefits, yet there are few studies on the chemical composition and biological properties of date palm seed oil. In this study, we present an in-depth characterization of the biochemical composition and antioxidant properties of date palm seed oil (DPSO) produced in Algeria. DPSOs of eight Algerian cultivars, Arechti, Degla-Baida, Deglet-Nour, Ghars, Haloua, Itima, Mech-Degla, and Tentbouchet, were investigated to determine their biochemical compositions and antioxidant properties. The results highlight the potential of DPSO as an alternative food and a natural resource, thanks to several important compounds having high antioxidant capacity. In particular, fatty acids and triacylglycerol (TAGs) analyses showed that oleic (42.74–50.19%), lauric (18.40–22.2%), and myristic (8.83–10.17%) were the major fatty acids, while 1-myristoyl 2-oleoyl 3-linoleoyl glycerol, 1-linolenoyl 2-oleoyl 3-linoleoyl glycerol, 1-2-linolenoyl 3-linoleoyl glycerol, and 1-linolenoyl 2-myristoyl 3-linoleoyl glycerol were the major TAGs. Biophenols and tocopherols analyses revealed the presence of important compounds, such as catechin (22.04–24.92 mg/kg), vanillin (10.67–23.98 mg/kg), and α-tocopherol (443.59 mg/kg), at high remarkable levels. Therefore, a comparison with the literature data concerning other seed oils, including olive oil, confirms that DPSO can be considered a high-quality oil, from a biochemical and biological point of view.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhoenix dactylifera 3aalpha-tocopherol 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acatechin 3achemical composition 3acultivars 3aglycerol 3aolive oil 3aseed oils 3atriacylglycerols 3avanillin 3awages and remuneration 3aAlgeria1 aBousba, Ratiba 1 aBenincasa, Cinzia 1 aAtrouz, Kamel 1 aGültekin-Özgüven, Mine 1 aAltuntaş, Ümit 1 aDemircan, Evren 1 aZahran, Hamdy A.1 aÖzçelik, Beraat 0 tPlants.g2022 Jan. 29, v. 11, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants110303813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02354naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245018800175500002200363520119300385592002801578653004801606653003201654653001601686653003001702653002501732653001501757700002001772700001401792700001401806700001301820773009001833856008401923852000902007655001202016IND60561503220221122220832.0170628s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056150322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phclin.2016.12.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNoblot-Rossignol, M.10aConciliation des traitements médicamenteux à l’admission : expérimentation en établissement de santé mentale et éligibilité des patients pouvant en bénéficier en priorité  aPre-press version  aSetting up a Medication Reconciliation system without extra staffing requires efficiency, notably by defining patient selection criteria.An experimental observational single-center study was conducted in a mental health facility to determine eligibility criteria so that reconciliation could be implemented in priority for patients at highest drug-related iatrogenic risk and to enable efficient implementation of the reconciliation process. Potentially relevant general, somatic and psychiatric criteria (n=6, 14 and 15, respectively) were identified and studied.One or more medication errors were detected in 32 of the 200 patients in whom reconciliation was performed at admission. Thirty-nine of the 53 medication errors were corrected by the physician. A patient interview was carried out in 75 % of cases. Criteria significantly related to risk of medication error were: female gender, admission for agitation/aggressiveness, depressive state, manifest delusional state, alcohol abuse, Quebec score>4, high blood pressure or thyroid dysfunction, and classification as “long-term disease”. No psychiatric criteria were significantly associated with risk of medication error.  aPublisher supplied data 0aConciliation des traitements médicamenteux 0aCritères d’éligibilité 0aPsychiatrie 0aMedication reconciliation 0aEligibility criteria 0aPsychiatry1 aVailleau, J.-L.1 aHamad, M.1 aDenis, F.1 aBeye, F.0 tLe Pharmacien Hospitalier et Clinicien.g2017, dElsevier Masson SASx2211-10427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phclin.2016.12.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01998naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245010700171300001600278520073000294592002801024650002101052650001801073650001201091650001501103650001401118650001801132650002601150653002101176653001801197653002301215653003201238653004501270700002001315700001901335773016401354856008501518852000901603655001201612IND60567069820221117051254.0190312e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056706982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijpara.2017.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalleret, Benoit14aThe unhealthy attraction of Plasmodium vivax to reticulocytes expressing transferrin receptor 1 (CD71)  ap. 379-383.  aThe majority of malaria parasite species prefer to invade reticulocytes, the most infamous being Plasmodium vivax. While the absence of an in vitro continuous culture method has hampered the study of P. vivax invasion biology, studies utilising primate models and ex vivo assays have provided some important insights. Most importantly, P. vivax merozoites have a strong preference for a subset of immature erythrocytes characterised by the expression of the transferrin receptor (CD71). This current opinion piece on P. vivax merozoite invasion highlights important gaps in our understanding of how this parasite recognises and enters reticulocytes, and discusses some recent conceptual advances in P. vivax invasion biology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlasmodium vivax 3aanimal models 3amalaria 3amerozoites 3aparasites 3areticulocytes 3atransferrin receptors 0aPlasmodium vivax 0aReticulocytes 0aMerozoite invasion 0aTransferrin receptor (CD71) 0aDuffy Antigen Chemokine Receptor (CD234)1 aRénia, Laurent1 aRussell, Bruce0 tInternational journal for parasitology.g2017 June, v. 47, no. 7 p.379-383dElsevier LtdaAustralian Society for ParasitologywJournal:jnl1441x0020-75197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpara.2017.03.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02571naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003300139245015100172520132800323592002801651650002301679650005201702650001601754650001701770650002301787650001401810650001101824650001801835650002401853650002701877650006201904650001201966700002601978773012202004856007402126852000902200655001202209IND60754421420221121055211.0211023e20211002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075442142DNAL7 a10.3390/v131019832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlves Ferreira-Bravo, Irani 10aXeno-Nucleic Acid (XNA) 2’-Fluoro-Arabino Nucleic Acid (FANA) Aptamers to the Receptor-Binding Domain of SARS-CoV-2 S Protein Block ACE2 Binding  aThe causative agent of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, gains access to cells through interactions of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) on the viral S protein with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the surface of human host cells. Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) was used to generate aptamers (nucleic acids selected for high binding affinity to a target) to the RBD made from 2ʹ-fluoro-arabinonucleic acid (FANA). The best selected ~79 nucleotide aptamers bound the RBD (Arg319-Phe541) and the larger S1 domain (Val16-Arg685) of the 1272 amino acid S protein with equilibrium dissociation constants (KD,ₐₚₚ) of ~10–20 nM, and binding half-life for the RBD, S1 domain, and full trimeric S protein of 53 ± 18, 76 ± 5, and 127 ± 7 min, respectively. Aptamers inhibited the binding of the RBD to ACE2 in an ELISA assay. Inhibition, on a per weight basis, was similar to neutralizing antibodies that were specific for RBD. Aptamers demonstrated high specificity, binding with about 10-fold lower affinity to the related S1 domain from the original SARS virus, which also binds to ACE2. Overall, FANA aptamers show affinities comparable to previous DNA aptamers to RBD and S1 protein and directly block receptor interactions while using an alternative Xeno-nucleic acid (XNA) platform.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aamino acids 3adissociation 3aetiological agents 3ahalf life 3ahumans 3anucleic acids 3anucleotide aptamers 3apeptidyl-dipeptidase A 3asystematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment 3aviruses1 aDeStefano, Jeffrey J.0 tViruses.g2021 Oct. 02, v. 13, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v131019833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03340naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002300184245006700207506007600274520168700350592002802037506003702065650000802102650001902110650001602129650002702145650001002172650001302182650001202195650002502207650002202232700001902254700002302273700002602296700002402322700002502346700001802371700003402389700002102423700002102444700002602465700001702491700002302508700002602531700001902557700001702576773011902593856007702712852000902789655001202798IND60660487020221207111114.0190823e20190820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066048702DNAL7 a10.3390/genes100806272doi7 aPMC67230202pmcid7 a314342892pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeakin, Janine E.,10aChromosomics: Bridging the Gap between Genomes and Chromosomes  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe recent advances in DNA sequencing technology are enabling a rapid increase in the number of genomes being sequenced. However, many fundamental questions in genome biology remain unanswered, because sequence data alone is unable to provide insight into how the genome is organised into chromosomes, the position and interaction of those chromosomes in the cell, and how chromosomes and their interactions with each other change in response to environmental stimuli or over time. The intimate relationship between DNA sequence and chromosome structure and function highlights the need to integrate genomic and cytogenetic data to more comprehensively understand the role genome architecture plays in genome plasticity. We propose adoption of the term &lsquo;chromosomics&rsquo; as an approach encompassing genome sequencing, cytogenetics and cell biology, and present examples of where chromosomics has already led to novel discoveries, such as the sex-determining gene in eutherian mammals. More importantly, we look to the future and the questions that could be answered as we enter into the chromosomics revolution, such as the role of chromosome rearrangements in speciation and the role more rapidly evolving regions of the genome, like centromeres, play in genome plasticity. However, for chromosomics to reach its full potential, we need to address several challenges, particularly the training of a new generation of cytogeneticists, and the commitment to a closer union among the research areas of genomics, cytogenetics, cell biology and bioinformatics. Overcoming these challenges will lead to ground-breaking discoveries in understanding genome evolution and function.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3abioinformatics 3acentromeres 3achromosome aberrations 3agenes 3agenomics 3amammals 3anucleotide sequences 3asequence analysis1 aPotter, Sally 1 aO’Neill, Rachel 1 aRuiz-Herrera, Aurora 1 aCioffi, Marcelo  B.1 aEldridge, Mark  D.B.1 aFukui, Kichi 1 aGraves, Jennifer A.

Premature loss of centromeric cohesion disrupts orderly mitotic progression. Shugoshin (Sgo1) binds to and protects cohesin at inner centromeres. The kinetochore kinase Bub1 phosphorylates histone H2A at T120 (H2A-pT120) and recruits Sgo1 to kinetochores, 0.5 μm from inner centromeres. Here, we show that Sgo1 is a direct reader of the H2A-pT120 mark. Bub1 also recruits RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to unattached kinetochores and promotes active transcription at mitotic kinetochores. Mitosis-specific inactivation of Pol II traps Sgo1 at kinetochores and weakens centromeric cohesion. Sgo1 interacts with Pol II in human cells and with RNA in vitro. We propose that Pol II-dependent transcription enables kinetochore-bound Sgo1 initially recruited by H2A-pT120 to reach cohesin embedded in centromeric chromatin. Our study implicates mitotic transcription in targeting regulatory factors to highly compacted mitotic chromatin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aRNA 3achromatids 3achromatin 3achromosome segregation 3acohesion 3ahistones 3ahumans 3akinetochores 3ametaphase 3amitosis1 aQu, Qianhui1 aWarrington, Ross1 aRice, Allyson1 aCheng, Ningyan1 aYu, Hongtao0 tMolecular cell.g2015 Aug. 06, v. 59 p.426-436dElsevier Inc.x1097-27657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2015.06.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01908naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245007500172300001600247520051400263536011800777592002800895596001600923650001700939650001400956650002600970650001500996650001301011650003001024650001901054650002001073650001301093653002001106653002601126653001801152700001501170700002001185700001901205700001401224773014101238856008601379852000901465655001201474IND60754916020221118042408.0220730e20210902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075491602DNAL7 a10.1080/10286020.2020.17999872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Xiang-Wei12aA new indolizinium alkaloid from marine-derived Streptomyces sp.

Subjects were recruited from the University Dental Clinic of CEU Cardenal Herrera University (Moncada, Valencia). Information on alcohol and tobacco consumption was obtained by questionnaire. Individual stimulated saliva samples from 105 patients were obtained and selective media was used to isolate and quantify mutans streptococci and Candida spp. colony forming units per millilitre of saliva (CFU ml⁻¹). Samples were stratified by duration and quantity of alcohol and tobacco consumption. Alcohol consumption statistically significantly decreased oral carriage of mutans streptococci, whereas there was no effect on Candida albicans colonization levels. Tobacco users were found to harbour elevated levels of C. albicans; however, there was no observed effect on bacterial colonization by mutans streptococci. The carriage of other species investigated, such as Candida krusei, Candida tropicalis and lactobacilli, do not show a response to the consumption of the stimulants analysed. Microbial colonization of the oral cavity changes in a species‐specific manner in response to dietary and social habits such as drinking alcohol and smoking. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: In this paper, we evaluate the effect of alcohol and tobacco consumption on key species of the oral microflora. Our results show species‐specific changes in two major opportunistic pathogens, such as Candida albicans and mutans streptococci, whereas other members of oral microflora are not affected by the consumption of the stimulants studied. We believe this original paper will contribute to raise awareness among the dental community towards a more personalized oral health assessment, taking in consideration alcohol and tobacco consumption in the prevention of specific oral and systemic pathologies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida albicans 3aCandida krusei 3aCandida tropicalis 3aLactobacillus 3aalcohol drinking 3aalcohols 3abacterial colonization 3ahealth effects assessments 3amicroorganisms 3amouth 3apatients 3aquestionnaires 3asaliva 3asecondary infection 3aselective media 3atobacco1 aMakda, K.1 aDilmahomed, Z.1 aGonzález, R.1 aLuzi, A.1 aJovani‐Sancho, M. del M.1 aVeses, V.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2016 Oct., v. 63, no. 4 p.254-259dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0266-82547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/lam.126203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03366naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100006100138245005500199300001600254500002000270520178200290592002802072596003502100596006002135596006102195596003502256596002802291596002402319650001402343650001502357650001002372650001402382650002402396650002302420650001502443650000902458650001102467650002302478650001602501651001602517651001102533651001602544700002402560700002402584700002102608700001902629773011902648856007202767852000902839655001202848IND60644711920221119085721.0190520e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064471192DNAL7 a10.1002/aqc.30532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFinucci, Brittany1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1315-294614aThe extinction risk of New Zealand chondrichthyans  ap. 783-797.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe national extinction risk of 103 New Zealand chondrichthyans (sharks, rays, and chimaeras), ~10% of the global chondrichthyan fauna, was evaluated for the first time using the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species Categories and Criteria. Across 32 families, 103 species were assessed. New Zealand holds a high degree of species endemism (20%) with deepwater species dominating the fauna (77%). Sharks were the most speciose group with 68 species (66%), followed by 24 rays (23%), and 11 chimaeras (10%). Most species were assessed as Least Concern (60%, 62 species) or Data Deficient (32%, 33 species), with four (3.8%) species listed as Near Threatened and four (3.8%) in a threatened category (Vulnerable, Endangered, Critically Endangered). Threatened species are all oceanic pelagic, of which two are only visitors to New Zealand waters, and their status the result of broader regional declines. These results are in stark contrast to other recent regional assessments in Europe and the Arabian Sea and adjacent areas, where up to half of species were listed in a threatened category. However, given New Zealand's extensive deepwater fishing effort and rapid collapses of deepwater chondrichthyan fisheries elsewhere, it is possible that New Zealand populations of many deepwater species are the remnants of previously reduced populations that are now at a low, yet stable level. Ongoing species‐level catch monitoring will be required to ensure these species do not become threatened. Recommendations for future research and conservation efforts include resolving taxonomic uncertainties, understanding habitat use, and increasing regional collaborations to better understand the effects of fishing on wider‐ranging species.  aPublisher supplied data  cAuckland Zoo Conservation Fund  cIUCN Species Survival Commission Shark Specialist Group  aA11 for NESP MBHcNational Environmental Science Program  cOceania Chondrichthyan Society  cShark Conservation Fund  cWorld Wildlife Fund 3achimerism 3aextinction 3afauna 3afisheries 3ahabitat preferences 3aindigenous species 3amonitoring 3arisk 3asharks 3athreatened species 3auncertainty 3aArabian Sea 3aEurope 3aNew Zealand1 aDuffy, Clinton A.J.1 aFrancis, Malcolm P.1 aGibson, Claudine1 aKyne, Peter M.0 tAquatic conservation.g2019 May, v. 29, no. 5 p.783-797dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl51367x1052-76137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aqc.30533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02940naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001600166245008100182300001400263500001500277520132800292592002801620650004301648650002001691650001301711650001101724650001301735650001201748650002301760650001701783650000901800650001301809650001301822650002501835650003701860650005001897650003501947650003801982650000902020650002202029651001002051653001302061700001402074700001702088700001502105700002002120700001502140700001602155700001902171773009402190856008102284852000902365655001202374IND50074257320221122033710.0150213e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007425732DNAL7 a242817602pmid7 a10.1007/s00572-013-0543-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalerni, E.10aEffects of soil tillage on Tuber magnatum development in natural truffières  ap. 79-87.  a2019-12-06  aTuber magnatum Pico, the Italian white truffle, commands the highest prices of any truffle. Despite its commercial value, it is the only edible European truffle which has not yet been successfully cultivated. Because of this, it is essential to safeguard natural truffières and to identify cultural practices to maximize their productivity. Soil tillage is successfully and extensively used in black truffle cultivation to enhance productivity, but its effects are not known on the development of T. magnatum. A recently developed real-time PCR assay was applied to evaluate the effects of tillage (10–15 cm depth) on T. magnatum mycelium in two different natural truffle grounds located in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna. Tillage effects on bulk density, ectomycorrhizal fungal communities, and ascoma production were also assessed. Tilling significantly increased the quantity of T. magnatum mycelium which seemed to be related to an increase in soil porosity by up to 34 %, and the diversity of ectomycorrhizal fungal communities. On the contrary, no significant effects were found on ascoma production. The results highlight that real-time PCR is the most reliable method for evaluating the effects of cultural practices on the development of T. magnatum in soil avoiding long-term studies on fruiting body production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aectomycorrhizae 3aascomata 3aprices 3aporosity 3atillage 3afungal communities 3abulk density 3asoil 3amycelium 3atruffles 2aAgriculturexmethods 2aAscomycotaxgrowth & development 2aFruiting Bodies, Fungalxgrowth & development 2aMyceliumxgrowth & development 2aMycorrhizaexgrowth & development 2aSoil 2aSoil Microbiology 3aItaly 0aascocarp1 aIotti, M.1 aLeonardi, P.1 aGardin, L.1 aD’Aguanno, M.1 aPerini, C.1 aPacioni, P.1 aZambonelli, A.0 tMycorrhiza.g2014 Apr., v. 24, no.

To investigate the release of iron, zinc, and lead from metallic iron and zinc bars incubated in water and in meals. Iron, zinc, and lead concentrations were measured at different incubation conditions in water and in meals. The iron concentration in water was 1.26 mg/L after incubation with one iron bar at pH 7 and 100°C for 20 minutes and in meals was 0.97 mg per 100 g of wet meals, rich in phytate, cooking at 100°C during 20 minutes. The maximum contents were 7,720 mg/L of iron and 1,826 mg/L of zinc in vinegar at pH 3 and 20°C after 90 and 32 days, respectively. Lead was released from the bars, but at concentrations well below the upper tolerable limits. In outreach populations, the use of iron and zinc metallic bars in water and meals could contribute to sustainable, very low-cost prevention of iron and zinc deficiencies, and home-fortified vinegar could be used for treatment of both deficiencies. Field trials should be performed to determine the impact that the use of iron and zinc metallic bars in water and meals might have on the iron and zinc status of population groups.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanemia 3acooking 3afield experimentation 3airon 3alead 3anutrient deficiencies 3aoutreach 3apH 3aphytic acid 3avinegars 3azinc 0aIron deficiency 0azinc deficiency 0awater fortification with iron and zinc 0airon and zinc metallic bars1 ade Romaña, Daniel Lòpez1 aBoy, Erick1 aVargas, Alejandro1 adel Portal, Mauricio Rosas1 aHuaylinos, María Luisa0 tFood and nutrition bulletin.g, v. 28, no. 4 p.426-434dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2034x0379-57217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1564826507028004083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02637naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245008300172300001600255520149600271592002801767650002701795650000901822650001601831650001201847650002501859650001501884653001401899653001401913653002101927653001601948653002401964700002001988700002002008700002002028773011302048856008102161852000902242655001202251IND60610837720221116165135.0180830e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061083772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jas.2017.06.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThompson, Jessica C.10aIdentifying the accumulator: Making the most of bone surface modification data  ap. 105-113.  aTaphonomic analysis is an essential component of zooarchaeology, but is employed in different ways within different research traditions. Within the Africanist Palaeolithic literature, there is a strong emphasis on quantitative comparison of proportions of different bone surface modifications to one another and to proportions observed on modern experimental collections. This work has been driven by debates about the taphonomic histories of Oldowan sites that document the subsistence strategies of early Homo, but this specific approach can be usefully applied to a range of contexts across many different time periods and geographic locations. One obstacle to the cross-fertilization of this taphonomic tradition with other zooarchaeological work is the restrictive manner in which data are selected from an assemblage for analysis. To ensure comparability between fossil and modern assemblages, analysts typically exclude specimens with evidence for post-depositional modification not modeled in the experimental data. Although this adds interpretive robustness, it can diminish sample size significantly, sometimes to the point of affecting statistical analyses, and results in much time invested in collecting data that ultimately are not used. Here, we describe a new method for maximizing the number of specimens that can be incorporated into analysis, thus resolving the persistent problem of poor sample sizes to make more statistically robust comparisons to actualistic datasets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGeographical Locations 3aHomo 3aarchaeology 3afossils 3astatistical analysis 3atraditions 0aTaphonomy 0aCut marks 0aPercussion marks 0aTooth marks 0aResearch traditions1 aFaith, J.

E. camaldulensis is likely a potential phytoremediator in areas vulnerable to Cu contamination, such as the industrial areas of Riyadh. To realize this objective, young seedlings of E. camaldulensis were potted in an open area with soil comprised of clay and sand. Different doses of Cu (30, 50, and 100 &micro;M) were applied to the plants as CuSO<inf>4</inf>&middot;5H<inf>2</inf>O for 6 weeks. Plant growth was monitored during the Cu exposure period, and morphological and physiological indicators were measured once a week to determine the growth rates. A proteomics study was also conducted to find out the influence of Cu stress on proteins. Our results showed that growth was negatively affected by Cu treatment, particularly at the highest concentrations. Moreover, using a proteomic analysis showed 26 targets involved in protein expression. Elevated levels of Cu increased the expression of 11 proteins and decreased the expression of 15 proteins. Changes were detected in proteins involved in photosynthesis, translation, transcription, metabolism, and antioxidant enzymes. Our findings provided insights into the molecular mechanisms related to Cu stress, in addition to its influence on the morphological and physiological attributes of E. camaldulensis seedlings. This investigation aimed to characterize the mechanism behind the impact of Cu stress on the plant.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEucalyptus camaldulensis 3aantioxidant enzymes 3aclay 3acopper 3aexposure duration 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant growth 3apolluted soils 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3asand 3aseedlings 3atranslation (genetics) 3aSaudi Arabia1 aMohammed, Afrah  E.1 aAlmutairi, Taghreed  A.1 aElobeid, Mudawi  M.0 tPlants.g2019 Feb. 15, v. 8, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants80200433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04725naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024001700135024002100152024003300173024001200206040001800218100001800236245012400254300001200378506007600390506017300466520212100639592002802760506003702788650002602825650004002851650002702891650001102918650001902929650000902948650002302957650001902980650001102999650001403010650001403024650001903038650001403057650002203071650001503093650001203108650001203120650001203132650003003144650000903174650002003183650006703203650006303270650001503333651001803348700002503366700002503391700002203416700002203438700002203460700001803482700001903500773011203519856011203631856008003743956014603823961001303969852000903982655001203991IND50061123820221214223512.0190823e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006112382DNAL7 aPMC35045162pmcid7 a230750982pmid7 a2850042aris7 a10113/626782hdl7 a10.1186/1756-3305-5-2362doi8 ans10346  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuder, Mark G10aVector competence of Culicoides sonorensis (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) to epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus serotype 7  ap. 236.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aBACKGROUND: Culicoides sonorensis (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) is a vector of epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) serotypes 1 and 2 in North America, where these viruses are well-known pathogens of white-tailed deer (WTD) and other wild ruminants. Although historically rare, reports of clinical EHDV infection in cattle have increased in some parts of the world over the past decade. In 2006, an EHDV-7 epizootic in cattle resulted in economic loss for the Israeli dairy industry. White-tailed deer are susceptible to EHDV-7 infection and disease; however, this serotype is exotic to the US and the susceptibility of C. sonorensis to this cattle-virulent EHDV is not known. The objective of the study was to determine if C. sonorensis is susceptible to EHDV-7 infection and is a competent vector. METHODS: To evaluate the susceptibility of C. sonorensis, midges were fed on EHDV-7 infected WTD, held at 22 ± 1°C, and processed individually for virus isolation and titration on 4–16 days post feeding (dpf). Midges with a virus titer of ≥10².⁷ median tissue culture infective doses (TCID₅₀)/midge were considered potentially competent. To determine if infected C. sonorensis were capable of transmitting EHDV-7 to a host, a susceptible WTD was then fed on by a group of 14–16 dpf midges. RESULTS: From 4–16 dpf, 45% (156/350) of midges that fed on WTD with high titer viremia (>10⁷ TCID₅₀/ml) were virus isolation-positive, and starting from 10–16 dpf, 32% (35/109) of these virus isolation-positive midges were potentially competent (≥10².⁷ TCID₅₀/midge). Midges that fed on infected deer transmitted the virus to a susceptible WTD at 14–16 dpf. The WTD developed viremia and severe clinical disease. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that C. sonorensis is susceptible to EHDV-7 infection and can transmit the virus to susceptible WTD, thus, C. sonorensis should be considered a potential vector of EHDV-7. Together with previous work, this study demonstrates that North America has a susceptible ruminant and vector host for this exotic, cattle-virulent strain of EHDV-7.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCulicoides sonorensis 3aEpizootic hemorrhagic disease virus 3aOdocoileus virginianus 3acattle 3adairy industry 3adeer 3aepizootic diseases 3ainsect vectors 3amidges 3apathogens 3aserotypes 3atissue culture 3atitration 3avector competence 3aviral load 3aviremia 3aviruses 2aAnimals 2aCeratopogonidaexvirology 2aDeer 2aDisease Vectors 2aHemorrhagic Disease Virus, Epizooticxisolation & purification 2aReoviridae Infectionsxtransmissionxveterinaryxvirology. 2aViral Load 3aUnited States1 aHowerth, Elizabeth W1 aStallknecht, David E1 aAllison, Andrew B1 aCarter, Deborah L1 aDrolet, Barbara S1 aKlement, Eyal1 aMead, Daniel G0 tParasites & vectors.g2012 Dec., v. 5, no. 1 p.236-236dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/626783Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1756-3305-5-2363Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/ARIS%20285004%20Vector%20competence%20of%20Culicoides%20sonorensis...pdf  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02281naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245009800166300001400264500001500278520105500293592002801348650001401376650001501390650001101405650001001416650001901426650001301445650001301458650002101471650001101492650001601503650001101519650001201530651001101542651001701553653001001570700001801580700002101598700001801619700002301637773007001660856008401730852000901814655001201823IND60084204720221118175313.0141101e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008420472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2011.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, C.B.10aHolocenic proxies of sedimentary organic matter and the evolution of Lake Arari-Amazon Region  ap. 26-38.  a2019-12-06  aFour sediment cores were sampled from Lake Arari, located on Marajó Island at the mouth of the Amazon River. The island's vegetation cover is composed mainly of Amazon coastal forest, herbaceous and varzea vegetation. The integration of data on sedimentary structures, pollen, carbon and nitrogen isotope records, C/N ratios and radiocarbon ages allowed the identification of changes in vegetation and the sources of organic matter accumulated in the lake during the Holocene. The data indicate a relatively high flow energy, marine water influence and the presence of mangroves during the lagoon phase between 8990 and 8690calyr B.P. and 2310–2230calyr B.P. Between 2310 and 2230calyr B.P. and ~1000calyr B.P., the flow energy decreased and the mangroves were replaced by herbaceous vegetation following the decline in marine influence, likely due to the increase in freshwater river discharge. During the last 1000years, Lake Arari was established in association with the expansion of herbaceous vegetation and the dominance of freshwater algae.  aPublisher supplied data 3asediments 3afreshwater 3arivers 3alakes 3aorganic matter 3anitrogen 3aisotopes 3avegetation cover 3acarbon 3aenergy flow 3apollen 3aforests 3aBrazil 3aAmazon River 0aAlgae1 aCohen, M.C.L.1 aPessenda, L.C.R.1 aFrança, M.C.1 aGuimarães, J.T.F.0 tCatena.g2012 Mar., v. 90 p.26-38dElsevier B.V.x0341-81627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2011.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03217naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245014000155300001600295500002000311520179200331592002802123650002402151650001002175650001102185650001402196650001702210650001002227650001102237650001802248650003502266650002602301650001902327650003002346650004502376650000902421650001402430650002302444650001402467651001002481700001602491700001702507700001602524773011302540856007302653852000902726655001202735IND60571744620221119083555.0170712e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057174462DNAL7 a10.1111/lam.126132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNanni, I.M.10aScreening of sensitivity to mandipropamid of Plasmopara viticola populations from Italian vineyards by molecular and biological methods  ap. 268-273.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe objective of this work was to study the sensitivity to mandipropamid of 33 Plasmopara viticola populations utilizing both molecular and biological techniques. The PCR‐RFLP technique was developed in order to detect the single point mutation, G1105S, occurring on the PvCesA3 gene. The sensitivity was also studied using the leaf‐disc bioassay. Thirty‐three downy mildew‐infected leaf samples, collected from 2010 to 2013 from Italian vineyards, were used in the study. PCR‐RFLP revealed the presence of 7 resistant, 12 sensitive, 14 mixed (sensitive and resistant) mutation profiles. Effective concentration for 50% inhibition rate (EC₅₀) calculated from the bioassays showed an EC₅₀ < 1 mg l⁻¹ for samples that showed sensitive profiles, while for those samples that had a mixed profile, EC₅₀ ranged from <1 to >300 mg l⁻¹, and values for resistant profiles ranged from 200·28 to >300 mg l⁻¹. The results suggest that P. viticola populations infecting Italian vineyards are under a selection pressure due to CAA‐based fungicide applications. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: We characterized Plasmopara viticola populations utilizing PCR‐RFLP technique to detect a point mutation known to cause resistance to carboxylic acid amides (CAA) fungicides. Sensitivity of these samples to the mandipropamid fungicide was assayed by a leaf‐disc method. In this work, we provide the first evidence about the presence of mandipropamid‐resistant populations of P. viticola from commercial vineyards in Italy. Improving the knowledge about development of resistant populations could enhance the current grapevine downy mildew management strategies and minimize the risk of the spread of mandipropamid and other CAA‐resistant populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlasmopara viticola 3aVitis 3aamides 3abioassays 3adowny mildew 3agenes 3aleaves 3amandipropamid 3amedian effective concentration 3apesticide application 3apoint mutation 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3arisk 3ascreening 3aselection pressure 3avineyards 3aItaly1 aPirondi, A.1 aContaldo, N.1 aCollina, M.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2016 Oct., v. 63, no. 4 p.268-273dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0266-82547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/lam.126133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03122naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245008200166300001600248520191300264592002802177650002402205650001102229650001202240650002902252650001902281650002602300650000902326650001902335650001702354650001002371650002102381650001202402650001302414700001402427700001602441700001702457700001602474700001302490773009502503856008102598852000902679655001202688IND60549088120221119210611.0160906e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054908812DNAL7 a10.1007/s40003-016-0209-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xiliang10aMechanical Testing of Tomato Plant Stem in Relation to Structural Composition  ap. 236-245.  aAs an important biological resource, the development and utilization of tomato plant stem arouse more and more attention. Facing increasingly rare resources and serious environmental protection, it will have more significant meaning to comprehensively use stem resource and research its mechanical properties. This paper takes tomato plant stem as research object to observe and analyze the microstructure of the fibers, and test moisture, tensile and shear mechanical properties of different parts of stem. The results revealed that: (1) Tomato plant stem is a composite material and its microstructure mainly consists of epidermis, cortex, vascular bundle and pith; moreover, it presents on sieve texture with heterogeneous distribution. (2) Cross-sectional area of root is 7.08–23.4 mm², its tensile strength and shear strength are 8.64–17.92 and 4.12–5.26 MPa, respectively, while cross-sectional area of middle is 5.94–20.19 mm² with tensile strength and shear strength being 13.73–22.68 and 2.24–4.38 MPa separately; in terms of top part, its cross-sectional area is between 5.04 and 14.57 mm² with tensile strength and shear strength being 11.86–29.59 and 1.4–4.27 MPa. (3) All tensile stress, tensile strength and elastic modulus from root to top part tend to decrease gradually; in addition, different parts have significant influence on both tensile strength and elastic modulus. (4) Shear stress, shear strength and shear modulus from root to top reduced gradually; besides, each part has extremely obvious impact on shear strength and shear modulus. This research provides necessary experimental data and theoretical basis for the development of harvest and processing machinery for tomato plant stems; moreover, it helps to confirm working parameters when cutting and assists to accelerate the application and promotion of comprehensive utilization of tomato plant stem.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite materials 3acortex 3acutting 3aenvironmental protection 3amicrostructure 3amodulus of elasticity 3apith 3ashear strength 3ashear stress 3astems 3atensile strength 3atexture 3atomatoes1 aGuo, Qian1 aXu, Yunfeng1 aLi, Pingping1 aChen, Cheng1 aWu, Shuo0 tAgricultural research.g2016 Sept., v. 5, no. 3 p.236-245dSpringer Indiax2249-720X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40003-016-0209-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02809naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245011000169520154100279592002801820650002101848650001501869650001101884650001601895650001701911650001301928650001501941650001601956650001501972700002001987700002302007700002402030700001902054700002302073700001802096700002202114700001902136700001802155773012302173856008202296852000902378655001202387IND60768470920221121064627.0220225e20220120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076847092DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens110201212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGueniche, Audrey 10aAdvances in Microbiome-Derived Solutions and Methodologies Are Founding a New Era in Skin Health and Care  aThe microbiome, as a community of microorganisms and their structural elements, genomes, metabolites/signal molecules, has been shown to play an important role in human health, with significant beneficial applications for gut health. Skin microbiome has emerged as a new field with high potential to develop disruptive solutions to manage skin health and disease. Despite an incomplete toolbox for skin microbiome analyses, much progress has been made towards functional dissection of microbiomes and host-microbiome interactions. A standardized and robust investigation of the skin microbiome is necessary to provide accurate microbial information and set the base for a successful translation of innovations in the dermo-cosmetic field. This review provides an overview of how the landscape of skin microbiome research has evolved from method development (multi-omics/data-based analytical approaches) to the discovery and development of novel microbiome-derived ingredients. Moreover, it provides a summary of the latest findings on interactions between the microbiomes (gut and skin) and skin health/disease. Solutions derived from these two paths are used to develop novel microbiome-based ingredients or solutions acting on skin homeostasis are proposed. The most promising skin and gut-derived microbiome interventional strategies are presented, along with regulatory, safety, industrial, and technical challenges related to a successful translation of these microbiome-based concepts/technologies in the dermo-cosmetic industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3adigestive system 3adissection 3agenome 3ahomeostasis 3ahuman health 3aindustry 3alandscapes 3ametabolites 3amicrobiome1 aPerin, Olivier 1 aBouslimani, Amina 1 aLandemaine, Leslie 1 aMisra, Namita 1 aCupferman, Sylvie 1 aAguilar, Luc 1 aClavaud, Cécile 1 aChopra, Tarun 1 aKhodr, Ahmad 0 tPathogens.g2022 Jan. 20, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens110201213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01503naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245009900160300002000259520048700279592002800766650002300794650002300817650003100840650002200871650002200893650002200915700002400937700002300961773012100984856007501105852000901180655001201189IND60550294520171220000000.0160910e20141107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055029452DNAL7 a10.1021/jo501988e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLorente, Adriana10aSelective Formation of a Z-Trisubstituted Double Bond Using a 1-(tert-Butyl)tetrazolyl Sulfone  ap. 10648-10654.  aIn our effort to gain further insight into the enantioselective synthesis of the structural core of phormidolides B and C, we have discovered the formation of a Z-trisubstituted double bond.

In particular, broiler parent stock produce thousands of eggs for commercial broiler chickens and can transfer antimicrobial-resistant bacteria and drug-resistance genes to chicks. This study was conducted to investigate the prevalence and characteristics of third-generation cephalosporin-resistant and extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL)-producing E. coli isolated from the broiler parent stock in Korea. Among 51 cefotaxime-resistant E. coli isolates, 45 (88.2%) isolates were identified as multidrug resistant and 21 isolates showed phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of CTX-M–producing E. coli. The CTX-M genes CTX-M-14, CTX-M-15, CTX-M-1, and CTX-M-1 were detected in 10, 7, 3, and 1 isolates, respectively. ISEcp1 or IS26 + ISEcp1 were identified upstream of all CTX-M–type genes, and orf477 and IS903 were detected downstream of 9 and 10 CTX-M–type genes, respectively. Thirteen (61.9%) of the 21 CTX-M–producing E. coli isolates harbored class 1 integrons with 4 different gene cassette arrangements. Among the plasmid replicons, CTX-M-1 was located on I1, F, and FIB; CTX-M-14 on F and FII; CTX-M-15 on FII, FIA, and FIB; and CTX-M-65 on FIB. This is the first study to investigate the presence and distribution of third-generation cephalosporin-resistant and CTX-M–producing E. coli isolated from the broiler parent stock level in Korea, and the results indicate that comprehensive surveillance and persistent monitoring systems in broiler parent stock farms are necessary to prevent the dissemination of resistant isolates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aanti-infective agents 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteria 3abacterial infections 3abeta-lactamase 3abroiler chickens 3achicks 3aeggs 3afarms 3agenes 3ahumans 3amonitoring 3amultiple drug resistance 3aphenotype 3aplasmids 3apublic health 3arisk 3aKorean Peninsula 0aEscherichia coli 0aantimicrobial resistance 0abroiler parent stock 0athird-generation cephalosporin 0aCTX-M1 aLee, Young Ju0 tPoultry science.g2021 Feb., v. 100, no. 2 p.1008-1015dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.psj.2020.09.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03124naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245010600168300001600274520168200290592002801972650002002000650001102020650001602031650003802047650001102085650001302096650001502109650001602124650000902140650002202149650001902171650002202190650001602212650001602228651001002244653001102254653001002265653000902275653001902284653001602303700001702319700001702336700001702353700001802370700001802388773010902406856008202515852000902597655001202606IND60621865320221118190425.0181121e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062186532DNAL7 a10.1177/1564826507028004092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPathak, Priyali10aIron, Folate, and Vitamin B₁₂ Stores Among Pregnant Women in a Rural Area of Haryana State, India  ap. 435-438.  aIron, folate, and vitamin B₁₂ deficiencies have adverse effects on pregnancy outcome. In India, data on the concomitant prevalence of these deficiencies among pregnant women are meager. We conducted a community-based study to assess the prevalence of deficiencies of iron, folate, and vitamin B₁₂ among pregnant women in a rural block of Haryana State. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. A total of 283 pregnant women were enrolled in the study. After oral informed consent had been obtained from the women, blood was drawn from the antecubital vein for estimation of the levels of serum ferritin by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (levels < 12 ng/mL were considered as indicative of poor iron stores); serum folate was determined by radioimmunoassay (levels < 3 ng/mL were considered as indicative of poor folate stores); and serum vitamin B₁₂ was estimated by the microbiologic method (levels < 200 pg/mL were considered as indicative of poor vitamin B₁₂ stores). The results indicated that 67.7%, 26.3%, and 74.1% of the women had poor iron, folate, and vitamin B₁₂ stores, respectively. Concomitant deficiencies of iron, folate, and vitamin B₁₂ occurred in 16.2% of the women. We found that 59.9% of the women were consuming less than 75% of the recommended daily caloric allowance (2,175 kcal), indicating an overall poor food intake. This could be one of the predominant reasons for poor iron, folate, and vitamin B₁₂ stores among the women. Our findings suggest that apart from iron and folate, vitamin B₁₂ deficiencies may play an important role in causing anemia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aanemia 3ablood serum 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aethics 3aferritin 3afolic acid 3afood intake 3airon 3apregnancy outcome 3apregnant women 3aradioimmunoassays 3arural areas 3avitamin B12 3aIndia 0aFolate 0aIndia 0airon 0apregnant women 0avitamin B121 aKapil, Umesh1 aYajnik, C.S.1 aKapoor, S.K.1 aDwivedi, S.N.1 aSingh, Rajvir0 tFood and nutrition bulletin.g, v. 28, no. 4 p.435-438dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2034x0379-57217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1564826507028004093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04009naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245009200174500002200266500002200288520202600310592002802336650002802364650003102392650002002423650001902443650005302462650003202515650002102547650001102568650002002579650001902599650002102618650002002639650002102659650001902680650001902699650001802718650001502736650001502751650002702766650001702793650001602810650002202826650001302848650001402861653001702875653003002892653002002922653002002942653001402962700002802976700002103004700002403025700002003049700002103069700002103090700002303111700001803134773009303152856008103245852000903326655001203335IND60613734020221120081610.0180914s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061373402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jim.2018.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl-Sahrigy, Sally A.F.14aThe influence of interferon-β supplemented human dendritic cells on BCG immunogenicity  aPre-press version  aPre-press version  aTuberculosis (TB) remains a huge worldwide burden, despite extensive vaccination coverage with the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), the only vaccine available against this disease, indicating that BCG-driven immunity is inadequate to protect the human population against TB. This underscore the critical necessitate to develop an improved TB vaccine, based on a better understanding of host-pathogen interactions and immune responses during mycobacterial infection.To examine whether the exogenous addition of IFN-β could improve dendritic cell (DC) response to Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis) and to evaluate the effect induced by the infection of human DCs with M. bovis (with and without IFN-β) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) on DC viability as well as to compare the ability of BCG and Mtb to provide DCs with a Th1-polarizing capacity through the assessment of the immunoregulatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-12, IL-10 and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ).Immature DCs (iDCs) were generated in vitro using peripheral blood monocytes separated by anti-CD14–conjugated microbeads in the presence of granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and IL-4, cultured cells were analyzed using flow cytometry, then we tested DC viability after inoculation with M. bovis (with and without IFN-β pretreatment) and Mtb using light microscopic examination and trypan blue exclusion method. Additionally, supernatants from infected-DCs cultures were analyzed for IFN-γ, IL-12 and IL-10 by ELISA.The viability of BCG-infected DCs was significantly higher than that of Mtb-infected DCs (61.55% vs 52.10%). BCG-infected DC produced significantly more IL-12 (p = 0.02) and less IL-10 (p = 0.01) compared with Mtb-infected cells. IFN-β-pretreated BCG-infected DCs produced significantly larger amounts of IL-12 than did BCG-infected DCs (p = 0.03) and Mtb-infected cells (p < 0.001).IFN-β improves DC functions following BCG infection, thus assuming that IFN-β could be used as a vaccine adjuvant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycobacterium bovis BCG 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3adendritic cells 3aflow cytometry 3agranulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3ahuman population 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3aimmunogenicity 3aimmunomodulation 3ainterferon-beta 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-12 3ainterleukin-4 3amicrobeads 3amicroscopy 3amononuclear leukocytes 3atuberculosis 3avaccination 3avaccine adjuvants 3avaccines 3aviability 0aTuberculosis 0aBacillus Calmette-Guérin 0aInterferon-beta 0aDendritic cells 0aCytokines1 aRahman, Azza M.O.

In the present study, the qualitative land suitability evaluation by parametric and fuzzy approaches was investigated for sugar beet crop in Sabzevar plain, Northeast of Iran. Our results indicated that the most limiting factor for sugar beet cultivation in the study area is soil organic carbon. In both models, the suitability classes for sugar beet cultivation were classified into high (S1) in north parts of the plain to moderate suitable (S2) due to lower values of soil organic carbon in southwest and scattered part in the center of the plain. The values of land indexes by parametric and fuzzy logic approaches ranged from 60.55 and 50.50 in some parts in the center and south west to 84.95 and 83.20 in the northern parts of the plain, respectively. The coefficient of determination between the results obtained from both models was R ² = 0.995, which shows a high correlation between the calculated land index values from two approaches. The correlation coefficient between the land index values and the observed sugar beet yield (R ²) varied between 0.86 and 0.94 by parametric and fuzzy approaches which verify the validation of both models in estimating land suitability for sugar beet production in the study area.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorrelation 3acrop yield 3afuzzy logic 3aland evaluation 3aland suitability 3aland use 3aland values 3aprediction 3asoil organic carbon 3asugar beet 3aIran1 aGholizadeh, Amin0 tAgricultural research.g2016 Sept., v. 5, no. 3 p.277-284dSpringer Indiax2249-720X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40003-016-0210-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02942naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006600153245012500219300001600344520146500360592002801825650001701853650002001870650002601890650001201916650001101928650001501939650001201954650001001966650001601976651001301992653000802005653000702013653000802020653000702028653000902035653000802044653000802052653000802060653003202068653003802100653002202138653002602160653002302186653002302209773010702232856008802339852000902427655001202436IND60538090120221121151944.0190319e20141110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053809012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2014.07.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTulowiecki, Stephen J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6787-096210aUsing vegetation data within presettlement land survey records for species distribution modeling: A tale of two datasets  ap. 109-120.  aResearchers have long utilized the vegetation data within presettlement land survey records (PLSRs) to understand past forest composition in North America. PLSRs typically contain two datasets: bearing-tree (BT) data and line-description (LD) data. BT data are records of the trees that surveyors blazed adjacent to survey monuments, whereas LD data provide descriptions of tree species that surveyors observed along survey lines. Recently, studies have applied BT data to develop species distribution models (SDMs). SDMs create predictions of species distributions, based upon the modeled relationship between species presence and absence records, and environmental variables. Despite the applications of BT data in SDMs, the value of LD data for developing SDMs has not been explored. This study compares SDMs trained from LD data versus BT data, using PLSRs that were created ca. 1799–1814 CE in Chautauqua County, New York State. Using consensus modeling techniques, this study finds that despite positional uncertainty issues, LD data produce SDMs with better predictive performance than BT data, and more adequately generalize to independent datasets. Moreover, a comparable amount of data can be collected from LD data as from BT data, in order to develop models with greater predictive ability. This study challenges the use of BT data in SDMs, and suggests that modeling past species distributions can be accomplished more effectively using LD data.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogeography 3adata collection 3aenvironmental factors 3aforests 3amodels 3aprediction 3asurveys 3atrees 3auncertainty 3aNew York 0aAUC 0aBT 0aHLC 0aLD 0aPLSR 0aRLD 0aSDM 0aTSS 0aSpecies distribution models 0aPresettlement land survey records 0aBearing-tree data 0aLine-description data 0aConsensus modeling 0aHistorical ecology0 tEcological modelling.g2014 Nov. 10, v. 291 p.109-120dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl6191x0304-38007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2014.07.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03598naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006300152245010500215300001600320500001500336520181600351592002802167650001602195650001902211650001202230650001102242650002002253650001302273650001302286650001402299650002102313650001702334650002102351650001102372650002202383650000902405650001102414650001702425650000902442650001402451650001202465650001202477650001902489651001002508653001702518653003302535653000802568653002502576653002702601653000802628700001802636700002102654700001802675700002202693700002102715700002402736773010502760856008602865852000902951655001202960IND60606838720221122090230.0180730e20161101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060683872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosres.2016.06.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSquizzato, Stefania1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4583-721010aFactors, origin and sources affecting PM1 concentrations and composition at an urban background site  ap. 262-273.  a2019-12-06  aPM1 is widely believed to provide better information on the anthropogenic fraction of particulate matter pollution than PM2.5. However, data on PM1 are still limited in Europe as well as comprehensive information about its chemical composition and source apportionment and this gap is more evident in the pollution hot-spots still remaining in Europe, such as the Po Valley (Northern Italy). Elemental and organic carbon, 7 water soluble inorganic ions and 17 elements were quantified in 117PM1 samples collected at an urban background site in Venice-Mestre, a large city located in the eastern Po Valley, during winter (December 2013–February 2014) and summer (May–July 2014) periods.Results show a strong seasonality for PM1 mass concentration (averages ranging from 6±2 in summer to 34±24μgm⁻³ in winter) and for most of the analysed species. Components mainly related to road traffic, residential heating, biomass burning and secondary inorganic aerosol (ammonium nitrate) reached their highest levels in winter, while mineral dust and marine components were elevated in summer. PMF analysis revealed 7 potential sources. Secondary inorganic aerosol (33%) and biomass burning (33%) are the major contributor in winter followed by EC-primary emissions (16%), aged sulphate (6%), road traffic (7%), fossil fuel combustion (%) and marine aerosol (3%). During summer, these sources account for 12%, 14%, 20%, 22%, 8%, 14% and 10%, respectively.Some PM1 sources are located near the sampling site (residential area, traffic road, industrial area) but a major contribution of long range transport is observed when high pollution events occur. The results give useful insights into PM1 composition in an urban area and chemical profiles of sources helpful in the interpretation of receptor model results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aurban areas 3aorganic carbon 3aburning 3asummer 3afuel combustion 3asulfates 3aaerosols 3apollution 3aammonium nitrate 3afossil fuels 3awater solubility 3awinter 3aresidential areas 3aheat 3amodels 3aparticulates 3adust 3aemissions 3atraffic 3abiomass 3ainorganic ions 3aItaly 0aMass closure 0aWater soluble inorganic ions 0aPM1 0achemical composition 0aCarbonaceous materials 0aPMF1 aMasiol, Mauro1 aAgostini, Chiara1 aVisin, Flavia1 aFormenton, Gianni1 aHarrison, Roy M.1 aRampazzo, Giancarlo0 tAtmospheric research.g2016 Nov. 01, v. 180 p.262-273dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11823x0169-80957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2016.06.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03392naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100007000138245014500208300001600353500002000369520205400389592002802443596004602471650002302517650001302540650001502553650002002568650001902588650002202607650001502629650001502644650001402659650001302673650000902686650001102695650001202706650001302718650001602731651001102747773011902758856007202877852000902949655001202958IND60644712220221119090028.0190520e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064471222DNAL7 a10.1002/aqc.30972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurridge, Christopher Paul1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8185-609110aPolitics and pride: Maintaining genetic novelty may be detrimental for the conservation of Formosa landlocked salmon Oncorhynchus formosanus  ap. 840-847.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPopulations of conservation concern are often rare, restricted in range, and isolated from other populations. This can manifest in low genetic diversity, which reduces the ability of a population to respond to changes in the environment, and in higher levels of inbreeding, which reduce individual fitness. Isolated populations, however, often harbour genetic and phenotypic novelty, which can elicit a strong community sentiment to maintain these populations. Genetic rescue – the introduction of genetic variation to improve fitness – offers potential benefits for isolated and threatened populations, but has associated risks, including a perceived loss in identity if that population is geographically, genetically, and culturally significant. Here, the potential benefits and risks of genetic rescue for isolated freshwater populations are discussed, using the Formosa salmon as an exemplar. Formosa landlocked salmon, a member of the masu salmon complex (Oncorhynchus masou sensu lato), is the southernmost naturally distributed salmonid in the world, occupying a single stream at high elevation in Taiwan. Listed as Critically Endangered, it exhibits continuing low abundance (<5000 individuals). Although Formosa salmon can be genetically distinguished from other masu salmon, its genetic variation is extremely low and genetic factors may now critically affect fitness. There appears to be clear merit for the genetic rescue of Formosa salmon, and test crosses involving other landlocked masu salmon are urgently required. If these test crosses yield individuals of high fitness, guidelines for introductions into the wild are provided. In addition, subpopulations above and below artificial instream barriers to movement require connection via the direct exchange of individuals to minimize any further losses of genetic variation. Insurance populations with independent risk probabilities to the existing population should also be constructed, with continuing connectivity among populations through the direct exchange of individuals.  aPublisher supplied data  cTaiwan Ministry of Science and Technology 3aOncorhynchus masou 3aaltitude 3afreshwater 3agenetic factors 3agenetic rescue 3agenetic variation 3aguidelines 3ainbreeding 3aphenotype 3apolitics 3arisk 3asalmon 3astreams 3ataxonomy 3atestcrosses 3aTaiwan0 tAquatic conservation.g2019 May, v. 29, no. 5 p.840-847dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl51367x1052-76137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aqc.30973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03022naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002800184245014700212506007600359520130400435592002801739506003701767650002001804650002401824650001001848650001401858650002401872650002401896650001301920650001501933650002301948650001801971650001701989650001602006650001102022650001602033650001902049650002202068650001102090700003002101700004102131700002502172700003102197700003002228700002902258773011902287856007702406852000902483655001202492IND60651302420221207133915.0190711e20190216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065130242DNAL7 a10.3390/plants80200442doi7 aPMC64099112pmcid7 a307814742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPreciado-Rangel, Pablo 10aFoliar Aspersion of Salicylic Acid Improves Phenolic and Flavonoid Compounds, and Also the Fruit Yield in Cucumber (<i>Cucumis sativus</i> L.)  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe aim of this research is to evaluate the effect of foliar application of salicylic acid (SA) on the yield and phytochemical content in hydroponically grown cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.). (1) Background: The importance of Mexico&rsquo;s cucumber production is based on its cultivation in recent decades as one of the major winter crops; in addition, the production of vegetables under hydroponic systems has increased significantly during the last few years, with cucumber being one of the vegetables with a high economic potential. (2) Methods: A completely randomized experimental design with 15 repetitions was used. SA at five doses (0.075, 0.1, 0.15, 0.25, and 0.5 mM) and one control (distilled water) was sprinkled weekly on cucumber plants. The evaluated variables were yield (total fruit weight per plant), fruit parameters (length, size and firmness), and nutraceutical quality of cucumber. (3) Results: Low concentrations of SA improve the yield and high concentrations decrease it, but the nutraceutical quality of fruits is improved, as compared to the control treatment. (4) Conclusions: In order to obtain a higher content of bioactive compounds without affecting the yield and commercial quality of cucumber fruits, it is advisable to use the average concentration (0.15 mM) of SA.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCucumis sativus 3abioactive compounds 3acrops 3acucumbers 3adietary supplements 3aexperimental design 3afirmness 3aflavonoids 3afoliar application 3afruit quality 3afruit weight 3afruit yield 3afruits 3ahydroponics 3asalicylic acid 3avegetable growing 3awinter1 aReyes-Pérez, Juan  José1 aRamírez-Rodríguez, Silvia  Citlaly1 aSalas-Pérez, Lilia 1 aFortis-Hernández, Manuel 1 aMurillo Amador, Bernardo,1 aTroyo-Diéguez, Enrique 0 tPlants.g2019 Feb. 16, v. 8, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants80200443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03614naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245010800173520219900281592002802480650002702508650001202535650001802547650001302565650001202578650002102590650002802611650001602639650002002655650001402675650002002689650001902709650001602728650001602744653001602760653002702776653001902803653003002822653002002852700001602872700001402888700001602902700001602918773009902934856009003033852000903123655001203132IND60731346520221120123032.0220124e20210630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073134652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.7366422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Xiaolong10aEffects of light cycle on circadian feeding activity and digestive physiology in Haliotis discus hannai  aThe abalone Haliotis discus hannai is a typical nocturnal animal. It generally feeds and moves at night but evades light by hiding in the shade during the day. However, the effects of different light cycles on the feeding physiology and potential molecular mechanisms responsible for such effects in H. discus hannai have not yet been reported. We examined the feeding patterns of abalones under different light (L)/dark (D) cycles (0 L:24D, 12 L:12D, 24 L:0D) using an infrared camera and analyzed the relationships between circadian digestive enzyme activities, gene expression levels of neuropeptide Y (NPY) and its receptor (NPYR), which can promote appetite, and feeding rhythms. Feeding in abalones, including searching for food and, food capture and intake, was examined by observation of videos. The percentage of abalones feeding under different light/dark cycles had two peaks, at 20:00–22:00 and 02:00–04:00. The ingestion rate was significantly higher in abalones maintained under 12 L:12D compared with 24 L:0D conditions. The percentage of feeding individuals and food intake were significantly lower in the “daytime” compared with at “night” irrespective of the light/dark cycle, suggesting the existence of an independent internal timing mechanism and the possible involvement of circadian clock genes in the regulation of periodic feeding activity in abalones. In abalones maintained under 12 L:12D and 24 L:0D cycles, protease, cellulase, and α-amylase activities started to increase from 18:00, 2 h before the first peak of food intake. Expression levels of NPY peaked at 20:00 and expression levels of NPYR increased again at 04:00, suggesting that NPY and NPYR might be induced before and after the two peak periods of food intake in abalones, respectively. These findings demonstrate the feeding rhythm and ingestion rate of abalones under different light/dark cycles, as well as the relationships among digestive enzyme activities, gene expression levels of NPY and NPYR, and feeding activity, which in turn provides a useful reference for the development of optimal feeding strategies and improved food utilization in abalone aquaculture production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaliotis discus hannai 3aabalone 3aalpha-amylase 3aappetite 3acameras 3acircadian clocks 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3afood intake 3agene expression 3aingestion 3amollusc culture 3aneuropeptide Y 3aphotoperiod 3aproteinases 0aLight cycle 0aHaliotis discus hannai 0aFeeding rhythm 0aDigestive enzyme activity 0aGene expression1 aPang, Gewen1 aLuo, Xuan1 aYou, Weiwei1 aKe, Caihuan0 tAquaculture.g2021 June 30, v. 539 p.736642-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.7366423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01736naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002500112245008900137300001600226520063800242650001900880650001800899650000900917650001700926650001800943650001900961650002300980650001201003650002201015650001201037650001201049650002301061651001801084700002101102773016501123856007701288852000901365655001201374IND60569896020221119180502.0170620e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056989602DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWolf, Christopher A.10aCow Welfare in the U.S. Dairy Industry: Willingness-to-Pay and Willingness-to-Supply  ap. 164-179.  aConsumers are increasingly scrutinizing the animal welfare implications of modern agricultural production processes.

Tests were performed either with primary antibodies labelled with horseradish peroxidase or with alkaline phosphatase-labelled secondary antibodies reacting with specifically bound rabbit anti-duck IgY antibodies, respectively. Ra-specific IgYs in egg yolk from three ducks increased rapidly at day 8 after the first of two vaccinations. In two ducks, the IgY titre persisted on a high plateau for 3 months. The concentration of Ra-specific IgYs in the serum of the progeny of vaccinees decreased between day 3 and day 10 after hatching. The fraction of total IgYs decreased less but also significantly. It was shown that antibodies were vertically transmitted and therefore protect offspring against Ra infection at least during the first week after hatching. The test design with anti-IgY rabbit antibodies is further suitable to detect other specific antibodies if respective antigens were fixed on solid phases. 3aRiemerella anatipestifer 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3ablood serum 3aducks 3aegg yolk 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ahatching 3aimmunoglobulin Y 3aperoxidase 3aprogeny 3arabbits 3avaccination1 aSchlatterer, B.0 tJournal of veterinary medicine.

Pteridietum is classified into six types according to its pattern of local distribution. Bracken communities as animal habitat are considered in relation to distribution types, frond density and canopy cover. As a direct source of food for the vertebrates bracken is considered to be of little or no value. As an indirect source of food bracken communities may be important in providing habitats for invertebrates, though in terms of numbers of species the insect fauna of vigorous Pteridietum is not great compared with that of other communities that may replace it. Pteridietum provides shelter and cover for a number of small mammals but in these respects it is of very limited value to the larger grazing animals. It is estimated that in Scotland, under the economic conditions of recent years, bracken herbicide is unlikely to be used on more than about 40,470 ha (100,000 acres) in the combined land uses of agriculture, forestry and sport; i.e. less than 25% of the Scottish bracken coverage is at risk. At this level of control, provided some precautions are taken, it is considered that the wild vertebrates are unlikely to be seriously affected; indeed in certain situations some benefits may be derived. 3aanimal communities 3acanopy 3afauna 3aferns and fern allies 3afoods 3afronds 3ahabitats 3aherbicides 3ahighlands 3ainvertebrates 3aland use 3arisk 3asmall mammals 3asoil 3asports 3aScotland1 aPATERSON, I.S.0 tBotanical journal of the Linnean Society.g1976 , v. 73, no. 1/3 p.269-283dBlackwell Publishing Ltdw60042x0024-40747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8339.1976.tb02026.x 7aarticle02576naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001300152245010700165300001600272520149700288650001101785650002301796650001901819650001001838650001001848650001001858650001001868650001801878650001001896650002001906650001101926651002101937773009901958852000902057856009202066939003302158946001102191655001202202IND4464277320221119180425.0121009e200306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446427732DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1439-0450.2003.00667.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUmur, S.10aPrevalence and Economic Importance of Cystic Echinococcosis in Slaughtered Ruminants in Burdur, Turkey  ap. 247-252.  aThis study was conducted between April 2000 and March 2001, in 12-month period. During the study, local slaughterhouses were visited periodically for 1 year to examine the internal organs (livers, lungs, spleens and hearts) for the presence of cysts and total 1355 cattle, 218 sheep and 104 goats were examined for the cystic echinococcosis (CE). It was found that 13.5% of cattle, 26.6% of sheep and 22.1% of goats were infected with this disease. While cysts in cattle (P < 0.001) and goats (P > 0.05) were found mostly in lungs (88.5 and 82.6%, respectively), but they were mostly found in livers (P > 0.05) in sheep. In addition to this, three spleens and one heart in cattle were infected with CE. In this study, the prevalence of CE and the number of cysts in ruminants were found different when the cattle, sheep and goats examined were stratified based on age. The prevalence and the number of cysts increased with age approaching an asymptotic prevalence of one in the oldest animals (P < 0.05). The number of cysts in cattle, sheep and goats were increasing at a rate of 0.31, 0.63 and 0.42/year, respectively. The economic decrease in the value of the carcasses because of the discarded liver and lung as a result of CE was estimated as 1.1% ($7.5 per cattle) for cattle, 4.37% ($3.2 per sheep) for sheep and 4.26% ($2.9 per goat) for goats. The minimum total loss for all infected animals was determined to be $583 in infected animals, based on the market prices in the year 2002. 3acattle 3adisease prevalence 3aechinococcosis 3agoats 3aheart 3aliver 3alungs 3amarket prices 3asheep 3aslaughterhouses 3aspleen 3aTurkey (country)0 tJournal of veterinary medicine.

Study Design: Case report. Animals: A 21 kg, 7-year-old, male intact mixed breed dog. Methods: Two skin stretchers were applied to the site of the thoracodorsal axial pattern flap 4 days before surgery. The elastic cables connecting the adhesive pads were tightened daily to increase the skin available for a peninsular thoracodorsal axial pattern flap, which was created and rotated 180° to cover an antebrachial defect to a level 2 cm proximal to the carpus. Results: The entire flap survived; there was a small amount of incisional separation at the distal margin of the flap that healed without further treatment.

It was found that in addition to yield variance of 16 and 465 mg/kg depending upon origin, the propolis could be differentiated by their chemical composition. In particular, upon the common constituents, alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, trans-verbenol, alpha-copaene, beta-bourbonene, beta-caryophyllene, spathulenol and caryophyllene oxide, which were found in higher content in the propolis from stingless bees. 3acapillary gas chromatography 3amedicinal properties 3achemical analysis 3avolatile organic compounds 3apropolis 3astingless bees 3amass spectrometry 3aMexico 0ahoney bees1 aMarbot, R.1 aDelgado, A.1 aZumarraga, C.1 aSauri, E.0 tJournal of essential oil research.g2006 , v. 18, no. 1 p.53-56x1041-29057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10412905.2006.96993843Available from publisher's Web site  a20060413b20060529c00000000  aINDdPNNe2006/02/28  aOther US 7aarticle02259naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002600152245007800178300001600256520111600272650002101388650001001409650001001419650002201429650001401451650001401465653003001479653002301509653002401532653002401556653001801580653002401598773011801622852000901740856009201749930003301841946001101874655001201885IND4409806320221119180532.0080905e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440980632DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2311.2008.00987.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMAJERUS, MICHAEL E.N.10aNon-morph specific predation of peppered moths (Biston betularia) by bats  ap. 679-683.  a1. Industrial melanism in the peppered moth, Biston betularia, is one of the foremost examples of natural selection in action. 2. Differential bird predation was suggested as the main agent for the evolution of melanism in the peppered moth by Tutt in the 1890s, with empirical support being published by Kettlewell in the 1950s. 3. Some recent critiques that have attempted to undermine Kettlewell's work have lacked objectivity, and have been answered previously. 4. One criticism that has not previously been addressed is that of the role of bat predation in the case. 5. The difficulty of using non-visual differential predation by bats to explain the increase and decrease in melanism in the peppered moth, correlated as it is to pollution levels, is outlined. 6. Predation experiments, in which moths of the typica and carbonaria forms of the peppered moth were released and observed at night, were used to determine whether bats differentially predate these forms. 7. Results of experiments at three sites showed no significant differences in the level of bat predation of the two forms of peppered moth. 3aBiston betularia 3abirds 3amoths 3anatural selection 3apollution 3apredation 0aAnti-Darwinian literature 0aBernard Kettlewell 0aevolution in action 0aindustrial melanism 0apeppered moth 0aselective predation0 tEcological entomology.g2008 Oct., v. 33, no. 5 p.679-683dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0307-69467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2311.2008.00987.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080905b20081011c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02103naa a2200349 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002000115245012600135300001400261300002800275500001500303520107600318650001001394650001801404650002301422653001701445653003101462653002301493653001901516700001901535700002401554700001801578773008401596852000901680939003301689945000801722946001101730655001201741991565711880742620221119180542.0820511e198201  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI820006882DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorgan, Jane B.12aA study of the thermic responses to a meal and to a sympathomimetic drug (ephedrine) in relation to energy balance in man  ap. 21-32.  ap. 21-32. ill., charts.  a2019-12-05  aEnergy expenditure was determined for 8 lean adult males in a high-energy intake (HEI) group and 8 in a low-energy intake (LEI) group, using open-circuit indirect calorimetry. Resting metabolic rate (RMR) was recorded, followed by a 2.1 or 4.2 MJ meal, ephedrine-HCL (0.25 and 0.50 mg/kg), or a water control, with metabolic rate (MR) measured for 4 hours. Blood serum, before and 1 hour after the meal (or drug) was analyzed. Thermic response to feeding was related to meal size in both groups. MR increased 21.6 and 28.6% in the HEI group and 8.2 and 20.0% in the LEI group for the 2.1 and 4.2 MJ meals, respectively. Fasting insulin levels were similar in both groups, but was significantly higher in the LEI group after the meals. RMR increased 5.2 and 10.3% in the LEI and 15.7 and 11.2% in the HEI after 0.25 and 0.50 mg/kg ephedrine, respectively, with serum free fatty acids significantly higher in the HEI group. The results suggested that meal size for maximum thermic effect is smaller and sensitivity to ephedrine higher in energetically-inefficient subjects. 3amales 3aenergy intake 3aenergy expenditure 0adrug effects 0aBasal Metabolic Rate (BMR) 0aEnergy measurement 0aenergy balance1 aYork, David A.1 aWasilewska, Amanda.1 aPortman, Jan.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g1982 Jan., v. 47, no. 1 p.21-32x0007-11457nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19820511c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US 7aarticle01962naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001800171245006200189300001600251500002400267520087800291650002401169650000901193650001201202650001001214650001801224650002001242650001201262650001401274650001201288650001201300650001101312650003301323650000901356650002601365773010901391852000901500856005501509655001201564IND4432270620221119180451.0100205e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443227062DNAL7 a204091592pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2656.2009.01649.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJokela, Jukka10aTransgenerational immune priming as cryptic parental care  ap. 305-307.  aIncludes references  aO.

Journal of Animal Ecology, 79, 403-413. Eggs are relatively large and can provide offspring with resources that improve their survival. While such maternal effects are common, it has been difficult to imagine what, other than genes, individual offspring could receive from their fathers. The study by Roth et al. (2009a) suggests that we should look more closely. Their experiments show that red flour beetle fathers can transfer specific biochemical information to their offspring, priming their immune system to combat pathogens better. When mothers do the same, the offspring get a double dose of protection. This discovery alerts us to re-evaluate the importance of cryptic parental care. 3aTribolium castaneum 3aeggs 3afathers 3agenes 3aimmune system 3amaternal effect 3amothers 3apathogens 3aprogeny 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aImmunity, Innateximmunology 2aMale 2aTriboliumximmunology0 tjournal of animal ecology.g2010 Mar., v. 79, no. 2 p.305-307dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0021-87907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2009.01649.x 7aarticle01951naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072001700149072001700166072001700183100001700200245013900217300001400356520069300370650002301063650002001086650001601106650001701122650002001139650001901159650001901178650002501197650003101222651001501253700001901268773008501287852000901372856008901381930003301470945002501503946001301528655001201541IND4377879220221119180558.0060214e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437787922DNAL7 a10.1080/10412905.2006.96993782doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Effects on hydraulic and cell wall properties  ap. 1049-1056.  aThe underlying mechanism of photoinhibition of stem elongation by blue (BL) and red light (RL) was studied in etiolated seedlings of pea (Pisum sativum L. cv Alaska). Brief BL irradiations resulted in fast transient inhibition of elongation, while a delayed (lag approximately 60 minutes) but prolonged inhibition was observed after brief RL. Possible changes in the hydraulic and wall properties of the growing cells during photoinhibition were examined. Cell sap osmotic pressure was unaffected by BL and RL, but both irradiations increased turgor pressure by approximately 0.05 megapascal (pressure-probe technique). Cell wall yielding was analyzed by in vivo stress relaxation (pressure-block technique). BL and RL reduced the initial rate of relaxation by 38 and 54%, while the final amount of relaxation was decreased by 48 and 10%, respectively. These results indicate that RL inhibits elongation mainly by lowering the wall yield coefficient, while most of the inhibitory effect of BL was due to an increase of the yield threshold. Mechanical extensibility of cell walls (instron technique) was decreased by BL and RL, mainly due to a reduction in the plastic component of extensibility. Thus, photoinhibitions of elongation by both BL and RL are achieved through changes in cell wall properties, and are not due to effects on the hydraulic properties of the cell. 3aPisum sativum 3aseedlings 3astems 3aphotoinhibition 3ablue light 3ared light 3acell walls 3amathematical models 0ahydraulic potential 0agrowth1 aCosgrove, D.J.0 tPlant physiology.g1991 Apr., v. 95, no. 4 p.1049-1056x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03014naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245011500172300001600287520192400303653000802227653002702235653001002262653002202272700001802294700001302312700001802325700001602343700001702359700001602376773012702392852000902519856009202528930003302620946001102653655001202664IND4407701520221119180435.0080712e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440770152DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1463-1326.2008.00850.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScherbaum, W.A.10aEfficacy and tolerability of vildagliptin in drug-naïve patients with type 2 diabetes and mild hyperglycaemia  ap. 675-682.  aThis study was conducted to assess efficacy and tolerability of vildagliptin in drug-naïve patients with type 2 diabetes and mild hyperglycaemia. Multicentre, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of 52-week treatment with vildagliptin (50 mg q.d.) in 306 drug-naïve patients with type 2 diabetes (A1C = 6.2-7.5%). A1C, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and measures of prandial glucose control and beta-cell function determined during standard meal tests were assessed. Baseline A1C and FPG averaged 6.7% and 7.1 mmol/l, respectively, in patients randomized to vildagliptin (n = 156) and 6.8% and 7.2 mmol/l in those randomized to placebo (n = 150). A1C decreased modestly in vildagliptin-treated patients (Δ = -0.2 ± 0.1%) and increased in patients receiving placebo (Δ = 0.1 ± 0.1%). The between-group difference (vildagliptin - placebo) in adjusted mean change (AMΔ) in A1C was -0.3 ± 0.1% (p < 0.001). FPG increased in patients receiving placebo (Δ = 0.5 ± 0.1 mmol/l) and to a significantly lesser extent in vildagliptin-treated patients (between-group difference in AMΔ FPG = -0.4 ± 0.2 mmol/l, p = 0.032). Relative to placebo, 2-h postprandial glucose (PPG) decreased (-0.9 ± 0.4 mmol/l, p = 0.012), and insulin secretory rate (ISR) relative to glucose [ISR area under the curve (AUC)₀₋₂ h/glucose AUC₀₋₂ h] increased (+5.0 ± 1.2 pmol/min/m²/mM, p < 0.001). Mean body weight decreased by 0.5 ± 0.3 kg in vildagliptin-treated patients and by 0.2 ± 0.3 kg in patients receiving placebo. The side-effect profile of vildagliptin was similar to that of placebo, and one hypoglycaemic episode occurred in one patient receiving placebo. In drug-naïve patients with mild hyperglycaemia, relative to placebo, 52-week treatment with vildagliptin 50 mg q.d. significantly decreases A1C, FPG and PPG and improves beta-cell function without weight gain or hypoglycaemia. 0aA1C 0adipeptidyl peptidase-4 0aGLP-1 0aincretin hormones1 aSchweizer, A.1 aMari, A.1 aNilsson, P.M.1 aLalanne, G.1 aJauffret, S.1 aFoley, J.E.0 tDiabetes, obesity & metabolism.g2008 Aug., v. 10, no. 8 p.675-682dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1462-89027nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1463-1326.2008.00850.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080712b20080801c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01959naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245009200145300001800237500001500255520092700270650001501197650002501212650001801237650002601255650002601281650002101307650001001328650002401338653001701362653001901379700001401398700001501412700001501427773007601442852000901518939003301527946001301560655001201573IND9102365820221119180419.0910604e199104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910236582DNAL7 a166680932pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKiyosue, T.10aPurification and immunohistochemical detection of an embryogenic cell protein in carrot  ap. 1077-1083.  a2019-12-04  aAn embryogenic cell protein from carrot (Daucus carota L.), designated ECP31 for embryogenic cell protein and with a relative mass of 31,000, was purified by sequential column chromatographies. Its apparent relative mass was estimated to be 120,000 by gel filtration. Immunoblotting and immunohistochemical studies showed that ECP31 was preferentially localized in the peripheral cells of clusters of embryogenic cells in the presence of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and disappeared during the course of somatic embryogenesis in the absence of 2,4-D. ECP31 began to accumulate on the 33rd day after initiation of cultures of hypocotyl segments on Murashige-Skoog medium with 2,4-D, when callus began to appear on the segments. In dry seeds, lower amounts of ECP31 were located throughout the entire zygotic embryos but not in endosperm. ECP31 was also detected in provascular tissue of malformed somatic embryos. 3ahypocotyls 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aDaucus carota 3asomatic embryogenesis 3amonoclonal antibodies 3amolecular weight 3a2,4-D 3aprotein composition 0apurification 0aembryo (plant)1 aSatoh, S.1 aKamada, H.1 aHarada, H.0 tPlant physiology.g1991 Apr., v. 95, no. 4 p.1077-1083x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03316naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245019700165300001600362500001500378520217800393650002102571650000902592650001502601651001202616651001802628653002702646653002902673700002202702773011602724852000902840856008502849930003302934946001102967655001202978IND4408523420221119180437.0080801e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440852342DNAL7 a10.1007/s00254-007-1033-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKatz, Brian G. 10aUsing chemical and microbiological indicators to track the impacts from the land application of treated municipal wastewater and other sources on groundwater quality in a karstic springs basin  ap. 801-821.  a2019-12-04  aMultiple chemical constituents (nutrients; N, O, H, C stable isotopes; 64 organic wastewater compounds, 16 pharmaceutical compounds) and microbiological indicators were used to assess the impact on groundwater quality from the land application of approximately 9.5 million liters per day of treated municipal sewage effluent to a sprayfield in the 960-km² Ichetucknee Springs basin, northern Florida. Enriched stable isotope signatures (δ¹⁸O and δ²H) were found in water from the effluent reservoir and a sprayfield monitoring well (MW-7) due to evaporation; however, groundwater samples downgradient from the sprayfield have δ¹⁸O and δ²H concentrations that represented recharge of meteoric water. Boron and chloride concentrations also were elevated in water from the sprayfield effluent reservoir and MW-7, but concentrations in groundwater decreased substantially with distance downgradient to background levels in the springs (about 12 km) and indicated at least a tenfold dilution factor. Nitrate-nitrogen isotope (δ¹⁵N-NO₃) values above 10 [per thousand] in most water samples were indicative of organic nitrogen sources except Blue Hole Spring (δ¹⁵N-NO₃ = 4.6-4.9 [per thousand]), which indicated an inorganic source of nitrogen (fertilizers). The detection of low concentrations the insect repellent N,N-diethyl-metatoluamide (DEET), and other organic compounds associated with domestic wastewater in Devil's Eye Spring indicated that leakage from a nearby septic tank drainfield likely has occurred. Elevated levels of fecal coliforms and enterococci were found in Blue Hole Spring during higher flow conditions, which likely resulted from hydraulic connections to upgradient sinkholes and are consistent with previoius dye-trace studies. Enteroviruses were not detected in the sprayfield effluent reservoir, but were found in low concentrations in water samples from a downgradient well and Blue Hole Spring during high-flow conditions indicating a human wastewater source. The Upper Floridan aquifer in the Ichetucknee Springs basin is highly vulnerable to contamination from multiple anthropogenic sources throughout the springs basin. 3aland application 3adeet 3awastewater 3aFlorida 0aUnited States 0aUpper Floridan aquifer 0aPharmaceutical compounds1 aGriffin, Dale W. 0 tEnvironmental geology.g2008 Aug., v. 55, no. 4 p.801-821dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0943-01057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00254-007-1033-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080801b20080801c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02258naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245010000126300001600226520108500242650002101327650001701348650001501365650001801380650001001398650002301408650001601431650001601447650002301463650001501486653001001501653001701511653001501528653002201543653003201565700001301597700001401610700001801624700001601642773008801658852000901746930003301755945001301788946001101801655001201812IND2042048420221119180427.0940916s1991    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204204842DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPellmyr, O.10aCycad cone and angiosperm floral volatiles: inferences for the evolution of insect pollinations  ap. 623-627.  aThe chemistry of the volatile emissions of male cones of four putatively insect-pollinated cycad (Cycadales) species and cones of both sexes of one wind-pollinated cycad species was analysed using GC-MS. Zamia furfuracea, Macrozamia moorei, and Encephalartos altensteinii had blends consisting primarily of monoterpenoids, benzenoids, and, in two cases, a di-unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon, while that of Zamia pumila was dominated by methyl salicylate, with sesquiterpenes and aliphatic hydrocarbons also present. In contrast, the wind-pollinated Cycas rumphii contained a series of highly volatile alcohols, ketones and esters. The compound classes found in the cycads are potent herbivore deterrents, and there is no apparent difference in this regard between insect- and wind-pollinated species. The results suggest convergent evolution in the gymnospermous cycads and magnoliid angiosperms of the olfactory cues that attract pollinating insects; the data are consistent with the hypothesis that early chemical attractants for pollinators evolved from herbivore deterrents. 3aZamia furfuracea 3aZamia pumila 3aMacrozamia 3aEncephalartos 3aCycas 3avolatile compounds 3apollination 3apollinators 3adefense mechanisms 3aherbivores 0acones 0acycas ruphii 0amale cones 0amacrozamia moorei 0aencephalartos alstensteinii1 aTang, W.1 aGroth, I.1 aBergstrom, G.1 aThien, L.B.0 tBiochemical systematics and ecology.g1991, v. 19, no. 8 p.623-627x0305-19787nnas  aDNAL  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02112naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072001700149072001700166072001700183100001400200245015500214300001600369500001500385520056800400650002500968650002200993650002601015650001901041650001501060650002101075650001901096650003101115650001701146650002301163650002301186650002601209651001101235653002901246653002201275700001901297700001401316700002001330773008701350852000901437856008901446930003301535945002501568946001301593655001201606IND4377029220221119180406.0060106e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437702922DNAL7 a10.1080/10412905.2005.96990362doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Total 131 environmental samples were screened using the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the highly conserved 5'-nontranslated regions (5'-NTR). Among these enterovirus RNA-positive samples, 32, 15 and 6 of the samples were recovered from surface water, ground water and sewage water respectively. However, the total positive detection rate increased to 40·5% with the application of seminested PCR. Sequencing revealed that the majority of isolates belonged to the following genotypes: coxsackie A2 (35·8%), coxsackie A6 (13·2%) and enterovirus (EV)71 (11·3%); echovirus 11, porcine EV9 and coxsackie A16 isolates were also observed. This study confirms that the major epidemic genotypes of enterovirus are prevalent in the surface and ground water of Taiwan. This study is helpful in understanding the significance and epidemiology of the virus within and beyond the study area. Moreover, it was possible to predict the enterovirus genotype and evaluate possible correlations between water contamination and viral sequences found among clinical samples. 3aEnterovirus 3aRNA 3aepidemiology 3agenotype 3agroundwater 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asurface water 3aswine 3aviruses 3awastewater 3awater pollution 2aBase Sequence 2aEnterovirusxclassificationxgenetics. 2aFresh Water 2aGenome, Viral 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA, Viralxanalysis 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aSewage 2aWater Microbiology 3aTaiwan 0aTaiwan 0aenvironmental water 0amolecular detection1 aHsu, B.-M.1 aWan, M.-T.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2008 Mar., v. 104, no. 3 p.817-823dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1364-50727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.2007.03598.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080218b20080301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01199naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245003800132300001500170520047400185650001100659650001400670650001700684650001700701650001100718650001500729653002100744773006900765852000900834939003300843945000800876946001300884655001200897991565707650742620221119180455.0860623e198504  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI860107822DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKinney, W.P.14aThe right fryer is the best fryer  ap. 46- 75.  aAn overview on deep fat fryers for food service operations emphasizes and explains the importance of fryer design and construction in providing quality cooked foods.

The hypothesis tested was that leaf essential oil phenotypes would have differential effects in vitro on these endophytic species. Another objective was to determine whether differences in response to redwood essential oils existed among pathogens isolated from redwood and a mutualistic endophyte never isolated from redwood. These species were: Botrytis cinerea, an opportunist generalist pathogen able to attack redwood; Pestalotiopsis funerea, Phomopsis occulta and Seiridium juniperi, actual or potential conifer pathogens isolated as leaf endophytes in redwood; Cryptosporiopsis abietina, a common conifer endophyte with uncertain ecological status isolated from redwood; and Meria parkeri, a mutualistic endophyte known only from Douglas fir. The four essential oil phenotypes were uniformly inhibitory for some species and differentially so for others. Susceptibility to the four phenotypes varied widely within and among fungus species. The conifer-specific pathogens were the least susceptible and the Douglas fir endophyte the most; the other two displayed intermediate susceptibility. The diversity of responses by these fungus species suggests that these redwood terpenoids may have a differential intra- and interspecific importance in preventing pathogenic activity in the species found within redwood foliage. 3aendophytes 3aterpenoids 3aessential oils 3aantifungal properties 3aconifer needles 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aSequoia sempervirens 0afungi1 aLangenheim, J.H.0 tBiochemical systematics and ecology.g1991, v. 19, no. 8 p.629-642x0305-19787nnas  aDNAL  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02826naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245015000173300001600323500002400339500001500363520144200378650001901820650001701839650002001856650001801876650002001894650001301914650003001927650002101957650001101978650002601989650001402015650001702029650001002046650001402056650001102070650002702081650001602108653001502124700002202139700002102161773011002182852000902292856005502301655001202356IND4418914620221119175852.0090410e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441891462DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-3040.2009.01949.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aATWELL, BRIAN J.10aDoes soil nitrogen influence growth, water transport and survival of snow gum (Eucalyptus pauciflora Sieber ex Sprengel.) under CO₂ enrichment?  ap. 553-566.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aEucalyptus pauciflora Sieber ex Sprengel. (snow gum) was grown under ambient (370 μL L⁻¹) and elevated (700 μL L⁻¹) atmospheric [CO₂] in open-top chambers (OTCs) in the field and temperature-controlled glasshouses. Nitrogen applications to the soil ranged from 0.1 to 2.75 g N per plant. Trees in the field at high N levels grew rapidly during summer, particularly in CO₂-enriched atmosphere, but suffered high mortality during summer heatwaves. Generally, wider and more numerous secondary xylem vessels at the root-shoot junction in CO₂-enriched trees conferred fourfold higher below-ground hydraulic conductance. Enhanced hydraulic capacity was typical of plants at elevated [CO₂] (in which root and shoot growth was accelerated), but did not result from high N supply. However, because high rates of N application consistently made trees prone to dehydration during heatwaves, glasshouse studies were required to identify the effect of N nutrition on root development and hydraulics. While the effects of elevated [CO₂] were again predominantly on hydraulic conductivity, N nutrition acted specifically by constraining deep root penetration into soil. Specifically, 15-40% shallower root systems supported marginally larger shoot canopies. Independent changes to hydraulics and root penetration have implications for survival of fertilized trees under elevated atmospheric [CO₂], particularly during water stress. 3acarbon dioxide 3aroot systems 3asecondary xylem 3axylem vessels 3afluid mechanics 3anitrogen 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3afertilizer rates 3ashoots 3aEucalyptus pauciflora 3anutrition 3awater stress 3atrees 3amortality 3asummer 3ahydraulic conductivity 3agreenhouses 0aatmosphere1 aHENERY, MARTIN L.1 aBALL, MARILYN C.0 tPlant, cell and environment.g2009 May, v. 32, no. 5 p.553-566dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0140-77917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3040.2009.01949.x 7aarticle01655naa a2200325 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002500115245005100140300001400191300002200205500001500227520077600242650003701018650002101055650001601076650002401092653001701116653001401133653001701147653002401164773006601188852000901254939003301263945000801296946001301304655001201317991565704560742620221119180117.0810507e198101  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI810009852DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeckinger, Gerald E.10aEnergy conservation in the restaurant industry  ap. 36-38.  ap. 36-38. charts.  a2019-12-06  aThe food service industry is highly dependent on energy. Conservation measures can help alleviate higher energy costs by increasing energy availability. The most important practice a manager can do today is to eliminate energy waste. Proper equipment upkeep and sound operating procedures should be stressed. Load control systems can limit the rate of energy consumption during peak demand periods. Chemical dishwashers and electric igniters may also save utility costs. Food service personnel should be trained in energy conservation. The heating, ventilating, air-conditioning and food preparation operations in the Sambo Restaurant in Colonie, NY have been designed specifically to conserve and reclaim energy.

Serotype and phage type of the strains identified as Salmonella was determined. In the captive group, of the 285 samples examined, 21 (7.36%) were positive for Salmonella. Serotyping revealed that most of the individuals were infected by Salmonella serotype Havana. This result suggested that there could be a source of contamination in the Hospital although it could not be established. In the wild free-living group, over 310 samples examined (4.19%) were positive for Salmonella. The Salmonella isolates showed a major variety of serotypes: Enteritidis, Adelaide, Brandenburg, Newport, Typhimurium, Hadar, Saintpaul and Virchow. Most of them are similar to those commonly described in isolates from human and domestic animals. These results indicate that wild birds could be involved in the dissemination of Salmonella in humans or domestic animals or vice versa. 3aSalmonella 3abacteriophages 3acaptive animals 3adomestic animals 3afeces 3ahospitals 3ahumans 3aselective media 3aserotypes 3awild birds 3awildlife 3aSpain1 aJimenez, P.A.1 aAlvarez, F.1 aGarcia de los Rios, J.E.1 aRojas, A.M.1 aPedro, P. de0 tJournal of veterinary medicine.

The content of total extractable phenols was higher in younger leaves in Quercus ilex Linn, Quercus semecarpifolia Sm and Quercus serrata Roxb, whereas in Quercus glauca Thunb the content was higher in the mature leaves. In all species studied, condensed tannins increased with maturation. Protein precipitation capacity had a trend similar to that of total phenols. In Q serrate and Q semecarpifolia the apparent degree of polymerisation increased, and the content of protein precipitable phenolics and specific activity decreased as the leaves matured. The decrease in protein precipitation capacity with maturation in these two species may be explained by both the decrease in the content and the change in the nature of phenols capable of binding proteins. Protein precipitation capacity was not detectable in Q ilex leaves.

Blocks containing liquid condensed solubles and dried distillers grain with solubles as the base material and protein source were prepared with different cementing agents. A method for testing the hardness of blocks, an index of the physical durability, was also developed. The hardness of blocks was positively related to the concentration of magnesium oxide and to the length of storage time. Ferrous sulphate, on the other hand, had a synergistic effect with magnesium oxide which accelerated the setting of blocks after 24 h. A feeding trial revealed a negative relationship between daily intake by cattle and hardness of blocks. Blocks prepared with about 4% magnesium oxide and 3% ferrous sulphate provide a dry, weather-resistant supplement with a degree of hardness that allows an optimum rate of intake. 3acattle 3afeeds 3afeed intake 3amagnesium oxide 3afood storage 3ahardness 3aferrous sulfate 3adietary supplements 0adistillery effluent 0apoured block1 aDeyoe, C.W.1 aBehnke, K.C.1 aSeib, P.A.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1991, v. 54, no. 4 p.535-547x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02386naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002900145245005600174300001500230500002400245520137100269650001601640650001501656650002101671650002101692650001101713650002101724650001501745650001901760650002401779650002601803650002501829700002101854773009201875852000901967856004801976655001202024IND4414197820221119180052.0081226e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441419782DNAL7 a10.1007/s00271-008-0125-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChowdhary, Neelam Patel.10aEffect of subsurface drip irrigation on onion yield  ap. 97-108.  aIncludes references  aSubsurface drip system is the latest method of irrigation. The design of subsurface drip system involves consideration of structure and texture of soil, and crop's root development pattern. A 3-year experiment was conducted on onion (Allium Cepa L., cv. Creole Red) in a sandy loam soil from October to May in 2002-2003, 2003-2004 and 2004-2005 to study the effect of depth of placement of drip lateral and different levels of irrigation on yield. Tests for uniformity of water application through the system were carried out in December of each year. Three different irrigation levels of 60, 80 and 100% of the crop evapotranspiration and six placement depths of the drip laterals (surface (0), 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 cm) were maintained in the study. Onion yield was significantly affected by the placement depth of the drip lateral. Maximum yield (25.7 t ha⁻¹) was obtained by applying the 60.7 cm of irrigation water and by placing the drip lateral at 10 cm soil depth. Maximum irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) (0.55 t ha⁻¹ cm⁻¹) was obtained by placing the drip lateral at 10 cm depth. The greater vertical movement of water in the sandy-loam soil took place because of the predominant role of gravity rather than that of the capillary forces. Therefore, placement of drip lateral at shallow depths is recommended in onion crop to get higher yield. 3aAllium cepa 3acrop yield 3airrigation rates 3airrigation water 3aonions 3asandy loam soils 3asoil depth 3asoil structure 3asoil water movement 3asubsurface irrigation 3awater use efficiency1 aRajput, T.

Growing and desiccated plants differed significantly in their percentage of glucose (3.1,0.2%), sucrose (6.9, 23.1%) and trehalose (89.8, 75.6%). The apparent stoichiometry between the decrease in sucrose and increase in trehalose concentration after rehydration suggests that sucrose serves as the carbon source for trehalose synthesis. A comparison of extraction methods revealed that using "Boileezers" in Soxhlets resulted in sugar degradation ranging from 25 to 75%. Extraction by shaking in 80% ethanol appeared to be the best extraction method. 3aPolypodiopsida 3asucrose 3atrehalose 3aferns and fern allies 3aleaves 0asugars 0adesiccation1 aKendall, E.1 aKartha, K.K.0 tBiochemical systematics and ecology.g1990, v. 18, no. 2/3 p.107-110x0305-19787nnas  aDNAL  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01476naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245005600126300001600182500001500198520042900213650001800642650001400660650001500674650003600689650001800725650002300743651001000766653002200776653001200798653002300810700001400833700001500847700001600862700001400878700001500892773009300907852000901000930003301009945001301042946001101055655001201066IND2041026920221119174734.0940725e199307  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204102692DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiner, R.M.12aA chemotaxonomic survey of Sonchus subgenus Sonchus  ap. 617-620.  a2019-12-05  aFive species of Sonchus subgenus Sonchus were surveyed for their phenolic constituents.

A marked decrease in solid content and the formation of ethanol and lactic acid may account for the difference in iron absorption. In addition, Fe chelators may be produced by micro-organisms. The presence of ethanol potentiated iron absorption; however, solid material greatly inhibited iron absorption, particularly when the solid content was 100 gram/liter or more. Starch may be the solid which interferes with iron absorption. Iron absorption was 4 times greater from a 2 ml/l lactic acid solution than from a hydrocholoric acid solution. Adding lactic acid to a gruel containing 200 g solids/l increased the mean iron abosrption. 3aSorghum (Poaceae) 3airon 3acorn 3abrewing 3alactic acid 3astarch 3aethanol 3abeers 3airon absorption 2aBeer 2aEdible Grain. 2aEthanolxpharmacology 2aFemale 2aFermentation 2aFerritinsxblood 2aHemoglobinsxanalysis 2aHumans 2aIntestinal Absorptionxdrug effects 2aIronxbloodxmetabolism. 2aIron Radioisotopes 2aLactatesxpharmacology 2aMale 2aZea mays1 aBothwell, T.H.1 aTorrance, J.D.1 aBezwoda, W.R.1 aMacPhail, A.P.1 aKew, M.C.1 aSayers, M.H.1 aDisler, P.B.1 aCharlton, R.W.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g1980 Mar., v. 43, no. 2 p.271-279x0007-11457nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830725c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US 7aarticle01170naa a2200253 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097245002800115300001200143520050000155650001200655650001600667650001600683653002300699653004600722773007300768852000900841939003300850945000800883946001300891655001200904991565699780742620221119174725.0800717e197903  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI800015372DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL10aNatural raisin replacer  ap. 104.  aBakers and other food processors faced with severe 1979 raisin shortages could use a raisin replacer called raisin bran buds composed of raisin pieces, bran, raisin concentrate, and other natural ingredients.

Arc Hydro-DRAINMOD uses a distributed approach to route water from each field edge to the watershed outlet. In the framework the Arc Hydro data model was used to describe the stream network in the watershed and to connect the individual simulated DRAINMOD‐field outflow time series from each plot using Arc Hydro schema‐links features, which were summed at Arc Hydro schema‐nodes features along the stream network to generate the stream network flow. Hydrology data collected during six periods between 2003 and 2008 were used to test Arc Hydro-DRAINMOD and its performance was evaluated by considering uncertainties in model inputs using generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE). The GLUE estimates obtained (uncertainty bands 5% and 95%) agreed satisfactorily with measured monthly discharges. The percentage of time in which the observed discharges were bracketed by the uncertainty bands was 88% in calibration periods and 75% in validation periods. Although monthly time step simulations showed good agreement with observed discharges during the two main discharge events in spring, the contradictory daily time step results indicate that the watershed response simulations on a daily basis need to be improved. The uncertainty analysis showed that in periods of higher discharge, such as spring periods, the uncertainty in prediction was higher. It is important to note that these uncertainty estimations using the GLUE procedure include the uncertainties in measured discharge values, model inputs, boundary conditions and model structures. It was estimated that stream baseflow represented 42% of the total watershed discharge, but further research is needed to confirm this. These results show that the new Arc Hydro-DRAINMOD framework is applicable for predicting discharge from artificially drained watersheds in southeast Sweden. 3aDRAINMOD model 3ageographic information systems 3amodel uncertainty 3aprediction 3astream flow 3atime series analysis 3auncertainty analysis 3awatersheds 3aSweden1 aJoel, Abraham1 aWesström, Ingrid.1 aLinner, Harry.1 aSkaggs, R.

Within the Phytophaga (=Pseudotetramera), the parameres have been reduced several times. Comparison of different types of parameres, median lobes, aedeagi lacking parameres, and investigation of dissected pairs in copula revealed that (1) parameres do not provide mechanical coupling, (2) mechanical footing is provided by the endophallus, (3) median lobes of Phytophaga bear different kinds of sensilla. Mechanical and behavioural interaction between male and female copulatory organs were studied morphologically and by observation of live, copulating pairs. For the first time, copulation of a Sagrinae-species (Chrysomelidae: Sagrinae: Mecynodera coxalgica) was investigated in detail. 3aChrysomelidae 3acopulation 3amale reproductive system 3asensilla 2aAnimals 2aColeopteraxanatomy & histologyxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aBiomechanical Phenomena 2aFemale 2aGenitaliaxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aMale 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aPhylogeny 2aSexual Behavior, Animal1 aSchmitt, Michael0 tGenetica.g2010 Jan., v. 138, no. 1 p.45-57dSpringer Netherlandsx0016-67077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10709-009-9404-9 7aarticle04052naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100003000181245018300211300001800394500002400412506007600436520149300512506003702005650002802042650003102070650001302101650002102114650001802135650000902153650003002162650001302192650001402205650001702219650001602236650002402252650005202276650001202328650003502340650002802375650001102403650001802414650003702432650003302469650003102502650006802533650004702601650000902648650002402657650002302681650001902704650003602723650004302759650005502802650003902857650003802896700002302934700002702957700002902984700002603013700001803039700002003057700003403077773011803111852000903229856008003238655001203318IND4428649020221207111256.0091113s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442864902DNAL7 a197520292pmid7 aPMC27864812pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.00580-092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFonseca, Denise Morais da10aMycobacterium tuberculosis Culture Filtrate Proteins plus CpG Oligodeoxynucleotides Confer Protection to Mycobacterium bovis BCG-Primed Mice by Inhibiting Interleukin-4 Secretion  ap. 5311-5321.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCulture filtrate proteins (CFP) are potential targets for tuberculosis vaccine development. We previously showed that despite the high level of gamma interferon (IFN-γ) production elicited by homologous immunization with CFP plus CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CFP/CpG), we did not observe protection when these mice were challenged with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In order to use the IFN-γ-inducing ability of CFP antigens, in this study we evaluated a prime-boost heterologous immunization based on CFP/CpG to boost Mycobacterium bovis BCG vaccination in order to find an immunization schedule that could induce protection. Heterologous BCG-CFP/CpG immunization provided significant protection against experimental tuberculosis, and this protection was sustained during the late phase of infection and was even better than that conferred by a single BCG immunization. The protection was associated with high levels of antigen-specific IFN-γ and interleukin-17 (IL-17) and low IL-4 production. The deleterious role of IL-4 was confirmed when IL-4 knockout mice vaccinated with CFP/CpG showed consistent protection similar to that elicited by BCG-CFP/CpG heterologous immunization. These findings show that a single dose of CFP/CpG can represent a new strategy to boost the protection conferred by BCG vaccination. Moreover, different immunological parameters, such as IFN-γ and IL-17 and tightly regulated IL-4 secretion, seem to contribute to the efficacy of this tuberculosis vaccine.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMycobacterium bovis BCG 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3aantigens 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-4 3amice 3aoligodeoxyribonucleotides 3aproteins 3asecretion 3atuberculosis 3avaccination 3avaccine development 2aAdjuvants, Immunologicxadministration & dosage 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Proteinsximmunology 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aFemale 2aGene Deletion 2aImmunization, Secondaryxmethods 2aInterferon-gammaximmunology 2aInterleukin-17ximmunology 2aInterleukin-4xantagonists & inhibitorsxdeficiencyxsecretion. 2aLungximmunologyxmicrobiologyxpathology. 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aMice, Knockout 2aMycobacterium bovisximmunology 2aMycobacterium tuberculosisximmunology 2aOligodeoxyribonucleotidesxadministration & dosage 2aTuberculosisxprevention & control 2aTuberculosis Vaccinesximmunology1 aSilva, Celio Lopes1 aWowk, Pryscilla Fanini1 aPaula, Marina Oliveira e1 aRamos, Simone Gusmão1 aHorn, Cynthia1 aMarchal, Gilles1 aBonato, Vânia Luiza Deperon.0 tInfection and immunity.g2009 Dec., v. 77, no. 12 p.5311-5321dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.00580-093Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02959naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100001300158245012400171300001600295500002400311520109800335650002001433650001701453650001501470650001701485650002401502650003201526650001301558650002601571650001201597650002801609650002901637650003401666650005001700650001101750650001101761650001101772650004901783650000901832650001901841650001901860650002401879650005501903650003601958650003101994650003802025700001602063700001602079700002402095773011602119852000902235856007902244856005802323655001202381IND4370840820221119175025.0050529s2005    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437084082DNAL7 a157980132pmid7 a10.1530/rep.1.002942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPocar, P10aMolecular interactions of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and its biological and toxicological relevance for reproduction  ap. 379-389.  aIncludes references  aThe dioxin/aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor responsive to both natural and man-made environmental compounds. AhR and its nuclear partner ARNT are expressed in the female reproductive tract in a variety of species and several indications suggest that the AhR might play a pivotal role in the physiology of reproduction. Furthermore, it appears to be the mediator of most, if not all, the adverse effects on reproduction of a group of highly potent environmental pollutants collectively called aryl hydrocarbons (AHs), including the highly toxic compound 2,3,7,8-tetrachlor-odibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). Although a large body of recent literature has implicated AhR in multiple signal transduction pathways, the mechanisms of action resulting in a wide spectrum of effects on female reproduction are largely unknown. Here we summarize the major types of molecular cross-talks that have been identified for the AhR and linked cell signaling pathways and that are relevant for the understanding of the role of this transcription factor in female reproduction. 3aadverse effects 3ahydrocarbons 3apollutants 3areproduction 3asignal transduction 3atetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin 3atoxicity 3atranscription factors 2aAnimals 2aApoptosisxdrug effects 2aCell Cyclexdrug effects 2aDioxinsxchemistryxtoxicity. 2aEnvironmental Pollutantsxanalysisxtoxicity. 2aFemale 2aGenome 2aHumans 2aHypothalamo-Hypophyseal Systemxdrug effects 2aMice 2aMice, Knockout 2aModels, Animal 2aOvaryxdrug effects 2aReceptors, Aryl Hydrocarbonxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReceptors, Estrogenxmetabolism 2aReproductionxdrug effects 2aSignal Transductionxdrug effects1 aFischer, B.1 aKlonisch, T1 aHombach-Klonisch, S0 tReproduction.g2005 Apr., v. 129, no. 4 p.379-389dJournals of Reproduction and Fertility, Ltdx1470-16267nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1530/rep.1.002943Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.srf-reproduction.org/3electronic resource 7aarticle01832naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072001700149072001700166100001300183245011200196300001600308520053400324650002300858650001300881650001900894650002700913650001900940650002500959650002200984650003101006651002101037700001301058700001801071700004701089700001801136773008701154852000901241856008901250930003301339945002501372946001301397655001201410IND4380086420221119174948.0060509e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438008642DNAL7 a10.1080/10412905.2006.96990612doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Detailed analysis revealed the presence of echinenone (5% of total carotenoids), (3S)-3-hydroxyechinenone (21%), canthaxanthin (14%), (3S, 3'S)-astaxanthin (5%), (3S,3'R)-adonixanthin (42%), lutein and zeaxanthin (together 7%) and two minor unidentified carotenoids (6%). Methods employed for the identifications were chromatographic properties (TLC, HPLC), VIS-spectra, MS,1H NMR and CD data in comparison with authentic carotenoids. The chirality of astaxanthin was determined by the camphanate method. This strain differs from the previously examined strain YIC1 in its ability to carry out 3(3)-hydroxylation of the secondary carotenoids; (3S,3'R)-adonixanthin is the major carotenoid in the stationary phase of growth. 3acarotenoids 3asecondary metabolites 3astrain differences1 aMetzger, P.1 aLiaaen-Jensen, S.0 tBiochemical systematics and ecology.g1994 Jan., v. 22, no. 1 p.25-29x0305-19787nnas  aDNAL  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle01779naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072001700149072001700166100001400183245007000197300001600267520035800283650002300641650001000664650001700674650001600691650001500707650002100722650002500743650001000768650001800778650001900796650002500815650002200840650003100862650001900893651001200912653002000924700002200944700001700966700001600983700001800999773008701017852000901104856008901113930003301202945002501235946001301260655001201273IND4380084920221119174825.0060509e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438008492DNAL7 a10.1080/10412905.2006.96990532doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

They may have been more common globally before Pleistocene glaciations. Based on the premise that natural selection has favoured limited dispersability of sedentary organisms, OCBILs should have elevated persistence of lineages (Gondwanan Heritage Hypothesis) and long-lived individuals (Ultimate Self Hypothesis), high numbers of localised rare endemics and strongly differentiated population systems. To counter such natural fragmentation and inbreeding due to small population size, ecological, cytogenetic and genetic mechanisms selecting for the retention of heterozygosity should feature (the James Effect). The climatic stability of OCBILs should be paralleled by persistence of adjacent semi-arid areas, conducive to speciation (Semiarid Cradle Hypothesis). Special nutritional and other biological traits associated with coping with infertile lands should be evident, accentuated in plants, for example, through water-foraging strategies, symbioses, carnivory, pollination and parasitism. The uniquely flat landscapes of southwestern Australia have had prolonged presence of saline lakes along palaeoriver systems favouring evolution of accentuated tolerance to salinity. Lastly, unusual resiliences and vulnerabilities might be evident among OCBIL organisms, such as enhanced abilities to persist in small fragmented populations but great susceptibility to major soil disturbances. In those places where it is most pertinent, OCBIL theory hopefully lays a foundation for future research and for better informed conservation management. 3abiodiversity 3acarnivores 3aconservation practices 3adisturbed soils 3aglaciation 3aheterozygosity 3alakes 3alandscapes 3amaterials life cycle 3anatural selection 3aparasitism 3apollination 3apopulation size 3asalt tolerance 3asemiarid zones 3asymbiosis 3aAustralia 3aSouth Africa 3aVenezuela0 tPlant and soil.g2009 Sept., v. 322, no. 1-2 p.49-86dSpringer Netherlandsx0032-079X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-009-0068-0 7aarticle02384naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245010200146300001800248500001500266520145800281650001201739650002001751650001901771650002301790650001001813651001001823653002801833653001601861653001101877700001501888773007601903852000901979939003301988946001302021655001202034IND9102366920221119174901.0910604e199104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910236692DNAL7 a166681042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartinez, F.10aInteractions between glucose and inorganic carbon metabolism in Chlorella vulgaris strain UAM 101  ap. 1150-1155.  a2019-12-04  aChlorella vulgaris strain UAM 101 has been isolated from the effluent of a sugar refinery. This alga requires glucose to achieve maximal growth rate even under light saturating conditions. The growth rate of cultures grown on light + CO2 + glucose (3.16 per day) reaches the sum of those grown on light + CO2 (1.95 per day) and on dark + glucose (1.20 per day). Unlike other Chlorella strains, uptake of glucose (about 2 micromoles per milligram dry weight per hour) was induced to the same extent in the light and dark and was not photosensitive. The rate of dark respiration was not affected by light and was strongly stimulated by the presence of glucose (up to about 40% in 4 hours). The rate of photosynthetic O2 evolution was measured as a function of the CO2 concentration. These experiments were conducted with cells which experienced different concentrations of CO2 or glucose during growth. The maximal photosynthetic rate was inhibited severely by growing the cells in the presence of glucose. A rather small difference in the apparent photosynthetic affinity for extracellular inorganic carbon (from 10-30 micromolar) was found between cells grown under low and high CO2. Growth with glucose induced a reduction in the apparent affinity (45 micromolar) even though cells had not been provided with CO2. Experiments performed at different pH values indicate CO2 as the major carbon species taken from the medium by Chlorella vulgaris UAM 101. 3aglucose 3anutrient uptake 3aphotosynthesis 3aChlorella vulgaris 3alight 3aSpain 0acarbohydrate metabolism 0arespiration 0agrowth1 aOrus, M.I.0 tPlant physiology.g1991 Apr., v. 95, no. 4 p.1150-1155x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02714naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245017000146300001800316500001500334520156100349650001701910650002001927650002101947650002301968650002701991650001402018650003102032650002002063650001602083650001702099653001702116653001702133653001502150700002002165773007602185852000902261939003302270946001302303655001202316IND9102367520221119174913.0910605e199104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910236752DNAL7 a166681102pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalker, C.J.10aFurther characterization of the magnesium chelatase in isolated developing cucumber chloroplasts.

Mg-chelatase was assayed in intact chloroplasts from semi-green cucumber (Cucumis sativus, cv Sumter) cotyledons. In the presence of Proto and MgATP, enzyme activity was linear for 50 minutes. Plastid intactness was directly related to (and necessary for) Mg-chelatase activity. Uncouplers and ionophores did not inhibit Mg-chelatase in the presence of ATP. The nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs, beta, gamma-methylene ATP and adenylylimidodiphosphate, could not sustain Mg-chelatase activity alone and were inhibitory in the presence of ATP (I50 10 and 3 millimolar, respectively). Mg-chelatase was also inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide (I50, 50 micromolar) and the metal ion chelators 2,2'-dipyridyl and 1, 10 phenanthroline (but not to the same degree by their nonchelating analogs). In addition to Proto, the following porphyrins acted as Mg-chelatase substrates, giving comparable specific activities: deuteroporphyrin, mesoporphyrin, 2-ethyl, 4-vinyl Proto and 2-vinyl, 4-ethyl Proto. Mg-chelatase activity and freely exchangeable heme levels increased steadily with greening, reaching a maximum and leveling off after 15 hours in the light. Exogenous protochlorophyllide, chlorophyllide, heme, and Mg-Proto had no measurable effect on Mg-chelatase activity. The potent ferrochelatase inhibitors, N-methylmesoporphyrin and N-methylprotoporphyrin, inhibited Mg-chelatase at micromolar concentrations. 3abiosynthesis 3aCucumis sativus 3achelating agents 3acatalytic activity 3aadenosine triphosphate 3amagnesium 3aphysicochemical properties 3aenzyme activity 3achlorophyll 3achloroplasts 0apurification 0atetrapyrrole 0aregulation1 aWeinstein, J.D.0 tPlant physiology.g1991 Apr., v. 95, no. 4 p.1189-1196x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03722naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004600092040001800138072000900156100002000165245011600185300001600301500002400317520207700341650001502418650001402433650003502447650001702482650002402499650004502523650002202568650001402590650001002604650002402614650001802638650001002656653003302666653002402699653002102723700002202744700002502766700002102791700001602812700001702828700001902845700001802864700001502882773010902897852000903006856009603015930003303111945002503144946001103169655001203180IND4417666920221119174927.0090313e20090401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441766692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2008.10.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL2101 aBech-Sàbat, G.10aPregnancy patterns during the early fetal period in high producing dairy cows treated with GnRH or progesterone  ap. 920-929.  aIncludes references  aIn order to explore pregnancy patterns in high producing dairy cows treated with GnRH or progesterone at pregnancy diagnosis (Days 28-34), two consecutive experiments were designed. In Experiment 1, cows bearing a single embryo were randomly assigned to a PRID (n =40; cows fitted with a progesterone releasing intra-vaginal device for 28 days), GnRH (n =40; cows receiving GnRH) or Control (n =26; untreated cows) group. PRID treatment led to a rise in plasma progesterone concentrations in the 7 days following the onset of treatment compared to the other two groups. In Experiment 2, in which we also examined twin pregnancies, animals were randomly assigned to PRID (n =312) or GnRH (n =294) treatment groups. Treatments were the same as described for Experiment 1. Logistic regression procedures revealed that in cows with a single corpus luteum, the probability of pregnancy loss between the first (Days 28-34) and second (Days 65-62) pregnancy diagnosis decreased by a factor of 0.51 in the PRID group compared to the GnRH group. However, in cows with two or more corpora lutea, PRID treatment increased the likelihood of pregnancy loss by a factor of three, compared to GnRH treatment. In cows carrying twins, the conceptus reduction rate was higher (P =0.02) for the GnRH (36%) than for the PRID (16.4%) group. Formation of a new corpus luteum was recorded in 17.7% of cows in the GnRH group. Our results indicate that compared to GnRH treatment, progesterone treatment given at pregnancy diagnosis in high producing dairy cows, reduced by a factor of 0.51 and increased by a factor of 3 the probability of pregnancy loss in cows with a single or with two or more corpora lutea, respectively, and reduced the conceptus reduction rate in cows carrying twins. The practical implications of our findings are that in herds with a high incidence of early fetal loss of a non-infectious nature, treatment at the time of pregnancy diagnosis with PRID in cows with one corpus luteum and with GnRH in cows with two or more corpora lutea should offer considerable benefits. 3adairy cows 3apregnancy 3agonadotropin-releasing hormone 3aprogesterone 3ahormone supplements 3acontrolled internal drug release devices 3ahormone secretion 3aconceptus 3afetus 3aembryonic mortality 3acorpus luteum 3atwins 0aprogesterone supplementation 0aconceptus reduction 0aearly fetal loss1 aLópez-Gatius, F.1 aGarcía-Ispierto, I.1 aSantolaria, J.P.1 aSerrano, B.1 aNogareda, C.1 ade Sousa, N.M.1 aBeckers, J.F.1 aYániz, J.0 tTheriogenology.g2009 Apr. 1, v. 71, no. 6 p.920-929dButterworth-Heinemann; [New York]x0093-691X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2008.10.0133Available from publisher's Web site  a20090324b20090508c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/03/24  aNon-US 7aarticle03100naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002700110245015600137300001800293520197700311650002202288650001102310650002702321650002802348650001702376650001902393650002502412650004102437650002002478650002002498700001802518700002102536700002202557700001602579773007602595852000902671939003302680946001302713655001202726IND9102368320221119174905.0910605e199104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910236832DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClaassen, P.q(Pamela)10aPotential role of pyrophosphate: fructose 6-phosphate phosphotransferase in carbohyrate metabolism of cold stored tubers of Solanum tuberosum cv Bintje  ap. 1243-1249.  aTo gain a better understanding of the mechanism of cold induced sweetening, sugar accumulation in potato, Solanum tuberosum cv Bintje, was compared to the maximum activity of inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi):fructose 6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase (EC 2.7.1.90) and the concentration of two regulatory metabolites. Mature tubers accumulated reducing sugars and sucrose at an almost linear rate of 13.4 and 5.2 micromole per day per gram dry weight at 2 degrees C and 4.5 and 1.3 micromole per day per gram dry weight, respectively, at 4 degrees C. During storage at 8 degrees C sugar accumulation was nil. Sugar accumulation was preceded by a lag phase of about 4 days. The accumulation of reducing sugars persisted for at least 4 weeks, whereas sucrose accumulation declined after 2 weeks of storage. The ratio of glucose:fructose changed concomitantly with sugar increase from 65:35 to equimolarity. The maximum activity of PPi:fructose 6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase was 2.51 and 2.25 units per gram dry weight during storage at 2 and 8 degrees C, respectively. The temperature coefficient of this enzyme from potatoes kept at 2 or 8 degrees C was 2.12 and 2.48, respectively. The endogenous concentration of fructose 2,6-biphosphate increased from 0.15 to 1 nanomole per gram dry weight during storage at 2 and 4 degrees C but remained the same throughout storage at 8 degrees C. After exposure to 2 degrees C an initial increase in the concentration of PPi was observed from 4.0 to 5.6 nanomoles per gram dry weight. Pyrophosphate concentration did not change during storage at 4 degrees C but decreased slightly at 8 degrees C. All observed changes became annulled after transfer of cold stored tubers to 18 degrees C. These data strongly indicate that PPi:fructose 6-phosphate 1-phosphotransterase can be fully operational in cold stored potato tubers and the lack of increase in PPi concentration supports the functioning of this enzyme during sugar accumulation. 3aSolanum tuberosum 3atubers 3apostharvest physiology 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3acold storage 3apyrophosphates 3afructose 6-phosphate 3aphosphotransferases (phosphomutases) 3aenzyme activity 3astorage quality1 aBudde, M.A.W.1 aRuyter, H.J. de.1 aCalker, M.H. van.1 aEs, A. van.0 tPlant physiology.g1991 Apr., v. 95, no. 4 p.1243-1249x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02327naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072001700149072001700166072001700183100001700200245013600217300001600353500001500369520081700384650003301201650001901234650002701253650002101280650001901301650003101320650001301351650002201364650001301386650001801399650002601417650001101443650002001454653001501474700002201489700001701511700001901528700001801547773008701565852000901652856008901661930003301750945002501783946001301808655001201821IND4380082420221119174942.0060509e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438008242DNAL7 a10.1080/10412905.2006.96990392doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Birth of a cattlexbuffalo (Bubalus bubalis) hybrid has reportedly occurred in Russia and in China, but these reports were not authenticated. Such hybrids could be important in improving livestock production and management of diseases that impede production in tropical Africa. This study investigated hybridization between cattle and its closest African wild bovid relative, the African buffalo (Syncerus caffer caffer). In an attempt to produce cattlexbuffalo hybrid embryos in vitro, matured cattle oocytes were subjected to a standard in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedure with either homologous cattle (n =1166 oocytes) or heterologous African buffalo (n =1202 oocytes) frozen-thawed epididymal sperm. After IVF, 67.2% of the oocytes inseminated with the homologous cattle sperm cleaved. In contrast, fertilization with buffalo sperm resulted in only a 4.6% cleavage rate. The cleavage intervals were also slower in hybrid embryos than in the IVF-derived cattle embryos. Of the cleaved homologous cattle embryos 52.2% progressed to the morula stage compared with 12.7% for the buffalo hybrid embryos. No hybrid embryos developed beyond the early morula stage, while 40.1% of the cleaved cattlexcattle embryos developed to the blastocyst stage. Transfer of buffalo hybrid IVF embryos to domestic cattle surrogates resulted in no pregnancies at 60 days post-transfer. This study indicates that interspecies fertilization of cattle oocytes with African buffalo epididymal sperm can occur in vitro, and that a barrier to hybridization occurs in the early stages of embryonic development. Chromosomal disparity is likely the cause of the fertilization abnormalities, abnormal development and subsequent arrest impairing the formation of hybrid embryos beyond the early morula stage. Transfer of the buffalo hybrid embryos did not rescue the embryos from development arrest. 3acell cleavage 3aepididymis 3ahybrids 3aSyncerus caffer 3acattle 3amorula 3aspermatozoa 3ainterspecific hybridization 3aembryo culture 3aoocytes 3aembryo transfer 3ain vitro fertilization 2aAnimals 2aBlastocyst 2aBuffaloes 2aCattle 2aCleavage Stage, Ovum 2aEmbryo Culture Techniquesxveterinary 2aEmbryo Lossxveterinary 2aEmbryo Transferxveterinary 2aEmbryonic Development 2aEpididymisxcytology 2aFemale 2aFertilization in Vitroxveterinary 2aHybridization, Genetic 2aMale 2aMorula 2aOocytesxphysiology 2aPregnancy 2aSpermatozoaxphysiology 0aAfrica 0ain vitro embryo production 0aembryo (animal) 0aembryogenesis1 aBarry, D.M.1 aAgaba, M.1 aGodke, R.A.0 tTheriogenology.g2009 Apr. 1, v. 71, no. 6 p.884-894dButterworth-Heinemann; [New York]x0093-691X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2008.10.0163Available from publisher's Web site  a20090324b20090508c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/03/24  aNon-US 7aarticle01904naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072001700149072001700166100002000183245011900203300001600322500001500338520057700353650001400930650002500944650001900969650002600988650002101014650001901035650002301054650001101077650002901088651000901117653001901126700001801145700001901163700002001182773008701202852000901289856008901298930003301387945002501420946001301445655001201458IND4377892220221119174852.0060214e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437789222DNAL7 a10.1080/10412905.2006.96994022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In all habitats and at all seasons, medium-sized ungulates (roe deer Capreolus capreolus, reindeer Rangifer tarandus and domestic sheep Ovis aries) dominated the diet (81% of ingested biomass estimated from faeces). Mountain hares Lepus timidus and galliform birds comprised the remainder of the diet (15% and 3%, respectively). Lynxes with different life history status did not differ in prey choice, but adult males utilised carcasses of ungulate prey considerably less (16% of the edible parts) than did females with offspring (80%) and subadults (58%.). Forest habitats in lowlands and adjacent to cultivated fields were the most favourable foraging habitats (indexed as the prey encounter rate per km lynx track) primarily owing to the presence of roe deer. Two family groups tracked in winter killed 0.2 ungulate per day. The importance of agricultural land as a foraging habitat and the dominance of livestock in the diet in remoter areas indicate that the lynx has responded to agriculture and reindeer husbandry during the past century by switching from smaff game to ungulates. 3aCapreolus capreolus 3aLepus timidus 3aLynx 3aRangifer tarandus 3aagricultural land 3abiomass 3abirds 3adiet 3afeces 3afemales 3aforaging 3ahabitats 3ahares 3alife history 3alowland forests 3amales 3ameat carcasses 3amountains 3aprogeny 3areindeer 3asheep 3asnow 3atelemetry 3awinter 3aNorway1 aKvam, Tor1 aBolstad, Jan P.1 aBronndal, Morten0 tEcography.g2000 June, v. 23, no. 3 p.291-298dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0906-75907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2000.tb00284.x 7aarticle02036naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072001700149072001700166072001700183100001600200245013500216300001400351520052300365650002200888650001400910650001300924650001100937650001500948650002800963650002100991650001401012650001701026650001901043650001901062650002501081650003101106650002501137650002601162651001001188700001601198700001601214700001601230700001801246773008501264852000901349856008901358930003301447945002501480946001301505655001201518IND4377888820221119174555.0060214e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437788882DNAL7 a10.1080/10412905.2006.96993902doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Nitrogen limitation triggers a rapid, cycloheximide-insensitive derepression of the gene. Residual derepression in a cAMP-nonresponsive mutant with attenuated protein kinase activity (bcy1 tpk1(w) tpk2 tpk3) demonstrates the existence of an alternative, cAMP-independent nutrient signaling mechanism. Deletion analysis using CTT1-lacZ fusion genes revealed the contribution of multiple control elements to derepression, not all of which respond to the cAMP signal. A positive promoter element responding to negative control by cAMP was inactivated by deletion of a DNA region between base pairs -340 and -364. Upstream fragments including this element confer negative cAMP control to a LEU2-lacZ fusion gene. Northern analysis of CTT1 expression in the presence or absence of heme, in RAS2+ (high cAMP) and ras2 mutant (low cAMP) strains and in cells grown at low temperature (23 degrees C) and in heat-shocked cells (37 degrees C) shows that CTT1 is only induced to an appreciable extent when at least two of the three factors contributing to its expression (oxidative stress signaled by heme, nutrient starvation (low cAMP) and heat stress) activate the CTT1 promoter. 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3acyclic AMP 3aheme 3aheat stress 3anutrient requirements 3aprotein synthesis 3aenzyme activity 3atranscription (genetics) 2aBase Sequence 2aCatalasexbiosynthesis 2aCyclic AMPxpharmacology 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungalxdrug effects 2aGenes, Fungal 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOligonucleotide Probes 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxbiosynthesis 2aRestriction Mapping 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexenzymologyxgenetics. 2aTranscription, Geneticxdrug effects 2aTransformation, Genetic 2abeta-Galactosidasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 0agenetic regulation1 aWagner, A.1 aWieser, R.1 aSchanz, M.1 aAdam, Gilles.1 aHartig, A.1 aRuis, H.0 tEMBO journal.g1991 Mar., v. 10, no. 3 p.585-592x0261-41897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01661naa a2200325 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097245004100115300001200156520076600168650001400934650002500948650002300973650003100996650001701027650002001044650003201064650001701096650002301113653001801136653002401154773008401178852000901262939003301271945000801304946001101312655001201323991565692310742620221119174922.0800905e197910  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI800021132DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL14aThe assessment of nutritional status  ap. 321.  aSince nutrition is so important in fighting infection, healing wounds and in treatment of the chronically or acutely ill patient, the assessment of nutritional status in hospitals should be a thorough and routine process.

Most of these ashes are currently landfilled, despite their nutrient and micronutrient contents. The aim of this research was to find a way to return wood ash from biomass incineration plants into the natural cycle of matter. Three composts from source separated organic waste were produced with 0%, 8% and 16% ash admixture. The composting process was monitored by in situ measurements of temperature and CO₂ concentration in the windrows. Maturation of the composts was observed through the parameters basal respiration, microbial biomass, metabolic quotient, Corg, Ntot, C/N-ratio and plant growth tests with cress. Mature composts were further analysed for potential pH, electrical conductivity as well as for nutrient (Mg, K, P) and heavy metal contents. The process indicators showed that ash admixture had no adverse effects and all legal standards were met. All produced composts met the requirements of the Austrian Compost Ordinance (Compost Quality A or even A+). In a field experiment - a recultivation trial on an alpine ski-run - we compared the effects of the three composts with an organic fertilizer and a mineral fertilizer. Best plant growth was found on the compost amended plots, followed by the organic fertilizer. Soil respiration measurements indicated a better performance of composts amended with 8% or 16% ash as compared to compost that did not contain ash. Concluding it may be stated that up to 16% ash admixture to organic wastes does not impair the composting process but is even able to improve the product quality. However, it has to be made sure that only bottom ashes of low heavy metal contents are being used and strict quality control is implemented. 3anutrient content 3aelectrical conductivity 3awood ash 3aheavy metals 3asoil amendments 3amagnesium 3apotassium 3apH 3acompost quality 3aorganic wastes 3acomposting 3aphosphorus 3aAustria 0acomposts1 aTschöll, A.1 aPartl, C.1 aMeyer, K.1 aInsam, H.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2008 Aug., v. 127, no. 1-2 p.43-49dElsevierx0167-88097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2008.02.0123Available from publisher's Web site  a20110623b20110701c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/08/27  aNon-US 7aarticle01283naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097245005600115300001400171300002800185520056600213650001700779650001400796650001100810650001300821650001500834653001500849773006600864852000900930939003300939945000800972946001300980655001200993991565690800742620221119174931.0860624e198509  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI860107832DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL10aStart-up and demonstration of foodservice equipment  ap. 32-37.  ap. 32-37. ill., charts.  aPractical guidelines and check-lists are provided for the installation, start-up, and demonstration testing of food service equipment.

Soil total P (TP) concentrations and compaction are soil characteristics that can influence P losses to streams. The objective of this study was to compare these two soil characteristics among riparian forest buffers, grass filters, pastures with cattle fenced out of the stream, intensive rotational, rotational and continuously grazed pastures and row-cropped fields in three physiographic regions of Iowa. Soil TP and compaction for the seven riparian land-uses were determined in stream bank and surface riparian soils. Total P concentrations in stream bed material along the seven riparian land-uses were also measured. Total P concentrations in riparian stream bank soils among land-uses ranged from 303 to 398mgkg⁻¹ in the central region, to 432-518mgkg⁻¹ in the northeast, to 360-555mgkg⁻¹ in the southeast. In the surface riparian soils TP among land-uses ranged from 434 to 649mgkg⁻¹ in the central region, to 493-764mgkg⁻¹ in the northeast region, to 428-716mgkg⁻¹ in the southeast region. Finally, the TP concentrations in the stream bed sediments among land-uses ranged 194-307mgkg⁻¹ in the central region, to 169-461mgkg⁻¹ in the northeast, to 389-964mgkg⁻¹ in the southeast. Few soil TP significant differences among riparian land-uses within regions were found. Soil compaction under some of the grazing practices was significantly higher than under the conservation practices. Limited differences in soil TP concentrations and compaction were partially due to the young age of the conservation practices and the rotational and intensive rotational pastures. Past land-use on these sites had been either continuous grazing or row-cropping and those uses were still influencing these soil parameters. Within riparian land-uses, surface riparian soils generally had higher TP than the stream bank riparian soils. Stream bed samples had lower TP concentrations than the riparian soils in the northeast and central regions but were higher than the riparian soils in some of the land-uses in the southeast region. Overall TP concentrations in the stream bank, surface riparian soils and stream bed material were high indicating that these areas can potentially be important source areas of P and the focus should be on reducing the transport of P. 3ariparian areas 3aland use 3asoil fertility 3aphosphorus 3asoil compaction 3awater pollution 3aagricultural runoff 3awater quality 3alosses from soil 3ariparian forests 3ariparian buffers 3afilter strips 3apastures 3acattle 3agrazing management 3aintensive livestock farming 3afield crops 3astreams 3atemporal variation 3anonpoint source pollution 3aIowa 0astreambanks1 aSchultz, Richard C.1 aIsenhart, Thomas M.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2008 Aug., v. 127, no. 1-2 p.22-30dElsevierx0167-88097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2008.02.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20080915b20081011c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/08/27  aNon-US 7aarticle01275naa a2200253 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002400115245003800139300001400177300002600191520059400217650002400811650002000835653002500855773006800880852000900948939003300957945000800990946001100998655001201009991565689430742620221119174955.0840110e198312  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI840037722DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColburn, Michael G.10aTime management and profitability  ap. 43-46.  ap. 43-46, 48. charts.  aTime management increases profitability.

The primary aim of the experiment was to study how different secondary vegetation succession scenarios influence community development of invertebrates in different trophic levels. The succession scenarios were obtained by sowing high diversity or low diversity seed mixtures of mid-successional plant species in 1996 in comparison with unsown plots where agriculture ceased in 1996 or 1999. Carnivorous carabid species generally preferred plots characterized by open vegetation, whereas herbivorous carabids generally favored plots associated with high plant diversity. However, carabid community composition was affected most by sampling year and there was also a dramatic shift over the three years in the relative proportion of the different trophic groups. Irrespective of treatment, the proportion of carnivores in the community declined with time, whereas phytophages increased over the course of the three years. By contrast, the proportion of omnivores peaked during the second year. These long-term changes were, at least to some extent, related to short-term changes in the structure and composition of the plant communities. The importance of local variation and temporal changes in plant species richness on carabids and other insect fauna are discussed. 3atemporal variation 3afunctional diversity 3aplant communities 3aagricultural land 3abotanical composition 3aecological succession 3avegetation cover 3aecological function 3aabandoned land 3aCarabidae 3atrophic relationships 3aNetherlands 0aspecies assemblages 0aspecies diversity 0afeeding guilds 0avegetation1 avan der Putten, Wim H.1 aTurin, Hans1 aWagenaar, Roel1 aBezemer, T.

Many of these schools experience difficulty in meeting their obligation of feeding a full warm meal to their patrons. Lack of knowledge of the children's nutritional needs, space problems, and tight budgets have resulted in long term, unacceptable improvisations. A case study presented illustrates how problems were solved in a German school system serving over 2000 children. Analysis of the existing system was made and criteria for a proposed system were established. Calculation of total food cost per menu indicated that the most economical system was the chilled foodservice. A table summarizes the evaluation criteria used to compare 3 main foodservice systems.

Gene banking of non-human primate sperm is still in its infancy. The objective of the present study was to initiate a systematic approach to optimize the process of sperm cryopreservation for rhesus macaques, specifically, factors related to pre-freezing conditions (e.g., straw freezing position, sperm concentration, sperm washing, equilibration methods, and equilibration time periods). Straw position had no effect on post-thaw motility (P =0.193). Sperm concentration was tested in a range from 5x10⁶ mL⁻¹ to 5x10⁸ mL⁻¹; post-thaw motility of sperm samples frozen at 5x10⁷ cellmL⁻¹ (51.0±10.6%; mean±S.D.) and 5x10⁸ cellmL⁻¹ (48.1±7.3%) were higher than samples frozen at 5x10⁶ cellsmL⁻¹ (33.0±12.0%, P =0.003). Comparison of motility immediately after thawing between samples with (51.2±6.2%) and without washing (53.9±6.8%) revealed no differences (P >0.05). However, washing improved sperm forward progression within 1h after thawing, whereas unwashed sperm retained higher post-thaw motility and progression during extended incubation (4h) after thawing (P <0.05). Equilibration methods (with or without pre-cooling) made no difference on post-thaw motility (P >0.05), and the most effective equilibration time was the duration required for samples to acclimate to 4°C prior to freezing. Evaluation and optimization of these pre-freezing conditions will help to minimize sources of injury, maximize survival, and contribute to the development of an optimized cryopreservation protocol for rhesus macaque sperm.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3afreezing 3asemen 3acryopreservation 3amonkeys 3asperm motility 3aMacaca mulatta 3aspermatozoa 3athawing 0aoptimization 0asperm cryopreservation 0asperm concentration 0asperm washing1 aRodenburg, S.E.1 aHuang, C.1 aVandeVoort, C.A.0 tTheriogenology.g2008 July 1, v. 70, no. 1 p.61-69dButterworth-Heinemann; [New York]x0093-691X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2008.02.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20090129b20090206c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/01/29  aNon-US 7aarticle02403naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245010300160300001600263500002400279520114900303650000801452650002401460650002801484650001301512650001001525650002201535650003301557650004701590650001801637650001001655650001401665651001001679653004401689700001901733700002601752700001401778700001601792773011601808852000901924856004801933655001201981IND4405520120221119174813.0080509e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440552012DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-007-9253-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLópez, M.10aIntraspecific diversity within avocado field isolates of Rosellinia necatrix from south-east Spain  ap. 201-205.  aIncludes references  aFifty-five isolates of Rosellinia necatrix, the cause of common avocado white root rot disease, were collected from south-east Spain and characterised according to their virulence behaviour and their molecular patterns to assess broader levels of genetic diversity. Virulence properties were revealed by in vitro inoculation on avocado plants. Differences in reaction types showed variability among these isolates. No sequence differences were observed when the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) and ITS2 regions and DNA fragments of the β-tubulin, adenosine triphosphatase and translation elongation factor 1 genes were explored in representive isolates from five virulence groups. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) amplifications were also performed for each isolate using 19 random primers. Four of these primers revealed polymorphism among isolates and repetitive and discriminative bands were used to build an unweighted pair group with arithmetic mean tree. However, RAPD clustering showed low stability, and no correlation between RAPD and virulence groups was observed, possibly indicating high levels of sexual recombination. 3aDNA 3aRosellinia necatrix 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3aavocados 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3aroot diseases 3atrees 3avirulence 3aSpain 0aPersea americanaRAPD-PCR White root rot1 aRuano-Rosa, D.1 aLópez-Herrera, C.

L. -C.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aEthylene is a major regulator of submergence responses in rice (Oryza sativa). This gaseous phytohormone rapidly accumulates in tissues of submerged plants due to physical entrapment and active biosynthesis during the stress, triggering a range of acclimation responses including shoot elongation, adventitious root formation and carbohydrate metabolism. In addition, ethylene coordinates the balance of gibberellic acid (GA) and abscisic acid (ABA) contents, which facilitates GA-promoted elongation of shoots during submergence. Besides cell elongation, the interaction of ethylene with GA and ABA also regulates adventitious root formation, but these developmental processes are modulated by distinct regulatory networks of the three hormones. Deepwater and lowland rice can overcome submergence stress through antithetical modes of responses. Deepwater rice promotes internode elongation during submergence to project photosynthetic organs above the air-water interface. This escape response is mediated by a high rate of ethylene production and sensitivity to the hormone. By contrast, submergence-tolerant lowland rice restricts carbohydrate consumption used for cell division and cell elongation that promotes underwater elongation. This tolerance is the result of limited ethylene production and sensitivity. We propose that response strategies have evolved in rice to survive distinct conditions of submergence. 3aethylene 3arice 3aplant stress 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3aOryza sativa 3agibberellic acid 3asignal transduction 3aflooded conditions 3awater stress 3aplant-water relations 3aacclimation 3aadventitious roots 3aphysiological response 3aplant response 3arooting 3aabscisic acid 0aplant hormones 0aliterature reviews1 aBailey-Serres, Julia0 tPlant science.g2008 July, v. 175, no. 1-2 p.43-51dElsevier Science Ireland Ltd.x0168-94527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2007.12.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20080814b20080905c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/08/14  aNon-US 7aarticle01312naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115245005400131300001400185300001900199520059900218650001100817650001400828650001800842650001600860653001500876773006800891852000900959939003300968945000801001946001301009655001201022991565687100742620221119174905.0860623e198504  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI860107802DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHenke, M.C.10aAir impingement baking--technology for the future  ap. 28-32.  ap. 28-32. ill.  aThe techniques and advantages of air impingement baking are described and illustrated.

Curiously, QS-deficient variants, often carrying mutations in the central QS regulator LasR, are frequently isolated from infections, particularly from cystic fibrosis (CF) lung infections. Very little is known about the proportion and diversity of these QS variants in individual infections. Such information is desirable to better understand the selective forces that drive the evolution of QS phenotypes, including social cheating and innate (nonsocial) benefits. To obtain insight into the instantaneous within-patient diversity of QS, we assayed a panel of 135 concurrent P. aeruginosa isolates from eight different adult CF patients (9 to 20 isolates per patient) for various QS-controlled phenotypes. Most patients contained complex mixtures of QS-proficient and -deficient isolates. Among all patients, deficiency in individual phenotypes ranged from 0 to about 90%. Acyl-HSL, sequencing, and complementation analyses of variants with global loss-of-function phenotypes revealed dependency upon the central QS circuitry genes lasR, lasI, and rhlI. Deficient and proficient isolates were clonally related, implying evolution from a common ancestor in vivo. Our results show that the diversity of QS types is high within and among patients, suggesting diverse selection pressures in the CF lung. A single selective mechanism, be it of a social or nonsocial nature, is unlikely to account for such heterogeneity. The observed diversity also shows that conclusions about the properties of P. aeruginosa QS populations in individual CF infections cannot be drawn from the characterization of one or a few selected isolates.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aadults 3abiofilm 3acystic fibrosis 3aevolution 3agenes 3amutation 3apathogens 3apatients 3aphenotype 3aquorum sensing 3avirulence 2aAcyl-Butyrolactonesxmetabolism 2aAdult 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aBacterial Typing Techniques 2aCluster Analysis 2aCystic Fibrosisxmicrobiology 2aDNA Fingerprinting 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aGenetic Variation 2aHumans 2aLigasesxgenetics 2aLungxmicrobiology 2aMiddle Aged 2aPhenotype 2aPneumonia, Bacterialxmicrobiology 2aPseudomonas Infectionsxmicrobiology 2aPseudomonas aeruginosaxclassificationxisolation & purificationxphysiology. 2aQuorum Sensing 2aRandom Amplified Polymorphic DNA Technique 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aTrans-Activatorsxgenetics 2aTranscription Factorsxgenetics 2aYoung Adult1 aAllada, Gopal1 aSchuster, Martin0 tInfection and immunity.g2009 Dec., v. 77, no. 12 p.5631-5639dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.00755-093Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02718naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100001900168245006900187300001600256500010400272500002400376500001500400520138500415650001301800650001701813650002201830650002401852650002401876650001301900650001101913653002401924653001901948653002301967700002101990773010502011852000902116856009002125930003302215945002502248946001102273655001202284IND4406779720221119174844.0080613e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440677972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plantsci.2008.02.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF2001 aEzura, Hiroshi10aMelon, an alternative model plant for elucidating fruit ripening  ap. 121-129.  aIn the Special Issue:  Ethylene biology / edited by Delseny, M., Charng, Y. -Y. and Wang, K.

Arabidopsis has been an ideal model system for gene identification and subsequent functional analysis of the identified gene. On the other hand, tomato is not only the model of choice to study climacteric fruit ripening but also crops of agronomic importance and hence has been at the forefront of the comparative analysis with Arabidopsis. A number of fruit development and ripening studies in melon have been conducted by many laboratories in the last decade, leading to the accumulation of a great deal of information. These include genetic transformation techniques, isolation of related genes, physiological information and genetics resources. The information accumulated has enabled melon to carve a niche for itself as an alternative model system for fruit for studies. In addition, International Cucurbit Genomics Initiative (ICuGI) was launched 2005, in which melon became a model species in Cucurbit genomics research. In next decade, genomic resources including large collection of ESTs, precise maps and so on will be gathered, indicating that melon will be an alternative model plant for studying fruit ripening in addition to ethylene perception and signaling. In this review, we will summarize the information accumulated so far and discuss the perspectives. 3aethylene 3aCucumis melo 3atransgenic plants 3asignal transduction 3aethylene production 3aripening 3amelons 0afunctional genomics 0aplant hormones 0aliterature reviews1 aOwino, Willis O.0 tPlant science.g2008 July, v. 175, no. 1-2 p.121-129dElsevier Science Ireland Ltd.x0168-94527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2008.02.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20080814b20080905c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/08/14  aNon-US 7aarticle01311naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001500115245004300130300001400173300001900187520059400206650002800800650001500828653001700843653001600860653001400876773006800890852000900958939003300967945000801000946001301008655001201021991565686310742620221119174623.0880930e198804  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI880031002DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeehan, V.10aHow to reduce tableware breakage costs  ap. 22-23.  ap. 22-23. ill.  aPractical guidelines emphasizing planning and systemization are discussed to aid food service managers in reducing their costs in china and glassware breakage.

Sixteen to twenty different types of pastirma can be produced from a carcass, and each pastirma type has a different name, shape and quality characteristics. The objective of this study was to determine the free amino acid (FAA) composition, pH and moisture values of ‘sırt', ‘bohca' and ‘sekerpare' pastirma. RESULTS: Significant differences were determined among the pastirma types in glutamic acid (P < 0.05), threonine (P < 0.05), arginine (P < 0.05), alanine (P < 0.01), methionine (P < 0.01), tryptophan (P < 0.05), proline (P < 0.01) and valine (P < 0.01). Threonine, methionine and valine were higher in sırt pastirma than the others; glutamic acid, arginine and tryptophan were higher in sekerpare pastirma. The predominant FAA in the all pastirma samples was alanine, while the lowest was asparagine. The highest mean pH was in sırt pastirma, and the lowest mean pH in bohca pastirma. There was no significant difference in mean moisture values among pastirma types. CONCLUSION: Significant differences were determined among pastirma types in some FAA. Analysis results indicated that quality and nutritional properties for different pastirma types are different. The most advantageous pastirma types in terms of FAA were bohca and sırt, which contain the highest quantity of threonine, methionine and valine. 3aalanine 3aarginine 3aasparagine 3abeef 3abuffaloes 3acured meats 3afree amino acids 3aglutamic acid 3amethionine 3anutritive value 3apH 3aproline 3athreonine 3atryptophan 3avaline 2aAmino Acidsxanalysis 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMeat Productsxanalysis1 aAksu, Muhammet İrfan0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2011 Mar. 30, v. 91, no. 5 p.956-962dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.4273 7aarticle01793naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245004500143300001600188500008400204500002300288520036700311650002000678650000800698650001000706650001700716650002500733650002500758650002900783650002600812650001200838650001800850650001100868650001000879650002000889650003100909650003100940650001100971650002000982650001901002650002701021653001601048653003301064653001601097700001601113700001501129773006601144852000901210939003301219946001101252655001201263IND9301567520221119174924.0930316e198505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930156752DNAL7 a38963252pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHenaut, A.14aThe origins of the strategy of codon use  ap. 475-483.  aIn the special issue: The application of computer methods to molecular biology.  aSummary in French.  aWe analyzed the DNA sequences taking as an elementary pattern segments of increasing length from the codon to the gene.

In order to estimate genetic diversity, characterize population structure and infer the demographic history, we examined six microsatellite loci and cytochrome b (mtDNA) sequences from samples taken throughout C. lusitanicum's geographical range. Estimates of genetic diversity were low in all samples (average He < 0.35). The microsatellite data pointed to a major difference between northern (Samarra and Tejo drainages) and southern (Sado and Sines drainages) samples. This separation was not so clear with mtDNA, since one sample from the Tejo drainage grouped with the southern samples. This could be related with ancestral polymorphism or with admixture events between northern and southern sites during the late Pleistocene. Nevertheless, both markers indicate high levels of population differentiation in the north (for microsatellites F ST > 0.23; and for mtDNA ΦST > 0.74) and lower levels in the south (F ST < 0.05; ΦST < 0.40). With microsatellites we detected strong signals of a recent population decrease in effective size, by more than one order of magnitude, starting in the last centuries. This is consistent with field observations reporting a severe anthropogenic-driven population decline in the last decades. On the contrary mtDNA suggested a much older expansion. Overall, these results suggest that the distribution of genetic diversity in C. lusitanicum is the result of both ancient events related with drainage system formation, and recent human activities. The potential effect of population substructure generating genetic patterns similar to a population decrease is discussed, as well as the implications of these results for the conservation of C. lusitanicum. 3aChondrostoma 3acytochrome b 3adrainage 3adrainage systems 3afreshwater 3agenetic variation 3ahumans 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amitochondrial DNA 3apopulation dynamics 3apopulation structure 0aEndangered endemic Cyprinidae 0aChondrostoma lusitanicum 0aDemographic history1 aPenha, Filipa 1 aCollares-Pereira, Maria J. 1 aChikhi, Lounès 1 aCoelho, Maria M. 0 tConservation genetics.g2008 Aug., v. 9, no. 4 p.791-805dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx1566-06217nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10592-007-9399-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20080815b20080905c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02391naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111040001800148072000900166100002400175245010400199300001600303500002400319500001500343520058500358650001600943650001000959650001900969650002400988650001101012650002401023650001201047650001701059650001001076650002501086650002001111650002401131650000901155650001901164650002301183650001801206650001101224650001101235650003101246650003001277650002401307650003201331653000901363653001801372653002201390653003301412700001801445700002101463700002101484773008301505852000901588856008701597930003301684945002501717946001101742655001201753IND4406783720221119174906.0080613e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440678372DNAL7 a184670042pmid7 a10.1016/j.appet.2008.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT0001 aCoelho, Jennifer S.10aEffects of food-cue exposure on dieting-related goals: A limitation to counteractive-control theory  ap. 347-349.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe present study investigated the effects of exposure to a food cue on the self-reported importance of dieting in those with low, medium, and high levels of dietary restraint.

  1 aCetintas, R.10aDistribution and downward movement of Pasteuria penetrans in field soil  ap. 155-160.  aEndospores of Pasteuria penetrans were evaluated for their vertical distribution in field soil and their downward movement through soil in the laboratory. In the field trial, the number of endospores attached to second-stage juveniles (J2) of Meloidogyne arenaria race 1 varied greatly in different soil depths. There were higher percentages of J2 with endospores attached in former weed fallow plots during the first 3 years of growing peanut than in former bahiagrass and rhizomal peanut plots (P less than or equal to 0.05). In weed fallow plots a higher average number of endospores per J2 were maintained in all depths, upper three depths, and upper four depths in 1999, 2000, and 2001, respectively (P less than or equal to 0.05). However, in 2002, there were no differences in the percentages of J2 with endospores attached and in the average of the numbers of endospores per J2 among the treatments (P > 0.05). In laboratory trials, P. penetrans endospores were observed to move throughout the soil through the percolation of water. After one application of water, some endospores were detected 25 to 37.5 cm deep. Endospores were present at the greatest depth, 37.5 to 50 cm, after the third application of water. These results indicate that rain or water applications by irrigation are likely to move endospores to deeper levels of the soil, but the majority of endospores remain in the upper 0-to-30-cm depth. 3aPasteuria penetrans 3abiological control agents 3aMeloidogyne arenaria 3aroot-knot nematodes 3anematode control 3aendospores 3aspatial distribution 3asoil depth 3aArachis hypogaea 3apeanuts 3aagricultural soils 3asuppressive soils 3asoil water movement 3aFlorida 0avertical distribution 0aspore attachment 0apercolation1 aDickson, D.W.0 tJournal of nematology.g2005 June, v. 37, no. 2 p.155-160x0022-300X7nnas  aDNAL  a20051118b20051202c00000000  aINDdNZMe2005/10/31  aOther US 7aarticle02579naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111040001800133072001700151072001700168072001700185100001900202245010400221300001600325520130000341650002701641650002601668650002201694650002201716650001701738650002601755650002701781650001301808650001001821650001601831650001401847650002101861653001601882653001901898653001601917700001701933773007901950852000902029930003302038945002502071946001302096655001202109IND4375218420221119175025.0051014e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437521842DNAL7 a192628522pmid7 aPMC26209572pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Averaged over all experiments after 12 weeks, root weight was reduced 13% by R. fragariae and 20% by M. castanea. The percentage of the root system affected by root rot was increased by inoculation with either R. fragariae (35% more disease) or P. penetrans (50% more disease) but was unaffected by M. castanea. Rhizoctonia fragariae was isolated from 9.2% of the root segments from plants not inoculated with R. fragariae. The percentage of R. fragariae infected root segments was increased 3.6-fold by inoculation with R. fragariae on rye seeds. The presence of P. penetrans also increased R. fragariae root infection. The type of injury to root systems was important in determining whether roots were invaded by R. fragariae and increased the severity of black root rot. Pratylenchus penetrans increased R. fragariae infection and the severity of black root rot. Traumatic cutting action by Asiatic garden beetle did not increase root infection or root disease by R. fragariae. Both insects and diseases need to be managed to extend the productive life of perennial strawberry plantings. 3aPratylenchus penetrans 3aroot lesion nematodes 3aMaladera castanea 3aFragaria ananassa 3astrawberries 3aRhizoctonia fragariae 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aroot rot 3aroots 3acrop damage 3ainfection 3adisease severity 0awhite grubs 0ablack root rot 0aroot damage1 aCowles, R.S.0 tJournal of nematology.g2005 June, v. 37, no. 2 p.131-135x0022-300X7nnas  aDNAL  a20051118b20051202c00000000  aINDdNZMe2005/10/31  aOther US 7aarticle03133naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111040001800133072001700151072001700168100001300185245007700198300001600275500001500291520189600306650002402202650002402226650001602250650002302266650002302289650001402312650001302326650002102339650002202360650002302382650001902405653001702424653002402441653002102465700001502486773009402501852000902595930003302604945002502637946001302662655001202675IND4375219420221119174932.0051014e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437521942DNAL7 a192628572pmid7 aPMC26209542pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLi, Y.H.10aEffect of the rhg1 gene on population development of Heterodera glycines  ap. 168-177.  a2019-12-05  aThe effect of the rhg1 gene on equilibrium population densities (E) and reproduction factors (Rf) of Heterodera glycines was studied by comparing the nematode population development on two near-isogenic soybean lines (NIL), differing at the rhg1 locus. The NIL were inoculated with a series of initial egg densities (Pi) in the greenhouse. The relationships between final population densities (Pf= females per plant or eggs per plant) or Rf (final egg density/Pi) on both NIL and Pi were adequately described by quadratic models. The rhg1 gene suppressed Pf and Rf at all Pi of a population of H. glycines race 3 (HG Type 0-); E and maximum Rf were higher on the NIL-S line than on the NIL-R line. After two generations of culture of the race 3 population on the NIL-R line, the population selected by the rhg1 gene (R-eggs) had higher Pf and Rf on the NIL-R line than the population cultured on the NIL-S line (S-eggs) at all Pi. Both R-eggs and S-eggs produced similar egg numbers on the NIL-S line, which was higher than the egg number of either population on the NIL-R line at all Pi. The ratio of E in female numbers on the NIL-R line to E on the NIL-S line increased from 29% for the original race 3 population (S-eggs) to 46% for the rhg1-selected population (R-eggs). Regardless of different egg sources, a trend of increase in the number of eggs per female with the rise of Pi was observed on the NIL-S line. In contrast, female fecundity of both populations declined with the increase of Pi on the NIL-R line. At most inoculum densities, the highest number of eggs per female was observed on the NIL-S line inoculated with the R-eggs, whereas the lowest number of eggs per female was detected on the NIL-R line inoculated with the S-eggs. This study demonstrated that the E and maximum Rf determined by the quadratic models are useful measurements of plant resistance to nematodes. 3aHeterodera glycines 3amathematical models 3aGlycine max 3aselection response 3agenetic resistance 3afecundity 3asoybeans 3ainoculum density 3apopulation growth 3apopulation density 3acyst nematodes 0areproduction 0anear isogenic lines 0aresistance genes1 aChen, S.Y.0 tJournal of nematology.g2005 June, v. 37, no. 2 p.168-177wJournal:12353x0022-300X7nnas  aDNAL  a20051118b20051202c00000000  aINDdNZMe2005/10/31  aOther US 7aarticle03320naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245011500173300001600288520178300304650001602087650002102103650001302124650001202137650002202149650001402171650001802185650002002203650003502223650003002258650001602288650002102304650002202325650001402347650002202361650001502383650001702398653002202415653000802437653002602445700001802471700001702489700002102506700002002527773011002547852000902657856009202666930003302758946001102791655001202802IND4402575720221119175020.0080309e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440257572DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-313X.2007.03390.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNomura, Hironari10aEvidence for chloroplast control of external Ca²⁺-induced cytosolic Ca²⁺ transients and stomatal closure  ap. 988-998.  aThe role of guard cell chloroplasts in stomatal function is controversial. It is usually assumed that stomatal closure is preceded by a transient increase in cytosolic free Ca²⁺ concentration ([Ca²⁺]cyt) in the guard cells. Here, we provide the evidence that chloroplasts play a critical role in the generation of extracellular Ca²⁺ ([Ca²⁺]ext)-induced [Ca²⁺]cyt transients and stomatal closure in Arabidopsis. CAS (Ca²⁺ sensing receptor) is a plant-specific putative Ca²⁺-binding protein that was originally proposed to be a plasma membrane-localized external Ca²⁺ sensor. In the present study, we characterized the intracellular localization of CAS in Arabidopsis with a combination of techniques, including (i) in vivo localization of green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused gene expression, (ii) subcellular fractionation and fractional analysis of CAS with Western blots, and (iii) database analysis of thylakoid membrane proteomes. Each technique produced consistent results. CAS was localized mainly to chloroplasts. It is an integral thylakoid membrane protein, and the N-terminus acidic Ca²⁺-binding region is likely exposed to the stromal side of the membrane. The phenotype of T-DNA insertion CAS knockout mutants and cDNA mutant-complemented plants revealed that CAS is essential for stomatal closure induced by external Ca²⁺. In contrast, overexpression of CAS promoted stomatal closure in the absence of externally applied Ca²⁺. Furthermore, using the transgenic aequorin system, we showed that [Ca²⁺]ext-induced [Ca²⁺]cyt transients were significantly reduced in CAS knockout mutants. Our results suggest that thylakoid membrane-localized CAS is essential for [Ca²⁺]ext-induced [Ca²⁺]cyt transients and stomatal closure. 3aArabidopsis 3aWestern blotting 3aaequorin 3acalcium 3acomplementary DNA 3adatabases 3afractionation 3agene expression 3agenetically modified organisms 3agreen fluorescent protein 3aguard cells 3aknockout mutants 3amembrane proteins 3aphenotype 3astomatal movement 3athylakoids 3atransfer DNA 0acalcium signaling 0aCAS 0aextracellular Ca²⁺1 aKomori, Teiko1 aKobori, Maki1 aNakahira, Yoichi1 aShiina, Takashi0 tPlant journal.g2008 Mar., v. 53, no. 6 p.988-998dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0960-74127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2007.03390.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080309b20080404c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03334naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111040001800148072000900166100002600175245017600201300001600377500002400393500001500417520125500432650001101687650001501698650001701713650002401730650001001754650002001764650000801784650001001792650001201802650002401814650002301838650002301861650002101884650001701905650002001922650001501942650002001957650001701977650003601994650003002030650004602060650001102106650002502117650001102142650002302153650003102176650000902207650002102216650002502237653001602262653001802278700002102296700002402317700001802341700001702359773008302376852000902459856008702468930003302555945002502588946001102613655001202624IND4406782720221119174953.0080613e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440678272DNAL7 a184670052pmid7 a10.1016/j.appet.2008.03.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT0001 aBrunstrom, Jeffrey M.10aEstimating everyday portion size using a 'method of constant stimuli': In a student sample, portion size is predicted by gender, dietary behaviour, and hunger, but not BMI  ap. 296-301.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis paper (i) explores the proposition that body weight is associated with large portion sizes and (ii) introduces a new technique for measuring everyday portion size. In our paradigm, the participant is shown a picture of a food portion and is asked to indicate whether it is larger or smaller than their usual portion. After responding to a range of different portions an estimate of everyday portion size is calculated using probit analysis. Importantly, this estimate is likely to be robust because it is based on many responses. First-year undergraduate students (N =151) completed our procedure for 12 commonly consumed foods. As expected, portion sizes were predicted by gender and by a measure of dieting and dietary restraint. Furthermore, consistent with reports of hungry supermarket shoppers, portion-size estimates tended to be higher in hungry individuals. However, we found no evidence for a relationship between BMI and portion size in any of the test foods. We consider reasons why this finding should be anticipated. In particular, we suggest that the difference in total energy expenditure of individuals with a higher and lower BMI is too small to be detected as a concomitant difference in portion size (at least in our sample). 3ahunger 3aestimation 3aportion size 3amathematical models 3afoods 3aprobit analysis 3amen 3awomen 3adieting 3adietary restriction 3agender differences 3aenergy expenditure 3acollege students 3afood choices 3abody mass index 2aAdolescent 2aBody Mass Index 2aDiet Surveys 2aEatingxphysiologyxpsychology. 2aEnergy Intakexphysiology 2aFeeding Behaviorxphysiologyxpsychology. 2aFemale 2aFoodxclassification 2aHumans 2aHungerxphysiology 2aInhibition, Psychological. 2aMale 2aSex Distribution 2aStudentsxpsychology 0afood intake 0aeating habits1 aRogers, Peter J.1 aPothos, Emmanuel M.1 aCalitri, Raff1 aTapper, Katy0 tAppetite.g2008 Sept., v. 51, no. 2 p.296-301dAcademic Pressx0195-66637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2008.03.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080909b20081011c00000000  aINDd6CTe2008/08/15  aNon-US 7aarticle03600naa a2200841 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111040001800148072000900166100001700175245012800192300001600320500002400336500001500360520133500375650001101710650001201721650002401733650001201757650001501769650002301784650001701807650001301824650001701837650001301854650001001867650001601877650001001893650001501903650001001918650002101928650001601949650000901965650002201974650001001996650001102006650002502017650003302042650001102075650000902086650001102095650001602106650003202122650001402154650002102168650002202189650002202211653001002233653002402243653002702267653001302294653001602307653001502323653000902338653002302347653001602370653001402386700002402400700001902424700002302443700001802466700001402484773008302498852000902581856008702590930003302677945002502710946001102735655001202746IND4406782420221119174606.0080613e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440678242DNAL7 a183959332pmid7 a10.1016/j.appet.2008.02.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT0001 aLaureati, M.10aFood memory and its relation with age and liking: An incidental learning experiment with children, young and elderly people  ap. 273-282.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe present study compared incidental learning and food memory in children, young adults and elderly people for three sensory modalities (taste, texture and aroma).

Participants received a complete meal including a custard dessert used as target under incidental learning conditions. 24h later, participants were confronted with a series of samples consisting of the target and slightly modified versions of the target (distractors) and were unexpectedly asked to perform an “absolute memory” (“Did you eat this sample yesterday?”) and a “relative memory” test (“Is the present sample less/equal/more pleasant than the one you ate yesterday?”). Participants also performed a hedonic and a discrimination test. Memory for the custard was poor and did not depend on age, but it was related to gender, and to how much participants liked the product. Females and high-likers outperformed males and low-likers in the absolute memory task, but they were not better in discriminating the products on both the hedonic and the perceptual dimension. Results also showed that, contrary to common belief, not all sensory aspects that can be discriminated in perception and in liking, are equally well remembered. 3amemory 3aelderly 3amathematical models 3atexture 3atest meals 3agender differences 3ayoung adults 3achildren 3afood choices 3adesserts 3aodors 3adiet recall 3ataste 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAge Distribution 2aAge Factors 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aChild 2aFemale 2aFoodxclassification 2aFood Preferencesxpsychology 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMemory 2aMiddle Aged 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aSensation 2aSex Distribution 2aSmellxphysiology 2aTastexphysiology 0afoods 0alearning experiment 0ahedonic discrimination 0alearning 0amemory test 0asenescence 0adiet 0asensory properties 0afood memory 0asensation1 aMorin-Audebrand, L.1 aPagliarini, E.1 aSulmont-Rossé, C.1 aKöster, E.P.1 aMojet, J.0 tAppetite.g2008 Sept., v. 51, no. 2 p.273-282dAcademic Pressx0195-66637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2008.02.0193Available from publisher's Web site  a20080909b20081011c00000000  aINDd6CTe2008/08/15  aNon-US 7aarticle02495naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245010500166300001600271520097600287650002501263650002701288650002401315650002301339650001801362650001101380650001001391650002201401650001301423650001101436650000701447650001501454650001101469650001101480650001401491653002601505653002001531653002401551700002401575700002101599700002101620700002201641700002101663700001801684773013701702852000901839856008501848930003301933946001101966655001201977IND4400997120221119174654.0080203e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440099712DNAL7 a10.1007/s11274-007-9449-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKolombet, L.

Trichoderma asperellum has demonstrated biological control capability against Fusarium head blight. In the present studies, Trichoderma asperellum was grown in liquid media of differing composition. The effect of various amendments on the preservation of the viability and competitiveness, in vitro, of fungal mycelium and spores in a liquid paste was determined. The amendments with greatest effect were the addition of starch as a food base, reduction of metabolic activity by lowering the pH of the biomass paste and the addition of small amounts of copper. Oxygen availability was also shown to be important in maintaining biomass viability and competitiveness.

Planting an understorey of nitrogen-fixing trees might be an attractive option for maintaining the N fertility of soils. The development of mono-specific stands of Acacia mangium (100A:0E) and Eucalyptus grandis (0A:100E) was compared with mixed-species plantations, where A. mangium was planted in a mixture at a density of 50% of that of E. grandis (50A:100E). N₂ fixation by A. mangium was quantified in 100A:0E and 50A:100E at age 18 and 30 months by the ¹⁵N natural abundance method and in 50A:100E at age 30 months by the ¹⁵N dilution method. The consistency of results obtained by isotopic methods was checked against observations of nodulation, Specific Acetylene Reduction Activity (SARA), as well as the dynamics of N accumulation within both species. The different tree components (leaves, branches, stems, stumps, coarse roots, medium-sized roots and fine roots) were sampled on 5-10 trees per species for each age. Litter fall was assessed up to 30 months after planting and used to estimate fine root mortality. Higher N concentrations in A. mangium tree components than in E. grandis might be a result of N₂ fixation. However, no evidence of N transfer from A. mangium to E. grandis was found. SARA values were not significantly different in 100A:0E and 50A:100E but the biomass of nodules was 20-30 times higher in 100A:0E than in 50A:100E. At age 18 months, higher δ ¹⁵N values found in A. mangium tree components than in E. grandis components prevented reliable estimations of the percentage of N derived from atmospheric fixation (%Ndfa). At age 30 months, %Ndfa estimated by natural abundance and by ¹⁵N dilution amounted to 10-20 and 60%, respectively. The amount of N derived from N₂ fixation in the standing biomass was estimated at 62kgNha⁻¹ in 100A:0E and 3kgNha⁻¹ in 50A:100E by the ¹⁵N natural abundance method, and 16kgNha⁻¹ in 50A:100E by the ¹⁵N dilution method. The total amount of atmospheric N₂ fixed since planting (including fine root mortality and litter fall) was estimated at 66kgNha⁻¹ in 100A:0E and 7kgNha⁻¹ in 50A:100E by the ¹⁵N natural abundance method, and 31kgNha⁻¹ in 50A:100E by the ¹⁵N dilution method. The most reliable estimation of N₂ fixation was likely to be achieved using the ¹⁵N dilution method and sampling the whole plant. 3anitrogen-fixing trees 3amixed stands 3anodulation 3adensity 3astable isotopes 3aroots 3aestimation 3anitrogen fixation 3anutrient uptake 3aforest stands 3asoil fertility 3aEucalyptus grandis 3aleaves 3aAcacia mangium 3aforest trees 3asoil 3abranches 3anitrogen 3anutrient partitioning 3aforest plantations 3abark 3aBrazil 0aacetylene reduction activity 0aatmospheric nitrogen 0astems 0adilution method 0anatural abundance 0anitrogen transfer1 aLaclau, J.P.1 aGonçalves, J.L.M.1 aMoreira, M.Z.1 aTrivelin, P.C.O.1 aJourdan, C.1 aSilva, E.V.1 aPiccolo, M.C.1 aTsai, S.M.1 aGaliana, A.0 tForest ecology and management.g2008 June 30, v. 255, no. 12 p.3918-3930dElsevier Sciencex0378-11277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2007.10.0503Available from publisher's Web site  a20081107b20081206c00000000  aINDdLYNe2008/11/07  aNon-US 7aarticle01876naa a2200325 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097245006200115300001400177500001500191520100900206650001701215650001001232650001701242650001701259650001901276650001201295650003001307653001201337653002801349653001401377773008401391852000901475939003301484945000801517946001301525655001201538991565680510742620221119174559.0800923e19791210xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI800026002DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL10aNIH study: Treat 'mild' high blood pressure to save lives  ap. 30,32.  a2019-12-04  aA major study of persons with "mild" hypertension shows that their lives can be prolonged and serious diseases avoided by proper treatment.

Half received ordinary care from their physicians (control group) and half received an intensive treatment regimen at 14 clinics around the country (experimental group). Experimental patients were divided into three groups: mild pressure (90-104mm Hg), "moderate" pressure (105-114), and pressure 115 and above. After 5 years, overall mortality in the experimental group was 17% lower than in the control group, and among those with mild hypertension, mortality was 20% lower. Deaths from stroke and myocardial infarction were fewer in the experimental group by 45% and 25%, respectively. The mild pressure group showed 2 statistically significant diastolic falls compared to controls. 3aepidemiology 3amales 3ahypertension 3arisk factors 3ablood pressure 3afemales 3acerebrovascular disorders 0aClinics 0acardiovascular diseases 0atreatment0 tMedical world news.g1979 Dec. 10, v. 20, no. 25 p.30,32-30,32x0025-763X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19800923c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle03390naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166072000900175100002100184245013600205300001800341500002400359500001500383520175500398650001602153650002302169650001702192650002802209650001302237650002602250650001502276650002702291650002002318650001002338650001102348650001602359650001302375650001202388650002802400650002602428651001202454653001002466700002002476700002402496700002602520773011202546852000902658856008802667930003302755945002502788946001102813655001202824IND4406786620221119174757.0080613e20080630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440678662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2008.03.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aK120 0aF600 0aP210 0aJ5001 aCobb, William R.10aAboveground biomass and nitrogen in four short-rotation woody crop species growing with different water and nutrient availabilities  ap. 4032-4039.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aWe quantified the effect of water and nutrient availability on aboveground biomass and nitrogen accumulation and partitioning in four species from the southeastern United States, loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), slash pine (Pinus elliottii), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), and sycamore (Platanus occidentalis). The 6-year-old stands received five levels of resource input (control, irrigation with 3.05cmwaterweek⁻¹, irrigation+57kgNha⁻¹ year⁻¹, irrigation+85kgNha⁻¹ year⁻¹, and irrigation+114kgNha⁻¹ year⁻¹). Irrigation significantly increased foliage, stem, and branch biomass for sweetgum and sycamore, culminating in 103% and 238% increases in total aboveground biomass. Fertilization significantly increased aboveground components for all species resulting in 49, 58, 281, and 132% increases in total aboveground biomass for loblolly pine, slash pine, sweetgum, and sycamore, respectively. Standing total aboveground biomass of the fertilized treatments reached 79, 59, 48, and 54Mgha⁻¹ for loblolly pine, slash pine, sweetgum, and sycamore, respectively. Fertilization increased foliar nitrogen concentration for loblolly pine, sweetgum, and sycamore foliage.

Total biomass averaged roughly 60Mgha⁻¹ across all sites, although the proportion of logs to snags increased over the chronosequence. Units that had been salvage logged had lower log biomass than unsalvaged units, except for the most recently burned site, where salvaged stands had higher log biomass. Mesic aspects had higher log biomass than dry aspects. Post-fire regeneration increased in density over time. In a complementary experiment, soils heating and surrogate-root mortality caused by burning of logs were measured to assess the potential site damage if fire was reintroduced in these forests. Experimentally burned logs produced lethal surface temperatures (60°C) extending up to 10cm laterally beyond the logs. Logs burned in late season produced higher surface temperatures than those burned in early season. Thermocouples buried at depth showed mean maximum temperatures exponentially declined with soil depth. Large logs, decayed logs, and those burned in late season caused higher soil temperatures than small logs, sound logs, and those burned in early season. Small diameter (~1.25cm), live Douglas-fir branch dowels, buried in soil and used as surrogates for small roots, indicated that cambial tissue was damaged to 10cm depth and to 10cm distance adjacent to burned logs. When lethal soil temperature zones were projected out to 10cm from each log, lethal cover ranged up to 24.7% on unsalvaged portions of the oldest fire, almost twice the lethal cover on salvaged portions. Where prescribed fire is introduced to post-wildfire stands aged 20-30 years, effects of root heating from smoldering coarse woody debris will be minimized by burning in spring, at least on mesic sites. There may be some long-term advantages for managers if excessive coarse woody debris loads are reduced early in the post-wildfire period. 3asoil temperature 3amontane forests 3adry environmental conditions 3asnags 3awildfires 3asoil heating 3aforest regeneration 3amortality 3acoarse woody debris 3aroots 3aslash 0aWashington 0atimber salvage 0alogs1 aAgee, James K.0 tForest ecology and management.g2008 June 30, v. 255, no. 12 p.3952-3961dElsevier Sciencex0378-11277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2008.03.0483Available from publisher's Web site  a20081107b20081206c00000000  aINDdLYNe2008/11/07  aNon-US 7aarticle02858naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100001400167245006500181300001600246500002400262500001500286520158000301650001801881650002201899650001901921650002501940650002301965650002101988650001802009653003002027653001802057700001902075700001702094700001502111700001902126773010002145852000902245856008902254930003302343945002502376946001102401655001202412IND4417676620221119174835.0090313e20090501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441767662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2008.11.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF4001 aXu, Suxia10aReproductive organography of Bougainvillea spectabilis Willd  ap. 399-405.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBougainvillea spectabilis Willd. is of prime importance for horticulture, as well as potentially for pharmaceutical industries, agriculture and environmental industries. However, its floral development is not yet well understood. A detailed study on floral structure and floral organography in the species was first completed using microscopy of paraffin microtome sections of buds. The results were indicated as follows: first, the three trumped flowers in the cymose inflorescence develop asynchronously. Secondly, Varieties with multi-whorl bracts do not develop any sexual organs, i.e., perianth, pistil and stamens. Thirdly, the wall of the two-loculus anther consists of two kinds of cells: the inner wall, consisting of thick-cytoplasmed cells and the outer wall, consisting of fibrous cells. Fourthly, the pollen grains, with three germination colpi, vary substantially in the form and size in summer under the highest day temperature of 40°C. Fifthly, the pistil is characterized with betalain-acumulating stylar brush. Followed the developmental course, only one basal ovule is developed in the superior ovary. Finally, organs of one flower develop consecutively from the outer to the inner, i.e., from bracts, to calyx, stamen, and carpel while the three flowers bloomed one by one in one cymose inflorescence. It almost takes 1 week from first bud to the third flower blooming. Our research showed a series of special characteristics of reproduction organography of B. spectabilis which can be useful for understanding its reproduction biology and its sterility. 3aBougainvillea 3aornamental plants 3ainflorescences 3adevelopmental stages 3aplant reproduction 3aplant morphology 3aorganogenesis 0aBougainvillea spectabilis 0aplant anatomy1 aHuang, Qingyun1 aShu, Qingyan1 aChen, Chun1 aVick, Brady A.0 tScientia horticulturae.g2009 May 1, v. 120, no. 3 p.399-405dElsevier Sciencex0304-42387nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2008.11.0233Available from publisher's Web site  a20090506b20090608c00000000  aINDd9CTe2009/04/25  aNon-US 7aarticle02479naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245012500143300001600268500002300284500001500307520107300322650002501395650001001420650001401430650001301444650002401457650002401481650002801505650002601533650001401559650002501573650003601598653002201634653001801656653002801674653002301702700001301725700001401738700001401752700001401766700001601780700001801796700001401814773009201828852000901920939003301929946001101962655001201973IND9301415420221119174734.0930308e199007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930141542DNAL7 a22228532pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSidler, W.14aThe complete amino-acid sequence and the phylogenetic origin of phycocyanin-645 from the cryptophytan alga Chroomonas sp  ap. 537-547.  aSummary in German.  a2019-12-04  aThe first complete amino-acid sequence of the cryptomonad phycobiliprotein phycocyanin-645 from Chroomonas sp. is presented. The alpha 1-subunit contains 70 amino-acid residues and the alpha 2-subunit 80 residues. In each of the alpha-subunits a green, 697-nm absorbing chromophore is covalently bound to Cys18. Both alpha-subunits contain a high number of charged residues. The phycocyanin-645 beta-subunit consists of 177 amino-acid residues. Two phycocyanobilin chromophores are singly bound to Cys beta 82 and Cys beta 158. A purple cryptoviolin-like chromophore is doubly bound to Cys beta 50 and Cys beta 61. Sequence comparisons revealed that the phycocyanin-645 beta-subunit is closely related to red algal phycoerythrin (73% identical amino-acid residues) and not so close to C-phycocyanin (55% identical amino-acid residues). The phycocyanin-645 alpha-subunits represent a special type of phycobiliprotein and a direct relationship to other phycobiliproteins or any light-harvesting polypeptide-pigment complexes could not be derived by sequence comparisons. 3aamino acid sequences 3aalgae 3aphylogeny 3apigments 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aEukaryotaxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhycocyaninxgenetics 2aPhylogeny 2aRhodophytaxgenetics 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 0aphycobiliproteins 0aphycoerythrin 0amolecular sequence data 0aalgae and seaweeds1 aNutt, H.1 aKumpf, B.1 aFrank, G.1 aSuter, F.1 aBrenzel, A.1 aWehrmeyer, W.1 aZuber, H.0 tBiological chemistry Hoppe-Seyler.g1990 July, v. 371, no. 7 p.537-547x0177-35937nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02586naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111040001800133072001700151072001700168100001800185245007200203300001600275500001500291520137800306650002601684650001201710650001901722650002401741650002201765650002101787650001201808650000901820650002201829650002301851650001301874651001101887653002101898653001701919700001801936773009401954852000902048930003302057945002502090946001302115655001202128IND4375221220221119174845.0051014e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437522122DNAL7 a192628672pmid7 aPMC26209522pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Six samples of 10 cores each were gathered from each community. Nematodes were extracted from 200 cm3 soil by elutriation. All extracted nematodes were counted and identified to species-level taxa. Sixty-seven species were identified among the four plant communities; only eight species occurred in all four communities. Species diversity and evenness were greater in the rain forest and mesic forest than in the bog and the drier forest, but the drier forest and mesic forest had similar species communities. The bog nematode community was not similar to the other three sites. In a presence/absence cluster analysis, all six bog sample assemblages clustered together. The rain forest samples also clustered together but were associated with the mesic forest sample closest to the rain forest edge. Of 11 nematode orders collected, Tylenchida accounted for 40% to 73% of all individuals, followed by Dorylaimida (5% to 17%). Diplogasterida were absent. No plant-parasitic nematodes of known Hawaiian agricultural importance or occurrence were collected in these native plant communities. Calculated nematode densities (76,000 to 321,300/m2) were comparable to those reported for some other Pacific tropical forests. 3atropical rain forests 3aislands 3asoil nematodes 3acommunity structure 3aplant communities 3acluster analysis 3asurveys 3abogs 3aspecies diversity 3apopulation density 3aNematoda 3aHawaii 0atropical forests 0abiodiversity1 aSchmitt, D.P.0 tJournal of nematology.g2005 June, v. 37, no. 2 p.242-248wJournal:12353x0022-300X7nnas  aDNAL  a20051118b20051202c00000000  aINDdNZMe2005/10/31  aOther US 7aarticle02318naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159072000900168100001400177245014800191300001500339500002400354500001500378520074200393650001901135650002601154650002001180650002301200650002101223650001701244650004401261650000901305650001101314650001401325650002001339650002801359650001901387653002001406653001701426700001901443700001501462700001501477700001701492773011101509852000901620856009001629930003301719945002501752946001101777655001201788IND4406785220221119174925.0080613e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440678522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2008.04.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ101 0aQ111 0aQ5011 aSerra, M.10aQuantification of lipolysis and lipid oxidation during cold storage of yogurts produced from milk treated by ultra-high pressure homogenization  ap. 99-104.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe degree of lipolysis and lipid oxidation in yogurts from UHPH-treated milk was investigated because of their potential impact on the final flavour of the product.

Potato slices of different initial thicknesses (1.5, 2.5 and 3.5mm) were pretreated with three different methods (blanching and then freezing for 24h, blanching and then repeated freezing/thawing either for 3 or 5 cycles) to study the effects of these pretreatment methods on the degree of starch retrogradation. The potato slices were then dried by LPSSD at 90°C and absolute pressure of 7kPa to three levels of final moisture content (1.5%, 2.5% and 3.5% (d.b.)) to investigate the drying kinetics and the quality of dried potato chips in terms of hardness, toughness and crispness as well as degree of crystallinity by X-ray diffraction technique. The various pretreatment methods were found to have an obvious effect on the rates of moisture reduction of the samples. Higher degrees of starch retrogradation led to an increase in the hardness and toughness of dried chips, but did not show any significant effect on the crispness of the chips. An increase in the degree of starch retrogradation led to higher degree of crystallinity of dried potato chips. 3awater content 3apotato chips 3apotato starch 3ablanching 3asteaming 3adrying 3asupercooling 3apretreatment 3abaking quality 3abaking 3acrystallization 3adrying quality 3athickness 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3aretrogradation 3atexture 3awater activity 3aX-ray diffraction1 aDevahastin, Sakamon1 aChiewchan, Naphaporn0 tJournal of food engineering.g2008 Nov., v. 89, no. 1 p.72-79dElsevier Science Pub.

The workshop recommended that the social, cultural, and ethnic characteristics of the population be considered, either before designing a study or during post-assessment. An informed consent principle was proposed, with children found to have diseases to be referred for treatment. Dietary assessment was considered necessary for international comparisons. In addition, smoking history and physical activity should be assessed. It was felt that serum lipid analyses should be done in more detail, and that there should be training in the standardization of blood pressure measurement. A uniform way of presenting the resulting data also was recommended. 3aetiology 3aatherosclerosis 3arisk factors 3anational surveys 3anutrition assessment 2aAdolescent 2aAge Factors 2aArteriosclerosisxepidemiology 2aChild 2aHumans 2aRisk 2aWorld Health Organization 0aresearch methods 0aCultural factors 0aInternational programs0 tWHO chronicle.g1980 May, v. 34, no. 5 p.189-191x0042-96947nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19801001c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US 7aarticle03480naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129072000900147072000900156072000900165072000900174100001500183245006600198300001600264500002400280500001500304520215800319650002902477650001802506650002702524650002102551650001302572650001502585650002002600653002002620653001702640653006802657700002002725700001502745773009702760852000902857856008702866930003302953945002502986946001103011655001203022IND4406787720221119174828.0080613e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440678772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2008.02.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF100 0aJ700 0aP200 0aX1001 aNangia, V.10aWater quality implications of raising crop water productivity  ap. 825-835.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBecause of a growing and more affluent population, demand for agricultural products will increase rapidly over the coming decades, with serious implications for agricultural water demand. Symptoms of water scarcity are increasingly apparent, threatening ecosystem services and the sustainability of food production. Improved water productivity will reduce the additional water requirements in agriculture. However, there is a tradeoff between the quantity of water used in agriculture and the quality of return flow. Where yields are low due to limited nitrogen (N) and water supply, water productivity can be enhanced through higher fertilizer applications and improved water management. This limits the amount of additional water needed for increased food demand, thus leaving more water for environmental requirements. But it also increases the amount of nitrate (NO₃-N) leaching, thus adversely affecting the water quality of return flows. This paper quantifies the tradeoff between enhanced water productivity and NO₃-N leaching and shows the importance of the right management of water and N applications. Using the Decision Support System for Agro-technology Transfer (DSSAT) crop model, several scenarios combining different water and N application regimes are examined for maize (Zea mays L.) in Gainesville, FL, USA. Without adequate water, nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) remains low, resulting in substantial NO₃-N leaching. Too much water leads to excessive NO₃-N leaching and lower water productivity. The lack of N is a cause of low water productivity but too much of it leads to lower NUE and higher losses. The paper concludes that increased NO₃-N leaching is an inevitable by-product of increased water productivity, but its adverse impacts can greatly be reduced by better management of water and N application. The paper briefly shows that leaching can be reduced and water productivity increased by split application of N-fertilizer. This implies that improved water and nutrient management at field- and scheme-level is a prerequisite to limit adverse impacts of agriculture on ecosystems, now and especially in the future. 3adecision support systems 3awater quality 3afertilizer application 3awater management 3aleaching 3acrop yield 3adecision making 0acrop production 0aproductivity 0aDecision Support System for Agro-technology Transfer crop model1 ade Fraiture, C.1 aTurral, H.0 tAgricultural water management.g2008 July, v. 95, no. 7 p.825-835dElsevierx0378-37747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2008.02.0143Available from publisher's Web site  a20090821b20091002c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/07/30  aNon-US 7aarticle02513naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111040001800133072001700151100001500168245006200183300001600245500001500261520128800276650002101564650001001585650001201595650000801607650002601615650001501641650001101656650002101667650002601688650002401714651001201738653002201750653001601772653001601788653002401804653002401828700001701852773009401869852000901963930003301972945002502005946001302030655001202043IND4380787120221119174941.0060607e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438078712DNAL7 a192628982pmid7 aPMC26209902pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aXing, L.J.12aA method for field infestation with Meloidogyne incognita  ap. 500-503.  a2019-12-05  aA field inoculation method was developed to produce Meloidogyne spp. infestation sites with minimal quantities of nematode inoculum and with a reduced labor requirement compared to previous techniques. In a preseason-methyl bromide-fumigated site, nematode egg suspensions were delivered at concentrations of 0 or 10(x) eggs/m of row where x = 2.12, 2.82, 3.52, or 4.22 through a drip line attached to the seed firmer of a commercial 2-row planter into the open seed furrow while planting cowpea. These treatments were compared to a hand-inoculated treatment, in which 10(3.1) eggs were delivered every 30 cm in 5 ml of water agar suspension 2 weeks after planting. Ten weeks after planting, infection of cowpea roots was measured by gall rating and gall counts on cowpea roots. A linear relationship between the inoculation levels and nematode-induced galls was found. At this time, the amount of galling per root system in the hand-inoculated treatment was less than in the machine-applied treatments. Advantages of this new technique include application uniformity and low population level requisite for establishing the nematode. This method has potential in field-testing of Meloidogyne spp. management strategies by providing uniform infestation of test sites at planting time. 3asoil inoculation 3aVigna 3acowpeas 3aova 3aMeloidogyne incognita 3aroot galls 3asowing 3ainoculum density 3afield experimentation 3aroot-knot nematodes 3aIndiana 0anematode inoculum 0amethodology 0anew methods 0auniform infestation 0ainfestation methods1 aWestphal, A.0 tJournal of nematology.g2005 Dec., v. 37, no. 4 p.500-503wJournal:12353x0022-300X7nnas  aDNAL  a20080310b20080404c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/05/30  aOther US 7aarticle02375naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150100001800159245009000177300001600267500002400283520118900307650001801496650002201514650002701536650001601563650001501579650001601594650002401610650001101634700002201645700001701667700001301684773011201697852000901809856009001818930003301908945002501941946001101966655001201977IND4417673620221119174714.0090313e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441767362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2008.12.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ3001 aChen, Jianshe12aA novel technique for in situ measurements of stress development within a drying film  ap. 383-388.  aIncludes references  aA novel technique capable of monitoring the stress evolving process within a drying film has been developed in this work. The device uses a thin cantilever beam made of stainless steel to hold a thin layer of fluid material. The (bending) force exerted on the beam as a result of the lateral stress developed within the film is measured via a pendant-balance transmitting mechanism. The reliability of the device was tested with two different biopolymer fluids (18wt% sodium caseinate and 30wt% waxy maize starch) dried at different temperatures and relative humidity (RH). The results revealed three stages of stress development for these biopolymer films: an initial delay, a sharp stress increase, followed by a steady stress plateau. Further analysis of experimental data showed that stress development and moisture loss can be normalised to form a master curve. However, it appeared that the magnitude of stress increase has no direct link with the rate of moisture loss, indicating possibly different mechanisms of the stress increase and the loss of moisture. Results also showed that the total stress of a dried starch film was much higher than that of a dried caseinate film. 3awater content 3afilms (materials) 3abiodegradable products 3acorn starch 3acaseinates 3abiopolymers 3apackaging materials 3adrying1 aEttelaie, Rammile1 aYang, Haiyan1 aYao, Lin0 tJournal of food engineering.g2009 June, v. 92, no. 4 p.383-388dElsevier Science Pub.

In parental isolates cultured on susceptible and resistant cowpea, the virulent isolate contained 100% and the avirulent isolate 7% virulent lineages. Virulence was selected from the avirulent isolate within eight generations on resistant cowpea (lineage selection). In addition, virulence was selected from avirulent females (individual selection). Virulence differed (P less than or equal to 0.05) both within and between cohorts of IFL cultured for up to 27 generations on susceptible or resistant cowpea. Distinct virulence profiles were observed among IFL. Some remained avirulent on susceptible plants and became extinct on resistant plants; some remained virulent on resistant and susceptible plants; some changed from avirulent to virulent on resistant plants; and others changed from virulent to avirulent on susceptible plants. Also, some IFL increased in virulence on susceptible plants. Single descent lines from IFL showed similar patterns of virulence for up to six generations. These results revealed considerable genetic variation in virulence in a mitotic parthenogenetic nematode population. The frequencies of lineages with stable or changeable virulence and avirulence phenotypes determined the overall virulence potential of the population. 3aMeloidogyne incognita 3aroot-knot nematodes 3avirulence 3agenetic variation 3aline differences 3aartificial selection 3aVigna unguiculata 3acowpeas 3agenetic resistance1 aRoberts, P.A.0 tJournal of nematology.g2005 Dec., v. 37, no. 4 p.448-456wJournal:12353x0022-300X7nnas  aDNAL  a20080310b20080404c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/05/30  aOther US 7aarticle02200naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245010700166300001600273520099100289650001201280650001701292650001201309650002201321650001401343650002501357650001101382651001601393653002601409653002001435653002901455653002701484700003701511773012801548852000901676856008501685930003301770946001101803655001201814IND4407091020221119174816.0080620e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440709102DNAL7 a10.1007/s10640-007-9157-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKahui, Viktoria 12aA Bioeconomic Analysis of Marine Reserves for Paua (Abalone) Management at Stewart Island, New Zealand  ap. 339-367.  aTraditional fisheries management relies on the imposition of gear and/or effort restrictions. In spite of much experience with such techniques, the danger of fishery collapse is ever present. Biologists have advocated an alternative strategy, the establishment of marine reserves. However, it is possible that the benefits of marine reserve creation can be overstated if economic behaviour is ignored. In spite of being managed under a system of transferable quotas, the Stewart Island paua (abalone) fishery has been in decline for some time. We develop an integrated economic and biological model of this fishery and use it to predict biomass levels in a number of scenarios, including the imposition of a network of no-take areas. We identify circumstances under which the marine reserve solution outperforms traditional management techniques. We show that the benefit of a marine reserve is highest when a fishery is heavily exploited and when accounting for stochastic recruitment. 3aabalone 3abioeconomics 3abiomass 3aeconomic behavior 3afisheries 3afisheries management 3amodels 3aNew Zealand 0aBioeconomic modelling 0aMarine reserves 0aPaua (abalone) fisheries 0aStochastic recruitment1 aAlexander, William Robert James 0 tEnvironmental and resource economics.g2008 July, v. 40, no. 3 p.339-367dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0924-64607nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10640-007-9157-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20080620b20080704c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04380naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245010200165300001300267500001500280520267400295650002002969650001002989650002302999650001603022650001603038650001203054650001903066650000803085650001403093650001403107650001803121650001703139650001103156650001503167650001903182650001103201650002503212650001203237650001803249651001903267653003303286653002203319653001903341653001103360653002803371653002003399700002203419700002303441700001803464700002503482773013303507852000903640856008503649930003303734946001103767655001203778IND4406529620221119174746.0080606e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440652962DNAL7 a10.1007/s10546-008-9273-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJuang, Jehn-Yih10aInvestigating a Hierarchy of Eulerian Closure Models for Scalar Transfer Inside Forested Canopies  ap. 1-32.  a2019-12-04  aModelling the transfer of heat, water vapour, and CO₂ between the biosphere and the atmosphere is made difficult by the complex two-way interaction between leaves and their immediate microclimate. When simulating scalar sources and sinks inside canopies on seasonal, inter-annual, or forest development time scales, the so-called well-mixed assumption (WMA) of mean concentration (i.e. vertically constant inside the canopy but dynamically evolving in time) is often employed. The WMA eliminates the need to model how vegetation alters its immediate microclimate, which necessitates formulations that utilize turbulent transport theories. Here, two inter-related questions pertinent to the WMA for modelling scalar sources, sinks, and fluxes at seasonal to inter-annual time scales are explored: (1) if the WMA is to be replaced so as to resolve this two-way interaction, how detailed must the turbulent transport model be? And (2) what are the added predictive skills gained by resolving the two-way interaction vis-à-vis other uncertainties such as seasonal variations in physiological parameters. These two questions are addressed by simulating multi-year mean scalar concentration and eddy-covariance scalar flux measurements collected in a Loblolly pine (P. taeda L.) plantation near Durham, North Carolina, U.S.A. using turbulent transport models ranging from K-theory (or first-order closure) to third-order closure schemes. The multi-layer model calculations with these closure schemes were contrasted with model calculations employing the WMA. These comparisons suggested that (i) among the three scalars, sensible heat flux predictions are most biased with respect to eddy-covariance measurements when using the WMA, (ii) first-order closure schemes are sufficient to reproduce the seasonal to inter-annual variations in scalar fluxes provided the canonical length scale of turbulence is properly specified, (iii) second-order closure models best agree with measured mean scalar concentration (and temperature) profiles inside the canopy as well as scalar fluxes above the canopy, (iv) there are no clear gains in predictive skills when using third-order closure schemes over their second-order closure counterparts. At inter-annual time scales, biases in modelled scalar fluxes incurred by using the WMA exceed those incurred when correcting for the seasonal amplitude in the maximum carboxylation capacity (V cmax, ₂₅) provided its mean value is unbiased. The role of local thermal stratification inside the canopy and possible computational simplifications in decoupling scalar transfer from the generation of the flow statistics are also discussed. 3aeddy covariance 3atrees 3aseasonal variation 3aPinus taeda 3awater vapor 3aforests 3acarbon dioxide 3aair 3abreathing 3abiosphere 3acarboxylation 3amicroclimate 3amodels 3aprediction 3aturbulent flow 3acanopy 3atemperature profiles 3astomata 3aheat transfer 3aNorth Carolina 0aNet ecosystem CO₂ exchange 0aCanopy turbulence 0aClosure models 0aleaves 0aStratified canopy flows 0aScalar transfer1 aKatul, Gabriel G.1 aSiqueira, Mario B.1 aStoy, Paul C.1 aMcCarthy, Heather R.0 tBoundary-layer meteorology.g2008 July, v. 128, no. 1 p.1-32dDordrecht : Springer NetherlandswJournal:jnl9360x0006-83147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10546-008-9273-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20080606b20080704c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02707naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245012400168300001600292520132100308650001901629650002501648650002101673650002401694650001901718650001801737650001101755650004301766650001501809650001401824650001201838650001001850653001401860653002401874700002401898700002501922700002301947700002301970773013001993852000902123856008502132930003302217946001102250655001202261IND4404358520221119174938.0080412e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440435852DNAL7 a10.1007/s00217-007-0709-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlanda, Giampaolo 10aPhenolic content and antioxidant capacity versus consumer acceptance of soaked and vacuum impregnated frozen nectarines  ap. 191-197.  aNectarines (Prunus persica L. cv. Maria Laura) were manually selected, cut in slices and divided into four groups: fresh, untreated frozen, soaked in osmotic solution and subsequently frozen, and vacuum impregnated (VI) and subsequently frozen. This investigation was focused on evaluation of consumer acceptance with respect to treated versus untreated frozen nectarine slices. In a preliminary acceptance test of untreated frozen nectarine slices, fruits were generally rejected on the basis of a darkened appearance and “oxidized” taste. These negative attributes were probably linked to the activity of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and depletion of phenols due to cell rupture during freeze-thaw procedures. For these reasons, in order to evaluate the tendency of fruit to oxidation, several analyses were performed: the antioxidant capacity of phenolic fraction and the o-diphenol content were estimated by spectrophotometric assays, whereas the hydroxycinnamic acid (chlorogenic and neochlorogenic acids) composition was evaluated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).

Pollinizer cultivars produced about half of their optimal fruit set when selfed, but cross-pollination was needed to reach an optimal fruit set of 33.7%. Eighty-one percent of the overall fruit set in pistillate vines was attributed to insect cross-pollination; wind played only a small role. Diminished fruit set and fewer seeds per berry occurred in cultivars receiving no effective cross-pollination. Components of fruit quality were not profoundly affected by the pollination treatments, although seed set and berry weight in pistillate cultivars was lower in the absence of cross-pollination. Parthenocarpy was rare, except in 'Fry Seedless'. Muscadine production throughout the southeastern United States depends on cross-pollination by indigenous insects, particularly bees. To ensure consistently high yields, bees must have safe access to flowers and their nesting sites must be preserved. 3acultivars 3acrop quality 3awind 3apollinators 3aVitis rotundifolia 3aparthenocarpy 3aseed productivity 3aseed set 3across pollination 3aMississippi 0afruit set 0apollination1 aNoffsinger, S.1 aGupton, C.1 aMagee, John P.0 tHortScience.g2001 Feb., v. 36, no. 1 p.120-124x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL  a20010702b20010710c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03083naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245007800127300001600205520197800221650001902199650002302218650002102241650001202262650002302274650002502297650001702322650002302339650001202362650001102374650001002385650001902395650001902414653001902433653001002452700001502462700002002477700001502497773006902512852000902581930003302590945001302623946001302636655001202649IND2303168220221117183922.0010501e200102  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND230316822DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKelley, K.M.10aConsumer and professional chef perceptions of three edible-flower species  ap. 162-166.  aTwo surveys were conducted to assess consumer and professional chefs' perceptions of three edible-flower species. Our objectives were to determine opinions, preferences, and uses of Viola tricolor L. 'Helen Mount' (viola), Borago officinalis L. (borage), and Tropaeolum majus L. 'Jewel Mix' (nasturtium). Flowers were grown using certifiable organic methods and chosen to reflect a variety of flower tastes, textures, and appearances. We quantified three attributes (taste, fragrance, and visual appeal) with a total of seven semantic, differential scales adapted from a scaling authority. The attributes were rated as: visual-"appealing", "desirable," and "very interested in tasting"; fragrance-"appealing" and "pleasant"; and taste-"tasty" and "desirable". Garden Day participants were self-selected to evaluate and taste flowers from a consumer perspective. When asked to rate the three species on visual appeal and desire, no less than 76% of consumers awarded all flowers an acceptable rating. We found similar results when consumers answered questions regarding the taste of two of the three species. Results from this study support our hypothesis that customers would rate edible flower attributes highly and would be likely to purchase and serve the three species tested. Members of the Michigan Chefs de Cuisine Association participated in a similar survey. At least 66% of these chefs rated the three visual attributes and two fragrance attributes of viola and nasturtium acceptable. Chefs' ratings of the fragrance of borage as "appealing" and "pleasant" were higher than those of consumers, but the ratings were still low, 21% and 25%, respectively. Unlike consumers, chefs' ratings of the taste of viola as "appealing" and "desirable" were low (29% and 36%, respectively). We found some minor differences in ratings when groups were compared, using demographic variables as a basis for segmentation, indicating a homogenous marketing strategy may be employed. 3aViola tricolor 3aBorago officinalis 3aTropaeolum majus 3aflowers 3aconsumer attitudes 3aconsumer preferences 3afood choices 3asensory evaluation 3atexture 3aflavor 3aodors 3afood marketing 3aedible species 0avisual stimuli 0acooks1 aBehe, B.K.1 aBiernbaum, J.A.1 aPoff, K.L.0 tHortScience.g2001 Feb., v. 36, no. 1 p.162-166x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL  a20010702b20010710c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle01754naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245010900129300001600238520065100254650002400905650001500929650001800944650002200962650002100984650001901005650001601024650001501040650002101055650001401076650001401090653001101104653001301115700001401128700001701142700001801159700001801177773006901195852000901264930003301273945001301306946001301319655001201332IND2303167620221117183917.0010501e200102  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND230316762DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAyanlaja, S.A.10aLeachate from earthworm castings breaks seed dormancy and preferentially promotes radicle growth in jute  ap. 143-144.  aSeeds of jute (Chorchorus olitorius L.) undergo a period of dormancy, which hitherto has been broken with the conventional method of steeping in boiling water. Another seed treatment procedure, which involves soaking seeds in earthworm cast leachate, was found superior to the conventional method of breaking dormancy. Furthermore, radicle growth was enhanced when seeds were irrigated with water that contained earthworm cast leachate instead of water without earthworm cast leachate. This possibly suggests that earthworms excrete substances that contain hormones or biochemically active ingredients that are capable of stimulating root growth. 3aCorchorus olitorius 3aworm casts 3aseed dormancy 3adormancy breaking 3aseed germination 3aseed treatment 3amethodology 3airrigation 3airrigation water 3aexcretion 3aleachates 0agrowth 0aradicles1 aOwa, S.O.1 aAdigun, M.O.1 aSenjobi, B.A.1 aOlaleye, A.O.0 tHortScience.g2001 Feb., v. 36, no. 1 p.143-144x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL  a20010702b20010710c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02733naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245012100125300001400246520151300260650002401773650004301797650001901840650002101859650002101880650001101901650001801912650002001930650001901950650001101969650001101980650001901991650001302010653001602023653001502039653001102054700001702065700002602082700001702108700001502125773006702140852000902207930003302216945001302249946001302262655001202275IND2303163520221117173649.0010501e200102  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND230316352DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKubota, C.10aGrowth and net photosynthetic rate of tomato plantlets during photoautotrophic and photomixotrophic micropropagation  ap. 49-52.  aNodal explants of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) were cultured in vitro to evaluate the effects of sugar concentration, photosynthetic photon flux (PPF), CO2 concentration, ventilation rate of the vessel, and leaf removal on growth and photosynthesis. After 20 days of culture, the dry weights of plantlets derived from explants with leaves and cultured photoautotrophically (without sugar in the medium) under high PPF, high CO2 concentration, and high ventilation rate were more than twice as great as those of plantlets derived conventionally from explants without leaves and cultured photomixotrophically (with sugar in the medium) under low PPF, low CO2 concentration, and low ventilation rate (107 and 45 mg per plantlet, respectively). Under photomixotrophic micropropagation conditions, the dry weights of plantlets from explants with leaves increased more than did those of plantlets from explants without leaves. High PPF, high CO2 concentration, and high ventilation rate increased net photosynthetic rate and promoted growth of the plantlets under photomixotrophic micropropagation conditions. Photomixotrophic conditions produced the greatest dry weight and the longest shoots, but photoautotrophic conditions produced the highest net photosynthetic rate. The number of leaves did not differ significantly between photoautotrophically and photomixotrophically cultured plantlets. Thus, photoautotrophic micropropagation is applicable to the production of high quality tomato transplants. 3aventilation systems 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3aphotosynthesis 3amicropropagation 3aplant physiology 3asugars 3aculture media 3alight intensity 3acarbon dioxide 3aleaves 3ashoots 3atissue culture 3aexplants 0agrowth rate 0adry matter 0agrowth1 aKakizaki, N.1 aKozai, Toyoki,d1943-1 aKasahara, K.1 aNemoto, J.0 tHortScience.g2001 Feb., v. 36, no. 1 p.49-52x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL  a20010702b20010710c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02181naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245003200124300001600156520146500172650000901637650001201646653001501658700001701673700001901690700001701709700002001726773006701746852000901813930003301822945001301855946001101868655001201879IND2037069320221123040100.0940202s1994    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203706932DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOphir, J.10aElastography of beef muscle  ap. 239-250.  aElastography, a technique that uses ultrasonic pulses to track the internal displacements of small tissue elements in response to an externally applied stress, has been applied to beef muscle. Beef longissimus (1 day post mortem) and semimembranosus (5 days post mortem) muscles were obtained from A maturity beef carcasses. Samples were vacuum-packaged and frozen to -20 degrees C For elastography measurements, muscles were equilibrated to a constant temperature (30 degrees C +/- 0.5) in a water tank. Custom transmitters and receivers were used in conjunction with a 2.25 Mhz medical transducer. The transducer was driven by a 286 PC, and the radio-frequency echoes digitized at 50 Mhz and 8 bits. The pre- and post-compression echo trains (A-lines) were subjected to cross-correlation analysis. Visual interpretation of beef elastograms demonstrate circular areas of relatively inelastic tissues and smaller, banding areas of elastic tissues in the cross-section of beef longissimus muscle. The dark inelastic areas from the elastograms may be related to myofibrilar areas from the same muscle sections; the light, elastic band areas from the elastograms may be related to perimysial connective tissue or intramuscular fat. Fatty septa and a calcified abscess could be easily identified on the elastogram. These preliminary results demonstrate that elastography may have potential as a non-intrusive method of visualizing tissue components of beef muscle. 3abeef 3amuscles 0aelasticity1 aMiller, R.K.1 aPonnekanti, H.1 aCespedes, I.1 aWhittaker, A.D.0 tMeat science.g1994, v. 36, no. 1/2 p.239-250x0309-17407nnas  aDNAL  a19940305b19940310c00000000  aINDdJFM  aNon-US 7aarticle01758naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245007200125300001600197500001500213520103100228650000901259650001401268653001801282653002301300653001201323773006701335852000901402930003301411945001301444946001101457655001201468IND2037068320221123025651.0940202s1994    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203706832DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKanner, J.10aOxidative processes in meat and meat products: quality implications  ap. 169-189.  a2019-12-05  aLipid peroxidation is, in most instances, a free radical chain reaction that can be described in terms of initiation, propagation, branching and termination processes. With regard to lipid peroxidation, one of the most important questions concerns the source of the primary catalysis that initiate peroxidation in situ in muscle foods. When cells are injured, such as in muscle foods after slaughtering, lipid peroxidation is favored, and traces of O2 and H2O2, indicating lipid peroxides, are formed. The stability of a muscle food product will depend on the 'tone' of these peroxides and especially from the involvement of metal ions in the process. The cytosol contains not only prooxidants but also antioxidants and the tone of both affects the overall oxidation. Lipid peroxidation is one of the primary mechanisms of quality deterioration in foods and especially in meat products. The changes in quality can be manifested by deterioration in flavor, color, texture, nutritive value and the production of toxic compounds. 3ameat 3aoxidation 0ameat products 0aliterature reviews 0aquality0 tMeat science.g1994, v. 36, no. 1/2 p.169-189x0309-17407nnas  aDNAL  a19940305b19940310c00000000  aINDdJFM  aNon-US 7aarticle02772naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245011400126300001600240520182800256650002002084650001802104650001202122650001202134650002102146650001602167650001702183651001302200653001102213700001302224700002102237700001502258773006902273852000902342930003302351945001302384946001302397655001202410IND2328364620221123025535.0020805e200206  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232836462DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErvin, E.H.10aTrinexapac-ethyl restricts shoot growth and prolongs stand density of 'Meyer' zoysiagrass fairway under shade  ap. 502-505.  a'Meyer' zoysiagrass (Zoysia japonica Steud.) is a popular turfgrass species for transition zone golf course fairways and tees because it is generally winter hardy while providing an excellent playing surface with minimal chemical and irrigation inputs. However, its functionality declines readily on many of the shaded areas on these courses. Reduced irradiance causes excessive shoot elongation, reduced tillering, and weak plants that are poorly suited to tolerate or recover from traffic and divoting. Trinexapacethyl (TE) effectively reduces gibberellic acid (GA) biosynthesis and subsequent shoot cell elongation. The objective of this study was to determine if monthly applications of TE would reduce shoot elongation of 'Meyer' zoysiagrass and improve stand persistence under two levels of shade. Shade structures were constructed in the field that continuously restricted 77% and 89% irradiance. A mature stand of 'Meyer' was treated with all combinations of three levels of shade (0%, 77%, and 89%) and three levels of monthly TE application [0, 48 g(.)ha-1 a.i. (0.5x), and 96 g(.)ha-1 a.i. (1x)] in 1998 and 1999. In full sun, the 0.5x-rate reduced clipping production by 17% to 20% over a four-week period and the 1x-rate by 30% to 37%. Monthly application of TE at the 1x-rate increased 'Meyer' tiller density in full sun and under 77% shade. Both rates of TE consistently reduced shoot growth under shade relative to the shaded control. Only the monthly applications at the 1x-rate consistently delayed loss of quality under 77% shade. The zoysiagrass persisted very poorly under 89% shade whether treated or not with TE and plots were mostly dead at the end of the experiment. Our results indicate TE can be an effective management practice to increase 'Meyer' zoysiagrass persistence in shaded environments. 3aZoysia japonica 3astand density 3atillers 3atraffic 3agibberellic acid 3acell growth 3agolf courses 3aMissouri 0agrowth1 aOk, C.H.1 aFresenburg, B.S.1 aDunn, J.H.0 tHortScience.g2002 June, v. 37, no. 3 p.502-505x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL  a20021002b20021010c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle01533naa a2200241 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245009300126300001400219520085500233650001701088650002001105650002301125773006501148852000901213930003301222945001301255946001101268655001201279IND2037066420221122235835.0940202s1994    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203706642DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSellier, P.14aThe future role of molecular genetics in the control of meat production and meat quality  ap. 29-44.  aCurrent applications of quantitative genetics for genetic improvement of farm animals rely on sophisticated statistical procedures applied to fairly simple genetic models and have been effective in producing large cumulative genetic changes in many traits.

It is not, at this stage, obvious that transgenesis will be an important way of improving meat-producing animals, at least in the near future. 3ameat quality 3ameat production 3amolecular genetics0 tMeat science.g1994, v. 36, no. 1/2 p.29-44x0309-17407nnas  aDNAL  a19940305b19940310c00000000  aINDdJFM  aNon-US 7aarticle01766naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245005400128300001800182500001500200520076100215650001400976650002800990650003301018650002301051650002001074650002201094650002401116650002801140650002301168650002501191653002401216653001301240773007101253852000901324930003301333945001301366946001301379655001201392IND2230377620221122230931.0010220e200012  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND223037762DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBosland, P.W.10aSources of curly top virus resistance in Capsicum  ap. 1321-1322.  a2019-12-05  aDuring a natural field epidemic of curly top virus, accessions within five species of Capsicum were evaluated for resistance.

These subspecies are allopatric except for two known regions of sympatry in Texas and Mexico. We demonstrate that populations of D. v. virgifera, with the exception of two populations in southern Arizona, are infected with a strain of Wolbachia. Populations of D. v. zeae are not infected. Treatment of D. v. virgifera with tetracycline eliminated the Wolbachia and removed the reproductive incompatibility. Similar patterns of reproductive incompatibility exist among taxa of the cricket genus Gryllus. Gryllus assimilis, G. integer, G. ovisopis, G. pennsylvanicus, and G. rubens are infected with Wolbachia whereas G. firmus is usually not. Populations of G. rubens and G. ovisopis carry the same Wolbachia strain, which is distinct from that of G. integer. G. pennsylvanicus is infected with two Wolbachia strains, that found in G. rubens and one unique to G. pennsylvanicus. Moreover, a proportion of G. pennsylvanicus individuals harbors both strains. Wolbachia may have influenced speciation in some members of the genus Gryllus by affecting the degree of hybridization between species. Given that Wolbachia infections are relatively common in insects, it is likely that other insect hybrid zones may be influenced by infections with Wolbachia.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abacterial proteins 3aGryllus 3astructural genes 3aribosomal DNA 3ainterspecific hybridization 3ainfection 3aWolbachia 3astrain differences 3aDiabrotica virgifera zeae 3aDiabrotica virgifera virgifera 3acytoplasmic incompatibility 3anucleotide sequences 3apopulation 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aColeopteraxgeneticsxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aBiological Evolution 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aCytoskeletal Proteins 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aFemale 2aGTP-Binding Proteinsxgenetics 2aGeography 2aMale 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOrthopteraxgeneticsxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aPhylogeny 2aReproductionxgenetics 2aRickettsiaxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aZea maysxparasitology 3aAlberta 3aTexas 3aOntario 0aUnited States 0aUnited States 0agenbank/u83096 0agenbank/af011269 0agenbank/u83094 0agenbank/u83100 0astrains 0agenbank/af010271 0agenbank/u83101 0agenbank/u83097 0agenbank/u83106 0agenbank/u83099 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/u83090 0agenbank/u83104 0agenbank/u83108 0aDiabrotica virgifera 0agenbank/u83093 0agenbank/u83102 0agenbank/u83103 0agenbank/u83105 0ahybridization 0agenbank/u83098 0agenbank/u83091 0agenbank/u83107 0agenbank/u83095 0asexual reproduction 0agenbank/u83092 0agenbank/af011270 0aftsz gene 0aincompatibility1 aJackson, J.J.1 aRobertson, H.M.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1997 Oct. 14, v. 94, no. 21 p.11439-11444x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.94.21.114393Available from publisher's Web site  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle04156naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110024003200130040001800162100001800180245016300198300001800361500001500379506007600394520170200470506003702172650002502209650001802234650002202252650002102274650001802295650002602313650001802339650002202357650002502379650002002404650001602424650002202440650002502462650001202487650001502499650003602514650001802550650001702568650001902585650002402604650003902628650002502667650003402692650002902726650003802755650002502793650002802818650002702846650002902873650002302902650003402925653001102959653002102970653002802991653001403019700001403033700001703047700001403064700001603078773014203094852000903236856008203245930003303327945001303360946001303373655001203386IND2180450320221207104804.0981014e19980217dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218045032DNAL7 a94651232pmid7 aPMC192202pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.95.4.19502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEssigmann, B.10aPhosphate availability affects the thylakoid lipid composition and the expression of SQD1, a gene required for sulfolipid biosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana  ap. 1950-1955.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPhotosynthetic membranes of higher plants contain specific nonphosphorous lipids like the sulfolipid sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol in addition to the ubiquitous phospholipid phosphatidylglycerol. In bacteria, an environmental factor that drastically affects thylakoid lipid composition appears to be the availability of phosphate. Accordingly, we discovered an increase in the relative amount of sulfolipid and a concomitant decrease in phosphatidylglycerol in Arabidopsis thaliana grown on medium with reduced amounts of phosphate, as well as in the pho1 mutant of A. thaliana deficient in phosphate transport. To investigate the molecular basis of the observed change in lipid composition, we isolated a cDNA of A. thaliana, designated SQD1, that encodes a protein involved in sulfolipid biosynthesis as suggested by three lines of evidence. First, the cDNA shows high sequence similarity to bacterial sqdB genes known to be essential for sulfolipid biosynthesis; second, the SQD1 gene product is imported into chloroplasts where sulfolipid biosynthesis takes place; and third, transgenic plants expressing SQD1 in antisense orientation show a reduction in sulfolipid content. In the pho1 mutant as well as in wild-type plants grown under reduced phosphate availability, increased amounts of SQD1 mRNA and SQD1 protein are detected, suggesting that the increase in sulfolipid content under phosphate limitation is the result of an increased expression of at least one gene required for sulfolipid biosynthesis in A. thaliana. It is suggested that a certain amount of anionic thylakoid lipid is maintained by substituting sulfolipid for phosphatidylglycerol under reduced phosphate availability.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3amessenger RNA 3acomplementary DNA 3astructural genes 3aantisense DNA 3anutrient availability 3aPisum sativum 3atransgenic plants 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3alipogenesis 3aprotein transport 3anucleotide sequences 3amutants 3aphosphates 3achemical constituents of plants 3aphospholipids 3achloroplasts 3aplant proteins 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsis Proteins 2aBacterial Proteinsxchemistry 2aChloroplastsxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aLipidsxbiosynthesis 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhosphatesxmetabolism 2aPlant Proteinsxgenetics 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 0alipids 0agenbank/af022082 0amolecular sequence data 0asqd1 gene1 aGuler, S.1 aNarang, R.A.1 aLinke, D.1 aBenning, C.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1998 Feb. 17, v. 95, no. 4 p.1950-1955x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.95.4.19503Available from publisher's Web site  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02742naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245011800166300001600284520164700300650001101947650001301958650001301971650001401984650002201998650001002020650001302030650002202043700002402065700001702089700002202106700002502128700002202153773015202175856004402327852000902371655001202380IND60566198120221122211712.0170405e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056619812DNAL7 a10.2460/ajvr.78.4.5082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFinck, Cyrielle A.10aEffects of repeated use and resterilization on structural and functional integrity of microwave ablation antennas  ap. 508-516.  aOBJECTIVE To determine effects of repeated use and resterilization on structural and functional integrity of microwave ablation (MWA) antennas. SAMPLE 17 cooled-shaft MWA antennas (3 groups of 5 antennas/group and 2 control antennas). PROCEDURES 1, 2, and 3 ablations in the livers of bovine cadavers were performed at the maximum recommended settings. Antennas were cleaned and sterilized in hydrogen peroxide plasma, and the process was repeated (reprocessing cycle; n = 6). Control antennas were only sterilized (6 times). Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures were performed, and antennas were microscopically assessed for damage. RESULTS 6 cycles were completed. Thirteen of 15 MWA antennas remained functional for up to 4 cycles, 10 were functional after 5 cycles, and only 7 were functional after 6 cycles. Progressive tearing of the silicone coating of the antennas was observed, with a negative effect of the number of cycles for silicone tearing. Size of the ablation zone decreased mildly over time after cycles 5 and 6; however, this was not considered clinically relevant. No significant changes in the shape of ablation zones were detected. All cultures yielded negative results, except for an isolated case, which was considered a contaminant. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Structural and functional integrity of the microwave antennas remained acceptable during repeated use and reprocessing for up to 4 cycles. However, there was a decrease in functional integrity at cycles 5 and 6. We suggest that these microwave antennas be subjected to > 3 reprocessing cycles. Antennas should be carefully examined before reuse. 3acattle 3acleaning 3acoatings 3aequipment 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aliver 3asilicone 3asurgical ablation1 azur Linden, Alex R.1 aSingh, Ameet1 aFoster, Robert A.1 aNykamp, Stephanie G.1 aSears, William C.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g2017 Apr., v. 78, no. 4 p.508-516dAmerican Veterinary Medical AssociationwJournal:1912x0002-96457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.78.4.508  aDNAL 7aarticle03655naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092024002000124024001800144040001800162100001300180245018100193300001800374500001500392506007600407520182600483506003702309650002102346650002802367650001102395650001302406650001102419650001602430650002002446650002102466650002702487650002202514650002002536650001002556650001502566650002002581650002902601650001702630653001402647653001502661653001502676653001502691653002302706653001402729653001302743700001702756773014202773852000902915856008202924930003303006945001303039946001303052655001203065IND2180459120221207113038.0981014e19980331dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218045912DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.95.7.33802doi7 aPMC198442pmcid7 a95203742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFang, N.10aAnticancer action of cube insecticide: correlation for rotenoid constituents between inhibition of NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase and induced ornithine decarboxylase activities  ap. 3380-3384.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRotenone and rotenoid-containing botanicals, important insecticides and fish poisons, are reported to have anticancer activity in rats and mice. The toxic action of rotenone is attributed to inhibition of NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity and the purported cancer chemopreventive effect of deguelin analogs has been associated with inhibition of phorbol ester-induced ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity. This study defines a possible relationship between these two types of activity important in evaluating the toxicology of rotenoid pesticides and the suitability of the anticancer model. Fractionation of cube resin (the commercial rotenoid pesticide) establishes that the activity in both assays is due primarily to rotenone (IC50 = 0.8-4 nM), secondarily to deguelin, and in small part to rotenolone and tephrosin. In addition, the potency of 29 rotenoids from cube insecticide for inhibiting NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase in vitro assayed with bovine heart electron transport particles satisfactorily predicts their potency in vivo in the induced ODC assay using noncytotoxic rotenoid concentrations with cultured MCF-7 human breast cancer cells (r = 0.86). Clearly the molecular features of rotenoids essential for inhibiting NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase are similar to those for blocking ODC induction. This apparent correlation extends to 11 flavonoids and stilbenoids from cube resin (r = 0.98) and genistein and resveratrol except for lower potency and less selectivity than the rotenoids relative to cytotoxicity. These findings on cube insecticide constituents and our earlier study comparing rotenone and pyridaben miticide indicate that inhibition of NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity lowers the level of induced ODC activity leading to the antiproliferative effect and anticancer action.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abreast neoplasms 3aornithine decarboxylase 3ahumans 3arotenone 3acattle 3astilbenoids 3aDeguelia utilis 3amedicinal plants 3abotanical insecticides 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aoxidoreductases 3aheart 3acell lines 3aenzyme activity 3aelectron transport chain 3aLonchocarpus 0arotenoids 0aflavonoids 0ainhibition 0arotenolone 0alonchocarpus urucu 0atephrosin 0adeguelin1 aCasida, J.E.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1998 Mar. 31, v. 95, no. 7 p.3380-3384x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.95.7.33803Available from publisher's Web site  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02829naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001400149245014200163300001600305500002400321520161900345650002601964650002601990650001302016650002102029650002002050650001002070650002602080650001702106650001202123650002102135650001002156650002002166651001602186700001802202700002202220773009102242852000902333856008902342655001202431IND4466756120221122173357.0130428s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446675612DNAL7 a10.1016/S0261-2194(03)00003-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEster, A.10aField experiments using the rhabditid nematode Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita or salt as control measures against slugs in green asparagus  ap. 689-695.  aIncludes references  aGreen asparagus (Asparagus officinalis L.) crops are frequently damaged by the grey field slug (Deroceras reticulatum). Most damage occurs in the soil, although some asparagus spears are attacked above ground. In the Netherlands damage occurs especially during the first 5 weeks of harvesting, from the end of April until the end of May and results in loss of quality. Field experiments were carried out from 1998 until 2000 at Oudkarspel in the western region of The Netherlands with the objective of controlling slugs with the slug-parasitic nematode (Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita) and common salt (sodium chloride (NaCl)). Nematodes and salt were applied as row applications in asparagus beds. Dosages of 10,000-600,000 nematodes per m2 were used. Salt was applied in doses of 500-4000 kg NaCl per ha. Each of the treatments was applied from 1 to 4 times and was compared with conventional field application of metaldehyde pellets (0.35 kg a.i. per ha) in an equal number of applications and with untreated plots. Significant protection of the crop was achieved with nematodes during the harvest period in 1999 and 2000, when nematodes were applied three times in the row at a dose of 50,000/m2 (2000) or 100,000/m2 (1999 and 2000). Additionally, salt applied at 2000 kg/ha twice (1998) or at a dose of 1000 kg applied four times (1998, 1999 and 2000) provided successful slug control. An application of slug-parasitic nematodes (Nemaslug®) is recommended once at a dose of 300,000/m2 or three times at a dose of 50,000/m2 as a row application for control of slug damage in green asparagus in The Netherlands. 3aAsparagus officinalis 3aDeroceras reticulatum 3aNematoda 3aasparagus spears 3acontrol methods 3acrops 3afield experimentation 3aharvest date 3apellets 3aplant protection 3aslugs 3asodium chloride 3aNetherlands1 aRozen, K. van1 aMolendijk, L.P.G.0 tCrop protection.g2003 June, v. 22, no. 5 p.689-695dElsevier Sciencex0261-21947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0261-2194(03)00003-63Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03027naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002000149245006700169300001600236500002400252520186000276650001002136650000802146650001102154650001602165650001202181650001602193650001602209650001002225650000902235650001402244650000902258650002302267650001002290650001102300650001002311651001402321700002402335700001902359700001502378773009002393852000902483856008902492655001202581IND4466756020221122173311.0130428s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446675602DNAL7 a10.1016/S0261-2194(03)00006-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, Peter R.10aIncreasing sowing depth to reduce mouse damage to winter crops  ap. 653-660.  aIncludes references  aPlagues of house mice (Mus domesticus) can cause severe economic damage to grain crops in southern Australia when their populations peak at sowing of winter-growing crops in autumn. Mice damage crops by locating and digging out newly sown seeds. If damage is high, farmers have to re-sow their crop. A trial was conducted to examine the effect of increasing sowing depth of winter cereal (short and long coleoptile wheat), lupin and field peas and whether the addition of a repellent reduced the amount of seed damaged by mice. Crops were sown at 30, 50 and 70 mm and the germination rate and number of mouse diggings was compared in an open field and a mouse-proof exclosure (fenced site). Omethoate was tested as a repellent for crops sown at 30 mm depth. The population density of mice was 60 mice/ha at sowing and increased to 300 mice/ha 4 weeks after sowing, then declined to <5 mice/ha 4 months after sowing. There was a significant difference in the emergence rate of the crops, but no difference in the emergence rate of plants sown at different depths or with the repellent. The effective loss at emergence on the open field compared to the fenced site was 10-18% for wheat, -1% for lupins and 7% for field peas. There were more mouse diggings along drill lines evident in wheat and field pea crops sown at shallow depths. Omethoate was not an effective repellent. The yields of lupins and field peas were higher on deeper sown seed because of moisture availability. The wheat crops were not harvested because of army worm (Aspodoptera mauritia) damage, and hares (Lepus capensus) caused some damage to lupins. We recommend that if high mouse numbers are forecast at sowing of winter crops in southern Australia, wheat and field pea crops that are tolerant of deeper sowing should be sown at greater depth to reduce the chance of damage by mice. 3aLepus 3aMus 3aautumn 3acrop damage 3afarmers 3agermination 3agrain crops 3ahares 3amice 3aomethoate 3apeas 3apopulation density 3aseeds 3asowing 3awheat 3aAustralia1 aSingleton, Grant R.1 aTann, Colin R.1 aMock, Ivan0 tCrop protection.g2003 May, v. 22, no. 4 p.653-660dElsevier Sciencex0261-21947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0261-2194(03)00006-13Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02977naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245007800127300001800205520180400223650001202027650001102039650002002050650001702070650002202087650001502109650001902124650001502143650001002158650002102168650001102189650001402200650002502214650001702239650001602256650001002272650002302282653001202305653001902317700001702336700001502353773007102368852000902439930003302448945001302481946001302494655001202507IND2230375720221122134323.0010220e200012  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND223037572DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHodges, D.M.10aProcessing line effects on storage attributes of fresh-cut spinach leaves  ap. 1308-1311.  aThe degree of damage that may occur through harvesting and packing represents one of the major factors that can affect quality of fresh-cut produce. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of different steps in a representative fresh-cut processing line on storage quality of spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.). To this end, spinach leaves were removed at successive points on the line: 1) before entry into the line (control); 2) after a shaking procedure but before initial rinsing with 10 degrees C water + 5 mg(.)L-1 chlorine dioxide; 3) after centrifugal drying; and 4) after commercial packaging. After removal from the different points in the line, the spinach samples were stored at 10 degrees C for 16 days, during which time malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration (lipid peroxidation assay), electrolyte leakage (membrane leakiness), chlorophyll content (a, b, and total), and color attributes (L, saturation, hue angle) were measured. Both lipid peroxidation and electrolyte leakage increased with time of storage and with stage of processing. Electrolyte leakage increased most in material removed after the shaking procedure, but prior to hydrocooling. Overall total chlorophyll loss during storage did not change with time of removal from the processing line, although overall chlorophyll b content decreased in stored material 8 days following centrifugal drying and packaging. A more rapid loss in chlorophyll a relative to chlorophyll b over the first 8 days of storage was reflected in hue angle measurements regardless of the point of removal. The processing line under study, thus had both beneficial and detrimental effects on storage quality of spinach. Detrimental effects associated with centrifugal drying and packaging procedures could be modified to improve quality. 3aspinach 3aleaves 3afood processing 3afood storage 3amechanical damage 3aharvesting 3afood packaging 3ashelf life 3awater 3achlorine dioxide 3adrying 3aaldehydes 3achemical composition 3aelectrolytes 3achlorophyll 3acolor 3alipid peroxidation 0aleakage 0afresh products1 aForney, C.F.1 aWismer, W.0 tHortScience.g2000 Dec., v. 35, no. 7 p.1308-1311x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL  a20010402b20010411c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle01382naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002700112245008400139300001400223520053300237650001200770650001100782650001200793650001300805650001200818650001900830650001500849700001700864700001600881700002300897773010400920856003501024852000901059655001201068IND60566199020221122104523.0170405s1994    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056619902DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMichael S.

Honey on sweet cherry (Prunus avium L.). Thymol and carvacrol were the two most potent fungicides among the monoterpenoids tested. The brown rot incidences of M. fructicola-inoculated cherry dipped in 1000 microgram(.)mL-1 thymol and carvacrol were 24% and 23%, respectively, compared with 81% for the control. The effects of thymol and carvacrol were not significantly enhanced by the addition of CaCl2 or CaB'y, a foliar calcium fertilizer. Decco 282 significantly reduced the activity of thymol. Methyl jasmonate, an elicitor of plant defense mechanisms, did not reduce brown rot by itself, and did not increase the efficacy of thymol and carvacrol when used as an additive in dipping or fumigation experiments. Thymol and carvacrol caused stem browning of cherry fruits in the fumigation experiment, however, 69% and 73%, respectively, of the browning was prevented when methyl jasmonate was used as a co-fumigant. 3acherries 3aMonilinia fructicola 3amonoterpenoids 3ajasmonic acid 3athymol 3adefense mechanisms 3astems 3afumigation 3ainorganic ions 3acalcium 3acarvacrol 3apostharvest diseases 0afungus control1 aZhou, T.0 tHortScience.g2000 Dec., v. 35, no. 7 p.1304-1307x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL  a20010402b20010411c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03712naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110024003200130040001800162100001400180245015200194300001800346500001500364506007600379520133100455506003701786650002701823650002301850650002301873650002801896650001701924650002201941650003001963650002701993650001402020650002002034650002702054650002102081650002002102650001102122650002702133650002002160650002102180650003702201650004802238650002102286650004002307650002102347650002302368650001902391650003102410650003502441650002902476650004702505650002402552650002802576653001602604653003002620700001602650700001502666700001702681773014202698852000902840856008202849930003302931945001302964946001302977655001202990IND2180698320221207105951.0981028e19980317dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218069832DNAL7 a95011642pmid7 aPMC196432pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.95.6.27672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, X.10aAgrobacterium-transformed rice plants expressing synthetic cryIA(b) and cryIA(c) genes are highly toxic to striped stem borer and yellow stem borer  ap. 2767-2772.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOver 2,600 transgenic rice plants in nine strains were regenerated from > 500 independently selected hygromycin-resistant calli after Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The plants were transformed with fully modified (plant codon optimized) versions of two synthetic cryIA(b) and cryIA(c) coding sequences from Bacillus thuringiensis as well as the hph and gus genes, coding for hygromycin phosphotransferase and beta-glucuronidase, respectively. These sequences were placed under control of the maize ubiquitin promoter, the CaMV35S promoter, and the Brassica Bp10 gene promoter to achieve high and tissue-specific expression of the lepidopteran-specific gamma-endotoxins. The integration, expression, and inheritance of these genes were demonstrated in R0 and R1 generations by Southern, Northern, and Western analyses and by other techniques. Accumulation of high levels (up to 3% of soluble proteins) of CryIA(b) and CryIA(c) proteins was detected in R0 plants. Bioassays with R1 transgenic plants indicated that the transgenic plants were highly toxic to two major rice insect pests, striped stem borer (Chilo suppressalis) and yellow stem borer (Scirpophaga incertulas), with mortalities of 97-100% within 5 days after infestation, thus offering a potential for effective insect resistance in transgenic rice plants.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3agenetic transformation 3agenetic resistance 3aChilo suppressalis 3ainsecticidal properties 3aOryza sativa 3atransgenic plants 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3aScirpophaga incertulas 3abioassays 3agene expression 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3acrystal proteins 3asynthetic genes 3alarvae 3ainheritance (genetics) 3apest resistance 3abacterial toxins 2aBacillus thuringiensisxgenetics 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxpharmacology. 2aBacterial Toxins 2aEndotoxinsxgeneticsxpharmacology. 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aHemolysin Proteins 2aInsect Control 2aInsecticidesxpharmacology 2aOryzaxgeneticsxparasitology. 2aPest Control, Biological 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxparasitology 2aRhizobiumxgenetics 2aTransformation, Genetic 0asegregation 0aAgrobacterium tumefaciens1 aSardana, R.1 aKaplan, H.1 aAltosaar, I.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1998 Mar. 17, v. 95, no. 6 p.2767-2772x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.95.6.27673Available from publisher's Web site  a19990101b19990111c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02338naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245006500177300001300242520127000255650002301525650003001548650001501578650002001593650001501613650000901628650001901637650001901656650002101675650001901696650001401715650003301729650001301762700002401775773010301799856005301902852000901955655001201964IND60566198620221122104528.0170405s1994    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056619862DNAL7 a10.1080/1065657X.1994.107711342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoitink, Harry A. J.10aStatus of Biological Control of Plant Diseases with Composts  ap. 6-12.  aComposts have the potential to provide biological control of plant diseases. Foliar as well as root pathogens may be affected. Many factors control these effects. Heat exposure during composting kills or inactivates pathogens if the process is monitored properly. Unfortunately, most biocontrol agents also are killed by this heat treatment. Thus, biocontrol agents must recolonize composts after peak heating. The raw feedstock, the environment in which the compost is produced, as well as conditions during curing and utilization determine the potential for recolonization by this microflora and disease suppression. Controlled inoculation of compost with biocontrol agents has proved necessary to induce consistent levels of suppression on a commercial scale. The decomposition level (stability) of composts also affects suppressiveness. Immature composts serve as food for pathogens and increase disease even when biocontrol agents are present. On the other hand, excessively stabilized organic matter does not support the activity of biocontrol agents. Composts also may induce detrimental effects. For example, chemical factors may negate suppressiveness. Salinity and the concentration of nitrogen in composts are principal chemical factors to be considered. 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3acomposting 3adisease control 3afeedstocks 3aheat 3aheat treatment 3amicroorganisms 3anitrogen content 3aorganic matter 3apathogens 3aplant diseases and disorders 3asalinity1 aGrebus, Marcella E.0 tCompost science & utilization.g1994, v. 2, no. 2 p.6-12dJG PresswJournal:19700x2326-23977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1065657X.1994.10771134  aDNAL 7aarticle04021naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110024003200130040001800162100001800180245007100198300001800269500001500287506007600302520157100378506003701949650002101986650001702007650001602024650001702040650001402057650002502071650002102096650001902117650001802136650002502154650001802179650002402197650003902221650001102260650002802271650004102299650005802340650002302398650004402421650004002465653001902505653001802524653001902542653001402561653002802575653001902603653002702622653001902649653001902668653001902687653001902706653002802725653001902753653001202772653001902784700001802803700001702821700001602838700001402854700001902868700001702887700001902904773014202923852000903065856008203074930003303156945001303189946001303202655001203215IND2180463620221207083405.0981014e19980331dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218046362DNAL7 a95204452pmid7 aPMC199152pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.95.7.37862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoparev, V.N.12aA third distinct tumor necrosis factor receptor of orthopoxviruses  ap. 3786-3791.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCowpox virus Brighton red strain (CPV) contains a gene, crmD, which encodes a 320-aa tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) of 44% and 22% identity, respectively, to the CPV TNFR-like proteins, cytokine response modifiers (crm) CrmB and CrmC. The crmD gene was interrupted in three other cowpox strains examined and absent in various other orthopoxviruses; however, four strains of ectromelia virus (ECT) examined contained an intact crmD (97% identity to CPV crmD) and lacked cognates of crmB and crmC. The protein, CrmD, contains a transport signal; a 151-aa cysteine-rich region with 21 cysteines that align with human TNFRII ligand-binding region cysteines; and C-terminal region sequences that are highly diverged from cellular TNFR C-terminal region sequences involved in signal transduction. Bacterial maltose-binding proteins containing the CPV or ECT CrmD cysteine-rich region bound TNF and lymphotoxin-alpha (LT alpha) and blocked their in vitro cytolytic activity. Secreted viral CrmD bound TNF and LT alpha and was detectable after the early stage of replication, using nonreducing conditions, as 60- to 70-kDa predominant and 90- to 250-kDa minor disulfide-linked complexes that were able to be reduced to a 46-kDa form and deglycosylated to a 38-kDa protein. Cells infected with CPV produced extremely low amounts of CrmD compared with ECT. Possessing up to three TNFRs, including CrmD, which is secreted as disulfide-linked complexes in varied amounts by CPV and ECT, likely enhances the dynamics of the immune modulating mechanisms of orthopoxviruses.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3astructural genes 3acytotoxicity 3alymphotoxin 3aCowpox virus 3areceptors 3aamino acid sequences 3aEctromelia virus 3aviral proteins 3abinding sites 3anucleotide sequences 3aglycoproteins 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aGlycoproteinsxanalysisxgenetics. 2aHumans 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOrthopoxvirusxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReceptors, Tumor Necrosis Factorxanalysisxgenetics. 2aSequence Alignment 2aTumor Necrosis Factor-alphaxmetabolism 2aViral Proteinsxanalysisxgenetics. 0agenbank/u93910 0aOrthopoxvirus 0agenbank/u87583 0acytokines 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/u87581 0atumor necrosis factors 0agenbank/u87234 0agenbank/u87579 0agenbank/u87582 0agenbank/u87580 0aviral immunosuppression 0agenbank/u87235 0abinding 0agenbank/u875781 aParsons, J.M.1 aKnight, J.C.1 aPanus, J.F.1 aRay, C.A.1 aBuller, R.M.L.1 aPickup, D.J.1 aEsposito, J.J.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1998 Mar. 31, v. 95, no. 7 p.3786-3791x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.95.7.37863Available from publisher's Web site  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03951naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100003300164245010900197300001800306500002400324520198100348650000902329650001402338650001202352650003102364650001002395650002502405650001302430650001902443650001802462650003002480650002502510650002502535650002002560650002802580650001102608650002102619650001202640650002102652650003502673650001802708650001302726650002802739650000902767650001402776650002602790650002802816650002202844650003402866650003602900651001102936651000902947700001302956700001902969700001602988700001603004700001603020700002103036700001203057700001703069773011003086852000903196856004803205655001203253IND4442581420221122040448.0100917e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444258142DNAL7 a205678012pmid7 a10.1007/s00122-010-1380-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Alencar Figueiredo, L.

The objective of this targeted association study was to assess whether the polymorphism detected in six genes involved in synthesis pathways of starch (Sh2, Bt2, SssI, Ae1, and Wx) or grain storage proteins (O2) could explain the phenotypic variability of six grain quality traits [amylose content (AM), protein content (PR), lipid content (LI), hardness (HD), endosperm texture (ET), peak gelatinization temperature (PGT)], two yield component traits [thousand grain weight (TGW) and number of grains per panicle (NBG)], and yield itself (YLD). We used a core collection of 195 accessions which had been previously phenotyped and for which polymorphic sites had been identified in sequenced segments of the six genes. The associations between gene polymorphism and phenotypic traits were analyzed with Tassel. The percentages of admixture of each accession, estimated using 60 RFLP probes, were used as cofactors in the analyses, decreasing the proportion of false-positive tests (70%) due to population structure. The significant associations observed matched generally well the role of the enzymes encoded by the genes known to determine starch amount or type. Sh2, Bt2, Ae1, and Wx were associated with TGW. SssI and Ae1 were associated with PGT, a trait influenced by amylopectin amount. Sh2 was associated with AM while Wx was not, possibly because of the absence of waxy accessions in our collection. O2 and Wx were associated with HD and ET. No association was found between O2 and PR. These results were consistent with QTL or association data in sorghum and in orthologous zones of maize. This study represents the first targeted association mapping study for grain quality in sorghum and paves the way for marker-aided selection. 3acorn 3aendosperm 3aenzymes 3agelatinization temperature 3agenes 3agenetic polymorphism 3ahardness 3ainflorescences 3alipid content 3amarker-assisted selection 3aphenotypic variation 3apopulation structure 3aprotein content 3aquantitative trait loci 3astarch 3astorage proteins 3atexture 3ayield components 2aAmylosexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBase Sequence 2aBreeding 2aEdible Grainxgenetics. 2aFood 2aPhenotype 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aQuantitative Trait Loci 2aSorghumxgenetics 2aStarchxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aZea maysxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aAfrica 0aAsia1 aSine, B.1 aChantereau, J.1 aMestres, C.1 aFliedel, G.1 aRami, J.-F.1 aGlaszmann, J.

ASM protected cantaloupe against a fungal pathogen, Colletotrichum lagenarium, and a viral pathogen, cucumber mosaic virus (CMV). ASM induced the systemic accumulation of chitinase, a marker protein for SAR, in both greenhouse and field grown seedlings. ASM at 50 or 100 μg/ml provided almost complete protection against the fungal pathogen and effectively delayed the spread of CMV in greenhouse trials. In two field trials, ASM had no negative effect on fruit production in the absence of CMV disease pressure. 3aColletotrichum orbiculare 3aCucumber mosaic virus 3acantaloupes 3achitinase 3afield experimentation 3afruit growing 3afungi 3agreenhouses 3apathogens 3aplant protection 3asalicylic acid 3aseedlings 3asystemic acquired resistance1 aKeen, N.T.1 aBecker, Jo.0 tCrop protection.g2003 June, v. 22, no. 5 p.769-774dElsevier Sciencex0261-21947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0261-2194(03)00044-93Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02852naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245010500126300001600231520176600247650001902013650001202032650001102044650001402055650001302069650001102082650000902093650002802102650002202130650002102152651001302173653000902186653001102195653001102206653001302217700001802230700001702248700001602265773006902281852000902350930003302359945001302392946001302405655001202418IND2330870720221122003247.0030219e200207  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233087072DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMyers, S.C.10aPartial flower thinning increases shoot growth, fruit size, and subsequent flower formation of peach  ap. 647-650.  aPartial thinning of peach (Prunus persica L. Batsch) during bloom to 50% of the necessary level by hand, and followed by adjustment hand thinning at 42 days after full bloom (DAFB) was compared to a similar degree of thinning accomplished entirely at 42 DAFB by hand. Partial flower thinning altered the distribution of fruit by diameter, increasing the percentage of large diameter (greater than or equal to 62.0 mm) fruit harvested compared to unthinned trees or trees thinned entirely at 42 DAFB. Although shoot number per limb was not altered by thinning time, the distribution of shoots by length was affected, increasing the percentage of long shoots (greater than or equal to 20.0 cm). Compared to unthinned trees and trees thinned at 42 DAFB, partial flower thinning increased the subsequent development of flower buds per shoot and the number of flower buds per node. Number of flower buds on the proximal five nodes of shoots 15.0-30.0 cm in length was increased, although not on shoots 5.0-7.0 cm in length. Additional trials established that airblast spray application of AMADS was effective in achieving a similar level of thinning as that accomplished by partial flower thinning by hand in previous experiments. The degree of flower removal exhibited a linear response to chemical concentration. Fruit diameter on chemically flower-thinned trees was greater at adjustment thinning time, when compared to trees thinned by hand at 42 DAFB only. Distribution of fruit at harvest indicated a larger percentage of fruit >65.0 mm in trees which received partial flower thinning in comparison to trees thinned at 42 DAFB only. As a result, overall crop value was increased, based on the commercial processing peach price structure at the time of harvest. 3aPrunus persica 3aflowers 3ashoots 3aflowering 3adiameter 3alength 3abuds 3aplant growth substances 3aeconomic analysis 3aapplication rate 3aVirginia 0asize 0afruits 0agrowth 0athinning1 aSavelle, A.T.1 aTustin, D.S.1 aByers, R.E.0 tHortScience.g2002 July, v. 37, no. 4 p.647-650x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02332naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245010300124300001600227520131800243650002201561650001401583650002001597650001801617650001301635650001201648650002001660650002201680650001901702650001801721650002601739650002101765651001101786700001201797773006901809852000901878930003301887945001301920946001301933655001201946IND2330870920221122003337.0030219e200207  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233087092DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHue, N.V.10aManganese toxicity in watermelon as affected by lime and compost amended to a Hawaiian acid Oxisol  ap. 656-661.  aManganese (Mn) toxicity in crops is a serious problem in Hawaii, especially Kauai and Oahu, where most soils are highly weathered.

Factorial combinations of lime (0, 2.0, and 4.0 g(.)kg-1 CaCO3) and two composts (made from chicken manure and from sewage sludge at 0, 5, and 10 g.kg(-1)) were applied to the soil, which was subsequently planted to watermelon (Citrullus lanatus Thunb. 'Crimson Sweet'). Our preliminary results showed that: 1) liming reduced Mn extractability and phytoavailability, but the reduction in Mn per unit increase in pH was much less than predicted by theory; 2) for good watermelon growth, soluble Mn, as extracted by the saturated paste method, should be <2.0 mg(.)L-1 corresponding to a soil pH >5.7; 3) unlike the saturated-paste extractable Mn, the Mehlich3-extractable Mn varied less with pH in a given soil series than between soil series; 4) effects of composts on Mn toxicity varied with compost properties, especially their Ca content and pH altering capacity; and 5) the diagnostic criteria for Mn toxicity in watermelon are tentatively proposed as: leaf Mn >1000 mg(.)kg-1 and leaf Ca/Mn ratio (g(.)g-1) <25. 3aCitrullus lanatus 3amanganese 3anutrient excess 3aphytotoxicity 3acomposts 3aOxisols 3acrop management 3acalcium carbonate 3apoultry manure 3asewage sludge 3anutrient availability 3aapplication rate 3aHawaii1 aMai, Y.0 tHortScience.g2002 July, v. 37, no. 4 p.656-661x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03232naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002200149245019000171300001600361500002400377520201300401650002502414650001502439650002302454650002602477650001802503650001102521650003102532650001102563650001302574650001402587650001302601700003002614700002502644773009102669852000902760856008902769655001202858IND4466758620221122003349.0130429s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446675862DNAL7 a10.1016/S0261-2194(02)00205-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTorres-Vila, L.M.10aImpact of Helicoverpa armigera larval density and crop phenology on yield and quality losses in processing tomato: developing fruit count-based damage thresholds for IPM decision-making  ap. 521-532.  aIncludes references  aA 2-year study was carried out in Extremadura (southwestern Spain) to assess the impact of Helicoverpa armigera Hb. on processing tomato at several larval densities and crop phenological stages. Artificial infestations with neonate larvae (0-16 larvae per plant) were conducted at each of eight crop growth stages (from fruit setting to 60% red fruit stage) in large-cage field trials following a randomised-complete-block design. The % damaged fruits during crop growth (seasonal damage), % damaged fruits at harvest and tomato yield loss were evaluated. All three variables increased significantly as the number of larvae per plant increased. However, the occurrence of larval density by crop phenology interaction indicated that variation in the levels of fruit damage and yield loss were a function of the date of infestation relative to plant phenology. Mature tomato plants were more tolerant than young plants so that the % damaged fruits and yield loss decreased at advanced growth stages for a given larval density. Seasonal damage was consistently higher than damage at harvest: the former strongly overestimated the later. Significant positive correlations between % seasonal damage and % damage at harvest were obtained for all phenological stages, while negative correlations between % seasonal damage and tomato yield occurred from fruit setting to 20% red fruit stage. Results suggest that seasonal damage may be a reliable predictor in integrated pest management (IPM) decision-making to infer both fruit quality and yield loss at harvest. A 3% seasonal damage is the preliminarily proposed economic threshold irrespective of crop phenological stage. By using such a threshold, a 2% damage level at harvest, the commercial quality standard, will not be reached in most cropping situations, yield losses ranging from 3% to 7%. Information provided in this study may be also used in the development of alternative action levels in IPM programmes for H. armigera in processing tomatoes in Spain. 3aHelicoverpa armigera 3acrop yield 3aeconomic threshold 3afield experimentation 3afruit quality 3afruits 3aintegrated pest management 3alarvae 3aneonates 3aphenology 3atomatoes1 aRodrı́guez-Molina, M.C.1 aLacasa Plasencia, A.0 tCrop protection.g2003 Apr., v. 22, no. 3 p.521-532dElsevier Sciencex0261-21947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0261-2194(02)00205-33Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02245naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002800145245009300173300001600266500002400282500001500306520116600321650001701487650000901504650001101513650001801524650001501542650001201557650001901569650001501588650001301603650001201616650001701628650002201645651001101667653001501678773009701693852000901790856004801799655001201847IND4401802220221122003306.0080223e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440180222DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-007-9337-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKeskitalo, E.

The prospect is of particular concern at the local and regional levels, since vulnerability and adaptive capacity are location-specific and many decisions regarding climate-induced risks are made at those levels. In this light, one is compelled to survey stakeholders' understandings of their situation and perceived problems. Assessments should also include the context of other ongoing changes, such as globalisation, that will impact communities and exacerbate their vulnerabilities. This paper presents an assessment of vulnerability and adaptive capacity in the forestry sector in the Pite River basin in northern Sweden. The study was carried out using a multi-method design encompassing literature surveys, interviews with stakeholders, and stakeholder meetings. The paper concludes that while climate change will have an impact on the region, its effect will be superseded by that of broader socio-economic changes. The results illustrate the need to understand local and regional perceptions of adaptation in formulating appropriate policy measures. 3astakeholders 3arisk 3ahumans 3aglobalization 3ainterviews 3asurveys 3aclimate change 3awatersheds 3aforestry 3asociety 3acase studies 3aissues and policy 3aSweden 0aadaptation0 tClimatic change.g2008 Mar., v. 87, no. 1-2 p.219-234dSpringer Netherlandsx0165-00097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-007-9337-1 7aarticle02833naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245011100127300001600238500001500254520179500269650001102064650001702075650001802092650001202110650001402122650001502136650001902151650001202170650001302182650001102195651001302206653002202219653001902241653001302260653001302273773006902286852000902355930003302364945001302397946001302410655001202423IND2330870620221122003334.0030219e200207  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233087062DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarini, R.P.10aHeading fruiting shoots before bloom is equally effective as blossom removal in peach crop load management  ap. 642-646.  a2019-12-05  aThree experiments were performed to determine if pruning treatments could reduce the need for peach [Prunus persica (L.) Batsch] fruit thinning without reducing average fruit weight. To determine if dormant shoot heading affected fruit size simply by reducing the number of flowers per tree, all 1-year-old shoots on 'Cresthaven' trees were headed by 50% or blossoms were removed from the terminal half of each shoot. At 45 days after full bloom, all trees were hand-thinned to obtain predetermined crop densities. Average fruit weight was highest on trees with blossom removal, but crop value and net profit were highest for nontreated trees. To determine the influence of treatment severity on fruit weight, all shoots on 'Cresthaven' trees were blossom-thinned or headed to remove blossoms on varying proportions of each shoot. Fruit set and the number of fruit removed during postbloom thinning decreased as the percentage of a shoot that was headed or blossom-thinned increased. Average fruit weight at harvest and crop value were higher for trees with blossom removal than for trees with headed shoots. Fruit weight and crop value were not affected by the percentage of the shoot treated. In the final experiment, all shoots on 'Cresthaven' trees were headed by 50% or were not headed. Heading of shoots reduced fruit set, number of fruits removed at thinning, and thinning time per tree, but yield, crop density, and average fruit weight were not affected by heading. Profit was increased by shoot heading one of the 3 years. Results from this study indicate that heading peach shoots by 50% while dormant pruning can reduce thinning costs without reducing fruit size, but a similar level of labor-intensive blossom removal may reduce postbloom thinning costs and improve fruit size. 3aweight 3acrop quality 3aprofitability 3aflowers 3afruit set 3acrop yield 3aPrunus persica 3apruning 3adormancy 3ashoots 3aVirginia 0aeconomic analysis 0aflowering date 0athinning 0afruiting0 tHortScience.g2002 July, v. 37, no. 4 p.642-646x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02050naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245006900126300001600195520105500211650002301266650002101289650002701310650002501337650002001362650002301382650001701405650001001422650001401432650001401446650001801460653001101478653002001489700001801509773006901527852000901596930003301605945001301638946001301651655001201664IND2330871320221121232733.0030219e200207  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233087132DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCloyd, R.A.10aPhytotoxicity of selected insecticides on greenhouse-grown herbs  ap. 671-672.  aA greenhouse study was conducted from Oct. 1999 through Feb. 2000, and Mar. 2001 through Apr. 2001, to determine the potential phytotoxic effects of selected insecticides on Spanish lavender (Lavandula stoechas L.), oregano (Origanum vulgare L.

Insecticides used for the study were Beauveria bassiana Strain GHA, pyrethrin [+ piperonyl butoxide (PBO)], azadirachtin, potassium salts of fatty acids, two rates of cinnamaldehyde, paraffinic oil, and capsaicin. Visual observations of phytotoxicity were made 7 days after the final application. Pyrethrin, potassium salts of fatty acids, and both rates of cinnamaldehyde were consistently more phytotoxic than the other insecticides. Despite the phytotoxic effects from some of the insecticides, new growth that emerged following treatments compensated for the initial damage, and the herbs were still saleable. 3aLavandula stoechas 3aOriganum vulgare 3aRosmarinus officinalis 3aHypericum perforatum 3aThymus vulgaris 3aBeauveria bassiana 3aazadirachtin 3asalts 3acapsaicin 3aaldehydes 3aphytotoxicity 0agrowth 0aliquid paraffin1 aCycholl, N.L.0 tHortScience.g2002 July, v. 37, no. 4 p.671-672x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02517naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245011100128300001600239500001500255520148600270650002301756650002101779650002301800650001401823650001501837650001301852651001201865653000901877653001101886653001701897653002801914653004101942653001101983773006901994852000902063930003302072945001302105946001302118655001202131IND2330871120221121232834.0030219e200207  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233087112DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeSmith, D.S.10aResponse of rabbiteye blueberry (Vaccinium ashei Reade) to the growth regulators CPPU and gibberellic acid  ap. 666-668.  a2019-12-05  aExperiments were conducted during 1999 and 2000 at Griffin, Ga., with rabbiteye blueberries (Vaccinium ashei Reade) to determine how the growth regulator CPPU affected fruit set, berry size, and yield. CPPU (applied at two different timings) was used alone, and in conjunction with GA3 on mature, field-grown 'Tifblue' plants. A control treatment without either growth regulator was also included. The CPPU concentration used was 10 mg(.)L-1 (a single application per treatment), and the GA3 concentration used was 200 mg(.)L-1 (two applications per treatment). Results from both years showed a positive benefit of CPPU with respect to fruit set and berry size, especially in the absence of GA3. Depending on timing, berry number per plant was increased by more than 200% in 1999 using CPPU. Berry size increases of more than 30% occurred in 2000 when CPPU alone was applied at 17 d after flowering (DAF). CPPU did not increase berry size of GA3-treated plants in either year. Total yield per plant during 2000 was 5.0, 7.1, and 8.3 kg for control, CPPU applied 7 DAF, and CPPU applied 17 DAF treatments, respectively, without GA3. While CPPU did substantially increase fruit set, berry size, and yield of 'Tifblue', there was a notable delay in fruit ripening. These results suggest that CPPU may be useful for increasing yield of rabbiteye blueberries under conditions of inadequate fruit set (such as occurs in much of the Southeast), but a delay in ripening will likely result. 3aapplication timing 3agibberellic acid 3aVaccinium virgatum 3afruit set 3acrop yield 3amixtures 3aGeorgia 0asize 0afruits 0ainteractions 0aplant growth substances 0an-(2-chloro-4-pyridyl)-n'-phenylurea 0agrowth0 tHortScience.g2002 July, v. 37, no. 4 p.666-668x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02409naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001300149245011600162300001600278500002400294520139200318650001001710650000901720650002101729650001901750650001901769650001301788650001301801650000901814700001401823700001501837700001801852773009101870852000901961856008901970655001202059IND4466759420221121224510.0130429s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446675942DNAL7 a10.1016/S0261-2194(03)00045-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOoms, D.10aImpact of the horizontal movements of a sprayer boom on the longitudinal spray distribution in field conditions  ap. 813-820.  aIncludes references  aThe influence of horizontal sprayer boom movements on the longitudinal distribution of the sprayed product was investigated in field and laboratory conditions. The boom movements of a sprayer were measured in the field using a specially designed measurement chain, and the resulting ground distribution was estimated by spraying a dye (Nigrosine) on large sheets of wallpaper and using image analysis to compute the spray coverage. The horizontal movements, identical to those measured in the field, were applied to a laboratory boom part moving on horizontal rails, in the absence of wind. For the three tested situations, the longitudinal coefficients of variation (CV) of the spray coverage were very close in the field (8.81%, 6.9%, 10.9%) and in the laboratory (9.17%, 8.17%, 10.96%). This indicates that horizontal movements were the main source of spray deposit variations, even if other factors such as vertical movements or wind may have an influence. The mean ratio RCV between the CV of the horizontal movements and the spray coverage was estimated. In addition, the amplitude of the boom movements was investigated in a large range of situations (five different sprayers, three different crops). On basis of the measured movements and the computed RCV, the variability of the longitudinal spray distribution due to horizontal movements was estimated at between 3.5% and 5.2%. 3acrops 3adyes 3ahome furnishings 3aimage analysis 3aspray coverage 3asprayers 3aspraying 3awind1 aRuter, R.1 aLebeau, F.1 aDestain, M.F.0 tCrop protection.g2003 July, v. 22, no. 6 p.813-820dElsevier Sciencex0261-21947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0261-2194(03)00045-03Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02209naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245010000126300001600226500001500242520113600257650002801393650002601421650001001447650001301457650001801470650002301488650001101511650002201522650001001544653002401554700001701578700001801595700001601613700001801629700001501647773006901662852000901731930003301740945001301773946001301786655001201799IND2330871420221121224428.0030219e200207  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233087142DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJenks, M.A.10aSeasonal variation in cuticular waxes on hosta genotypes differing in leaf surface glaucousness  ap. 673-677.  a2019-12-05  aCuticular waxes were analyzed on abaxial and adaxial leaf surfaces of three Hosta genotypes differing in leaf surface glaucousness; the glossy-leaved Hosta plantaginea, the glossy-leaved Hosta lancifolia, and the glaucous-leaved Hosta 'Krossa Regal'. All three hosta had their highest total leaf wax quantity in the spring soon after full leaf expansion. The major wax constituent class on these hosta was primary alcohols, comprising up to 84.6% of the total wax. Many hosta leaves had unusually high C24 length primary alcohols, especially in the spring. However, the dominant chain length in this alcohol class varied with development and genotype. A unique class of beta-diketones were present on the glaucous 'Krossa Regal', comprising as much as 28.7% of the total waxes on abaxial leaf surfaces in the summer. Interestingly, these beta-diketones were only 0.9% of total waxes on adaxial leaf surfaces of 'Krossa Regal' in the summer. Studies are under way to determine whether the dramatic seasonal changes in the waxy leaf coatings described in this report are associated with biotic and abiotic stress resistance in hosta. 3ainterspecific variation 3aquantitative analysis 3aHosta 3aalcohols 3aplant cuticle 3aseasonal variation 3alength 3agenetic variation 3awaxes 0aspecies differences1 aGaston, C.H.1 aGoodwin, M.S.1 aKeith, J.A.1 aTeusink, R.S.1 aWood, K.V.0 tHortScience.g2002 July, v. 37, no. 4 p.673-677x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02021naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245006100126300001600187500001500203520111100218650001201329650001201341650001201353650001201365650001401377650001801391650004201409653001501451653001601466653002501482700001501507773006901522852000901591930003301600945001301633946001301646655001201659IND2328366320221121224359.0020805e200206  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232836632DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, K.L.10aBA and sucrose increase vase life of cut Eustoma flowers  ap. 547-549.  a2019-12-05  aAn experiment was conducted to measure the effects of pulse treatments of BA, sucrose, and BA before, after, or with sucrose, on the vase life of cut Eustoma flowers. A BA pulse at 50 mg(.)L-1 before 4% sucrose promoted the longevity of cut Eustoma flowers better than other treatments. Simultaneously, sucrose, glucose, and mannose concentrations in flowers during vase periods were maintained at higher levels in double pulse treatments than in the single pulses. Ethylene production in flowers 2 days after vase treatment was highest in the BA-treated flowers; intermediate in flowers pulsed with BA before, after, or with sucrose; and lowest in sucrose-treated flowers. Although a BA pulse increased ethylene production over that of controls, it inhibited senescence in cut Eustoma flowers. Respiration in flowers pulse-treated with sucrose or with BA before, after, or with sucrose, was significantly higher than that in controls. Results suggest that the vase life of cut Eustoma flowers is improved by either BA or sucrose in vase solution and especially when BA was pulsed before the sucrose pulse. 3aglucose 3asucrose 3amannose 3aflowers 3avase life 3abenzyladenine 3aEustoma exaltatum subsp. russellianum 0asenescence 0arespiration 0aEustoma russellianum1 aChen, W.S.0 tHortScience.g2002 June, v. 37, no. 3 p.547-549x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL  a20021002b20021010c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03603naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245014300146300001600289500002400305520181500329650001002144650001902154650001202173650001802185650001602203650001102219650001802230650002702248650001702275650000902292650001402301650003202315650001402347650002602361650001102387650001402398650003202412650001402444650001502458650002602473650001102499650002002510650001102530650001202541650001202553650000902565650001002574650002502584650001902609650000902628650001102637650001102648650000902659650004402668650001602712650002202728651001802750651001802768700002202786773011202808852000902920655001202929IND4466760120221121192031.0130429s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446676012DNAL7 a125142922pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHajjar, Ihab10aRegional Variations of Blood Pressure in the United States Are Associated with Regional Variations in Dietary Intakes: The NHANES-III Data  ap. 211-214.  aIncludes references  aCompared with other regions in the United States, the southern region has had the highest stroke mortality rate and a more prevalent and resistant hypertension. We designed this analysis of the data obtained from the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey III (NHANES-III), which is a community-based cross-sectional survey, to describe regional variations in blood pressure and the reported consumption of nutrients, focusing on those linked to blood pressure, in the United States. We selected the following variables from the NHANES-III data for this analysis: systolic and diastolic blood pressures, protein, carbohydrates, total fatty acids, saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, cholesterol, fiber, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, zinc, copper, iron, riboflavin, niacin, thiamin, alcohol and vitamins C, E, B-6 and B-12. Of the 17,752 participants in the survey who were 18 y of age or older, the south had the highest systolic and diastolic blood pressures (P < 0.005 for each) and reported the highest consumption of monounsaturated fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids and cholesterol (P < 0.05 for all) and the least amount of fiber in the multivariate analysis (P < 0.005). The highest reported sodium consumption was in the south region (3.4 ± 0.02 g), and the lowest was in the west (3.2 ± 0.03 g; P < 0.05). The south also consumed the least potassium, calcium, phosphorous, magnesium, copper, riboflavin, niacin, iron and vitamins A, C and B-6 (P < 0.005). There was no difference among the four regions in frequency of “adding salt on the table.” The region of the United States that includes the “stroke belt” has dietary patterns that may contribute to the high prevalence of hypertension and cardiovascular disease. 3ablood 3ablood pressure 3acalcium 3acarbohydrates 3acholesterol 3acopper 3aeating habits 3afatty acid composition 3ahypertension 3airon 3amagnesium 3amonounsaturated fatty acids 3amortality 3amultivariate analysis 3aniacin 3anutrients 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3apotassium 3ariboflavin 3asaturated fatty acids 3asodium 3asodium chloride 3astroke 3asurveys 3athiamin 3azinc 2aAdult 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aBlood Pressure 2aDiet 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMicronutrientsxadministration & dosage 2aMiddle Aged 2aNutrition Surveys 3aUnited States 0aUnited States1 aKotchen, Theodore0 tJournal of nutrition.g2003 Jan., v. 133, no. 1 p.211-214dAmerican Institute of Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle04123naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110024003300130040001800163100001800181245011700199300001800316506007600334520197000410506003702380650001302417650002202430650002402452650002002476650002102496650001602517650002002533650002502553650002402578650001202602650001302614650002302627650002302650650002102673650007602694650001102770650001602781650003002797650002102827650002402848650003302872650002002905650000902925650008402934650003403018653002403052653002803076700001603104700001803120700001403138700001603152773014203168852000903310856008303319930003303402945001303435946001303448655001203461IND2060223320221207110220.0971022e19970527dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206022332DNAL7 a91591162pmid7 aPMC208222pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.94.11.55882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChirala, S.S.10aAnimal fatty acid synthase: functional mapping and cloning and expression of the domain I constituent activities  ap. 5588-5593.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAnimal fatty acid synthase (FAS; EC 2.3.1.85) is a homodimer of a multifunctional subunit protein and catalyzes the synthesis of palmitate from acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, and NADPH. The subunit (Mr approximately 270,000) carries seven distinct component activities and a site for the prosthetic group 4'-phosphopantetheine (acyl carrier protein). Based on proteolytic mapping, the organization of the activity domains along the subunit polypeptide from the N terminus is as follows: beta-ketoacyl synthase, acetyl and malonyl transacylases, beta-hydroxyacyl dehydratase, enoyl reductase, beta-ketoacyl reductase, acyl carrier protein, and thioesterase. By comparing the amino acid sequences of the chicken, rat, and human syntheses, we found that kallikrein cleavage sites occur in the least conserved regions of the FAS polypeptide subunit. Determining the amino acid sequences of the N-terminal end of the major kallikrein cleavage peptides helped delineate the most likely boundaries of the component activities in the cDNA-derived amino acid sequence. To confirm this organization, we cloned the chicken FAS cDNA coding for domain I and expressed it in Escherichia coli as a maltose-binding fusion protein. The isolated recombinant protein contained the activities of the acetyl and malonyl transacylases and the beta-hydroxyacyl dehydratase. Based on the boundaries of the acetyl and malonyl transacylases and the beta-hydroxyacyl dehydratase, we also cloned the appropriate cDNA fragments encoding the domains that contain the transacylases and the dehydratase in pET vectors and expressed them in E. coli as thioredoxin-6xHis fusion proteins. The purified recombinant proteins contained, respectively, the activities of the acetyl and malonyl transacylases and the dehydratase. These results not only confirmed the order of the component activities in domain I, but also paved the way for successful expression and characterization of the remaining activities.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achickens 3acomplementary DNA 3afatty-acid synthase 3agene expression 3aEscherichia coli 3aproteolysis 3aenzyme activity 3arecombinant proteins 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aChickens 2aCloning, Molecular 2aConserved Sequence 2aEscherichia coli 2aFatty Acid Synthasesxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aHumans 2aKallikreins 2aMacromolecular Substances 2aMolecular Weight 2aOpen Reading Frames 2aPeptide Fragmentsxchemistry 2aPeptide Mapping 2aRats 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxbiosynthesisxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 0aproteolytic mapping 0amultifunctional enzymes1 aHuang, W.Y.1 aJayakumar, A.1 aSakai, K.1 aWakil, S.J.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1997 May 27, v. 94, no. 11 p.5588-5593x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.94.11.55883Available from publisher's Web site  a19971102b19971106c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02194naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002000125024001800145040001800163100002000181245007600201300001800277506007600295520090600371506003701277650002901314650002001343650002601363650001201389650001301401653001701414700001301431700001601444700001301460700001801473773014201491852000901633856008301642930003301725945001301758946001301771655001201784IND2060223220221207110216.0971022e19970527dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206022322DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.94.11.55822doi7 aPMC208212pmcid7 a91591152pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSlusarewicz, P.10aI(B/2) is a small cytosolic protein that participates in vacuole fusion  ap. 5582-5587.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSaccharomyces cerevisiae vacuole inheritance requires two low molecular weight activities, LMA1 and LMA2.

Though LMA2/I(B/2) was initially identified as a protease B inhibitor, this protease inhibitor activity is not related to its ability to promote vacuole fusion: (i) Low Mr protease B inhibitors cannot substitute for LMA1 or LMA2, (ii) LMA1 and LMA2 promote the fusion of vacuoles from a strain that has no protease B, (iii) low concentrations of LMA2 that fully inhibit protease B do not promote vacuole fusion, and (iv) LMA1, in which I(B/2) is complexed with thioredoxin, is far more active than LMA2/I(B/2) in promoting vacuole fusion and far less active in inhibiting protease B.

In a cell-free system, this process is ATP- and cytosol-dependent. While yeast cytosol promotes the export of glycopeptides from mammalian ER in vitro, glycopeptide release cannot be detected in the presence of mammalian cytosol. We demonstrate that this is due to an N-glycanase in mammalian cytosol rather than lack of glycopeptide transport activity in mammalian microsomes. Monitoring the amount of glycopeptide enclosed in ER membranes we show the cytosol- and ATP-dependent release of glycopeptide from mammalian microsomes. The fact that glycopeptide export can be achieved with ER and cytosol derived from heterologous sources indicates that glycopeptide export from the ER is an important process conserved during evolution.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ainterspecific variation 3arats 3apancreas 3adogs 3acytosol 3amicrosomes 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aprotein transport 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aenzyme activity 3aN-glycoside hydrolases 3aglycopeptides 2aAnimals 2aBiological Transport 2aDogs 2aEndoplasmic Reticulumxmetabolism 2aGlycopeptidesxmetabolism 2aMammals 2aPancreasxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aRats 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexmetabolismxultrastructure. 0aspecies differences 0an-glucanase 0aglycotripeptides1 aAli, B.R.S.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1997 June 24, v. 94, no. 13 p.6730-6734x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.94.13.67303Available from publisher's Web site  a19980101b19980107c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02943naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002600129245014800155300001800303500002400321520152200345650001801867650001801885650001801903650001301921650001101934650000901945650000901954650001501963650004301978650001002021650001102031650001102042650001702053650001502070650001202085650006102097650002502158650004102183650001102224650003002235700002402265700002802289700002102317773011402338852000902452655001202461IND4466766920221121090510.0130429s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446676692DNAL7 a126729312pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoutsos, Elizabeth A.10aMaternal Carotenoid Status Modifies the Incorporation of Dietary Carotenoids into Immune Tissues of Growing Chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus)  ap. 1132-1138.  aIncludes references  aCarotenoids provide pigmentation to avian species, and also have immunomodulatory potential, although experimental results are often inconsistent. Therefore, dietary carotenoid deposition into immune tissue of growing chicks was examined in relation to their maternal carotenoid status (i.e., yolk carotenoid level). Single-comb white leghorn chicks were hatched from carotenoid-replete (C+) or carotenoid-deplete (C−) eggs. For 4 wk posthatch, chicks were fed diets whose carotenoid level ranged from 0 to 38 mg total carotenoid/kg. Carotenoid additions consisted of lutein + canthaxanthin at a ratio of 4:1. After 4 wk, the carotenoid concentration of thymus, bursa, liver, plasma and shank epithelium was measured by HPLC. Egg yolk–derived carotenoids were detectable in chicks fed 0 dietary carotenoids for 4 wk. Chicks hatched from C+ eggs had significantly greater tissue lutein, zeaxanthin and/or canthaxanthin for all tissues (P < 0.05), compared to chicks hatched from C− eggs. Only bursa carotenoids were not dependent on chick diet (P = 0.24); for all other tissues, C+ chicks incorporated dietary carotenoids in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.01), whereas C− chicks never achieved the same level of carotenoid incorporation. This study demonstrated the importance of maternal carotenoid status on incorporation of yolk- and diet-derived tissue carotenoids in an avian model, and may explain some variability in carotenoid-based research, given that maternal carotenoid status is rarely controlled. 3aGallus gallus 3aWhite Leghorn 3acanthaxanthin 3achickens 3achicks 3adiet 3aeggs 3aepithelium 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aliver 3alutein 3amodels 3apigmentation 3azeaxanthin 2aAnimals 2aCarotenoidsxadministration & dosagexbloodxmetabolism. 2aChickensximmunology 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aFemale 2aImmune Systemxmetabolism1 aClifford, Andrew J.1 aCalvert, C.

The Strategic Approach was a major contribution to translating the international consensus on integrated water resources management (IWRM) into development cooperation activities. The approach and guidance were intended for use by decision-makers in government, the private sector, civil society, and international organisations of all kinds involved in water resources management. At the time, the guidance contained in the Strategic Approach was at the forefront of current thinking and provided a practical means of putting IWRM theory into practice. But since its inception new perspectives and priorities have emerged which need to be considered within the Strategic Approach and guidance given. This paper reviews the Strategic Approach against the IWRM trends and needs that have subsequently developed, and identifies how the approach could be amended to respond to these emerging needs. 3aguidelines 3ainternational organizations 3aprivate sector 3asociety 3awater management 0aliterature reviews 7aInternet resource1 aPearce, Geoff0 tIrrigation and drainage systems.g2010 Dec., v. 24, no. 3-4 p.191-203dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0168-62917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10795-010-9100-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110601b20110603c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02599naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002700129245011200156300001800268500002400286520125700310650001601567650001301583650002501596650002001621650001201641650002001653650001001673650000901683650001101692650001201703650001801715650000901733650001401742650002501756650001201781650001101793650001101804650001101815650001401826650002201840650001901862650001001881650002601891700002501917700002801942773011401970852000902084655001202093IND4466767020221121063829.0130429s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446676702DNAL7 a126729322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPenniston, Kristina L.12aA Theoretical Increase in Infants’ Hepatic Vitamin A Is Realized Using a Supplemented Lactating Sow Model  ap. 1139-1142.  aIncludes references  aVitamin A deficiency (VAD) is a public health problem affecting millions in developing nations. Supplementation for lactating women, whose needs are high, involves large oral doses of the preformed vitamin. The safety and efficacy of these doses has been inadequately studied. Lactating women typically receive 210 μmol of retinyl ester during early lactation, but 420 μmol has also been administered. If larger doses of vitamin A are not significantly more effective in preventing VAD in mothers and infants, then smaller doses would be recommended. We therefore examined the vitamin A concentration of milk from lactating sows (n = 15) that were provided two different doses of vitamin A (i.e., 1050 or 2100 μmol, n = 6/group) or corn oil (n = 3), corresponding to doses given women on the basis of body weight. Compared with controls, an overall significant treatment effect was found (P = 0.0019), but there was no difference in milk concentration between treatment groups. Theoretically, applying the mean milk vitamin A concentrations of the groups through 12 h and values to 48 h from 4 sows, we estimate that an infant of a supplemented mother could realize an increase of +0.08 or 0.16 μmol/g liver from the low or high dose, respectively. 3abody weight 3acorn oil 3adeveloping countries 3aearly lactation 3ainfants 3alactating women 3aliver 3amilk 3amodels 3amothers 3apublic health 3asows 3avitamin A 3avitamin deficiencies 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aLactation 2aLiverxmetabolism 2aModels, Animal 2aSwine 2aVitamin Axmetabolism1 aValentine, Ashley R.1 aTanumihardjo, Sherry A.0 tJournal of nutrition.g2003 Apr., v. 133, no. 4 p.1139-1142dAmerican Institute of Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03414naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110024003300130040001800163100001600181245009300197300001800290506007600308520143100384506003701815650003001852650001301882650002001895650002001915650002001935650001501955650001201970650002401982650001802006650007302024650001502097650007302112650002302185650004102208650003202249650002002281650007102301650001202372650004702384650003902431653001502470700002102485700002002506700001602526773014302542852000902685856008302694930003302777945001302810946001302823655001202836IND2060520020221207112911.0971113e19970610dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206052002DNAL7 a91771842pmid7 aPMC210162pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.94.12.61422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, G.W.10aInteraction of the S phase regulator Cdc18 with cyclin-dependent kinase in fission yeast  ap. 6142-6147.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe fission yeast gene cdc18(+) is required for entry into S phase and for coupling mitosis to the successful completion of S phase. Cdc18 is a highly unstable protein that is expressed only once per cell cycle at the G1/S boundary. Overexpression of Cdc18 causes a mitotic delay and reinitiation of DNA replication, suggesting that the inactivation of Cdc18 plays a role in preventing rereplication within a given cell cycle. In this paper, we present evidence that Cdc18 is associated with active cyclin-dependent kinase in vivo. We have expressed Cdc18 as a glutathione S-transferase fusion in fission yeast and demonstrated that the fusion protein is functional in vivo. We find that the Cdc18 fusion protein copurifies with a kinase activity capable of phosphorylating histone H1 and Cdc18. The activity was identified by a variety of methods as the cyclin-dependent kinase containing the product of the cdc2(+) gene. The amino terminus of Cdc18 is required for association with cyclin-dependent kinase, but the association does not require the consensus cyclin-dependent kinase phosphorylation sites in this region. Additionally, both G1/S and mitotic forms of cyclin-dependent kinase phosphorylate and interact with Cdc18. These interactions between Cdc18 and cyclin-dependent kineses suggest mechanisms by which cyclin-dependent kinases could activate the initiation of DNA replication and could prevent rereplication.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSchizosaccharomyces pombe 3ahistones 3aphosphorylation 3aDNA replication 3aenzyme activity 3ainterphase 3amitosis 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBinding Sites 2aCDC2 Protein Kinasexgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aCell Cycle 2aCell Cycle Proteinsxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aConsensus Sequence 2aCyclin-Dependent Kinasesxmetabolism 2aFungal Proteinsxmetabolism 2aPhosphorylation 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aS Phase 2aSchizosaccharomycesxcytologyxphysiology. 2aSchizosaccharomyces pombe Proteins 0aregulation1 aJallepalli, P.V.1 aHuneycutt, B.J.1 aKelly, T.J.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1997 June 10, v. 94, no. 12 p.6142-6147x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.94.12.61423Available from publisher's Web site  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03094naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245006300142300002000205500001500225520123100240650001301471650002501484650002001509650001101529650003401540650002001574650002401594650001201618650001901630650004101649650003301690650002401723650004001747650001301787650002201800650002801822650002101850650002001871650004601891650002001937650005801957650005902015650000902074650002202083650003802105653001202143653002302155653002802178653002002206700001502226700001502241700001402256700001402270700001902284773009802303852000902401939003302410946001302443655001202456IND9202669020221121034609.0920430e19911125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920266902DNAL7 a19392682pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPlana, M.10aPhosphorylation of maize RAB-17 protein by casein kinase 2  ap. 22510-22514.  a2019-12-04  aThe maize gene RAB-17, which is responsive to abscisic acid, encodes a basic glycine-rich protein containing, in the middle part of its sequence, a cluster of 8 serine residues followed by a putative casein kinase 2-type substrate consensus sequence. This protein was found to be highly phosphorylated in vivo. Here, we show that RAB-17 protein is a real substrate for casein kinase 2. RAB-17 protein is phosphorylated in vitro by casein kinase 2 isolated from rat liver cytosol and from maize embryos. A maximum of 4 mol of phosphate were incorporated per mol of RAB-17 protein following incubation with casein kinase 2. Phosphopeptide mapping experiments show that the peptide phosphorylated by casein kinase 2 in vitro is identical to that derived from the protein phosphorylated in vivo. Purification by high performance liquid chromatography and partial sequencing of the phosphopeptide indicate that it corresponds to the region of the protein (residues 56-89) containing the cluster of serine residues. Our results indicate that RAB-17 is phosphorylated by casein kinase 2 or a kinase with a similar specificity and that phosphorylation takes place in the serine cluster region of the protein both in vitro and in vivo. 3aZea mays 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3acasein 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3aphosphorylation 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aCasein Kinases 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aChromatography, Ion Exchange 2aCytosolxenzymology 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aKinetics 2aLiverxenzymology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMolecular Weight 2aPeptide Mapping 2aPhosphopeptidesxisolation & purification 2aPhosphorylation 2aPlant Proteinsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aProtein Kinasesxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aRats 2aSeedsxenzymology 2aZea maysxenzymologyxmetabolism. 0akinases 0agenetic regulation 0amolecular sequence data 0aphosphopeptides1 aItarte, E.1 aEritja, R.1 aGoday, A.1 aPages, M.1 aMartinez, M.C.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1991 Nov. 25, v. 266, no. 33 p.22510-22514x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02000naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245010800124300001800232520086400250650001601114650001901130650001101149650001001160650001201170650002501182650002501207650002501232653001801257653002801275653001901303653001601322653001601338700001701354700001401371700001801385700001701403700001801420773008501438852000901523939003301532946001301565655001201578IND9202667920221121034751.0920430e199112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920266792DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMasai, E.10aCloning and sequencing of the gene for a Pseudomonas paucimobilis enzyme that cleaves a beta-aryl ether  ap. 7950-7955.  aWe isolated Pseudomonas paucimobilis SYK-6, which as able to degrade various dimeric lignin compounds (Y.

This gene was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the enzyme had the same kinetic properties as the P. paucimobilis SYK-6 enzyme. 3aPseudomonas 3abiodegradation 3alignin 3agenes 3aenzymes 3abiochemical pathways 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 0abeta-etherase 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/m69107 0aembl/m69107 0addbj/m691071 aKatayama, Y.1 aKawai, S.1 aNishikawa, S.1 aYamasaki, M.1 aMorohoshi, N.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1991 Dec., v. 173, no. 24 p.7950-7955x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03712naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110024003300130040001800163100001300181245012600194300001800320506007600338520181200414506003702226650002802263650002102291650001302312650002002325650002702345650002502372650002302397650001802420650001202438650001802450650001502468650002402483650004602507650004602553650002402599650003102623653002002654653001202674700001702686700002002703700001602723700001402739700001602753700001402769700001902783700001502802773014202817852000902959856008302968930003303051945001303084946001303097655001203110IND2061110820221207111259.0980107e19970708dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206111082DNAL7 a92070692pmid7 aPMC237922pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.94.14.72042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, S.C.10aHigh-affinity binding of the Drosophila Numb phosphotyrosine-binding domain to peptides containing a Gly-Pro-(p)Tyr motif  ap. 7204-7209.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain is a recently identified protein module that has been characterized as binding to phosphopeptides containing an NPXpY motif (X = any amino acid). We describe here a novel peptide sequence recognized by the PTB domain from Drosophila Numb (dNumb), a protein involved in cell fate determination and asymmetric cell division during the development of the Drosophila nervous system. Using a Tyr-oriented peptide library to screen for ligands, the dNumb PTB domain was found to bind selectively to peptides containing a YIGPY phi motif (phi represents a hydrophobic residue). A synthetic peptide containing this sequence bound specifically to the isolated dNumb PTB domain in solution with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 5.78 +/- 0.74 micromolar. Interestingly, the affinity of this peptide for the dNumb PTB domain was increased (Kd = 1.41 +/- 0.10 micromolar) when the second tyrosine in the sequence was phosphorylated. Amino acid substitution studies of the phosphopeptide demonstrated that a core motif of sequence GP(p)Y is required for high-affinity binding to the dNumb PTB domain. Nuclear magnetic resonance experiments performed on isotopically labeled protein complexed with either Tyr- or pTyr-containing peptides suggest that the same set of amino acids in the dNumb PTB domain is involved in binding both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of the peptide. The in vitro selectivity of the dNumb PTB domain is therefore markedly different from those of the Shc and IRS-1 PTB domains, in that it interacts preferentially with a GP(p)Y motif, rather than NPXpY, and does not absolutely require ligand phosphorylation for binding. Our results suggest that the PTB domain is a versatile protein module, capable of exhibiting varied binding specificities.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3abinding proteins 3atyrosine 3aphosphorylation 3aamino acid derivatives 3aamino acid sequences 3asynthetic peptides 3abinding sites 2aAnimals 2aBinding Sites 2aDrosophila 2aDrosophila Proteins 2aJuvenile Hormonesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aPeptide Fragmentsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aPeptidesxchemistry 2aPhosphotyrosinexchemistry 0aphosphopeptides 0abinding1 aSongyang, Z.1 aVincent, S.J.F.1 aZwahlen, C.1 aWiley, S.1 aCantley, L.1 aKay, L.E.1 aForman-Kay, J.1 aPawson, T.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1997 July 8, v. 94, no. 14 p.7204-7209x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.94.14.72043Available from publisher's Web site  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02174naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245010000164300001600264500002400280520098100304650001401285650001201299650001301311650001501324650000901339650001201348650001501360650001701375650001901392650001101411650002201422650000701444650002501451650001301476650001601489650000901505700001501514700003401529773012001563852000901683856004801692655001201740IND4451394320221121034633.0110326e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445139432DNAL7 a10.1007/s11746-010-1681-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMajoni, Sandra10aPhysical and Chemical Processes to Enhance Oil Recovery from Condensed Corn Distillers Solubles  ap. 425-434.  aIncludes references  aOil recovery from corn fermentation co-products can provide feedstock for biodiesel production. The effects of physical and chemical processes on oil recovery from condensed corn distillers solubles (CCDS) were investigated. Heating disrupted physical interactions in the CCDS and increased oil recovery by 2.5-fold when temperature was increased from 25 to 59 °C. Oil recovery at acidic pH conditions was significantly greater than at alkaline pH. Oil recovery at alkaline pH was increased by heating and addition of the reducing agent, sodium metabisulfite. Oil extraction using polar solvents isopropanol and butanol achieved greater than 80% oil recovery. When oil was co-extracted with zein using hexane and ethanol as co-solvents, the greatest total oil recovery was achieved, 89%. Churning CCDS at pH 3.5, 50 °C for 3 h achieved up to 80% oil recovery. This study provides data for designing further effective methods for oil separation from corn ethanol co-products. 3abiodiesel 3abutanol 3achurning 3acoproducts 3acorn 3aethanol 3afeedstocks 3afermentation 3aheat treatment 3ahexane 3aisopropyl alcohol 3apH 3asodium metabisulfite 3asolvents 3atemperature 3azein1 aWang, Tong1 aJohnson, L.

At the 25th percentile of calcium intakes, 15% of young women were overweight, and that fraction fell to only 4% at calcium intakes in the range of currently recommended values. Similarly, obesity prevalence in this cohort fell from 1.4 to 0.2% across the same difference in calcium intakes. At midlife, women at the 25th percentile of intakes gained weight, on average, at a rate of 0.42 kg/y. This gain dropped to −0.011 kg/y at currently recommended calcium intakes. Although calcium intake explains only a small fraction of the variability in weight or weight gain, shifting the mean of the distributions downward by increasing calcium intake can be estimated to reduce the prevalence of overweight and obesity by perhaps as much as 60–80%. 3acalcium 3aobesity 3aweight gain 3awomen0 tJournal of nutrition.g2003 Jan., v. 133, no. 1 p.268S-270SdAmerican Institute of Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02664naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002300110245011800133300001800251500002400269520150800293650002101801650001201822650001901834650001001853650001601863650001001879650001801889650000901907650001101916650001901927650001401946650000901960650001401969650001401983650001801997650002002015650001102035650001402046650002302060650002402083773011402107852000902221655001202230IND4466761720221121002432.0130429s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446676172DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoss, A.

Although it may be presumed that the concentration of RA is closely regulated, the mechanisms underlying such regulation are not well understood. Our research has examined the expression and function of two enzymes, lecithin:retinol acyltransferase (LRAT) and a cytochrome P450, CYP26, in the liver and lung of rats and mice, over a wide range of vitamin A status or after treatment of vitamin A–deficient animals with exogenous RA. LRAT expression at both the mRNA and protein activity levels and CYP26 mRNA are regulated by dietary vitamin A in a steady-state model and are acutely regulated by RA in an acute repletion model. In the liver, the level of expression of LRAT and CYP26 is as follows: vitamin A deficient < vitamin A marginal < vitamin A adequate < vitamin A supplemented < RA treated. The regulation of LRAT shows strong tissue specificity (highly regulated in liver and lung but not in small intestine), whereas CYP26 is strongly regulated in the liver, lung, testis and intestine. RA may function as a signal of the body’s vitamin A adequacy. The regulated expression of LRAT, CYP26 and other genes by RA may provide a sensitive response mechanism that overall serves to adjust the metabolism of vitamin A to maintain retinoid homeostasis and prevent retinoid excess. 3acytochrome P-450 3aenzymes 3aesterification 3agenes 3ahomeostasis 3aliver 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3amodels 3anuclear family 3aoxidation 3arats 3areceptors 3arepletion 3aretinoic acid 3asmall intestine 3atestes 3avitamin A 3avitamin metabolism 3avitamin supplements0 tJournal of nutrition.g2003 Jan., v. 133, no. 1 p.291S-296SdAmerican Institute of Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02488naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001600149245014500165300001600310500002400326520130000350650002801650650001001678650001201688650002601700650001701726650002301743650001701766650001101783650001501794650001601809651001701825700002301842700002401865700002401889773009101913852000902004856008902013655001202102IND4466762720221120231017.0130429s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446676272DNAL7 a10.1016/S0261-2194(03)00084-X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMay, Billy.14aThe effects of trichlorfon and deltamethrin on alfalfa plant bug and lygus bug (Heteroptera: Miridae) populations in alfalfa grown in Canada  ap. 883-889.  aIncludes references  aPlant bugs (Heteroptera: Miridae), chiefly lygus bugs (Lygus spp.) and alfalfa plant bug (Adelphocoris lineolatus (Goeze) (APB)), are the main insect pests of alfalfa seed production in Canada. A 3-year study was conducted in small plots of alfalfa at Melfort, Saskatchewan, Canada, to determine the effectiveness of trichlorfon at a single rate and deltamethrin at several rates for controlling these pests. Trichlorfon effectively controlled APB each year and both trichlorfon and deltamethrin controlled Lygus spp. each year. Consistent control of APB populations was not achieved with deltamethrin; the insecticide controlled APB in the first year of the study, but was effective for only 2 weeks in the second year, and it did not reduce APB numbers below economic thresholds in the last year. In 1 year, numbers of beneficial arthropods were higher in control and trichlorfon plots than in deltamethrin plots. Alfalfa seed yields combined over 3 years were increased by trichlorfon at 560 g a.i./ha and by deltamethrin at 12.4, 14.8, and 17.3 g a.i./ha. Based on these data, despite occupying similar niches in alfalfa, lygus bugs and APBs have different levels of susceptibility to deltamethrin; therefore, the chemical should not be recommended for control of APB in seed alfalfa fields. 3aAdelphocoris lineolatus 3aLygus 3aalfalfa 3abeneficial arthropods 3adeltamethrin 3aeconomic threshold 3ainsect pests 3aniches 3aseed yield 3atrichlorfon 3aSaskatchewan1 aSoroka, Juliana J.1 aLoeppky, Heather A.1 aMurrell, Dorothy C.0 tCrop protection.g2003 July, v. 22, no. 6 p.883-889dElsevier Sciencex0261-21947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0261-2194(03)00084-X3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02670naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002600171245007500197300001600272500002400288520121700312650001201529650002401541650000901565650001901574650001601593650001101609650001601620650001201636650003001648650001101678650000901689650002401698650004701722650005301769700003001822700002201852700002401874700002301898700002301921700002201944700002301966773013501989852000902124856005502133655001202188IND4460362620221120230827.0110722e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446036262DNAL7 a213821192pmid7 a10.1111/j.1740-8261.2011.01805.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLAURENSON, MICHELE P.10aComputed tomography of the pharynx in a closed vs. open mouth position  ap. 357-361.  aIncludes references  aThe pharynx is anatomically complex and evaluation can be difficult even with cross-sectional imaging.

How this feat is accomplished by the colony's queen(s) and workers remains a puzzle. Here, I review what we have learned about this subject in the European honeybee (Apis mellifera), specifically with regard to a colony's production of males (drones). I identify five environmental conditions that influence colony-level patterns of drone production and then define five stages of drone rearing that are accomplished by the queen and workers. Using this framework, I detail our current understanding of how the queen or workers adjust their actions at each stage of drone rearing in response to each of the environmental conditions. Future investigations of this topic in honeybees and other social insect societies will lead to a better understanding of how colonies manage to flexibly and efficiently allocate their resources under changing environmental conditions. 3aApis mellifera 3arearing 3areproduction 3amales 3ahoney bees 3asocial insects 3aenvironmental factors 3afood availability 3ahoney bee colonies 0adrones0 tInsectes sociaux.g2010 Feb., v. 57, no. 1 p.1-9dSP Birkhäuser Verlag Baselx0020-18127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00040-009-0046-9 7aarticle03571naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110024003300130040001800163100001400181245009400195300001800289500001500307506007600322520148200398506003701880650001801917650001701935650004301952650002701995650002002022650001802042650001802060650001202078650002202090650001802112650002002130650002902150650002502179650004102204650001702245650003602262650002802298650001302326650002202339653003302361653003502394653001902429653002802448653001902476653002602495653002502521653001802546700001602564700001702580700001802597773014302615852000902758856008302767930003302850945001302883946001302896655001202909IND2060978420221207113036.0971219e19970624dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206097842DNAL7 a91926962pmid7 aPMC212892pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.94.13.70882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDry, I.B.12aA novel subviral agent associated with a geminivirus: the first report of a DNA satellite  ap. 7088-7093.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNumerous plant RNA viruses have associated with them satellite (sat) RNAs that have little or no nucleotide sequence similarity to either the viral or host genomes but are completely dependent on the helper virus for replication. We report here on the discovery of a 682-nt circular DNA satellite associated with tomato leaf curl geminivirus (TLCV) infection in northern Australia. This is the first demonstration that satellite molecules are not limited to RNA viral systems. The DNA satellite (TLCV sat-DNA) is strictly dependent for replication on the helper virus replication-associated protein and is encapsidated by TLCV coat protein. It has no significant open reading frames, and it shows no significant sequence similarity to the 2766-nt helper-virus genome except for two short motifs present in separate putative stem-loop structures: TAATATTAC, which is universally conserved in all geminiviruses, and AATCGGTGTC, which is identical to a putative replication-associated protein binding motif in TLCV. Replication of TLCV sat-DNA is also supported by other taxonomically distinct geminiviruses, including tomato yellow leaf curl virus, African cassava mosaic virus, and beet curly top virus. Therefore, this unique DNA satellite does not appear to strictly conform with the requirements that dictate the specificity of interaction of geminiviral replication-associated proteins with their cognate origins as predicted by the current model of geminivirus replication.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acoat proteins 3acircular DNA 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3aTomato leaf curl virus 3aDNA replication 3asatellite DNA 3apathogenicity 3amutants 3avirus replication 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA Replication 2aDNA, Satellitexgenetics 2aDNA, Viralxgenetics 2aGeminiviridaexgeneticsxphysiology. 2aGenes, Viral 2aSolanum lycopersicumxvirology. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlasmids 2aVirus Replication 0atomato leaf curl geminivirus 0areplication associated protein 0agenbank/u74627 0amolecular sequence data 0aviral proteins 0adna replicative forms 0anucleotide sequences 0aGeminiviridae1 aKrake, L.R.1 aRigden, J.E.1 aRezaian, M.A.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1997 June 24, v. 94, no. 13 p.7088-7093x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.94.13.70883Available from publisher's Web site  a19980101b19980107c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03248naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110024003300130040001800163100001400181245010600195300001800301500001500319506007600334520122100410506003701631650002401668650001301692650002901705650002201734650002501756650003401781650002401815650002301839650002301862650004101885650003901926650001801965650003401983650003102017650002902048650007802077653001302155653001502168700001302183700001602196700002102212700001402233700001202247700001502259700001702274700001902291700001802310773014302328852000902471856008302480930003302563945001302596946001302609655001202622IND2060978120221207111305.0971219e19970624dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206097812DNAL7 a91926952pmid7 aPMC212882pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.94.13.70822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYun, D.J.10aStress proteins on the yeast cell surface determine resistance to osmotin, a plant antifungal protein  ap. 7082-7087.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aStrains of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae differ in their sensitivities to tobacco osmotin, an antifungal protein of the PR-5 family. However, cells sensitive to tobacco osmotin showed resistance to osmotin-like proteins purified from the plant Atriplex nummularia, indicating a strict specificity between the antifungal protein and its target cell. A member of a gene family encoding stress proteins induced by heat and nitrogen limitation, collectively called Pir proteins, was isolated among the genes that conveyed resistance to tobacco osmotin to a susceptible strain. We show that overexpression of Pir proteins increased resistance to osmotin, whereas simultaneous deletion of all PIR genes in a tolerant strain resulted in sensitivity. Pir proteins have been immunolocalized to the cell wall. The enzymatic digestion of the cell wall of sensitive and resistant cells rendered spheroplasts equally susceptible to the cytotoxic action of tobacco osmotin but not to other osmotin-like proteins, indicating that the cell membrane interacts specifically with osmotin and facilitates its action. Our results demonstrate that fungal cell wall proteins are determinants of resistance to antifungal PR-5 proteins.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAtriplex nummularia 3amutation 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aNicotiana tabacum 3acell wall components 3apathogenesis-related proteins 3aimmunocytochemistry 3adefense mechanisms 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDrug Resistance, Microbialxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungal 2aGenes, Fungal 2aHeat-Shock Proteinsxgenetics 2aMicroscopy, Immunoelectron 2aPlant Proteinsxgenetics 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxultrastructure. 0aproteins 0aresistance1 aZhao, Y.1 aPardo, J.M.1 aNarasimhan, M.L.1 aDamsz, B.1 aLee, H.1 aAbad, L.R.1 aD'Urzo, M.P.1 aHasegawa, P.M.1 aBressan, R.A.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1997 June 24, v. 94, no. 13 p.7082-7087x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.94.13.70823Available from publisher's Web site  a19980101b19980107c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle01982naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002600149245009900175300001600274500002400290500001500314520077500329650002101104650001201125650003601137650001401173650001001187650001901197650003101216650000901247650001001256650001101266653001601277653001601293700001701309700001501326700001501341700001501356773009101371852000901462856008901471655001201560IND4466763220221120221019.0130429s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446676322DNAL7 a10.1016/S0261-2194(03)00090-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChowdhury, A.B.M.N.U.12aA novel method of delivering Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei spores for laboratory experiments  ap. 917-922.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA precise and accurate method for delivering conidia of powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei) onto artificial and natural substrates was developed for use in studies to optimise the bioefficacy of crop protection agents.

A mutation in one splice form, Ob-Rb, results in obesity in mice. Northern blots, RNase protection assays, and PCR indicate that Ob-Rb is expressed at a relatively high level in hypothalamus and low level in several other tissues. Ob-Ra is expressed ubiquitously, whereas Ob-Rc, -Rd, and -Re RNAs are only detectable using PCR. In hypothalamus, Ob-Rb is present in the arcuate, ventromedial, dorsomedial, and lateral hypothalamic nuclei but is not detectable in other brain regions. These nuclei are known to regulate food intake and body weight. The level of Ob-Rb in hypothalamus is reduced in mice rendered obese by gold thioglucose (GTG), which causes hypothalamic lesions. The obesity in GTG-treated mice is likely to be caused by ablation of Ob-Rb-expressing neurons, which results in leptin resistance.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3apolypeptides 3apancreas 3amessenger RNA 3aalternative splicing 3ahypothalamus 3arestriction mapping 3astructural genes 3ahormone receptors 3amice 3agene expression 3aexons 3abrown adipose tissue 3aobesity 3aintrons 2aAlternative Splicing 2aAnimals 2aBlotting, Northern 2aBrainxmetabolism 2aCarrier Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aIn Situ Hybridization 2aMice 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aOrgan Specificity 2aReceptors, Cell Surface 2aReceptors, Leptin 0abrain 0amolecular sequence data 0aprecursors 0aadipose tissue 0agenbank/u97034 0anucleotide sequences 0agenbank/u970321 aOkano, H.J.1 aLi, C.1 aLee, G.H.1 aZhao, C.1 aDarnell, R.1 aFriedman, J.M.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1997 June 24, v. 94, no. 13 p.7001-7005x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.94.13.70013Available from publisher's Web site  a19980101b19980107c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02584naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002700149245009300176300001600269500002400285520127600309650001801585650002701603650002001630650002201650650002701672650002301699650001801722650001401740650002001754650001901774650001201793650003101805650001101836650001001847650001301857650000901870650001601879650001301895650000901908700002001917773009101937852000902028856008902037655001202126IND4466763720221120220852.0130429s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446676372DNAL7 a10.1016/S0261-2194(03)00092-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoschier, Elisabeth H.10aLabiate essential oils affecting host selection and acceptance of Thrips tabaci lindeman  ap. 929-934.  aIncludes references  aEssential oils from plants within the Lamiaceae family at several concentrations were evaluated for their repellent and deterrent properties against Thrips tabaci Lindeman (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), the onion thrips. Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.) essential oil repelled onion thrips females at 10% concentration in olfactometer bioassays. In leaf disc bioassays on leek (Allium porrum L.), 1% concentration of rosemary oil inhibited settling within a 4-h period. In dual-choice experiments marjoram (Origanum majorana L.) and mint (Mentha arvensis L.) oil both at 0.1% and 1% concentrations significantly deterred the egg-laying activity of thrips females on treated leaf discs. Lavender (Lavandula angustifolia L.) oil at 1% and sage (Salvia officinalis L.) oil at 0.1% concentration affected oviposition. In no-choice assays, thrips oviposition rate was significantly reduced by about 45-60% compared to the untreated control after application of marjoram and lavender oil at 1% or 0.1% concentration. With mint oil, oviposition deterrence was found only at 1% concentration. Repellent and/or deterrent essential oils combined with other control measures against T. tabaci may contribute to the enhancement of biological or integrated pest management strategies. 3aAllium porrum 3aLavandula angustifolia 3aMentha arvensis 3aOriganum majorana 3aRosmarinus officinalis 3aSalvia officinalis 3aThrips tabaci 3abioassays 3acontrol methods 3aessential oils 3afemales 3aintegrated pest management 3aleaves 3aleeks 3amarjoram 3amint 3aoviposition 3arosemary 3asage1 aSedy, Katrin A.0 tCrop protection.g2003 Aug., v. 22, no. 7 p.929-934dElsevier Sciencex0261-21947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0261-2194(03)00092-93Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03558naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143072001700161072001700178100001500195245013300210300001600343500002400359520130800383650002001691650001101711650002401722650001801746650002301764650002301787650001001810650001401820650000901834650002701843650002201870650002101892650002801913650001801941650003001959650002201989650004002011650003702051650002302088650002202111650002902133650003102162650002002193650004402213650005402257650001302311650003002324650003802354650002802392653002402420700001102444700002502455700001702480700002102497773012302518852000902641856008202650856004502732930003302777945002502810946001302835655001202848IND4408884920221120205906.0080814e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440888492DNAL7 a183211902pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI-21-4-04482doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Previously, a cluster of four receptor-like genes, Vfa1, Vfa2, Vfa3, and Vfa4, was identified within the Vf locus. Because the amino-acid sequence of Vfa3 is truncated, it was deemed nonfunctional. In this study, each of the three full-length Vfa genes was introduced into a plant cloning vector, pCAMBIA2301, and used for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of two apple cultivars, Galaxy and McIntosh, to assess functionality of these genes and to characterize their roles in resistance to V. inaequalis. Transformed apple lines carrying each of Vfa1, Vfa2, or Vfa4 were developed, analyzed for the presence of the transgene using polymerase chain reaction and Southern blotting, and assayed for resistance to apple scab following inoculation with V. inaequalis. Transformed lines expressing Vfa4 were found to be susceptible to apple scab, whereas those expressing either Vfa1 or Vfa2 exhibited partial resistance to apple scab. Based on Western blot analysis as well as microscopic analysis of plant resistance reactions, the roles of Vfa1 and Vfa2 in apple scab disease resistance response are discussed. 3aMalus domestica 3aapples 3aVenturia inaequalis 3ascab diseases 3adisease resistance 3agenetic resistance 3agenes 3areceptors 3aloci 3agenetic transformation 3atransgenic plants 3aMalus floribunda 3aornamental woody plants 3anursery crops 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aSouthern blotting 2aAgrobacterium tumefaciensxgenetics 2aAscomycotaxgrowth & development 2aBlotting, Southern 2aBlotting, Western 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aImmunity, Innatexgenetics 2aModels, Genetic 2aPlant Diseasesxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aPloidies 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aRosaceaexgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aTransformation, Genetic 0areceptor-like genes1 aXu, M.1 aBorejsza-Wysocka, E.1 aKorban, S.S.1 aAldwinckle, H.S.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2008 Apr., v. 21, no. 4 p.448-458dAPS PresswJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-21-4-04483Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-21-4-0448  a20081008b20081101c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/09/15  aOther US 7aarticle02631naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100001500167245016500182300001600347500002400363520122600387650002601613650001301639650001801652650001601670650002101686650002701707650002201734650002101756653002201777653002301799700001501822700001301837700001401850700001401864700001801878773011001896852000902006856008902015930003302104945002502137946001102162655001202173IND4408887720221120200235.0080814e20080719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440888772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2007.11.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS100 0aS2001 aZhou, H.Y.10aEffect of molecular weight and degree of chitosan deacetylation on the preparation and characteristics of chitosan thermosensitive hydrogel as a delivery system  ap. 265-273.  aIncludes references  aA thermosensitive hydrogel has been prepared with chitosan and αβ-glycerophosphate (αβ-GP) which could be transited from solution into gel at 37 °C. The thermosensitive characteristics, appearance and structure of the hydrogel were affected by concentration, molecular weight and degree of deacetylation (DD) of chitosan. Chitosan, MW 1360 kDa, DD 75.4%, solution concentration 2% was optimal for preparation of chitosan-αβ-glycerophosphate (CS-αβ-GP) thermosensitive hydrogel. The appearance of the hydrogel became more compact and regular with increasing concentration and chitosan MW. Model drugs release from CS-αβ-GP hydrogel prepared by the drug being added into chitosan solution (method I) was slower than that from hydrogel prepared by the drug being directly added into chitosan hydrogel (method II).The release rate for both adriamycin and 6-mercaptopurine from CS-αβ-GP hydrogel decreased with the increase of MW of the chitosan. The hydrophilic model adriamycin was released 60-70% over 24 h which was slower than that of the hydrophobic model 6-mercaptopurine. Therefore it was projected that the CS-αβ-GP hydrogel should be an ideal sustained release system especially for hydrophilic drugs. 3adrug delivery systems 3achitosan 3ahydrocolloids 3aacetylation 3amolecular weight 3achemical concentration 3achemical analysis 3ain vitro studies 0athermosensitivity 0arelease efficiency1 aChen, X.G.1 aKong, M.1 aLiu, C.S.1 aCha, D.S.1 aKennedy, J.F.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2008 July 19, v. 73, no. 2 p.265-273dApplied Science Publishersx0144-86177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2007.11.0263Available from publisher's Web site  a20090831b20091002c00000000  aINDdLYNe2009/08/31  aNon-US 7aarticle02463naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110024003300130040001800163100001900181245004000200300001800240500013000258506007600388520081600464506003701280650002701317650002901344650002201373650001501395650001401410650001401424650001601438650001301454650002601467650001201493650002501505650001301530650001601543650002201559650002301581651001301604651001501617700001901632773014301651852000901794856008301803930003301886945001301919946001301932655001201945IND2061319220221207100557.0980115e19970722dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206131922DNAL7 a92232582pmid7 aPMC336942pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.94.15.77422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnderson, W.W.12aA demographic approach to selection  ap. 7742-7747.  aPaper presented at a colloquium "Genetics and the Origin of Species" held January 30 to February 1, 1997, Irvine, California.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe concepts or demography provide a means of combining the ecological approach to population growth with the genetical approach to natural selection. We have utilized the demographic theory of natural selection developed by Norton and Charlesworth to analyze life history schedules or births and deaths for populations of genotypes in Drosophila pseudoobscura. Our populations illustrate a stable genetic equilibrium, an unstable genetic equilibrium, and a case of no equilibrium. We have estimated population growth rates and Darwinian fitnesses of the genotypes and have explored the role of population growth in determining natural selection. The age-specific rates of births and deaths provide insights into components of selection. Both viability and fertility are important components in our populations.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3alife cycle (organisms) 3aDrosophila pseudoobscura 3anatural selection 3ademography 3afecundity 3alongevity 3akaryotyping 3agenotype 3achromosome inversions 2aAnimals 2aDrosophilaxgenetics 2aGenotype 2aKaryotyping 2aPopulation Growth 2aSelection, Genetic 3aColorado 3aCalifornia1 aWatanabe, T.K.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1997 July 22, v. 94, no. 15 p.7742-7747x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.94.15.77423Available from publisher's Web site  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02873naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111024003300131040001800164100001500182245008400197300001800281500001500299506007600314520112900390506003701519650001101556650001801567650002101585650001301606650002201619650001301641650002601654650002001680650001701700650001801717650002001735650001901755650001901774650001501793650002501808650002401833650002301857653001501880653001601895653001001911700001801921700001801939700001801957700001501975773014201990852000902132856008302141930003302224945001302257946001302270655001202283IND2061232220221207100542.0980113e19970805dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206123222DNAL7 a110385632pmid7 aPMC231902pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.94.16.89012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCharon, C.10aenod40 induces dedifferentiation and division of root cortical cells in legumes  ap. 8901-8906.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aUnder nitrogen-limiting conditions Rhizobium meliloti can establish symbiosis with Medicago plants to form nitrogen-fixing root nodules. Nodule organogenesis starts with the dedifferentiation and division of root cortical cells. In these cells the early nodulin gene enod40, which encodes an unusually small peptide (12 or 13 amino acids), is induced from the beginning of this process. Herein we show that enod40 expression evokes root nodule initiation. (i) Nitrogen-deprived transgenic Medicago truncatula plants over-expressing enod40 exhibit extensive cortical cell division in their roots in the absence of Rhizobium. (ii) Bombardment of Medicago roots with an enod40-expressing DNA cassette induces dedifferentiation and division of cortical cells and the expression of another early nodulin gene, Msenod12A. Moreover, transient expression of either the enod40 region spanning the oligopeptide sequence or only the downstream region without this sequence induces these responses. Our results suggest that the cell-specific growth response elicited by enod40 is involved in the initiation of root nodule organogenesis.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acortex 3agene transfer 3astructural genes 3anodulins 3atransgenic plants 3anitrogen 3anutrient deficiencies 3aMedicago sativa 3aroot nodules 3acell division 3agene expression 3ahistochemistry 3areporter genes 3anodulation 3acell differentiation 3aMedicago truncatula 3abeta-glucuronidase 0ainitiation 0aenod40 gene 0aroots1 aJohansson, C.1 aKondorosi, E.1 aKondorosi, A.1 aCrespi, M.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1997 Aug. 5, v. 94, no. 16 p.8901-8906x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.94.16.89013Available from publisher's Web site  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02163naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149100002300158245010500181300001600286500002400302500001500326520078400341650002201125650002501147650001401172650001201186650001501198650001301213650002001226650002301246653002001269700001801289700002001307700002001327700001601347700001801363700001801381700001701399773011001416852000901526856008901535930003301624945002501657946001101682655001201693IND4408888320221120184858.0080814e20080719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440888832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2007.11.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS2001 aSantos-Neves, J.C.12aA novel branched αβ-glucan isolated from the basidiocarps of the edible mushroom Pleurotus florida  ap. 309-314.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAs polysaccharides of the mushroom genus Pleurotus can act as biological response modifiers, we now describe the chemical characterization of a new water-soluble αβ-glucan from the fruiting bodies of the edible mushroom Pleurotus florida.

Est-5B, 5' upstream elements, give rise to a beta-galactosidase expression pattern that coincides with the wild-type expression of Est-5B in D. pseudoobscura. The expression patterns of the Est-5B/lacZ construct are different from those of a fusion gene containing the upstream region of Est-6. Common sites of expression for both kinds of constructs are the third segment of antenna, the maxillary palps, and salivary glands. In vitro deletion mutagenesis has shown that the two genes have a different organization of regulatory elements controlling expression in both the third segment of antenna and maxillary palps. The results suggest that the conservation of the expression pattern in genes that evolved from a common ancestor may not he accompanied by preservation of the corresponding cis-regulatory elements.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila pseudoobscura 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aesterases 3agene expression 3aregulatory sequences 3arecombinant DNA 3areporter genes 3abeta-galactosidase 3aspatial distribution 3atransgenic animals 3ahistochemistry 2aAnimals 2aCarboxylesterase 2aCarboxylic Ester Hydrolasesxgenetics 2aDrosophilaxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aDrosophila Proteins 2aDrosophila melanogasterxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aGene Expression 2aRegulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid 2abeta-Galactosidasexgenetics1 aLudwig, M.Z.1 aRichmond, R.C.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1997 July 22, v. 94, no. 15 p.7735-7741x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.94.15.77353Available from publisher's Web site  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03338naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110024003300130040001800163100001900181245005900200300001800259500001500277506007600292520162400368506003701992650001602029650001402045650001202059650002502071650003202096650002002128650001202148650002802160650001102188650001102199650000902210650004002219653001502259653001602274653001602290653002202306653001902328653002402347653002102371653002302392653001902415700001802434700001502452773014202467852000902609856008302618930003302701945001302734946001302747655001202760IND2061229920221207101703.0980113e19970805dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206122992DNAL7 a92380282pmid7 aPMC230512pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.94.16.86282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcMillan, W.O.10aWhat initiates speciation in passion-vine butterflies?  ap. 8628-8633.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aStudies of the continuum between geographic races and species provide the clearest insights into the causes of speciation. Here we report on mate choice and hybrid viability experiments in a pair of warningly colored butterflies, Heliconius erato and Heliconius himera, that maintain their genetic integrity in the face of hybridization. Hybrid sterility and inviability have been unimportant in the early stages of speciation of these two Heliconius. We find no evidence of reduced fecundity, egg hatch, or larval survival nor increases in developmental time in three generations of hybrid crosses. Instead, speciation in this pair appears to have been catalyzed by the association of strong mating preferences with divergence in warning coloration and ecology. In mate choice experiments, matings between the two species are a tenth as likely as matings within species. F1 hybrids of both sexes mate frequently with both pure forms. However, male F1 progeny from crosses between H. himera mothers and H. erato fathers have somewhat reduced mating success. The strong barrier to gene flow provided by divergence in mate preference is probably enhanced by frequency-dependent predation against hybrids similar to the type known to occur across interracial hybrid zones of H. erato. In addition, the transition between this pair falls at the boundary between wet and dry forest, and rare hybrids may also be selected against because they are poorly adapted to either biotope. These results add to a growing body of evidence that challenge the importance of genomic incompatibilities in the earliest stages of speciation.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNymphalidae 3aviability 3ahybrids 3aprobability analysis 3ainterspecific hybridization 3amating behavior 2aAnimals 2aButterfliesxphysiology 2aFemale 2aGenome 2aMale 2aSexual Behavior, Animalxphysiology 0aspeciation 0amate choice 0ainfertility 0aheliconius himera 0amating success 0asexual reproduction 0aheliconius erato 0amating preferences 0amating ability1 aJiggins, C.D.1 aMallet, J.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1997 Aug. 5, v. 94, no. 16 p.8628-8633x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.94.16.86283Available from publisher's Web site  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03858naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143072000900161072000900170100001900179245017200198300001600370500002400386520184400410650002502254650001002279650002502289650001902314650001902333650003402352650002202386650002002408650001602428650002602444650002402470650001102494650001802505650001202523650005502535650004802590650005202638650001302690650003502703650005502738650003302793650005202826650004602878650003802924700001202962700001502974773010502989852000903094856008203103930003303185945002503218946001303243655001203256IND4408885520221120184843.0080814e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440888552DNAL7 a183211882pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI-21-4-04242doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF822 0aF2001 aWubben, M.J.E.10aCyst Nematode Parasitism of Arabidopsis thaliana Is Inhibited by Salicylic Acid (SA) and Elicits Uncoupled SA-Independent Pathogenesis-Related Gene Expression in Roots  ap. 424-432.  aIncludes references  aCompatible plant-nematode interactions involve the formation of an elaborate feeding site within the host root that requires the evasion of plant defense mechanisms by the parasite. Little is known regarding plant defense signaling pathways that limit nematode parasitism during a compatible interaction. Therefore, we utilized Arabidopsis thaliana mutants perturbed in salicylic acid (SA) biosynthesis or signal transduction to investigate the role of SA in inhibiting parasitism by the beet cyst nematode Heterodera schachtii. We determined that SA-deficient mutants (sid2-1, pad4-1, and NahG) exhibited increased susceptibility to H. schachtii. In contrast, SA-treated wild-type plants showed decreased H. schachtii susceptibility. The npr1-2 and npr1-3 mutants, which are impaired in SA signaling, also showed increased susceptibility to H. schachtii, whereas the npr1-suppressor mutation sni1 showed decreased susceptibility. Constitutive pathogenesis-related (PR) gene-expressing mutants (cpr1 and cpr6) did not show altered susceptibility to H. schachtii; however, constitutive PR gene expression was restricted to cpr1 shoots with wild-type levels of PR-1 transcript present in cpr1 roots. Furthermore, we determined that H. schachtii infection elicits SA-independent PR-2 and PR-5 induction in wild-type roots, while PR-1 transcript and total SA levels remained unaltered. This was in contrast to shoots of infected plants where PR-1 transcript abundance and total SA levels were elevated. We conclude that SA acts via NPR1 to inhibit nematode parasitism which, in turn, is negatively regulated by SNI1. Our results show an inverse correlation between root basal PR-1 expression and plant susceptibility to H. schachtii and suggest that successful cyst nematode parasitism may involve a local suppression of SA signaling in roots. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aroots 3aHeterodera schachtii 3acyst nematodes 3asalicylic acid 3apathogenesis-related proteins 3aprotein synthesis 3agene expression 3ahost plants 3aresistance mechanisms 3asignal transduction 3ashoots 3amessenger RNA 2aAnimals 2aArabidopsisxdrug effectsxgeneticsxparasitology. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxdrug effects 2aMutation 2aNematodaxgrowth & development 2aPlant Rootsxdrug effectsxgeneticsxparasitology. 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSalicylic Acidxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aSignal Transductionxdrug effects1 aJin, J.1 aBaum, T.J.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2008 Apr., v. 21, no. 4 p.424-432dAPS Pressx0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-21-4-04243Available from publisher's Web site  a20081008b20081101c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/09/15  aOther US 7aarticle02516naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149100001200158245012200170300001600292500002400308500001500332520123400347650001401581650001801595650002701613650002101640650002601661650001301687650001801700650001601718650001501734653002001749700001301769700001201782700001101794773011001805852000901915856008901924930003302013945002502046946001102071655001202082IND4408887320221120184817.0080814e20080719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440888732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2007.11.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS2001 aFan, J.10aIn vitro evaluations of konjac glucomannan and xanthan gum mixture as the sustained release material of matrix tablet  ap. 241-247.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe objective of the present investigations was to develop sustained release matrix tablets with a mixture of the polysaccharides, konjac glucomannan (KGM) and xanthan gum (XG), as the sustained release material. A simple enzymatic procedure was selected to mimic the environment of colon in vitro assessments. The concentration of β-mannanase solution in mimic colon media was determined by comparing the hydrolytic ability of the mimic colon solution with that of 4% (w/v) rat cecal content media. In vitro, investigations were carried out to characterize the drug release process. The model drug cimetidine released from polysaccharides gel layer of matrix tablets over 10 h. It was shown that the synergistic interaction between konjac glucomannan and xanthan gum in the gel phase affects on the drug diffusion, which can effectively retard the drug release from the matrix tablets. Further research on the mixed polysaccharides indicated that there was a strong synergistic interaction between KGM and XG in solution and in the gel phase. The experimental results predicted that the polysaccharide mixtures of konjac glucomannan and xanthan gum has a good potential to be applied to sustained release drug delivery systems. 3aviscosity 3aparticle size 3anonfood plant products 3ain vitro studies 3adrug delivery systems 3amixtures 3akonjac mannan 3axanthan gum 3asynergists 0apolysaccharides1 aWang, K.1 aLiu, M.1 aHe, Z.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2008 July 19, v. 73, no. 2 p.241-247dApplied Science Publishersx0144-86177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2007.11.0273Available from publisher's Web site  a20090831b20091002c00000000  aINDdLYNe2009/08/31  aNon-US 7aarticle02622naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072000900135072000900144072000900153100001800162245006200180300001800242500002400260500002300284500001500307520114700322650002801469650001201497650001701509650001801526650002201544650001601566650002401582650002301606650001401629650001201643651002101655653001101676653001901687653000901706653001801715700001801733700001401751700001501765700001401780773013301794852000901927856007501936930003302011945002502044946001102069655001202080IND4408890420221120180124.0080814e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440889042DNAL7 a10.1139/X07-2062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF300 0aK100 0aK1301 aBunnell, F.L.10aLichens on down wood in logged and unlogged forest stands  ap. 1033-1041.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-06  aLichen communities of forests often appear to be negatively affected by timber harvest presumably because of reduction of suitable substrate and increased desiccation. We examined species richness and composition of lichens on wood of logs of the same decay class in unlogged stands (>140 years old) and logged, 20- to 30-year-old stands. There was no significant difference in species richness or mean lichen cover between logged and unlogged stands, but species composition differed, including species that were unique to either logged or unlogged stands. Crustose lichens accounted for 71% of rare species and all of the species occurring more commonly in unlogged stands; macrolichens accounted for 82% of common species and 60% of the species occurring more commonly in logged stands. Diameter at breast height and decay characteristics of down wood were the best predictors of lichen richness. Among lichen-rich, decay class 3 logs, relatively small amounts of retained down wood sustained lichen richness equivalent to unlogged stands. It appears important to ensure that decay classes favourable to lichens are retained after harvest. 3asilvicultural practices 3alogging 3adecayed wood 3aforest stands 3aspecies diversity 3acanopy gaps 3acoarse woody debris 3acolonizing ability 3aoverstory 3alichens 3aBritish Columbia 0acanopy 0acanopy removal 0alogs 0adecay classes1 aSpribille, T.1 aHoude, I.1 aGoward, T.1 aBjork, C.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2008 May, v. 38, no. 5 p.1033-1041dNational Research Council of Canadax0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/X07-2063Available from publisher's Web site  a20080826b20080905c00000000  aINDdLYNe2008/08/22  aNon-US 7aarticle03040naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072000900135072000900144100001700153245018500170300001700355500002400372500002300396500001500419520128100434650002201715650002601737650001101763650001201774650001701786650001501803650003201818650002101850650002501871650002201896650002501918650002501943651001301968653002001981653002102001653002202022653002102044653002402065653001902089700001602108700001702124700001902141700001702160773013202177852000902309856007502318930003302393945002502426946001102451655001202462IND4408889920221120180143.0080814e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440888992DNAL7 a10.1139/X07-2182doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aK0011 aIshiyama, H.10aDemographic history and interspecific hybridization of four Shorea species (Dipterocarpaceae) from Peninsular Malaysia inferred from nucleotide polymorphism in nuclear gene regions  ap. 996-1007.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-06  aShorea acuminata Dyer, Shorea curtisii Dyer ex King, Shorea leprosula Miq., and Shorea parvifolia Dyer are dominant tree species in the tropical rainforest of Peninsular Malaysia, which experienced several climatic changes during Pleistocene. To investigate the current population structure and demographic history of these species, we analyzed levels and patterns of nucleotide polymorphism of the nuclear gene region PgiC. We also used sequence data of the GapC gene region obtained in our previous study. Negative Tajima's D values observed in both investigated gene regions for S. curtisii, S. leprosula, and S. parvifolia implied that all three species have experienced population expansion events. Little to moderate levels of population differentiation in S. acuminata and S. curtisii suggested recent divergence of the investigated populations after postglacial colonization of the Peninsular Malaysia. In addition, some haplotypes were similar or identical to haplotypes of the other species. The existence of such haplotypes could be partially explained by interspecific hybridization. Indeed, we found some putative hybrid individuals. Interspecific hybridization among closely related species might have contributed to the polymorphism of the investigated species. 3asequence analysis 3atropical rain forests 3aShorea 3ahybrids 3aforest trees 3ahaplotypes 3ainterspecific hybridization 3aplant adaptation 3anucleotide sequences 3agenetic variation 3apopulation structure 3agenetic polymorphism 3aMalaysia 0aShorea curtisii 0aShorea leprosula 0aShorea parvifolia 0aShorea acuminata 0apopulation genetics 0atropical trees1 aInomata, N.1 aYamazaki, T.1 aShukor, N.A.A.1 aSzmidt, A.E.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2008 May, v. 38, no. 5 p.996-1007dNational Research Council of Canadax0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/X07-2183Available from publisher's Web site  a20080822b20080905c00000000  aINDdLYNe2008/08/22  aNon-US 7aarticle03155naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072000900135072000900144072000900153072000900162100001900171245013900190300001600329500002400345500002300369520147800392650002001870650001201890650002301902650001001925650001601935650002001951650001801971650002301989650002002012650002202032650002202054650002502076650002402101650002302125650001802148650001802166651001502184651002802199700001702227700001502244700001802259700001602277773013102293852000902424856007502433930003302508945002502541946001102566655001202577IND4408889720221120180153.0080814e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440888972DNAL7 a10.1139/X07-2452doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ100 0aL300 0aL001 0aK1001 aGillette, N.E.10aResponse of ground-dwelling spider assemblages to prescribed fire following stand structure manipulation in the southern Cascade Range  ap. 969-980.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  aWe assessed spider (Arachnida: Araneae) responses to prescribed fire following stand structure treatments in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex P. & C. Laws.) stands in the Cascade Range of California. Stands were logged or left untreated to create three levels of structural diversity. We logged one treatment to minimize old-growth characteristics (low diversity) and one to enhance old-growth characteristics (high diversity) and we used unlogged Research Natural Areas (RNAs) as old-growth, highest-diversity reference stands. We conducted low-intensity prescribed fire on half of each plot following harvest. Spider assemblages in unburned, logged stands were similar to one another but diverged from those in RNAs, with increased abundance, species richness, and diversity in more structurally diverse stands. Prescribed fire, which altered habitat in the organic soil layer where many spiders forage, resulted in altered spider assemblages and population declines in most plots. Fire generally reduced spider species richness, evenness, and diversity. Several taxa were potential indicators of fire and old-growth structure, and we discovered one species and one genus that were previously unknown. There was evidence that old-growth characteristics intensified the effects of fire on spider abundance. This outcome probably results from the deep litter layers in high-diversity stands and RNAs, which constituted greater fuel loads than low-diversity stands. 3asoil arthropods 3aAraneae 3aprescribed burning 3afires 3aburnt soils 3astand structure 3aforest stands 3aconiferous forests 3aPinus ponderosa 3aspecies diversity 3aindicator species 3apopulation structure 3apopulation dynamics 3aold-growth forests 3aforest litter 3amicrohabitats 3aCalifornia 3aCascade Mountain region1 aVetter, R.S.1 aMori, S.R.1 aRudolph, C.R.1 aWelty, D.R.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2008 May, v. 38, no. 5 p.969-980dNational Research Council of Canadax0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/X07-2453Available from publisher's Web site  a20080826b20080905c00000000  aINDdLYNe2008/08/22  aNon-US 7aarticle03099naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072000900135072000900144100001800153245011700171300001600288500002400304500002300328520141900351650001801770650002001788650002301808650002301831650002101854650001101875650002701886650001701913650001701930650002501947650001401972650002201986650002802008650002102036650002002057651001502077653004002092653001902132653002702151700001802178700001802196700001702214700001802231773013102249852000902380856007502389930003302464945002502497946001102522655001202533IND4408889420221120180148.0080814e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440888942DNAL7 a10.1139/X07-2392doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL300 0aK1001 aMaguire, C.C.10aResponse of small mammals to alternative stand structures in the mixed-conifer forest of northeastern California  ap. 943-955.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  aA common, but largely untested, strategy for maintaining forest biodiversity is to enhance stand structural complexity. A silvicultural experiment was implemented from 1996 to 1998 at Blacks Mountain Experimental Forest, California, to test the efficacy of two levels of structural diversity (high versus low) and two levels of prescribed underburning (burn versus no burn) for maintaining or restoring biodiversity. Small mammals were trapped and tagged in experimental units for 2 noncontiguous weeks in fall 2003 and 2004. Total number of captures and number of captured individuals varied by year (P < 0.002). No treatment effects were detected for all species lumped together or for the three most frequent species analyzed separately (Tamias amoenus J.A. Allen, 1890, Peromyscus maniculatus (Wagner, 1845), and Spermophilus lateralis (Say, 1823)), with the exception that T. amoenus was captured more often in burned units in 2004 (P = 0.004 for year x burn interaction). Mixed-effects regression models indicated that the number of captures and captured individuals of T. amoenus and P. maniculatus decreased with increasing residual basal area of overstory trees, but opposite results were obtained for S. lateralis. After accounting for residual stand density differences, T. amoenus was captured more frequently in units of low structural diversity and S. lateralis in units of high structural diversity. 3asmall mammals 3astand structure 3aconiferous forests 3aprescribed burning 3astand management 3aTamias 3aPeromyscus maniculatus 3aSpermophilus 3aforest trees 3aspatial distribution 3aoverstory 3awildlife habitats 3asilvicultural practices 3avegetation cover 3apopulation size 3aCalifornia 0aBlacks Mountain Experimental Forest 0aTamias amoenus 0aSpermophilus lateralis1 aMaguire, D.A.1 aManning, T.E.1 aGarber, S.M.1 aRitchie, M.W.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2008 May, v. 38, no. 5 p.943-955dNational Research Council of Canadax0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/X07-2393Available from publisher's Web site  a20080826b20080905c00000000  aINDdLYNe2008/08/22  aNon-US 7aarticle02540naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072000900135072000900144072000900153100001500162245013100177300001800308500002400326500002300350500001500373520111900388650002201507650002901529650001501558650001601573650002301589650002501612650001001637650001801647650001601665650001601681650001801697650001301715653002401728700002001752773013301772852000901905856007501914930003301989945002502022946001102047655001202058IND4408890120221120180141.0080814e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440889012DNAL7 a10.1139/X07-2042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aK810 0aX100 0aX6001 aBova, A.S.10aBeyond “fire temperatures”: calibrating thermocouple probes and modeling their response to surface fires in hardwood fuels  ap. 1008-1020.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-06  aThe maximum temperatures of thermocouples, temperature-sensitive paints, and calorimeters exposed to flames in wildland fires are often called “fire temperatures” but are determined as much by the properties and deployment of the measurement devices as by the fires themselves. Rather than report device temperatures that are not generally comparable among studies, we show that maximum and time-integrated temperatures of relatively thick (4.8 mm diameter) type-K thermocouple probes (TCPs) can be calibrated to estimate fuel consumption and fire line intensity in surface fires. Although reporting standard fire characteristics is an improvement over reporting device temperatures, TCPs are not ideal instruments for monitoring surface fires, because they provide only point estimates of fire behavior and must be calibrated for different fire environments, TCP characteristics, and deployments. To illustrate how TCPs respond to fires and to point the way towards a more general calibration method, we report results from a numerical model that accurately simulated TCP response to a spreading surface fire. 3asimulation models 3awildland fire management 3amonitoring 3acalibration 3aprobes (equipment) 3afuels (fire ecology) 3afires 3athermocouples 3atemperature 3ameasurement 3aheat transfer 3aaccuracy 0amathematical models1 aDickinson, M.B.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2008 May, v. 38, no. 5 p.1008-1020dNational Research Council of Canadax0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/X07-2043Available from publisher's Web site  a20080822b20080905c00000000  aINDdLYNe2008/08/22  aNon-US 7aarticle03752naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110024003300130040001800163100001700181245005800198300001800256500001500274506007600289520165700365506003702022650002102059650001202080650001402092650002502106650002202131650003002153650001202183650001802195650002402213650001202237650001802249650002802267650002302295650002502318650001102343650003002354650001802384650003102402650001702433650000902450650002802459650003102487653001302518653002602531653002102557653002802578653001802606653001402624653002502638653001302663653002102676700001702697700001402714700002102728773014202749852000902891856008302900930003302983945001303016946001303029655001203042IND2061230220221207083746.0980113e19970805dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206123022DNAL7 a92380292pmid7 aPMC230542pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.94.16.86342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerris, P.J.10aRapid evolution of sex-related genes in Chlamydomonas  ap. 8634-8639.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBiological speciation ultimately results in prezygotic isolation--the inability of incipient species to mate with one another--but little is understood about the selection pressures and genetic changes that generate this outcome. The genus Chlamydomonas comprises numerous species of unicellular green algae, including numerous geographic isolates of the species C. reinhardtii. This diverse collection has allowed us to analyze the evolution of two sex-related genes: the mid gene of C. reinhardtii, which determines whether a gamete is mating-type plus or minus, and the fus1 gene, which dictates a cell surface glycoprotein utilized by C. reinhardtii plus gametes to recognize minus gametes. Low stringency Southern analyses failed to detect any fus1 homologs in other Chlamydomonas species and detected only one mid homolog, documenting that both genes have diverged extensively during the evolution of the lineage. The one mid homolog was found in C. incerta, the species in culture that is most closely related to C. reinhardtii. Its mid gene carries numerous nonsynonymous and synonymous codon changes compared with the C. reinhardtii mid gene, in contrast, very high sequence conservation of both the mid and fus1 sequences is found in natural isolates of C. reinhardtii, indicating that the genes are not free to drift within a species but do diverge dramatically between species. Striking divergence of sex determination and mate recognition genes also has been encountered in a number of other eukaryotic phyla, suggesting that unique, and as yet unidentified, selection pressures act on these classes of genes during the speciation process.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3astructural genes 3atubulin 3aevolution 3aamino acid sequences 3asex determination 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3aintrons 3aglycoproteins 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aChlamydomonasxgenetics 2aConserved Sequence 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aFemale 2aFungal Proteinsxgenetics 2aGenes, Fungal 2aGenes, Mating Type, Fungal 2aGenes, Plant 2aMale 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aSex Determination Analysis 0aproteins 0achlamydomonas incerta 0agenbank/af001379 0amolecular sequence data 0aChlamydomonas 0afus1 gene 0anucleotide sequences 0amid gene 0agenbank/af0027101 aPavlovic, C.1 aFabry, S.1 aGoodenough, U.W.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1997 Aug. 5, v. 94, no. 16 p.8634-8639x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.94.16.86343Available from publisher's Web site  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03438naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001600149245016000165300001600325520181400341650001602155650001502171650001302186650001302199650001802212650001202230650003902242650002402281650000902305650001402314650002002328650005202348650004602400650004402446650004302490650001702533650004102550650004002591650001402631653001302645653002902658700001702687700001902704700001702723700001602740773009702756852000902853939003302862946001302895655001202908IND9202772020221120160452.0920506e199202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920277202DNAL7 a13099222pmid7 aPMC2407972pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlsen, C.W.10aMonoclonal antibodies to the spike protein of feline infectious peritonitis virus mediate antibody-dependent enhancement of infection of feline macrophages  ap. 956-965.  aAntibody-dependent enhancement of virus infection is a process whereby virus-antibody complexes initiate infection of cells via Fc receptor-mediated endocytosis. We sought to investigate antibody-dependent enhancement of feline infectious peritonitis virus infection of primary feline peritoneal macrophages in vitro. Enhancement of infection was assessed, after indirect immunofluorescent-antibody labelling of infected cells, by determining the ratio between the number of cells infected in the presence and absence of virus-specific antibody. infection enhancement was initially demonstrated by using heat-inactivated, virus-specific feline antiserum. Functional compatibility between murine immunoglobulin molecules and feline Fc receptors was demonstrated by using murine anti-sheep erythrocyte serum and an antibody-coated sheep erythrocyte phagocytosis assay. Thirty-seven murine monoclonal antibodies specific for the nucleocapsid, membrane, or spike proteins of feline infectious peritonitis virus or transmissible gastroenteritis virus were assayed for their ability to enhance the infectivity of feline infectious peritonitis virus. Infection enhancement was mediated by a subset of spike protein-specific monoclonal antibodies. A distinct correlation was seen between the ability of a monoclonal antibody to cause virus neutralization in a routine cell culture neutralization assay and its ability to mediate infection enhancement of macrophages. Infection enhancement was shown to be Fe receptor mediated by blockade of antibody-Fc receptor interaction using staphylococcal protein A. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that antibody-dependent enhancement of feline infectious peritonitis virus infectivity is mediated by antibody directed against specific sites on the spike protein. 3amacrophages 3aantibodies 3aepitopes 3aproteins 3apathogenicity 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Monoclonalximmunology 2aAscitesximmunology 2aCats 2aCell Line 2aCells, Cultured 2aCoronavirus, Felineximmunologyxpathogenicity. 2aFeline Infectious Peritonitisximmunology 2aImmunoglobulin Fc Fragmentsximmunology 2aMacrophagesximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aPhagocytosis 2aStaphylococcal Protein Aximmunology 2aViral Envelope Proteinsximmunology 2aVirulence 0ain vitro 0afeline peritonitis virus1 aCorapi, W.V.1 aNgichabe, C.K.1 aBaines, J.D.1 aScott, F.W.0 tJournal of virology.g1992 Feb., v. 66, no. 2 p.956-965wJournal:J000001378x0022-538X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02060naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001300149245009500162300001800257520074900275650003201024650001701056650001801073650001201091650002701103650003001130650006401160650006901224650001801293650005401311650002501365650002301390650001001413700001401423700001901437700002001456700001601476773007901492852000901571939003301580946001301613655001201626IND9202772520221120160509.0920506e199202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920277252DNAL7 a17310952pmid7 aPMC2408212pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSusa, M.10aPathogenesis of classical swine fever: B-lymphocyte deficiency caused by hog cholera virus  ap. 1171-1175.  aHog cholera, also known as classical or European swine fever, is caused by hog cholera virus, a member of the genus Pestivirus. It is shown here that the end stage of lethal infection in the natural host is associated with a dramatic depletion preferentially of B lymphocytes in the circulatory system as well as in lymphoid tissues. Already at the onset of disease, viral replication in lymphoid tissues demarcates the germinal centers, and the viral genome remains localized to that site as the disease progresses even after morphologic disintegration of the follicular structure. A block in B-lymphocyte maturation by infection and destruction of germinal centers is discussed as a key event in the pathogenesis of acute, lethal hog cholera. 3aClassical swine fever virus 3apathogenesis 3aB-lymphocytes 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Monoclonal 2aB-Lymphocytesximmunology 2aClassical Swine Feverximmunologyxmicrobiologyxpathology. 2aClassical Swine Fever Virusxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aGenome, Viral 2aLymph Nodesximmunologyxmicrobiologyxpathology. 2aLymphocyte Depletion 2aSpleenximmunology 2aSwine1 aKonig, M.1 aSaalmuller, A.1 aReddehase, M.J.1 aThiel, H.J.0 tJournal of virology.g1992 Feb., v. 66, no. 2 p.1171-1175x0022-538X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03266naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100002200149245017400171300001800345520128900363650000901652650003401661650001101695650000801706650001601714650001801730650002501748650002401773650001201797650002301809650003001832650000901862650001401871650002301885650005201908650007201960650008402032650002802116650005202144650002402196650003602220650001702256650003802273650002202311653002802333653001902361653001902380653001702399700001302416700002202429700001502451700002402466700001602490773007902506852000902585939003302594946001302627655001202640IND9202772420221120160441.0920506e199202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920277242DNAL7 a13098912pmid7 aPMC2408132pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSiebelink, K.H.J.10aIsolation and partial characterization of infectious molecular clones of feline immunodeficiency virus obtained directly from bone marrow DNA of a naturally infected cat  ap. 1091-1097.  aReplication-competent molecular clones of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) were isolated directly from the DNA of bone marrow cells of a naturally FIV-infected cat. After transfection in a feline kidney cell line (CrFK) and subsequent cocultivation with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), the viral progeny of the clones was infectious for PBMC but not for CRFK cells. PBMC infected with these clones showed syncytium formation, a decrease in cell viability, and gradual loss of CD4+ cells. The restriction maps of these clones differed from those obtained for previously described molecular clones of FIV derived from cats in the United States. The predicted amino acid sequence similarity of the envelope genes of the two clones was 99.3%, whereas the similarities of the sequences of the clones to those of two molecular clones from the United States, Petaluma and PPR, were 86 and 88%, respectively. Most of the differences between the amino acid sequences of the two clones and those of the clones from the United States were found in five different hypervariable (HV) regions, Hv-l through HV-5. The viral progeny of one of these clones was inoculated into two specific-pathogen-free cats. The animals seroconverted, and the virus could be reisolated from their PBMC. 3acats 3aFeline immunodeficiency virus 3aclones 3aDNA 3abone marrow 3apathogenicity 3aamino acid sequences 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBlotting, Southern 2aBone Marrowxmicrobiology 2aCats 2aCell Line 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Viralxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aFeline Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndromexmicrobiologyxpathology. 2aImmunodeficiency Virus, Felinexgeneticsxisolation & purificationxphysiology. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aProvirusesxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aRestriction Mapping 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 2aTransfection 2aViral Envelope Proteinsxgenetics 2aVirus Replication 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/m73964 0agenbank/m73965 0acd4 molecule1 aChu, Ih.1 aRimmelzwaan, G.F.1 aWeijer, K.1 aOsterhaus, A.D.M.E.1 aBosch, M.L.0 tJournal of virology.g1992 Feb., v. 66, no. 2 p.1091-1097x0022-538X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03671naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110024003300130040001800163100001400181245010700195300001800302506007600320520154000396506003701936650002801973650001902001650001502020650001802035650001002053650001802063650002202081650002102103650001002124650001302134650001902147650001202166650002002178650001202198650003402210650002702244650002402271650004002295650001302335650002802348650002602376650002402402650001302426650001002439650002702449650002302476650006502499650002802564653001402592700001302606700001402619700001602633700001702649700001402666773014202680852000902822856008302831930003302914945001302947946001302960655001202973IND2060224520221207100419.0971022e19970527dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206022452DNAL7 a91591712pmid7 aPMC208772pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.94.11.58942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArnon, A.10aCalmodulin regulation of light adaptation and store-operated dark current in Drosophila photoreceptors  ap. 5894-5899.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPhototransduction in Drosophila occurs through inositol lipid signaling that results in Ca(2+) mobilization. In this system, we investigate the hitherto unknown physiological roles of calmodulin (CaM) in light adaptation and in regulation of the inward current that is brought about by depletion of cellular Ca(2+) stores. To see the effects of a decreased Ca-CaM content in photoreceptor cells, we used several methods. Transgenic Drosophila P[ninaC deltaB] flies, which have CaM-deficient photoreceptors, were studied. The peptide inhibitor M5, which binds to Ca-CaM and prevents its action, was applied. A Ca(2+)-free medium, which prevents Ca(2+) influx and thereby diminishes the generation of Ca-CaM, was used. The decrease in the Ca-CaM level caused the following effects. (i) Fluorescence of Ca(2+) indicator revealed an enhanced light-induced Ca(2+) release from internal stores. (ii) Measurements of the light-induced current in P[ninaC deltaB] cells showed a reduced light adaptation. (iii) Internal dialysis of M5 initially enhanced excitation and subsequently disrupted the light-induced current. (iv) An inward dark current appeared after depletion of the Ca(2+) stores with ryanodine and caffeine. Importantly, application of Ca-CaM into the photoreceptor cells prevented all of the above effects. We propose that negative feedback of Ca-CaM on Ca(2+) release from ryanodine-sensitive stores mediates light adaptation, is essential for light excitation, and keeps the store-operated inward current under a tight control.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aphotoreceptors 3acalmodulin 3acytochemistry 3alight 3acompound eyes 3aelectrophysiology 3aelectric current 3adrugs 3acaffeine 3ainorganic ions 3acalcium 2aAcclimatization 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Genetically Modified 2aCaffeinexpharmacology 2aCalciumxmetabolism 2aCalmodulinxdeficiencyxmetabolism. 2aDarkness 2aDrosophila melanogaster 2aHeparinxpharmacology 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aKinetics 2aLight 2aPatch-Clamp Techniques 2aPhotic Stimulation 2aPhotoreceptor Cells, Invertebratexdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aRyanodinexpharmacology 0aryanodine1 aCook, B.1 aGillo, B.1 aMontell, C.1 aSelinger, Z.1 aMinke, B.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1997 May 27, v. 94, no. 11 p.5894-5899x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.94.11.58943Available from publisher's Web site  a19971102b19971106c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03250naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001900129245005700148300001800205500002400223520180200247650002802049650001102077650001402088650001802102650001402120650001502134650001002149650002802159650001202187650001102199650001302210650001302223650001502236650001002251650000902261650002102270650002802291650001702319650002302336650002402359650001102383650002402394650001102418650000902429650001602438650002402454700002102478700001802499700002502517700001902542773011402561852000902675655001202684IND4466765320221120035113.0130429s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446676532DNAL7 a126729172pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWolf, Bryan W.10aPullulan Is a Slowly Digested Carbohydrate in Humans  ap. 1051-1055.  aIncludes references  aPullulan is an extracellular polysaccharide excreted by the fungus Aureobasidium pullulans. To evaluate the glycemic and breath hydrogen responses and gastrointestinal tolerance to pullulan, nondiabetic healthy adult subjects (n = 28) were studied in a randomized, double-masked, crossover design. After an overnight fast, subjects consumed beverages containing 50 g of carbohydrate from either maltodextrin (control) or pullulan. Capillary blood glucose response was determined for 180 min postprandially. Breath hydrogen response was determined for 8 h postprandially. Compared with control, incremental peak blood glucose concentration was reduced (P < 0.01) when subjects consumed pullulan (4.24 ± 0.35 vs. 1.97 ± 0.10 mmol/L). In addition, pullulan reduced (P < 0.01) the positive incremental area under the glucose curve by 50%. When subjects consumed pullulan, the incremental blood glucose excursions were reduced (P < 0.01) at 15, 30, 45, 60 and 90 min, but were maintained above basal glucose concentrations at 150 and 180 min. At 180 min, the blood glucose concentration was higher (P < 0.05) when subjects consumed pullulan compared with control, supporting the hypothesis that pullulan is digested slowly. Breath hydrogen concentrations were increased (P < 0.01) at 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 h postprandially when subjects consumed pullulan. In the first 24-h postprandial period, the frequency and intensity of flatulence was higher (P < 0.05) after subjects consumed pullulan compared with control. In conclusion, pullulan attenuated the postprandial glycemic excursion compared with an equivalent maltodextrin challenge. Pullulan also increased breath hydrogen excretion and the incidence of gastrointestinal intolerance symptoms, indicating that a portion of pullulan was malabsorbed. 3aAureobasidium pullulans 3aadults 3abeverages 3ablood glucose 3aexcretion 3aflatulence 3afungi 3agastrointestinal system 3aglucose 3ahumans 3ahydrogen 3apullulan 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAged 2aArea Under Curve 2aBlood Glucosexanalysis 2aBreath Tests 2aCross-Over Studies 2aDouble-Blind Method 2aFemale 2aGlucansxmetabolism 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPostprandial Period1 aGarleb, Keith A.1 aChoe, Yong S.1 aHumphrey, Phillip M.1 aMaki, Kevin C.0 tJournal of nutrition.g2003 Apr., v. 133, no. 4 p.1051-1055dAmerican Institute of Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03321naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110024003300130040001800163100001800181245010700199300001800306500001500324506007600339520103000415506003701445650002301482650001801505650002801523650001801551650001401569650001601583650002501599650001901624650003201643650001401675650001201689650001801701650002001719650001401739650001201753650002101765650006101786650001401847650002301861650002601884650001701910650002501927650003401952650001301986650001001999650004302009650001202052650001102064650003702075650001502112650001702127653001902144653002502163653001102188700001502199700002102214700001602235700001802251773014302269852000902412856008302421930003302504945001302537946001302550655001202563IND2060519520221207100414.0971113e19970610dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206051952DNAL7 a91771592pmid7 aPMC209912pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.94.12.60072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBonning, B.C.10aDisruption of lysosomal targeting is associated with insecticidal potency of juvenile hormone esterase  ap. 6007-6012.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aJuvenile hormone esterase (JHE; EC 3.1.1.1), which is intrinsically involved in regulation of development of some insect larvae, is rapidly removed from the hemolymph by the pericardial cells. Lys-29 and Lys-524, which are implicated in the degradation of JHE, were mutated to Arg. Neither the half-life of the modified JHE in the hemolymph nor the catalytic parameters were changed significantly, but when combined, these mutations resulted in apparent failure of lysosomal targeting in the pericardial cell complex. A hypothesis for the mechanism of reduced efficiency of lysosomal targeting is presented. Infection of larvae with a recombinant baculovirus expressing the modified JHE resulted in a 50% reduction in feeding damage compared with larvae infected with the wild-type virus, thus demonstrating improved properties as a biological insecticide. These data demonstrate that alteration of specific residues of JHE that disrupted lysosomal targeting, dramatically increased the insecticidal activity of this protein.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aviral insecticides 3aManduca sexta 3ainsecticidal properties 3aBaculoviridae 3alysosomes 3amutagenesis 3arecombinant proteins 3aLactuca sativa 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3abioassays 3amutants 3acytochemistry 3aenzyme activity 3ainfection 2aAnimals 2aBiological Assay 2aCarboxylic Ester Hydrolasesxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aCell Line 2aCloning, Molecular 2aHemolymphxenzymology 2aInsecticides 2aInsectaxphysiology. 2aJuvenile Hormonesxphysiology 2aKinetics 2aLarva 2aLysosomesxenzymologyxultrastructure. 2aManduca 2aPlants 2aRecombinant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aSpodoptera 2aTransfection 0afeeding damage 0aNucleopolyhedrovirus 0adamage1 aWard, V.K.1 aVan Meer, M.M.M.1 aBooth, T.F.1 aHammock, B.D.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1997 June 10, v. 94, no. 12 p.6007-6012x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.94.12.60073Available from publisher's Web site  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle04064naa a2200841 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110024003300130040001800163100001300181245009900194300001800293500001500311506007600326520142500402506003701827650002601864650001201890650000901902650001701911650001401928650002001942650002501962650001201987650001701999650002402016650003002040650002102070650001802091650002402109650001802133650002302151650002302174650001602197650004902213650002002262650001802282650002302300650004402323650002802367650003102395650002402426650004902450650002402499650002602523650002902549650006002578650003602638650001702674653001602691653001802707653002802725653001602753653001202769653002502781653001902806653001502825700001302840700001502853700001502868700001802883700001602901773014202917852000903059856008303068930003303151945001303184946001303197655001203210IND2060224320221207100427.0971022e19970527dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206022432DNAL7 a91591692pmid7 aPMC208752pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.94.11.58822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAn, Z.Q.14aThe second finger of Urbs1 is required for iron-mediated repression of sid1 in Ustilago maydis  ap. 5882-5887.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe urbs1 gene encodes a transcriptional regulator of siderophore biosynthesis in Ustilago maydis. Biological and DNA-binding activities of the two putative zinc-finger motifs of Urbs1 were studied by analyzing mutants containing altered finger domains. The mutated urbs1 alleles from three previously described N'-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (NTG) mutants were mapped and cloned by a gap-repair procedure. Sequence analyses revealed single amino acid substitutions in two of the NTG mutants. Both mutations (G-507 to D in urbs1-1 and P-491 to L in urbs1-3), which are located in the Urbs1 C-terminal finger domain, reduced DNA-binding activity by 10-fold and were sufficient to confer a urbs1-minus phenotype. The third NTG urbs1 mutant (urbs1-2) also contained a mutation in one of the conserved amino acids (P-518 to S) in the C-terminal finger domain, but this mutation alone was not sufficient to confer a urbs1-minus phenotype. A second frame shift mutation was identified in urbs1-2 and is necessary for the urbs1-minus phenotype. In an analysis of the function of the N-terminal finger of Urbs1, the conserved amino acid Arg-350 was mutated to leucine. A Urbs1 protein with this mutation complemented a urbs1 null mutant strain. By contrast, a similar mutation in the C-terminal domain abolished the ability of Urbs1 to regulate siderophore biosynthesis and greatly reduced its ability to bind target DNA.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3atranscription factors 3aalleles 3aloci 3abiosynthesis 3aphenotype 3aregulator genes 3aamino acid sequences 3amutants 3asiderophores 3aDNA-binding domains 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3apromoter regions 3aUstilago zeae 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aConserved Sequence 2aDNA Primers 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aFungal Proteins 2aGenes, Fungal 2aIronxpharmacology 2aMixed Function Oxygenasesxbiosynthesis 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutagenesis, Site-Directed 2aOpen Reading Frames 2aRecombinant Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aRestriction Mapping 2aSequence Tagged Sites 2aSiderophoresxmetabolism 2aTranscription Factorsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aUstilagoxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aZinc Fingers 0aurbs1 locus 0asid1 promoter 0amolecular sequence data 0amutagenesis 0abinding 0anucleotide sequences 0agenbank/l54058 0aurbs1 gene1 aZhao, Q.1 aMcEvoy, J.1 aYuan, W.M.1 aMarkley, J.L.1 aLeong, S.A.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1997 May 27, v. 94, no. 11 p.5882-5887x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.94.11.58823Available from publisher's Web site  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02943naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072000900165100001500174245012000189300001600309500002400325500001500349520109100364650002101455650002201476650000901498650002301507650001901530650001901549650002001568650001101588650001701599650001201616650004801628650002801676650004001704650002301744650003701767650004401804650006801848653002101916653001701937653002301954653002701977653004402004700001802048700001802066700001802084773008702102852000902189856008602198930003302284945002502317946001102342655001202353IND4408878520221117160610.0080814e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440887852DNAL7 a174938512pmid7 a10.1016/j.tvjl.2007.03.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8401 aGoff, L.M.10aStructural and biomechanical aspects of equine sacroiliac joint function and their relationship to clinical disease  ap. 281-293.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPain originating from the sacroiliac joint (SIJ) in horses has long been associated with poor performance, yet specific diagnosis of sacroiliac dysfunction (SID) has been difficult to achieve. Clinical presentation of SID appears to fall into two categories. The first, presenting as pain and poor performance, is responsive to local analgesia of periarticular structures with poorly defined pathology. The second presents primarily as poor performance with bony pathological changes as a result of chronic instability. Diagnostic tests based on biomechanics as well as manual provocation for SIJ pain have formed the basis of tests currently used to diagnose SIJ dysfunction in humans. This review summarises the anatomy and biomechanics of the equine SIJ and current biomechanical, innervation and motor control concepts in human SID. The relationship between abnormal SIJ motion and altered neuromotor control with clinical disease of the equine SIJ are discussed. Future utilisation of these principles to develop new diagnostic and management tools for the equine SID is promising. 3aanimal pathology 3adisease diagnosis 3apain 3aanimal performance 3ajoint diseases 3ahorse diseases 3ajoints (animal) 3ahorses 3asacral spine 2aAnimals 2aArthralgiaxpathologyxtherapyxveterinary. 2aBiomechanical Phenomena 2aHorse Diseasesxpathologyxtherapy. 2aHorsesxphysiology 2aPhysical Examinationxveterinary 2aPhysical Therapy Modalitiesxveterinary 2aSacroiliac Jointxanatomy & histologyxinnervationxphysiology. 0asacroiliac joint 0abiomechanics 0aliterature reviews 0asacroiliac dysfunction 0asigns and symptoms (animals and humans)1 aJefcott, L.B.1 aJasiewicz, J.1 aMcGowan, C.M.0 tVeterinary journal.g2008 June, v. 176, no. 3 p.281-293dHarcourtx1090-02337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2007.03.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20081008b20081101c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/09/15  aNon-US 7aarticle02837naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072001700146072001700163072001700180100001600197245008900213300001600302500002400318500001500342520115500357650001401512650001301526650001801539650001501557650003101572650002201603650000801625650003001633650000901663650001501672650002301687650001101710650002101721650001601742650001701758651001401775651001101789653003501800653000801835653001801843653002001861700001801881700001801899773011501917852000902032856008602041856004902127930003302176945002502209946001302234655001202247IND4408858620221117160547.0080812e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440885862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfca.2008.04.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In 2008, GM maize line MON810 was approved for commercialization in Brazil; nevertheless, maize Bt11, Bt176 and MON810 were found in Brazilian market products sold in 2000 and 2001. Nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was employed to monitor the presence of MON810 in 81 maize-derived products (maize flour, corn meal, maize flour flakes and polenta) that are sold in Brazilian markets from 2005 to 2007, after the implementation of genetically modified organism (GMO) labeling regulation. The sensitivity of nested PCR for MON810 detection was 0.1%. CTAB protocol was suitable for the extraction of amplifiable maize DNA from maize flour, corn meal, maize flour flakes, and polenta. MON810 GM maize line was not detected by specific nested PCR in 81 samples of maize-derived food sold in Brazil from 2005 to 2007. This paper reports data concerning the detection of GM maize after publishing Brazilian regulations that stipulate directions for using and labeling of foods and ingredients containing GMOs. 3acorn meal 3aZea mays 3afood labeling 3atransgenes 3agenetically modified foods 3atransgenic plants 3aDNA 3apolymerase chain reaction 3acorn 3acorn flour 3afood biotechnology 3aflakes 3afood composition 3afood safety 3atraceability 3aArgentina 3aBrazil 0agenetically modified organisms 0aGMO 0acorn products 0aquality control1 aMelo, J.E. de1 aArisi, A.C.M.0 tSubtropical plant science.g2008 Sept., v. 21, no. 6 p.515-518dAcademic PresswJournal:20855x0485-20447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfca.2008.04.0083Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfca.2008.04.008  a20080905b20081011c00000000  aINDdPNNe2008/09/05  aOther US 7aarticle03197naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072000900165072000900174100002100183245007900204300001600283500002400299520142800323650000901751650000901760650000901769650001401778650002101792650001501813650001101828650002301839650001901862650001201881650002101893650003301914650002801947650004301975650003802018650003702056650004302093650004502136650003002181650004302211653002802254653002102282700001402303700002302317700001602340773008702356852000902443856008602452930003302538945002502571946001102596655001202607IND4408879020221117160530.0080814e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440887902DNAL7 a175000172pmid7 a10.1016/j.tvjl.2007.03.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL400 0aL6001 aWolschrijn, C.F.10aCartilage canals in the medial coronoid process of young Golden Retrievers  ap. 333-337.  aIncludes references  aThe aim of the study was to establish the location of cartilage canals in the medial coronoid process (MCP) of the ulna of young Golden Retrievers, a breed that is predisposed to fractures of the medial coronoid process (FMCP). To determine whether the presence of cartilage canals could be associated with the predilection site of FMCP, the right elbows of nine young Golden Retrievers (aged 4, 6, 8, 10, 13, 16, 18, 22 and 24 weeks) were dissected and, with no prior decalcification, the formaldehyde-fixed MCPs were embedded in methylmethacrylate. The entire MCPs were serially sectioned in the frontal plane from cranial to caudal and the sections (5 μm) were routinely stained. Between the ages of 5 and 10 weeks, three main cartilage canals were visible -- medial, central and lateral. All originated from the periosteum of the distal parts of the MCP and ended proximally under the articular cartilage. Branches of the main canals were seen more cranially and caudally. At the age of 13 weeks, the central canal was absent, and the remaining canals showed a smaller diameter. From 16 weeks onwards, no cartilage canals were seen. No direct relationship could be established between the predilection site of FMCP (lateral part of the MCP) and the presence/absence of cartilage canals, since both medial and lateral canals disappeared at the same age. Further research is needed to elucidate the pathogenesis of FMCP. 3adogs 3apets 3aulna 3acartilage 3aGolden Retriever 3aanimal age 3aelbows 3aanimal development 3abone formation 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Newborn 2aBone Developmentxphysiology 2aDog Diseasesxpathology 2aDogsxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aGenetic Predisposition to Disease 2aImmunohistochemistryxveterinary 2aJoint Diseasesxpathologyxveterinary. 2aJointsxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aSeverity of Illness Index 2aUlnaxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 0amedial coronoid process 0acartilage canals1 aGruys, E.1 aWiel, C.W. van der1 aWeijs, W.A.0 tVeterinary journal.g2008 June, v. 176, no. 3 p.333-337dHarcourtx1090-02337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2007.03.0123Available from publisher's Web site  a20081008b20081101c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/09/15  aNon-US 7aarticle03832naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072000900165100002400174245005100198300001600249500002400265500001500289520147100304650001501775650003101790650002001821650001301841650002001854650001201874650000801886650002201894650002301916650001401939650001401953650000901967650001401976650001401990650002002004650000902024650002202033650001902055650001602074650002402090650002702114650004402141650001202185650003502197650006802232650000902300650001102309650003102320650005602351650003402407650000902441650003502450650007402485650003202559650002202591653002302613653003102636653001802667700002002685700001402705700001702719700001502736700002402751773008702775852000902862856008602871930003302957945002502990946001103015655001203026IND4408878620221123035752.0080814e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440887862DNAL7 a175127662pmid7 a10.1016/j.tvjl.2007.02.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8221 aVan der Merwe, L.L.10aSpirocerca lupi infection in the dog: A review  ap. 294-309.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSpirocercosis is a disease occurring predominantly in Canidae, caused by the nematode Spirocerca lupi. Typical clinical signs are regurgitation, vomiting and dyspnoea. The life-cycle involves an intermediate (coprophagous beetle) and a variety of paratenic hosts. Larvae follow a specific migratory route, penetrating the gastric mucosa of the host, migrating along arteries, maturing in the thoracic aorta before eventually moving to the caudal oesophagus. Here the worm lives in nodules and passes larvated eggs which can be detected using zinc sulphate faecal flotation. Histologically, the mature oesophageal nodule is composed mostly of actively dividing fibroblasts. Spirocerca lupi-associated oesophageal sarcomas may occur and damage to the aorta results in aneurysms. A pathognomonic lesion for spirocercosis is spondylitis of the thoracic vertebrae. Primary radiological lesions include an oesophageal mass, usually in the terminal oesophagus, spondylitis, and undulation of the aortic border. Contrast radiography and computed tomography are helpful additional emerging modalities. Oesophageal endoscopy has a greater diagnostic sensitivity than radiography. Endoscopic biopsies are not sensitive for detecting neoplastic transformation. Doramectin is the current drug of choice, effectively killing adult worms and decreasing egg shedding. Early diagnosis of infection is still a challenge and to date no ideal regimen for prophylaxis has been published. 3adoramectin 3agastrointestinal nematodes 3anematode larvae 3aarteries 3aSpirocerca lupi 3asarcoma 3aova 3aalternative hosts 3aintermediate hosts 3aradiology 3ahistology 3adogs 3aendoscopy 3aesophagus 3afecal egg count 3apets 3adisease diagnosis 3agastric mucosa 3afibroblasts 3acomputed tomography 3alife cycle (organisms) 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 2aAnimals 2aAnthelminticsxtherapeutic use 2aDog Diseasesxdiagnosisxdrug therapyxparasitologyxpathology. 2aDogs 2aFemale 2aHost-Parasite Interactions 2aIvermectinxanalogs & derivativesxtherapeutic use. 2aLife Cycle Stagesxphysiology 2aMale 2aParasite Egg Countxveterinary 2aSpirurida Infectionsxdiagnosisxparasitologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aThelazioideaxpathogenicity 2aTreatment Outcome 0aliterature reviews 0aanimal parasitic nematodes 0aspirocercosis1 aKirberger, R.M.1 aClift, S.1 aWilliams, M.1 aKeller, N.1 aNaidoo, Vijayndren.0 tVeterinary journal.g2008 June, v. 176, no. 3 p.294-309dHarcourtx1090-02337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2007.02.0323Available from publisher's Web site  a20081008b20081101c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/09/15  aNon-US 7aarticle03182naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100001300181245015400194300001800348500002400366506007600390520167900466506003702145650002602182650001302208650001402221650002502235650001002260650002002270650001402290650001602304650001102320650001802331650001702349650002502366700001202391700001402403700001402417700001302431700001802444700001302462773013602475852000902611856008002620655001202700IND4437391820221207113509.0100522e20100601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443739182DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.02964-092doi7 aPMC28764582pmcid7 a204005692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Dong10aAntibiotic Resistance Characteristics of Environmental Bacteria from an Oxytetracycline Production Wastewater Treatment Plant and the Receiving River  ap. 3444-3451.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe characterized the bacterial populations in surface water receiving effluent from an oxytetracycline (OTC) production plant. Additional sampling sites included the receiving river water 5 km upstream and 20 km downstream from the discharge point. High levels of OTC were found in the wastewater (WW), and the antibiotic was still detectable in river water downstream (RWD), with undetectable levels in river water upstream (RWU). A total of 341 bacterial strains were isolated using nonselective media, with the majority being identified as GAMMAPROTEOBACTERIA: The MICs were determined for 10 antibiotics representing seven different classes of antibiotics, and the corresponding values were significantly higher for the WW and RWD isolates than for the RWU isolates. Almost all bacteria (97%) from the WW and RWD samples demonstrated multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotypes, while in RWU samples, these were less frequent (28%). The WW and RWD isolates were analyzed for the presence of 23 tetracycline (tet) resistance genes. The majority of isolates (94.2% and 95.4% in WW and RWD, respectively) harbored the corresponding genes, with tet(A) being the most common (67.0%), followed by tet(W), tet(C), tet(J), tet(L), tet(D), tet(Y), and tet(K) (in the range between 21.0% and 40.6%). Class I integrons were detected in the majority of WW and RWD isolates (97.4% and 86.2%, respectively) but were not associated with the tet genes. We hypothesize that the strong selective pressure imposed by a high concentration of OTC contributes to the wide dissemination of tetracycline resistance genes and other antibiotic resistance genes, possibly through mobile genetic elements.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteria 3aeffluents 3agamma-Proteobacteria 3agenes 3aoxytetracycline 3aphenotype 3ariver water 3arivers 3asurface water 3atetracycline 3awastewater treatment1 aYu, Tao1 aZhang, Yu1 aYang, Min1 aLi, Zhen1 aLiu, Miaomiao1 aQi, Rong0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2010 June 1, v. 76, no. 11 p.3444-3451dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.02964-093Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02864naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072001700146100001900163245011500182300001600297500002400313500001500337520122600352650002101578650001001599650001801609650002001627650001501647650002101662650001201683650001501695650002001710650001501730650002101745650002201766650001101788651002001799651001101819653002001830653002501850653002701875700001601902700001201918700001501930700001701945773013301962852000902095856008602104856004902190930003302239945002502272946001302297655001202310IND4408857620221123035820.0080812e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440885762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfca.2008.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In conjunction with a larger study associated with the Northern Contaminants Program, traditional food items most frequently consumed in Inuit, Dene/Metis and Yukon First Nations communities of the Canadian North, were identified following a large-scale dietary assessment that included monitoring and collection of traditional and market foods in five regions of the Canadian North. Fifty out of 200 traditional food samples, collected as eaten, were prioritized for water-soluble vitamin analysis (folate, pyridoxine, riboflavin and niacin) based upon parameters that included frequency of consumption, lack of nutrient data and expectation of nutrient content. This paper reports on contents of selected B vitamins in the prioritized food samples, as eaten and expressed per 100 g of food sample. This is the first report of the levels of these water-soluble vitamins in many of these food sources. This study strongly suggests that traditional foods have the potential to contribute significantly to the water-soluble vitamin requirements of Northern Indigenous Peoples. 3anutrient content 3aInuit 3afood analysis 3avitamin content 3ariboflavin 3ahealth promotion 3acuisine 3apyridoxine 3anutritive value 3afolic acid 3afood composition 3atraditional foods 3aniacin 3aYukon Territory 0aCanada 0ahealth benefits 0achemical composition 0awater-soluble vitamins1 aPeace, R.W.1 aJee, P.1 aLeggee, D.1 aKuhnlein, H.0 tJournal of food composition and analysis.g2008 Sept., v. 21, no. 6 p.474-480dAcademic PresswJournal:jnl42192x0889-15757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfca.2008.04.0033Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfca.2008.04.003  a20080905b20081011c00000000  aINDdPNNe2008/09/05  aOther US 7aarticle03774naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100002200181245019600203300001800399500002400417506007600441520187300517506003702390650002102427650001302448650001602461650001402477650001702491650002802508650002102536650001502557650001502572650001402587650003002601650001002631650001202641650001802653650002902671650007402700650002202774650001302796650001402809650003902823650003902862700002502901700002302926773013402949852000903083856008003092856004803172655001203220IND4383700120221207113514.0060917e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438370012DNAL7 a169572282pmid7 aPMC15636192pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.00355-062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoldberg, Tony L.10aOptimization of Analytical Parameters for Inferring Relationships among Escherichia coli Isolates from Repetitive-Element PCR by Maximizing Correspondence with Multilocus Sequence Typing Data  ap. 6049-6052.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRepetitive-element PCR (rep-PCR) is a method for genotyping bacteria based on the selective amplification of repetitive genetic elements dispersed throughout bacterial chromosomes. The method has great potential for large-scale epidemiological studies because of its speed and simplicity; however, objective guidelines for inferring relationships among bacterial isolates from rep-PCR data are lacking. We used multilocus sequence typing (MLST) as a "gold standard" to optimize the analytical parameters for inferring relationships among Escherichia coli isolates from rep-PCR data. We chose 12 isolates from a large database to represent a wide range of pairwise genetic distances, based on the initial evaluation of their rep-PCR fingerprints. We conducted MLST with these same isolates and systematically varied the analytical parameters to maximize the correspondence between the relationships inferred from rep-PCR and those inferred from MLST. Methods that compared the shapes of densitometric profiles ("curve-based" methods) yielded consistently higher correspondence values between data types than did methods that calculated indices of similarity based on shared and different bands (maximum correspondences of 84.5% and 80.3%, respectively). Curve-based methods were also markedly more robust in accommodating variations in user-specified analytical parameter values than were "band-sharing coefficient" methods, and they enhanced the reproducibility of rep-PCR. Phylogenetic analyses of rep-PCR data yielded trees with high topological correspondence to trees based on MLST and high statistical support for major clades. These results indicate that rep-PCR yields accurate information for inferring relationships among E. coli isolates and that accuracy can be enhanced with the use of analytical methods that consider the shapes of densitometric profiles.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3abacteria 3achromosomes 3adatabases 3adensitometry 3aepidemiological studies 3agenetic distance 3agenotyping 3aguidelines 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3atrees 2aAlleles 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aEscherichia colixclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenotype 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aRepetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid1 aGillespie, Thomas R.1 aSinger, Randall S.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2006 Sept., v. 72, no. 9 p.6049-6052dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.00355-063Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aem.asm.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml 7aarticle02257naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245008600167300001600253500002400269520139700293650001301690650002401703650001701727650001201744650001501756650002401771773010801795852000901903856005501912655001201967IND4387067820221123025928.0070122e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438706782DNAL7 a10.1111/j.2006.0030-1299.15371.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Lin10aDensity compensation can cause no effect of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning  ap. 324-334.  aIncludes references  aThe role of density compensation (the decline of species density with increasing diversity), in the context of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, has not been explicitly explored. I used aquatic microbial communities containing bacterivorous consumers (protozoans and rotifers) to investigate whether competition can lead to density compensation and whether density compensation can contribute to the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. The experiment employed a nested design in which the consumer diversity gradient (0, 1, 2 or 4 species) was constructed by drawing all possible species or species combinations at each diversity level from a five-species pool. All consumer species coexisted but there was little evidence for overyielding or species dominance, suggesting weak complementarity and sampling effects. Rather, increasing number of consumer species resulted in community-wide density compensation, such that aggregate consumer biomass was unaffected by consumer diversity. Whereas culturable bacterial density declined as consumer diversity increased, total bacterial density showed no discernible response to changes in consumer diversity, a result probably due in part to heterogeneity in bacterial edibility. This study demonstrates the potential for density compensation to shape the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. 3aProtozoa 3aaquatic communities 3abiodiversity 3abiomass 3aecosystems 3apopulation dynamics0 tOikos.g2007 Feb., v. 116, no. 2 p.324-334dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl30362x0030-12997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.2006.0030-1299.15371.x 7aarticle03551naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002100129245005000150300001600200500002400216520179000240650002102030650001802051650001202069650002102081650003402102650001002136650002802146650001602174650001202190650002302202650003002225650002002255650002402275650001702299650001002316650000902326650001802335650003502353650000902388650001102397650001102408650004102419650003702460650001602497650001902513650004802532650001802580650003202598650001702630651001602647651003102663700002502694700001802719700002002737773017102757852000902928655001202937IND4368177620221123025924.0050405e200402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436817762DNAL7 a147492352pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKeinan-Boker, L.10aDietary phytoestrogens and breast cancer risk  ap. 282-288.  aIncludes references  aBackground: A high intake of phytoestrogens, particularly isoflavones, has been suggested to decrease breast cancer risk. Results from human studies are inconclusive. Objective: We investigated the association between phytoestrogen intake and breast cancer risk in a large prospective study in a Dutch population with a habitually low phytoestrogen intake. Design: The study population consisted of 15 555 women aged 49-70 y who constituted a Dutch cohort of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC: 1993-1997). Data concerning habitual dietary intake in the preceding year were obtained by using a validated food-frequency questionnaire. The content of isoflavones and lignans in relevant food items was estimated through a literature search, the use of food-composition tables, and contact with experts. Newly diagnosed breast cancer cases up to 1 January 2001 were identified through linkage with the Comprehensive Cancer Center Middle Netherlands. Hazard ratios for the disease were estimated by Cox proportional hazard analysis for quartiles of isoflavone and lignan intake. Associations were adjusted for known breast cancer risk factors and daily energy intake. Results: A total of 280 women were newly diagnosed with breast cancer during follow-up. The median daily intakes of isoflavones and lignans were 0.4 (interquartile range: 0.3-0.5) and 0.7 (0.5-0.8) mg/d, respectively. Relative to the respective lowest intake quartiles, the hazard ratios for the highest intake quartiles for isoflavones and lignans were 1.0 (95% CI: 0.7, 1.5) and 0.7 (0.5, 1.1), respectively. Tests for trend were nonsignificant. Conclusion: In Western populations, a high intake of isoflavones or mammalian lignans is not significantly related to breast cancer risk. 3abreast neoplasms 3aenergy intake 3aexperts 3afood composition 3afood frequency questionnaires 3afoods 3ahazard characterization 3aisoflavones 3alignans 3anutrient databanks 3anutrition risk assessment 3aplant estrogens 3aprospective studies 3arisk factors 3awomen 2aAged 2aAnthropometry 2aBreast Neoplasmsxepidemiology 2aDiet 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aIsoflavonesxadministration & dosage 2aLignansxadministration & dosage 2aMiddle Aged 2aPhytoestrogens 2aPlant Preparationsxadministration & dosage 2aPostmenopause 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aRisk Factors 3aNetherlands 0aNetherlandsxepidemiology.1 aSchouw, Y.T. van der1 aGrobbee, D.E.1 aPeeters, P.H.M.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2004 Feb., v. 79, no. 2 p.282-288dThe American Society for Nutrition, with the assistance of Highwire Pressx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle04349naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245006800169300001400237500002400251520304200275650001403317650001503331650002203346650001403368650001503382650000903397650000903406650001503415650001403430650002503444650001403469650002603483650002103509650001103530650001103541650001403552650002103566650001603587651001403603700002003617700002203637700002103659700002603680773009203706852000903798856004803807655001203855IND4413449220221122234300.0081205e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441344922DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-008-9583-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPauly, D.q(Daniel)10aJellyfish in ecosystems, online databases, and ecosystem models  ap. 67-85.  aIncludes references  aThere are indications that pelagic cnidarians and ctenophores ('jellyfish') have increased in abundance throughout the world, or that outbreaks are more frequent, although much uncertainty surrounds the issue, due to the scarcity of reliable baseline data. Numerous hypotheses have been proposed for the individual increases or outbreaks that are better documented, but direct experimental or manipulative studies at the ecosystem scale cannot be used for testing them. Thus, ecological modeling provides the best alternative to understand the role of jellyfish in large fisheries-based ecosystems; indeed, it is an approach consistent with new ecosystem-based fisheries management practices. Here, we provide an overview of online databases available to ecosystem modelers and discuss general aspects and shortcomings of the coverage of jellyfish in these databases. We then provide a summary of how jellyfish have been treated and parameterized by existing ecosystem models (specifically focusing on 'Ecopath with Ecosim' as a standard modeling toolset). Despite overall weaknesses in the parameterization of jellyfish in these models, interesting patterns emerge that suggest some systems, especially smaller and more structured ones, may be particularly vulnerable to long-term jellyfish biomass increase. Since jellyfish also feed on the eggs and larvae of commercially important food fish, outbreaks of jellyfish may ultimately imply a reduction in the fish biomass available to fisheries. On the other hand, jellyfish, which have been traditionally fished for human consumption in East and Southeast Asia, are now seen as a potential resource in other parts of the world, where pilot fisheries have emerged. It is also argued here that reduced predation on the benthic and pelagic stages of jellyfish, both a result of fishing, may be a strong contributing factor as well. For marine biologists specializing on jellyfish, this means that their research might become more applied. This implies that they would benefit from adopting some concepts and methods from fisheries biology and ecosystem modeling, and thus from using (and contributing to) online databases, such as SeaLifeBase and FishBase, developed to support such research. This would remedy the situation, documented here, wherein jellyfish are either infrequently included in food web models, typically constructed using the Ecopath with Ecosim software, or included as a single functional group with the characteristic of an 'average' jellyfish. Thus, jellyfish specialists could readily improve the jellyfish-related components of such models, and we show how they could do this. Also, it is suggested that when such improvement is performed, the resulting models can lead to non-intuitive inferences and hence interesting hypotheses on the roles of jellyfish in ecosystems. This is illustrated here through (a) an investigation of whether jellyfish are keystone species and (b) the identification of conditions under which (simulated) jellyfish outbreaks may occur. 3aScyphozoa 3abiologists 3acomputer software 3adatabases 3aecosystems 3aeggs 3afish 3afish feeds 3afisheries 3afisheries management 3afood webs 3afunctional properties 3akeystone species 3alarvae 3amodels 3apredation 3aresearch support 3auncertainty 3aEast Asia1 aGraham, William1 aLibralato, Simone1 aMorissette, Lyne1 aDeng Palomares, M.

The normal histological anatomy of primary, regular and irregular secondary dentine was found to be similar to that of the horse, with no tertiary dentine present. Undecalcified histology demonstrated the normal enamel histology, including the presence of enamel spindles. Scanning electron microscopy was performed on mid-tooth sections of five maxillary CT, five mandibular CT and two incisors. The ultrastructural anatomy of primary and secondary dentine, and equine enamel types-1, -2 and -3 (as described in horses) were identified in donkey teeth.

We used the terrestrial ecosystem model Century to examine relationships between carbon, nitrogen, and water dynamics. The model, run to a quasi-steady-state, shows strong correlations between carbon, water, and nitrogen fluxes that lead to equilibration of water/energy and nitrogen limitation of net primary productivity. This occurs because as the water flux increases, the potentials for carbon uptake (photosynthesis), and inputs and losses of nitrogen, all increase. As the flux of carbon increases, the amount of nitrogen that can be captured into organic matter and then recycled also increases. Because most plant-available nitrogen is derived from internal recycling, this latter process is critical to sustaining high productivity in environments where water and energy are plentiful. At steady-state, water/energy and nitrogen limitation "equilibrate," but because the water, carbon, and nitrogen cycles have different response times, inclusion of nitrogen cycling into ecosystem models adds behavior at longer time scales than in purely biophysical models. The tight correlations among nitrogen fluxes with evapotranspiration implies that either climate change or changes to nitrogen inputs (from fertilization or air pollution) will have large and long-lived effects on both productivity and nitrogen losses through hydrological and trace gas pathways. Comprehensive analyses of the role of ecosystems in the carbon cycle must consider mechanisms that arise from the interaction of the hydrological, carbon, and nutrient cycles in ecosystems.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3asimulation models 3aevapotranspiration 3awater 3aecosystems 3ahydrologic cycle 3abiogeochemical cycles 0aworld 0abiogeochemistry1 aBraswell, B.H.1 aParton, W.J.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1997 Aug. 5, v. 94, no. 16 p.8280-8283x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.94.16.82803Available from publisher's Web site  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02139naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245006100128300001600189500001500205520112000220650002301340650001201363650001501375650002201390650002601412651001001438653001601448653002801464653001501492653002401507653002601531653002901557700001701586773008401603852000901687930003301696945001301729946001101742655001201753IND2202960520221122172939.0000310s1999    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220296052DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKolavalli, S.10aFacilitating user participation in irrigation management  ap. 249-273.  a2019-12-05  aThis paper examines various factors which contribute to performance of water user associations. The capability of collective organizations such as WUAs to develop appropriate rules and to enforce them while keeping the level of conflict low is considered to be the core of organizational performance. We focus on the processes in collective organizations with greater attention to costs of working together. Four factors representing benefits and costs, the rights held by the WUAs, magnitude of expected benefits, external assistance received and leadership explain most of the differences in performance. The prospect of benefits is a necessary condition for individuals to act collectively. But it is not sufficient. Expected organizational costs need to be low. The prospect of costs being low or being absorbed by one or more individuals--either external agents or internal leaders--provides an encouraging environment. Effective internal leadership appears to be essential as it can lead to greater congruence in interests and greater possibility of mutual assurances which are critical for collective action. 3airrigation systems 3afarmers 3aleadership 3airrigated farming 3airrigation scheduling 3aIndia 0aperformance 0awater user associations 0airrigation 0ainternal leadership 0afarmers' associations 0aparticipative management1 aBrewer, J.D.0 tIrrigation and drainage systems.g1999, v. 13, no. 3 p.249-273x0168-62917nnas  aDNAL  a20000602b20000608c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02970naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001600127245010600143300001800249500001500267520156000282650001301842650001201855650002801867650003501895650001301930650004101943650001401984650002201998650002002020650002702040650001302067650001802080650002202098650001702120650001502137650002302152653002402175653001402199653001502213700001902228700001602247700001302263700001702276773008102293852000902374930003302383945002502416946001102441655001202452IND4397351820221122140454.0071101e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439735182DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aCiota, A.T.10aAdaptation of two flaviviruses results in differences in genetic heterogeneity and virus adaptability  ap. 2398-2406.  a2019-12-05  aWest Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that was first introduced into the USA in the New York City area in 1999. Since its introduction, WNV has steadily increased both its host and geographical ranges. Outbreaks of the closely related flavivirus, St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV), occur in the USA periodically, but levels of activity and host range are more restricted than those of WNV. Understanding the selective pressures that drive arbovirus adaptation and evolution in their disparate mosquito and avian hosts is crucial to predicting their ability to persist and re-emerge. Here, we evaluated the in vivo phenotypes of mosquito cell-adapted WNV and SLEV. Results indicated that in vitro adaptations did not translate to in vivo adaptations for either virus, yet SLEV displayed attenuated growth in both mosquitoes and chickens, while WNV generally did not. In vitro growth analyses also indicated that WNV adaptations could be generalized to cell cultures derived from other mosquito species, while SLEV could not. Analysis of genetic diversity for passaged SLEV revealed a highly homogeneous population that differed significantly from previous results of high levels of diversity in WNV. We hypothesize that this difference in genetic diversity is directly related to the viruses' success in new and changing environments in the laboratory and that differences in a viruses' ability to produce and maintain heterogeneous populations in nature may in some instances explain the variable levels of success seen among arboviruses. 3achickens 3ainsects 3ainterspecific variation 3aSaint Louis encephalitis virus 3azoonoses 3aviral diseases of animals and humans 3aCulicidae 3agenetic variation 3aWest Nile virus 3abiochemical mechanisms 3amutation 3apathogenicity 3anatural selection 3apathogenesis 3apathotypes 3amicrobial genetics 0aspecies differences 0aevolution 0aadaptation1 aLovelace, A.O.1 aJones, S.A.1 aPayne A.1 aKramer, L.D.0 tJournal of general virology.g2007 Sept., v. 88 p.2398-2406x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a20080311b20080404c00000000  aINDd4CTe2008/01/29  aNon-US 7aarticle04679naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001600127245014700143300001600290500001500306520328700321650002003608650003403628650003703662650001703699650001903716650001803735650002003753650002003773650002503793650002403818650001903842650003203861650001903893650001303912650001203925651001803937653001803955700001503973700001403988700002104002700001604023773010304039852000904142930003304151946001304184655001204197IND4379045120221122140421.0060324e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437904512DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aBriefel, R.10aFeeding Infants and Toddler Study: do vitamin and mineral supplements contribute to nutrient adequacy or excess among US infants and toddlers?  ap. S52-S65.  a2019-12-05  aObjective: To report the prevalence of dietary supplement use in a random sample of US infants 4 to 24 months of age, and to compare demographic characteristics, usual nutrient intakes, and food patterns of supplement users and nonusers. Design: Data from 24-hour recalls collected for the 2002 Feeding Infants and Toddlers Study were analyzed. Recalls included nutrient contributions from dietary supplements as well as all foods and beverages. We estimated usual energy and nutrient intakes of supplement users and nonusers, as well as the prevalence of nutrient adequacy and excess in the two groups. We also compared demographic characteristics and food patterns of supplement users and nonusers and, for supplement users, estimated the proportion of total intake provided by foods and the proportion provided by supplements. Subjects: A national random sample of 3,022 infants and toddlers age 4 to 24 months, including 430 vitamin and/or mineral supplement users and 2,592 nonusers. Statistical Analysis: We compared means, percentile distributions, and proportions by age and supplement subgroup, and applied the Dietary Reference Intakes to assess usual nutrient intakes. We conducted regression analysis to determine which population characteristics predict the use of dietary supplements in this population. Results: Overall, 8% of infants age 4 to 5 months received some type of dietary supplement. The prevalence of supplement use increased with age, to 19% among infants 6 to 11 months and 31% among toddlers 12 to 24 months. The vast majority of supplement users (97%) received only one type of supplement, most commonly a multivitamin and/or mineral supplement. Vitamin/mineral supplement use among infants and toddlers was associated with being a first-born child and being reported by the primary caretaker as being a picky eater. Characteristics that were independent predictors of supplement use were living in the Northeast, being male, and living in a household with fewer children. We found no significant differences between supplement users and nonusers in mean daily intakes of nutrients or nutrient density from foods alone, and few differences in food consumption. Overall, the prevalence of inadequate intakes was low (<1% to 2%). However, 65% of supplement nonusers and 9% of supplement users had vitamin E intakes less than the Estimated Average Requirement. Excessive intakes (ie, intakes above the Tolerable Upper Intake Level) were noted for both supplement users and nonusers for vitamin A (97% and 15% of toddlers) and zinc (60% and 59% of older infants and 68% and 38% of toddlers) as well as for folate among supplement users (18% of toddlers). Conclusions: Generally, healthy infants and toddlers can achieve recommended levels of intake from food alone. Dietetics professionals should encourage caregivers to use foods rather than supplements as the primary source of nutrients in children's diets. Vitamin and mineral supplements can help infants and toddlers with special nutrient needs or marginal intakes achieve adequate intakes, but care must be taken to ensure that supplements do not lead to excessive intakes. This is especially important for nutrients that are widely used as food fortificants, including vitamin A, zinc, and folate. 3anutrient intake 3aEstimated Average Requirement 3asociodemographic characteristics 3afood choices 3abreast feeding 3aenergy intake 3anutrient excess 3achild nutrition 3anutritional adequacy 3acomplementary foods 3abottle feeding 3avitamin-mineral supplements 3ainfant feeding 3atoddlers 3ainfants 3aUnited States 0aeating habits1 aHanson, C.1 aFox, M.K.1 aNovák, Tomáš.1 aZiegler, P.0 tJournal of the American Dietetic Association.g2006 Jan., v. 106, no. 1 p.S52-S65x0002-82237nnas  aDNAL  a20080805b20080905c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle04792naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001600127245013200143300001600275500001500291520347300306650002003779650001403799650001603813650003703829650001703866650001803883650001203901650002003913650001403933650001903947650001703966650005303983650001604036650001304052650001204065651001804077653001804095700001604113700002104129700001404150773010304164852000904267930003304276946001304309655001204322IND4379045420221122140424.0060324e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437904542DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aBriefel, R.10aFeeding Infants and Toddlers Study: characteristics and usual nutrient intake of Hispanic and non-Hispanic infants and toddlers  ap. S84-S95.  a2019-12-05  aObjective: To compare demographic and maternal characteristics and usual nutrient intakes of Hispanic and non-Hispanic infants and toddlers 4 to 24 months of age in the United States. Design: We conducted three interviews by telephone to collect information on sociodemographic and maternal characteristics, feeding practices, and dietary intake in the 2002 Feeding Infants and Toddlers Study. We collected 24-hour dietary recalls, including a second day's intake on a subsample, using the Nutrition Data System for Research. We used the Personal Computer version of the Software for Intake Distribution Estimation to estimate usual nutrient intake and nutrient adequacy and excess for three age subgroups--infants 4-5 months, infants 6-11 months, and toddlers 12-24 months--and Hispanic or non-Hispanic ethnicity. Subjects: A national sample of 3,022 infants and toddlers age 4-24 months, including 371 Hispanic and 2,637 non-Hispanic subjects. Statistical analysis: We compared means, percentile distributions, and percentages by age/Hispanic ethnicity subgroup, and applied the Dietary Reference Intakes to assess nutrient intakes. Results: Mothers of Hispanic infants and toddlers were younger, less likely to be married, and had lower education levels than mothers of non-Hispanic infants and toddlers (P<.01). Hispanic infants and toddlers had significantly higher rates of participation in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children than non-Hispanic infants and toddlers (42% to 23%) and were more likely to reside in urban areas and have lower annual household income levels (P<.01). There were no significant differences in usual energy intake between Hispanic and non-Hispanic infants and toddlers, and mean usual energy intake exceeded the mean estimated energy requirement for all age/ethnicity subgroups. Hispanic toddlers consumed a significantly higher proportion of energy from carbohydrate (56% to 53%, P<.01) and a significantly lower percentage of energy from fat (31% to 33%, P<.01) than non-Hispanics. Comparing usual mean intakes, Hispanic infants age 6 to 11 months had a significantly lower intake of calcium than non-Hispanics (means of 574 mg and 626 mg per day, respectively, P<.05) and a significantly higher intake of sodium compared with non-Hispanics of the same age (means of 647 mg to 476 mg per day, P<.01). For infants, mean usual intakes were adequate for all nutrients. For toddlers, the prevalence of nutrient inadequacy was low (<1%) with the exception of vitamin E, which was inadequate for 39% of Hispanic toddlers and 50% of non-Hispanic toddlers. For nutrients with defined Tolerable Upper Intake Levels, more than one third to almost half of toddlers exceeded the Tolerable Upper Intake Levels for vitamin A and zinc, and more than half (53% and 58% for Hispanics and non-Hispanic toddlers, respectively) exceeded the Tolerable Upper Intake Level for sodium. Usual mean intakes of vitamins A, C, and E and folate, potassium, and fiber were significantly higher among Hispanic toddlers compared with non-Hispanic toddlers. Conclusions: The Feeding Infants and Toddlers Study data provide information that is useful to practitioners, Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children program staff, and parents for delivering nutrition education messages that are consistent with dietary guidance for infants and toddlers as well as compatible with cultural preferences. 3anutrient intake 3aHispanics 3afood intake 3asociodemographic characteristics 3afood choices 3aenergy intake 3amothers 3achild nutrition 3aAmericans 3ainfant feeding 3afood records 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3adiet recall 3atoddlers 3ainfants 3aUnited States 0aeating habits1 aZiegler, P.1 aNovák, Tomáš.1 aPonza, M.0 tJournal of the American Dietetic Association.g2006 Jan., v. 106, no. 1 p.S84-S95x0002-82237nnas  aDNAL  a20080805b20080905c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02784naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002500152245008200177300001400259500002400273520170600297650001902003650001102022650001702033650001902050650001502069650001102084650001302095650001802108650001202126650001302138650001902151650001002170650000902180700002602189773011902215852000902334856005502343655001202398IND4449963620221122045133.0110225e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444996362DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-6592.2010.01321.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSemkiw, Elizabeth S.10aField Study of Enhanced TCE Reductive Dechlorination by a Full-Scale Whey PRB  ap. 68-78.  aIncludes references  aThis study evaluates the efficiency of a full-scale, 81 m-wide permeable reactive barrier (PRB) configured by injection of dairy whey in the downgradient region of a contaminant source zone to enhance the in situ biodegradation of high concentrations (10² to 10³μg/L) of chlorinated ethenes (CEs). Ten biannual whey injections were completed in a 3.5-year pilot phase and 1.5-year operational phase. Improved and sustained dechlorination was observed at extraction/injection and downgradient wells in the fully-operational phase, when dried whey masses were increased from 13.6 kg to 230-360 kg, whey slurry volumes were increased from 2300 L to 307,000-480,000 L, and extraction/injection well loops were employed for the application of whey. At extraction/injection wells, CEs decreased to low (≤10 μg/L) or undetectable levels. At downgradient wells, average trichloroethene concentrations decreased, by as much as 100% (from ≤384.2 during the pilot phase to ≤102.6 μg/L during the operational phase), while average cis-dichloroethene concentrations decreased by as much as 57.5% (from ≤6466.1 to ≤4912.2 μg/L). Downgradient vinyl chloride averages either increased by as much as 63.8% (from ≤859.6 to ≤1407.9 μg/L) or decreased by 64.0% (from 1375.4 to 880 μg/L). Downgradient ethene + ethane averages increased by as much as 73.2% (from ≤1145.3 to ≤1347.1 μg/L). On the basis of the 2008 average market price, the estimated material cost of whey is $1.96/kg organic carbon or, for the configuration of an 81 m PRB by biannual application of 300 kg whey, $325/year. Carbon substrate cost comparisons and implications for efficient in situ treatment design are discussed. 3abiodegradation 3acarbon 3achlorination 3adechlorination 3adried whey 3aethane 3aethylene 3amarket prices 3amarkets 3aslurries 3avinyl chloride 3awells 3awhey1 aBarcelona, Michael J.0 tGround water monitoring & remediation.g2011 Feb., v. 31, no. 1 p.68-78dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1069-36297nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6592.2010.01321.x 7aarticle02743naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245018500143300001600328520137700344650002201721650003801743650002001781650002901801650002701830650001801857650002501875650001201900650002401912650002101936650003701957650002301994650002502017650005002042650003702092650003102129650002602160773008202186852000902268939003302277946001102310655001202321IND9202783720221122034929.0920506e199108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920278372DNAL7 a17615182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYokota, A.10aRibulose bisphosphate-induced, slow conformational changes of spinach ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase cause the two types of inflections in the course of its carboxylase reaction  ap. 246-252.  aThe cause of the inflection in the course of the carboxylase reaction and the changes in the functioning form of spinach ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (RuBisCO) during the reaction were elucidated by relating the activity to the protein conformation of RuBisCO using a fluorescence probe, 2-p-toluidinylnaphthalene sulfonate. The activity of RuBisCO in the linear phase was 50 to 60%of that in the initial burst at 0.5 to 1.0 mM ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP) and 65 to 80% at 2 to 5 mM RuBP. The amount and the progress of the decrease in the activity during the reaction had a close relationship to a change in the protein conformation of RuBisCO. The enzyme, the substrate binding sites of which were masked beforehand with carboxyarabinitol bisphosphate, still showed a change of its protein conformation upon addition of RuBP, suggesting that RuBisCO has two (substrate and regulatory) RuBP-binding sites per RuBisCO protomer. RuBisCO required over 2 mM RUBP for binding on the regulatory sites. Both sites also bound 6-phosphogluconate. When both sites were masked with 6-phosphogluconate beforehand, the course of the subsequent carboxylase reaction was linear with time. From these results, I propose that the inflection in the course of the reaction of spinach RuBisCO is a hysteretic response of the enzyme to RUBP bound to both substrate and regulatory sites. 3aSpinacia oleracea 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3aenzyme activity 3aribulose 1,5-diphosphate 3amolecular conformation 3abinding sites 3aprotein conformation 2aAnimals 2aEuglenaxenzymology 2aFluorescent Dyes 2aNaphthalenesulfonatesxchemistry 2aPlantsxenzymology 2aProtein Conformation 2aRibulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylasexmetabolism 2aRibulosephosphatesxpharmacology 2aSpectrometry, Fluorescence 2aSubstrate Specificity0 tJournal of biochemistry.g1991 Aug., v. 110, no. 2 p.246-252x0021-924X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03419naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245011500144300001600259520187800275650002002153650001702173650002002190650002502210650002502235650001702260650002102277650002402298650001802322650002302340650002202363650002302385650001802408650004002426650003102466650002002497650002102517650002802538650002902566650002402595650002302619650002702642650002702669653001202696653002802708700001802736773008202754852000902836939003302845946001102878655001202889IND9202783520221122034810.0920506e199108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920278352DNAL7 a18370162pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshida, N.10aMolecular cloning and expression in Escherichia coli of cDNA encoding the subunit of sweet potato beta-amylase  ap. 196-201.  aTuberous roots of the sweet potato are unusually rich in beta-amylase, and the beta-amylase polypeptides account for about 5% of the total soluble protein of the organ. Unlike beta-amylases from other origins, the sweet potato beta-amylase is a tetramer of identical subunits, and it also bears starch phosphorylase-inhibitor activity. A cDNA for the subunit of sweet potato beta-amylase was obtained by immunological screening of an expression cDNA library constructed by the vector-primer and linker method using a plasmid vector containing tac-SP6 promoters. The SP6 transcript of a 2,000 base-pair-long cDNA insert directed the synthesis in vitro of a precursor to the subunit of beta-amylase which was identical in size with the mature subunit, and the beta-amylase mRNA detected by Northern blot hybridization was identical in size with the SP6 transcript of the cDNA insert. The cDNA insert contained 1,494 base pairs of an open reading frame which codes for the 499-amino-acid-long precursor to the subunit of beta-amylase. An amino acid sequence identical to the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the mature subunit appeared immediately after the initiator methionine of the precursor, indicating that the subunit of beta-amylase is synthesized as a mature form. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of subunits of sweet potato beta-amylase and seed beta-amylases from barley and soybean indicated that these enzymes share about 68% amino acid identities among each other. Escherichia coli cells harboring the cDNA clone produced the mature-sized subunit of the beta-amylase, and the soluble extract exhibited amylolytic activity which migrated to the same position as the beta-amylase purified from the sweet potato in non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing soluble starch indicating that oligomerization of the subunit occurred properly in E. coli cells. 3aIpomoea batatas 3abeta-amylase 3agene expression 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3apolypeptides 3aprotein subunits 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aBlotting, Northern 2aBlotting, Western 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNAxgenetics 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aGene Expression 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aRNA, Messengerxanalysis 2aRestriction Mapping 2aSequence Alignment 2aVegetablesxenzymology 2abeta-Amylasexgenetics 0acloning 0amolecular sequence data1 aNakamaura, K.0 tJournal of biochemistry.g1991 Aug., v. 110, no. 2 p.196-201x0021-924X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02528naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137100001600146245010100162300001800263500002400281520109900305650001901404650001701423650000901440650001701449650001401466650002301480650001801503650002201521650002301543651001101566653003601577653001701613700001601630700001501646700001601661700001801677700001701695700001501712773016201727852000901889856007701898930003301975945002502008946001302033655001202046IND4408852820221122031105.0080812e20080709xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440885282DNAL7 a10.1021/jf70373732doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5041 aMaraval, I.10aOdor-Active Compounds in Cooked Rice Cultivars from Camargue (France) Analyzed by GC-O and GC-MS  ap. 5291-5298.  aIncludes references  aVolatile compounds of cooked rice from scented (Aychade, Fidji) and nonscented (Ruille) cultivars grown in the Camargue area in France were compared to that of a marketed Asian scented one (Thai) by gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). GC-O analyses of the organic extracts resulted in the perception of 40 odorous compounds. Only two compounds, oct-1-en-3-one and 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, were almost always perceived. Hierarchical cluster analysis showed that most of the difference between rice odors was linked to quantitative differences with only 11 compounds being specific to some of the rice. Sixty compounds were identified and quantified by GC-MS, including a few new odor-active components. Principal component analysis enabled us to differentiate scented cultivars from a nonscented one, and scented rice cultivars from Camargue from a Thai sample. Calculated odor-active values evidenced that the Thai sample odor differed from that of scented Camargue cultivars because of the degradation of lipids and of cinnamic acid compounds. 3aodor compounds 3acooked foods 3arice 3aOryza sativa 3acultivars 3agas chromatography 3aolfactometers 3amass spectrometry 3asensory properties 3aFrance 0agas chromatography-olfactometry 0ascented rice1 aMestres, C.1 aPernin, K.1 aRibeyre, F.1 aBoulanger, R.1 aGuichard, E.1 aGunata, Z.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2008 July 9, v. 56, no. 13 p.5291-5298dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf70373733Available from publisher's Web site  a20090603b20090703c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/05/11  aOther US 7aarticle04171naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003100133040001800164100002100182245017700203300001800380500002400398500001500422506007600437520177900513506003702292650002502329650002602354650003102380650001202411650001802423650001802441650001602459650001502475650001702490650001002507650001902517650001202536650001102548650001302559650001902572650006102591650004802652650007002700650003402770650002502804650003802829650001602867650004102883650002802924650002902952650001302981650003302994653001203027653001103039700002103050700002203071700001603093700001503109700001703124700002503141700002203166700001903188700002503207773011503232852000903347856008103356655001203437IND4444618220221207083403.0101105e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444461822DNAL7 a208053272pmid7 aPMC29716232pmcid7 a10.1104/pp.110.1591112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurmu, Jhadeswar10aArabidopsis Basic Leucine-Zipper Transcription Factors TGA9 and TGA10 Interact with Floral Glutaredoxins ROXY1 and ROXY2 and Are Redundantly Required for Anther Development  ap. 1492-1504.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aROXY1 and ROXY2 are CC-type floral glutaredoxins with redundant functions in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) anther development. We show here that plants lacking the basic leucine-zipper transcription factors TGA9 and TGA10 have defects in male gametogenesis that are strikingly similar to those in roxy1 roxy2 mutants. In tga9 tga10 mutants, adaxial and abaxial anther lobe development is differentially affected, with early steps in anther development blocked in adaxial lobes and later steps affected in abaxial lobes. Distinct from roxy1 roxy2, microspore development in abaxial anther lobes proceeds to a later stage with the production of inviable pollen grains contained within nondehiscent anthers. Histological analysis shows multiple defects in the anther dehiscence program, including abnormal stability and lignification of the middle layer and defects in septum and stomium function. Compatible with these defects, TGA9 and TGA10 are expressed throughout early anther primordia but resolve to the middle and tapetum layers during meiosis of pollen mother cells. Several lines of evidence suggest that ROXY promotion of anther development is mediated in part by TGA9 and TGA10. First, TGA9 and TGA10 expression overlaps with ROXY1/2 during anther development. Second, TGA9/10 and ROXY1/2 operate downstream of SPOROCYTELESS/NOZZLE, where they positively regulate a common set of genes that contribute to tapetal development. Third, TGA9 and TGA10 directly interact with ROXY proteins in yeast and in plant cell nuclei. These findings suggest that activation of TGA9/10 transcription factors by ROXY-mediated modification of cysteine residues promotes anther development, thus broadening our understanding of how redox-regulated TGA factors function in plants.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptional activation 3amothers 3alignification 3agametogenesis 3amicrospores 3adehiscence 3acell nucleus 3agenes 3aleucine zipper 3amutants 3apollen 3acysteine 3aplant proteins 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBasic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aFlowersxgrowth & development 2aGametogenesis, Plant 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGermination 2aGlutaredoxinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutagenesis, Insertional 2aMutation 2aPollenxgrowth & development 0aanthers 0aplants1 aBush, Michael J.1 aDeLong, Catherine1 aLi, Shutian1 aXu, Mingli1 aKhan, Madiha1 aMalcolmson, Caroline1 aFobert, Pierre R.1 aZachgo, Sabine1 aHepworth, Shelley R.0 tPlant physiology.g2010 Nov., v. 154, no. 3 p.1492-1504dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.110.1591113Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02215naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245018000160300001600340520088500356592002801241650002201269650002301291650001601314650001801330650001401348650001601362650002501378650002201403650002001425650001701445650001501462653002101477653000801498653000801506653001301514700001301527700001601540700002001556773011501576856008101691852000901772655001201781IND60729582920221119041014.0210228e20080601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072958292DNAL7 a10.1556/aalim.37.2008.2.32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNagy, A.10aNutritional evaluation of the proteins of broad range herbicide resistant spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) lines II.

However, the over-reliance on metal-based photocatalysts hampers its long-term application. Here, a series of Earth-abundant natural biomass-derived heteroatom-doped carbonaceous photocatalysts prepared via a sulfuric-acid-assisted carbonization method are developed to convert the CO₂ waste into the valuable carbon monoxide (CO) fuel. On account of visible-light-harvesting, large CO₂ uptake, efficient charge separation and abundant defects, green catalysts such as the carbonized konjac biomass (CKB) exhibit a superior visible-light-driven CO formation of 115 μmol g⁻¹ h⁻¹ without using any co-catalyst or sacrificial reagent. The versatility of the synthetic approach developed is verified by preparing a series of carbonaceous photocatalysts derived from various Earth-abundant natural biomass precursors including crops, plants, and agricultural waste. The results show that they all perform appreciable photocatalytic CO₂-to-CO conversion. This study provides a general method for designing cheap, high-performance, sustainable, and metal-free photocatalysts using natural biomass, which makes the large-scale practical use feasible and helps achieve a closed-loop carbon cycle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmorphophallus 3aagricultural wastes 3abiomass 3acarbon cycle 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3acarbonization 3aenergy 3agreen chemistry 3agreenhouse effect 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3asolar energy1 aWei, Wei1 aNi, Bing-Jie0 tGreen chemistry.g2021 Nov. 29, v. 23, no. 23 p.9683-9692dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1gc03701c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02516naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245012900173520139300302592002801695650001901723650002401742650002501766650002201791650001801813650001701831653002201848653002501870653002201895653003601917700002101953773010901974856008602083852000902169655001202178IND60749566720221118051730.0211106e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074956672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2021.1084152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomillac, Nicolas10aTransferring concepts from plant to microbial ecology: A framework proposal to identify relevant bacterial functional traits  aIn the past decade, there was a growing interest in using functional trait approaches to study soil bacterial communities. However, microbial ecology as lagged behind plant and animal ecology in implementing such an approach. One of the main difficulties is linked to the absence of a small set of well identified bacterial functional traits, relevant for defining ecological strategies, explaining community assembly and predicting community impact on ecosystem functioning. Taking inspiration from plant functional ecology, we propose that functional traits should not be identified based on their relationship to an ecosystem function of interest, but rather on their relationship to bacterial fitness. We propose a framework in which bacterial fitness is composed of three components: growth rate, survival and dispersion. We identify putative functional traits linked to those components, in particular 16S rDNA copy number for growth rate. We propose several ways of validating identified functional traits by observing changes in community-aggregated trait values along environmental gradients, observing relationships between relative abundance and trait values within communities and comparing community and regional pool traits diversity. Finally, we argue for using traits to define bacterial ecological strategies and identify relationships between response and effect traits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal ecology 3aecological function 3aenvironmental impact 3amicrobial ecology 3asoil bacteria 3asoil biology 0aFunctional traits 0a16S rDNA copy number 0aBacterial fitness 0aBacterial ecological strategies1 aSantorufo, Lucia0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2021 Nov., v. 162 p.108415-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2021.1084153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02965naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245010000164500001400264520149700278592002801775650002701803650001901830650002201849650001301871650001101884650002501895650001301920650002601933650002101959650001201980650001301992650001102005650001502016650001202031650001502043650001002058650001602068650001002084650001802094650001602112651002802128700002002156700001902176700002402195700002502219773012102244856007302365852000902438655001202447IND60718894620221122194054.0201126e20201030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071889462DNAL7 a10.3390/f111111582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnna, Klamerus-Iwan 10aVariability of Leaf Wetting and Water Storage Capacity of Branches of 12 Deciduous Tree Species  aNAL-light  aLeaf surface wettability and factors which determine it are key in determining the water storage capacity of tree crowns and thus the interception of entire stands. Leaf wettability, expressed as the droplet inclination angle, and the surface free energy largely depend not only on the chemical composition of the leaves but also on their texture. The study concerns 12 species of trees common in Central Europe. The content of epicuticular waxes was determined in the leaves, and values ranging from 9.145 [µg/cm²] for horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum L.) to 71.759 [µg/cm²] for birch (Betula pendula Roth.) were obtained. Each additional µg/cm² increases the canopy water storage capacity by 0.067 g g⁻¹. For all species, the inclination angles of water, diiodomethane and glycerin droplets to the leaf surface were measured and the surface free energy was calculated. It is shown that it is the wax content and the species that constitute independent predictors of water storage capacity. These factors explain the 95.56% effect on the value of canopy water storage capacity. The remaining 4.44% indicate non-species-related individual features or the ability to mitigate pollutants as well as possible environmental factors. Wax analyzed separately from other factors causes a slight increase (by 0.067 g/g) of S. Nevertheless, the influence of the surface condition as a result of species-related variability is decisive for the value of the canopy water storage capacity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAesculus hippocastanum 3aBetula pendula 3aGibbs free energy 3abranches 3acanopy 3achemical composition 3adroplets 3aenvironmental factors 3aepicuticular wax 3aforests 3aglycerol 3aleaves 3apollutants 3atexture 3atree crown 3atrees 3avariability 3awater 3awater storage 3awettability 3aCentral European region1 aSylwia, Łagan 1 aMarcin, Zarek 1 aEwa, Słowik-Opoka 1 aWojtan, Bartłomiej 0 tForests.g2020 Oct. 30, v. 11, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f111111583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03055naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003300150245006000183300001600243520166000259592002801919653001901947653001901966653001901985653002702004653003202031653003002063653001902093653001902112653001902131653002802150653003602178653004002214700002102254700002102275700001902296700002402315700002102339773018002360856008402540852000902624655001202633IND60554598420221121094907.0161024e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055459842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmhimx.2016.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVelásquez-Forero, Francisco10aRisk factors evaluation for urolithiasis among children  ap. 228-236.  aThe prevalence of pediatric urolithiasis varies from 0.01–0.03%. Urolithiasis may be caused by anatomical, metabolic and environmental factors. Recurrence varies between 16 to 67%, and it is frequently associated with metabolic abnormalities. The objective of the present work was the identification of risk factors that promote urolithiasis in a child population.This study included 162 children with urolithiasis and normal renal function (mean age 7.5 years). Risk factors were investigated in two stages. In the first stage, 24-hour urine, and blood samples were analyzed to assess metabolic parameters and urinary tract infection. During the second stage, the effect of calcium restriction and a calcium load on renal Ca excretion were evaluated. Data were statistically analyzed.Urolithiasis was observed in 0.02% of children, 50% of them with family history of urinary stones. There were multiple risk factors for urolithiasis including hypocitraturia (70%), hypomagnesuria (42%), hypercalciuria (37%; in 11/102 was by intestinal hyperabsorption, in 13/102 was unclassified. Ca resorption or renal Ca leak were not detected). We also detected alkaline urine (21%), systemic metabolic acidosis (20%), urinary infections (16%), nephrocalcinosis with urolithiasis (11%), oliguria (8%), urinary tract anomalies, hyperuricosemia and hypermagnesemia (7% each one), hypercalcemia (6%), hyperoxaluria (2%) and hypercystinuria (0.61%).Hypocitraturia and hypomagnesuria were the most frequent risk factors associated with urolithiasis, followed by hypercalciuria. High PTH values were excluded. Children presented two or more risk factors for urolithiasis.  aPublisher supplied data 0aHypocitraturia 0aHypomagnesuria 0aHypercalciuria 0aPediatric urolithiasis 0aSystemic metabolic acidosis 0aUrolithiasis risk factors 0aHipocitraturia 0aHipomagnesuria 0aHipercalciuria 0aUrolitiasis pediátrica 0aAcidosis metabólica sistémica 0aFactores de riesgo para urolitiasis1 aEsparza, Mariela1 aSalas, Alejandro1 aMedeiros, Mara1 aToussaint, Georgina1 aLlach, Francisco0 tBoletín Médico del Hospital Infantil de México.g2016 July,  Aug., v. 73 p.228-236dMasson Doyma México S.A.aHospital Infantil de México Federico Gómezx1665-11467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmhimx.2016.05.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02560naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245007900171300001800250520151400268592002801782650003001810650001301840650001901853650002301872650001701895650001501912700005301927700005301980773012002033856008402153852000902237655001202246IND60742067720221121033605.0210622e20210610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074206772DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.1c008602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMichaels, Wesley10aAtomistic Modeling of PEDOT:PSS Complexes II: Force Field Parameterization  ap. 5354-5365.  aThe conductive polymer complex poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) is integral to many next-generation polymeric devices. All-atom molecular dynamics (MD) is increasingly employed to probe film microstructure, but the commonly used Generalized AMBER Force Field (GAFF) parameters remain unvalidated for this system. Here, we develop all-atom force fields for both undoped and highly doped PEDOT compatible with GAFF. Molecular geometries, vibrational energies, torsional profiles, and conformational energetics calculated with density functional theory comprise the training data. The optimized force fields improve upon GAFF for all the training data, including notable improvements in torsional barriers, and capture the finite size of charge carriers in doped PEDOT. Although GAFF predicts similar behavior between undoped and doped polymers, our models identify meaningful differences in ground-state geometry, vibrational spectra, and torsional barriers between the two. Furthermore, vacuum MD simulations show that the neutral polymer is more flexible than the highly doped polymer, primarily due to the weaker inter-monomer dihedral potentials. The foregoing trends are directly attributable to the aromatic-to-quinoid transition PEDOT experiences upon doping. This coupling between doping and molecular flexibility highlights the importance of charge–geometry interactions in atomistic modeling and should be considered while modeling conjugated polymers beyond PEDOT.  aPublisher supplied data 3adensity functional theory 3ageometry 3amicrostructure 3amolecular dynamics 3apolystyrenes 3asulfonates1 aZhao, Yan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1234-44551 aQin, Jian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6271-068X0 tMacromolecules.g2021 June 10, v. 54, no. 12 p.5354-5365dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.1c008603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02309naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003500140245005500175500002000230520116800250592002801418596006501446596002001511650001801531650001901549650001801568650001801586650001401604650000901618700007101627700006201698773012701760856007501887852000901962655001201971IND60789510020221122182121.0220821e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078951002DNAL7 a10.1002/aps3.113912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcía‐Gutiérrez, Emmanuel12aA novel, rapid technique for clearing leaf tissues  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPREMISE: Clearing leaves is a highly useful practice for many taxonomic, ecological, physiological, and eco‐physiological aspects of research. Using traditional methods, the procedure for clearing a leaf (referred to as diaphanization) can take several days or even weeks. In our laboratory we developed a technique, originally used for dissociating wood, that yields excellent epidermal and leaf venation preparations clearly showing the details of epidermal cells, hydathodes, trichomes, leaf margins, and leaf venation, in a maximum of three days. METHODS AND RESULTS: A solution originally used to macerate wood (Franklin’s solution) was used to accelerate the process of clearing leaves. Using this approach, it is possible to obtain clear images of the leaf adaxial and abaxial epidermal surfaces and leaf venation. Our technique works with both fragile and sturdy leaves, as well as with thin roots and stems. A few examples are presented. CONCLUSIONS: Franklin’s solution is very simple to prepare and easy to manipulate. This new technique has the advantage of separating the leaf epidermal layers and venations, which can then be clearly observed.  aPublisher supplied data  cFondo de Cooperación Internacional en Ciencia y Tecnología  a273659cCONACYT 3aecophysiology 3aleaf epidermis 3aleaf venation 3arapid methods 3atrichomes 3awood1 aOrtega‐Escalona, Fernando1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8870-578X1 aAngeles, Guillermo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0455-49970 tApplications in plant sciences.g2020 Sept., v. 8, no. 9 p.e11391-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:19710x2168-04507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aps3.113913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03218naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001400112245012800126300001400254500001900268520181500287592002802102650002002130650002302150650001502173650001602188650001402204650001602218650001902234650002002253650001702273650001302290650001102303650001602314650001602330650001802346650001302364650001902377650002802396653002502424653002502449653002702474653001202501700001502513700001902528700001702547773015102564852000902715655001202724IND60716923920221120124048.0201107e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071692392DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEdith, R.10aAlterations in serum enzyme profile of riverine buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) experimentally infected with Fasciola gigantica  ap. 50-55.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSerum enzymes activity in riverine buffalo yearlings of the Murrah breed (200–250 kgs, aged 12–15 months), were weekly monitored during the clinical course of tropical fasciolosis. Eight animals were randomly assigned to infected (Gr-I) and healthy control (Gr-II) groups. Each animal in Gr-I was orally infected with single primary infection dose of viable 800 Fasciola gigantica metacercariae, whereas Gr-II animals served as uninfected healthy controls. The infected animals (Gr-I) sequentially developed recognized signs of tropical fasciolosis from 5ᵗʰ week post-infection synchronous with in situ development of the flukes, and had mean in situ fluke population of 331.8±19.5 at necropsy. The progressively increased serum enzyme activity revealed two clearly demarcated stages: (a) remarkably elevated AST (40.8%) and ALT (140.0%) activity as compared to healthy controls in the host circulation during early prepatency, signifying traumatic lesions inflicted by the growing massive population of F. gigantica adolescercariae and, (b) marked with significant increase in serum AP concentration (107.9%), indicative of bile duct hyperplasia, cholangitis, periportal fibrosis and biliary obstruction from 6ᵗʰ week post-infection onwards. The possible source of refluxed ALT and AST were traumatized hepatocytes and for AP were hepato-biliary lesions, incidental to F. gigantica during late prepatency and patent phase of the disease in Gr-I animals. None of healthy controls (Gr-II) developed signs suggestive of illness and had within normal range haematological values and serum enzyme profile. Diagnostic significance of these marker enzymes in disease forecasting and in time application of control strategies to combat tropical fasciolosis in buffaloes in endemic areas has been discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBubalus bubalis 3aFasciola gigantica 3abile ducts 3ablood serum 3abuffaloes 3acholestasis 3adisease course 3aenzyme activity 3afascioliasis 3afibrosis 3aflukes 3ahepatocytes 3ahyperplasia 3ametacercariae 3anecropsy 3ariparian areas 3aveterinary parasitology 0aAlanine transaminase 0aAlkaline phosphatase 0aAspartate transaminase 0aBuffalo1 aGodara, R.1 aThilagar, M.B.1 aSharma, R.L.0 tJournal of veterinary parasitology.g2011 June, v. 25, no. 1 p.50-55dIndian Association of Veterinary PathologistswJournal:2087x0974-08137nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02605naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245012100171520110600292592002801398650001801426650001901444650001401463650002401477650001901501650001301520650001401533650001501547650001601562653001901578653002501597653001801622653002601640653002001666700002401686700001901710700002801729700003001757700002601787700002701813700002501840700006701865773011201932856008202044852000902126655001202135IND60793126620221118233920.0220921e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079312662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2022.1134112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaruppusamy, Indira10aFabrication of near superhydrophobic Pt–TiO2 hybrid nanoflake composite as food sensor in food processing industry  aThe current finding reports on the development of highly ordered closely packed TiO₂ nanotube arrays on Ti substrate via two-step anodization process. The nanotubes developed by second anodization step (TNT2) were encapsulated with Pt nanoflakes using electro-deposition followed by hydrothermal treatment process. The FE-SEM, FTIR, XRD and contact angle measurement, respectively were done to find out the morphological, functional group, phase structural and wettability of the samples. The tube diameter and length were found to be 110-120 and 50-100 nm and 437 and 682, respectively for first (TNT1) and second anodization. The structural order of the TNT has enhanced in the second anodization process. Chronoamperometric results showed that the Pt-TNT2 exhibited enhanced and steady state electro-catalytic activity than Pt-TNT1. Pt-TNT2 nanoflake composite showed near SHP behaviour than the TNT without Pt. The food processing machinery developed using near SHP Pt-TNT2 could be cleaned easily due to its high non-wettability.

Conventionally, a fairly ‘simple’ approach is employed for target gene identification e.g. finding genes with binding sites within 2 kb of a transcription start site (TSS). However, this does not take into account the number of sites upstream of the TSS, their exact positioning or the fact that different TFs appear to act at different characteristic distances from the TSS. RESULTS: Here we propose a probabilistic model called target identification from profiles (TIP) that quantitatively measures the regulatory relationships between TFs and target genes. For each TF, our model builds a characteristic, averaged profile of binding around the TSS and then uses this to weight the sites associated with a given gene, providing a continuous-valued ‘regulatory’ score relating each TF and potential target. Moreover, the score can readily be turned into a ranked list of target genes and an estimate of significance, which is useful for case-dependent downstream analysis. CONCLUSION: We show the advantages of TIP by comparing it to the ‘simple’ approach on several representative datasets, using motif occurrence and relationship to knock-out experiments as metrics of validation. Moreover, we show that the probabilistic model is not as sensitive to various experimental parameters (including sequencing depth and peak-calling method) as the simple approach; in fact, the lesser dependence on sequencing depth potentially utilizes the result of a ChIP-seq experiment in a more ‘cost-effective’ manner.

We addressed these critical challenges by (i) using a viscous liquid additive to control flow rate passively, without external pumping equipment, and (ii) adopting an immunobead assay that can be quantified with a portable fluorescence cell counter based on a blue light-emitting diode. Such novel features enable pumpless microflow cytometry (pFC) analysis by simply dropping a sample solution onto the inlet reservoir of a disposable cell-counting chamber. With our pFC platform, we achieved reliable cell counting over a dynamic range of 9–298 cells/μL. We demonstrated the practical utility of the platform by identifying a type of cancer cell based on CD326, the epithelial cell adhesion molecule. This portable microflow cytometry platform can be applied generally to a range of cell types using immunobeads labeled with specific antibodies, thus making it valuable for cell-based and point-of-care diagnostics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3adiagnostic techniques 3aepithelial cell adhesion molecule 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescence 3alight emitting diodes 3aliquids 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3apoint-of-care systems 3areceptors 3aviscosity1 aOh, Sein1 aShin, Suyeon1 aYim, Sang-Gu1 aYang, Seung Yun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1233-89601 aHahn, Young Ki1 aChoi, Sungyoung1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9344-59430 tAnalytical chemistry.g2018 June 06, v. 90, no. 13 p.8254-8260dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b018043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02661naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245006400163300001800227520140500245592002801650650001701678650001301695650001601708650003801724650001001762650002301772650003001795650002401825650001001849650001501859650001701874650000901891650001401900650002801914650002501942650001201967700001901979700002001998700001902018773008802037856008102125852000902206655001202215IND60523240420221119170241.0160609e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052324042DNAL7 a10.1007/s00726-016-2219-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Haining10aEffects of taurine on gut microbiota and metabolism in mice  ap. 1601-1617.  aAs being a necessary amino acid, taurine plays an important role in the regulation of neuroendocrine functions and nutrition. In this study, effects of taurine on mice gut microbes and metabolism were investigated. BALB/C mice were randomly divided into three experimental groups: The first group was administered saline (CK), the second was administered 165 mg/kg natural taurine (NE) and the third one administered 165 mg/kg synthetic taurine (CS). Gut microbiota composition in mice feces was analyzed by metagenomics technology, and the content of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) in mice feces was detected by gas chromatography (GC), while the concentrations of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were detected by a LPS ELISA kit and a SOD assay kit, respectively. The results showed that the effect of taurine on gut microbiota could reduce the abundance of Proteobacteria, especially Helicobacter. Moreover, we found that the SCFA content was increased in feces of the NE group while LPS content was decreased in serum of the NE group; the SOD activity in serum and livers of the NE and CS groups were not changed significantly compare to that of the CK group. In conclusion, taurine could regulate the gut micro-ecology, which might be of benefit to health by inhibiting the growth of harmful bacteria, accelerating the production of SCFA and reducing LPS concentration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelicobacter 3abacteria 3ablood serum 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afeces 3agas chromatography 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alipopolysaccharides 3aliver 3ametabolism 3ametagenomics 3amice 3anutrition 3ashort chain fatty acids 3asuperoxide dismutase 3ataurine1 aGuo, Zhengzhao1 aShen, Shengrong1 aShan, Weiguang0 tAmino acids.g2016 July, v. 48, no. 7 p.1601-1617dSpringer Viennax0939-44517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00726-016-2219-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02205naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245010300164300001600267520111500283592002801398650001601426650001901442650001301461650001501474650002301489650000901512650001001521650000901531650001201540651001401552651002401566651001201590700001801602700001801620700001801638773009401656856004801750852000901798655001201807IND4478906220221119223507.0121003e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447890622DNAL7 a10.1134/S00138738110700252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRusina, L.

In independent-founding Polistes and Mischocyttarus species, all cases of pulp partitioning were connected with aggression on the part of the foundresses. An experimental increase of nesting density of P. dominula led to changes in the relative abundance of workers in the polyethic task groups. Some workers practically stopped hunting and switched over to pulp delivery; some of these workers possessed well-developed ovaries and were able to lay eggs. The experimentally removed part of the nest envelope in the swarm-founding wasp Metapolybia cingulata was restored only in colonies that included young workers. The specific features of nest building activity in independent-founding and swarm-founding polistine wasps are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMetapolybia 3aMischocyttarus 3aPolistes 3aaggression 3aconservation areas 3aeggs 3anests 3apulp 3atropics 3aBlack Sea 3aTrinidad and Tobago 3aUkraine1 aFirman, L.

We provide new data and we review previously available information on bees (Apoidea) associated with three economically important crops in Spain: melon (Cucumis melo L.), watermelon (Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. & Nakai) and almond (Prunus dulcis (Mill.) D.A.Webb). We found that, overall, 98 bee species spanning four families visit flowers of the studied crop species, and 46 additional species were sampled within the crops with pan-traps. The bee assemblages visiting melon include 7–33 species, with moderate to high importance of small Lasioglossum (Halictidae) and of honey bee (Apis mellifera Linnaeus, 1758: Apidae), and in one case of small Ceratina: Apidae. Watermelon flowers are visited by 11–14 species of bees, with highest abundance of honey bees or of small Lasioglossum, depending on the locality. Bees collected on almond trees included 12–37 species, with the honey bee and medium-size to large Andrena (Andrenidae) and Osmia (Megachilidae) being predominant. The new samples expanded the geographical distributions of nearly one-fourth of the collected species. Diversity estimators slightly varied even within fields of the same crop, and a cluster analysis suggested both a certain overlap between melon and watermelon and a role of geographical distance on similarity among bee assemblages, though these patterns were much clearer using presence data rather than abundances. Below-ground-nesting and solitary species were more frequently collected than above-ground-nesting and eusocial species, but for melon and watermelon the highest abundances were recorded for eusocial species. Almost exclusively polylectic species visited the flowers of the three studied crops. The results of this study could help in planning conservation actions to maintain this important diversity of potential pollinators in Spanish areas covered by these crops.  aCP was funded by a post-doctoral contract funded by Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha and the European Social Fund (ESF).

Average particle size (d4,3), surface protein concentration, partial coalescence of fat and overrun of whipped cream during whipping were also determined. As Span 60 level increased (0–0.8%) in emulsion, the apparent viscosity was increased gradually, and the particle size range was narrowed, which was also detected by microstructure. A positive effect of whipping time was observed on the average particle size, partial coalescence of fat, surface protein concentration and overrun during whipping, respectively. An increase of Span 60 level resulted in a reduction of d4,3 values and partial coalescence of fat during 0–1min whipping, then increasing after whipping for 2–5min (0.6% Span 60 as the critical level). A negative behaviour was observed between surface protein concentration and Span 60. Moreover, Span 60 could improve the overrun and organoleptic properties of whipped cream efficiently.  aPublisher supplied data 3acreaming 3alipids 3aparticle size 3aparticle size distribution 3asensory properties 3asurface proteins 3aviscosity 3awhipped cream 3awhipping 3awhipping cream 0aSorbitan monostearate 0aWhipped cream 0aMicrostructure 0aPartial coalescence 0aSurface protein concentration1 aKuang, Wanmei1 aLong, Zhao1 aFang, Min1 aLiu, Daolin1 aYang, Bao1 aZhao, Mouming0 tFood chemistry.g2013 Dec. 01, v. 141, no. 3 p.1834-1840dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.04.0863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01974naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002800112245007700140300001400217500001900231520074900250592002800999650002401027650002501051650001301076650001601089650001401105650001901119650001301138650000901151650001501160650001501175650001501190650002101205650001501226650000901241650002801250653001701278653001901295653001901314700001701333700001801350773015101368852000901519655001201528IND60716924220221120135131.0201107e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071692422DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorthakur, Sonjoy Kumar10aClinical, hematological and biochemical studies in dirofilariosis in dog  ap. 63-66.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSix cases of dirofilariosis (Dirofilaria immitis) in dogs were clinically confirmed on the basis of symptoms, presence of microfilaria in blood followed by detection of antigen of adults heartworm in blood serum using Solo Step® CH kit.

After dissociation of LR, the reaction takes place through a two-step mechanism involving (i) a concerted cycloaddition between one monomer and the carbonyl compound to form a four-membered intermediate and (ii) a cycloreversion leading to the thiocarbonyl derivative and phenyl(thioxo)phosphine oxide. Topological analyses confirmed the concertedness and asynchronicity of the process. The second step is the rate-limiting one, and the whole process resembles the currently accepted mechanism for the lithium salt-free Wittig reaction. No zwitterionic intermediates are formed during the reaction, although stabilizing electrostatic interactions are present in initial stages. Phenyl(thioxo)phosphine oxide formed in the thionation reaction is capable of performing a second thionation, although with energy barriers higher than the first one. The driving force of the thionation reactions is the formation of trimers from the resulting monomers. In agreement with experimental observations, the amides are the most reactive when compared with esters, aldehydes, and ketones and the reaction is slightly influenced by the polarity of the solvent. Whereas for amides and esters substituents have little effect, aldehydes and ketones are influenced by both steric and electronic effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaldehydes 3aamides 3acarbonyl compounds 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3adissociation 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aenergy 3aesters 3aketones 3alithium 3amethodology 3aorganic chemistry 3aphosphine 3asolvents 3azwitterions1 aToma, L.1 aCaramella, P.1 aChiacchio, M.

Flow cytometry (FCM), the standard approach to estimating C‐values, relies mostly on fresh materials, performing poorly when used with herbarium materials. No fern C‐value reports have been derived from herbarium specimens; however, the herbarium spores of some ferns remain highly viable for decades and are thus promising for further investigation. To explore this possibility, we evaluated herbarium spore collections of Ophioglossaceae ferns using FCM. METHODS: Flow cytometry was conducted on 24 spore samples, representing eight of the 12 genera of the Ophioglossaceae, using specimens ranging in age from 2.6 to 111 years obtained from five herbaria. RESULTS: Regardless of the genus or the source herbarium, high‐quality C‐value data were generated from 17 samples, with the oldest being 26 years old. Estimates of the C‐values from sporophytic tissues of known ploidy did not reveal any evidence of apomixis for the species surveyed here. We also detected a pronounced genome downsizing in Sceptridium polyploids. DISCUSSION: The recent success of FCM for C‐value estimation using spores provides a much more convenient method of utilizing “dry” refrigerated materials. We demonstrate here that herbarium spores of some ferns are also promising for this use, even for older specimens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOphioglossaceae 3aapomixis 3aferns and fern allies 3aflow cytometry 3agenome 3aherbaria 3apolyploidy 3arefrigeration 3aspores 3asporophytes1 aTang, Sheng Kai1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3399-26431 aKao, Tzu‐Tong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1372-73241 aEbihara, Atsushi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7380-35981 aFawcett, Susan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5021-17791 aHsiao, Min‐Chien1 aShinohara, Wataru1 aDauphin, Benjamin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0982-42520 tApplications in plant sciences.g2021 Nov., v. 9, no. 11-12 p.e11452-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:19710x2168-04507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aps3.114523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02973naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245017000173300001600343520136700359592002801726650004401754650002201798650003701820650001601857650001101873650001801884650002101902650001401923650002101937650002101958650001101979650001201990650003302002650001602035653002102051653003102072653002202103653002402125653002802149700001402177700001702191700002202208700001702230700002202247700002202269773007102291856008402362852000902446655001202455IND60559523320221119204232.0170720e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055952332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2015.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIslam, Mohammad S.10aGrafting carbon nanotubes directly onto carbon fibers for superior mechanical stability: Towards next generation aerospace composites and energy storage applications  ap. 701-710.  aA novel chemical method was developed to graft carbon nanotubes (CNTs) onto carbon fiber (CF) by direct covalent bonding to form a CNT–CF hierarchical reinforcing structure. The grafting via ester linkage (formed at a low temperature of 70 °C without using any contaminating catalyst or coupling agent) was evidenced by SEM, FTIR, RAMAN, XPS and XRD spectroscopy. The CNT failure stress obtained from in situ SEM pulling out experiments varied from 25 to 31 GPa, depending on the grafting reaction conditions. CNT fracture was the only breaking mechanism observed from the pulling out experiments indicating an existence of a strong carbon–carbon covalent bonding at the CNT–CF interface and the real grafting strength was actually higher than the measured failure stress. This high grafting strength can significantly increase the interfacial and impact properties desirable in next generation advanced aerospace composite structures. Further, the CNT attachments on CF led to increased electrochemical capacitance properties by rapid ion diffusion through active CNT sites and defects created during grafting. The fibrous film of CNT–CF exhibits a specific capacitance that is 3.5 times greater than that of CF, indicating substantial promise as a material for fabricating textile supercapacitors with superior strength, flexibility and performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acapacitance 3acarbon 3acarbon fibers 3acarbon nanotubes 3acatalysts 3achemical bonding 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3afabrics 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 0aCarbon nanotubes 0aHierarchical reinforcement 0aCovalent grafting 0aAdvanced composites 0aFlexible supercapacitor1 aDeng, Yan1 aTong, Liyong1 aFaisal, Shaikh N.1 aRoy, Anup K.1 aMinett, Andrew I.1 aGomes, Vincent G.0 tCarbon.g2016 Jan., v. 96 p.701-710dElsevier Ltdx0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2015.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03140naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245015800172300001800330520184800348592002802196650001602224650003302240650001902273650001302292650002502305650002502330650002202355700006202377700002002439700005902459700006002518773011902578856008402697852000902781655001202790IND60742068120221121033754.0210622e20210528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074206812DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.1c009902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHouck, Matthew B.10aToward Taming the Chemical Reversibility of Perfluoropyridine through Molecular Design with Applications to Pre- and Postmodifiable Polymer Architectures  ap. 5586-5594.  aPolymer functionality greatly determines many of the key properties of these materials, such as glass-transition temperature, electrical and thermal conductivity, thermal stability, mechanical strength, and processability. Despite the importance of polymer functionality in determining material properties, the synthesis of functional polymers, with well-defined molecular weights and compositions, can still present a significant challenge, with many of the methods related to pre- or postpolymerization modification lacking synthetic scope, or requiring harsh functionalization conditions or transition-metal coupling reactions to install the desired functionality. Perfluoroaromatic systems are promising for the preparation of novel polymer architectures given that they can be readily functionalized using simple nucleophilic chemistries under very mild basic conditions. While promising, these systems have displayed some drawbacks. Previous work has shown that perfluoroaromatics, such as perfluoropyridine, can demonstrate a high degree of chemical reversibility with heteroatom nucleophiles. If the synthetic potential of these systems is to be realized, then a strategy for the rational design of stable monomers must be developed. Herein, we report the design, synthesis, and characterization of a series of unexplored heteroatom-based ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP)-active monomers containing a reactive perfluoropyridine pendent group, which can be used to readily prepare a wide variety of aryl ether-functionalized polymers, using both pre- and postpolymerization modification strategies. We also establish a direct connection between the dihedral angle of the monomer and its propensity to undergo reversible addition reactions, establishing functional criteria for the design of pre- and postmodifiable systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis bases 3aglass transition temperature 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3astrength (mechanics) 3athermal conductivity 3athermal stability1 aFuhrer, Timothy J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2405-87441 aPhelps, Cole R.1 aBrown, Loren C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7346-73391 aIacono, Scott T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2313-26180 tMacromolecules.g2021 May 28, v. 54, no. 12 p.5586-5594dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.1c009903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01222naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002100112245004900133300001400182500001900196520029100215592002800506650001200534650002100546650001000567650001500577650001200592650002800604653001200632653002400644700001600668700001800684700002200702773015100724852000900875655001200884IND60716924620221120124015.0201107e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071692462DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeyathilakan, N.10aTraumatic myiasis in a Rhode Island Red cock  ap. 79-81.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA case of cutaneous myiasis was reported in a 1½ year old Rhode Island Red cock.

Faeces of Infected hosts contain oocysts that are a source of new infections when ingested. As a consequence, we expect that the main route of coccidiosis transmission in the wild is related to the foraging behaviour of the hosts, and that bird species are exposed to infective oocysts, depending upon the way of foraging. We studied how prevalence and intensity of isosporan infection in wild birds are related to foraging stratum, gregariousness, and diet.

Properties of pectin depend on the string‐like structure (conformation, stiffness) of the molecules that determines their mutual interaction and with the surrounding environment. Therefore, in this review the primary, secondary, and structures of higher levels of pectin chains are discussed in relation to external factors including crosslinking mechanisms. The review shows that the primary structure of pectin is relatively well known, however, we still know little about the conformation and properties of the more realistic systems of higher orders involving side chains, functional groups, and complexes of pectin domains. In particular, there is lack of knowledge on the influence of postharvest changes and extraction method on the primary and secondary structure of pectin that would affect conformation in a given environment and assembly to higher structural levels. Exploring the above‐mentioned issues will allow to improve our understanding of pectin functionality and will help to tailor new functionalities for the food industry based on natural but often biologically variable source. The review also demonstrates that atomic force microscopy is a very convenient and adequate tool for the evaluation of pectin conformation since it allows for the relatively straightforward stretching of the pectin molecule in order to measure the force‐extension curve which is directly related to its stiffness or flexibility.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aapples 3aatomic force microscopy 3acell walls 3acrosslinking 3afood industry 3afood safety 3afruits 3apectins1 aPieczywek, Piotr M.1 aCybulska, Justyna0 tComprehensive reviews in food science and food safety.g2021 Jan., v. 20, no. 1 p.1101-1117dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:J000000062x1541-43377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1541-4337.126893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04876naa a2200817 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245013500159300001800294500001400312520255300326592002802879650001502907650002102922650002502943650002302968650002302991650002203014650002403036650002303060650001903083650002103102650002803123650001703151650002403168650001803192650001603210650002103226650001203247650001603259650001603275650001203291650002103303650001503324650003103339650002003370650001103390650002503401650001603426650001103442650001203453650001703465650002003482650002103502650001703523650001203540650001703552650002203569650001303591650001503604650001303619650001603632651001003648700002103658700002503679700002203704700002403726700001603750700001503766700001603781700001803797700002203815773012603837856007403963852000904037655001204046IND60714750420221118114759.0201024e20201021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071475042DNAL7 a10.1039/d0fo02147d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPereira, A. G.10aCulinary and nutritional value of edible wild plants from northern Spain rich in phenolic compounds with potential health benefits  ap. 8493-8515.  aNAL-light  aWild edible plants (WEPs) have been consumed since ancient times. They are considered as non-domesticated plants that grow spontaneously in nature, particularly in forests and bushlands, where they can be found and collected to be incorporated into human nutrition. Increasingly, WEPs are gaining importance as they are potential sources of food due to their nutritional value, besides showing positive health effects and offer innovative applications in haute cuisine. As these autochthonous plants grow naturally in the environment, they are more suitable to adapt to different climatic conditions as well as biotic and abiotic factors. Therefore, a door has been opened for their possible cultivation as they seem to require fewer expenses than other commercially cultivated plants. Moreover, the consumers demand for new products of natural origin that are sustainable and ecologically labeled have also boosted WEPs’ recovery and incorporation into the market. In addition, they are considered as promising sources of essential compounds needed not only in human diet including carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids but also of other minor compounds as phenols, vitamins, or carotenoids that have shown numerous beneficial bioactivities such as antioxidants, anti-inflammatory, or anti-tumor activity. The use of these plants rich in bioactive molecules could be beneficial from the health point of view as the human body is not always capable of producing enough defenses, for instance, preventing oxidative damage. In particular, the presence of phenolic compounds in these vegetal matrices is supposed to provide a prophylactic effect against further pathogenesis and disorders related to aging or oxidative stresses. Regarding all this information based on traditional knowledge and ethnobotanical data, different WEPs found in the Northwestern region of Spain were selected, namely, Mentha suaveolens, Glechoma hederacea, Prunus spinosa, Apium nodiflorum, Artemisia absinthium, Silybum marianum, Picris hieracioides, Portulaca oleracea, Crithmum maritimum, and the genus Amaranthus. However, even though tradition and popular knowledge are excellent tools for the exploitation of these plants, it is necessary to develop regulations in this aspect to assure safety and veracity of food products. This article aims to review the main aspects of their bioactive properties, their traditional use, and the possibility of their incorporation into the market as new functional foods, looking at innovative and healthy gastronomic applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmaranthus 3aApium nodiflorum 3aArtemisia absinthium 3aCrithmum maritimum 3aGlechoma hederacea 3aMentha suaveolens 3aPicris hieracioides 3aPortulaca oleracea 3aPrunus spinosa 3aSilybum marianum 3aantineoplastic activity 3aantioxidants 3abioactive compounds 3acarbohydrates 3acarotenoids 3aclimatic factors 3acuisine 3aethnobotany 3afood plants 3aforests 3afunctional foods 3agastronomy 3ahealth effects assessments 3ahuman nutrition 3ahumans 3aindigenous knowledge 3ainformation 3alipids 3amarkets 3anew products 3anutritive value 3aoxidative stress 3apathogenesis 3aphenols 3aplant growth 3aprotective effect 3aproteins 3ashrublands 3avitamins 3awild plants 3aSpain1 aFraga-Corral, M.1 aGarcía-Oliveira, P.1 aJimenez-Lopez, C.1 aLourenço-Lopes, C.1 aCarpena, M.1 aOtero, Paz1 aGullón, P.1 aPrieto, M.

In this paper, three amphiphilic copolymers of mPEG-poly(ester-thioether), mPEG-poly(thioketal-ester) and mPEG-poly(thioketal-ester-thioether) were synthesized. The ROS-responsive behaviors of the three copolymers nanoparticles as drug carriers were investigated. The ROS-sensitivity was demonstrated by NMR, DLS, and SEM. mPEG-poly(ester-thioether) nanoparticles exhibited the fastest drug release rate, which possessed the best ROS sensitivity. The in vitro anticancer activity of the DOX-loaded nanoparticles was studied, the results revealed that the mPEG-poly(ester-thioether) nanoparticles showed the most efficient anticancer activity.

An interesting method for efficiently modulating the charge transport characteristics of graphene films by introducing double-gated graphene field-effect transistor structure and organic ferroelectric P(VDF-TrFE) as top gate dielectrics has been reported. The introduction of functional P(VDF-TrFE) gate dielectric is to modulate the charge transport characteristics of graphene by polarization doping effects, which provides us an alternative method to rule out the environmental effects on graphene and obtain the GFETs with improved performances. Moreover, bottom gating induced electrostatic doping effects are also found to be an effective way to highly control the top gated transfer characteristics of GFETs.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3aelectricity 3aelectronic equipment 3agraphene 3amodels1 aXie, Dan1 aXu, Jian-Long1 aLi, Xin-Ming1 aZhang, Cheng1 aDai, Rui-Xuan1 aLi, Xian1 aMeng, Xiang-Jian1 aZhu, Hong-Wei0 tCarbon.g2016 Jan., v. 96 p.695-700dElsevier Ltdx0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2015.10.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03662naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245014800161300001800309500001400327520186200341592002802203650002102231650001502252650001602267650001302283650001302296650001502309650001502324650001302339650001002352650001702362650001702379650003002396650001502426650000902441650001102450650001602461650001002477650002102487650001702508650000902525650001402534650000902548650000902557650001902566650001302585650001302598650001302611700002502624700002502649700002302674700003002697700001602727700001902743700002502762700001602787773012602803856007402929852000903003655001203012IND60714750520221118114943.0201024e20201021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071475052DNAL7 a10.1039/d0fo02153a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHussain, Muzahir10aGut inflammation exacerbates hepatic injury in C57BL/6J mice via gut-vascular barrier dysfunction with high-fat-incorporated meat protein diets  ap. 9168-9176.  aNAL-light  aAim: Meat and its derivatives provide nutrients essential for human health. However, meat consumption, along with excessive fat intake, has been associated with gut inflammation, intestinal barrier dysfunction and alterations in gut microbiota. Herein, we investigated whether and how these changes in the intestinal barrier system affect the gut liver axis and hepatic injury and eventually lead to the progression of liver syndrome such as NAFLD. Methods: Mice were fed with high fat (60% kcal) or low fat (12% kcal) along with soybean (control), chicken and pork proteins (HFCH, HFP, LFCH, and LFP) for 12 weeks. The biomarkers for liver injury were investigated after meat protein intake along with the high fat. Findings: Greater amount of fat vacuoles visible in the H&E staining increased the inflammatory cell infiltration and disorganized liver structures were observed in the HFP-fed mice. Oil Red O staining revealed that the HFP-fed and HFCH-fed mice showed more lipid droplets, confirming the increased hepatic lipid accumulation. Potential serum markers for NAFLD, ALT and AST were increased in the HF meat diet groups. Key genes responsible for hepatic inflammation and lipogenesis, such as MCP-1, IL1-β and TNF-α were upregulated. HF meat protein diet-fed mice exhibited signs of compromised liver with increased levels of endotoxin in the liver and its binding protein in serum, upregulation of TLRs in the liver, and significant increase in TG, TC, LDL-C and HDL-C concentrations. Significance: Intestinal inflammation and barrier dysfunction aggravate liver injury and fibrosis due to the intake of HF meat protein diets in mice, which may contribute to the progress of liver injury and associated complications. Gut inflammation may directly contribute to the development of NAFLD, especially of the gut vascular barricade dysfunction.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding proteins 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3achickens 3adroplets 3aendotoxins 3afat intake 3afibrosis 3agenes 3ahuman health 3ainflammation 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3alead 3alipids 3alipogenesis 3aliver 3ameat consumption 3ameat protein 3amice 3anutrients 3aoils 3apork 3aprotein intake 3asoybeans 3astaining 3avacuoles1 aUmair Ijaz, Muhammad1 aAhmad, Muhammad Ijaz1 aKhan, Iftikhar Ali1 aBukhary, Syed Umar Farooq1 aKhan, Waqar1 aHussain, Sayed1 aHashmi, Majid Suhail1 aLi, Chunbao0 tFood & function.g2020 Oct. 21, v. 11, no. 10 p.9168-9176dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0fo02153a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03175naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001700186245014900203300001800352506007600370520147400446592002801920506003701948650001501985650002202000650001002022650002302032650002302055650001302078650002002091650001702111650002102128650001302149650002502162650001402187650002302201650002202224650001702246650001302263650001602276700002302292700002002315700002202335700002702357700002002384700002002404773011902424856008102543852000902624655001202633IND60576376520221207122846.0170804e20170616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057637652DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.7b003572doi7 aPMC58733242pmcid7 a285167732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeares, Adam10aAmphiphilic BODIPY-Hydroporphyrin Energy Transfer Arrays with Broadly Tunable Absorption and Deep Red/Near-Infrared Emission in Aqueous Micelles  ap. 6054-6070.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBODIPY-hydroporphyrin energy transfer arrays allow for development of a family of fluorophores featuring a common excitation band at 500 nm, tunable excitation band in the deep red/near-infrared window, and tunable emission. Their biomedical applications are contingent upon retaining their optical properties in an aqueous environment. Amphiphilic arrays containing PEG-substituted BODIPY and chlorins or bacteriochlorins were prepared and their optical and fluorescence properties were determined in organic solvents and aqueous surfactants. The first series of arrays contains BODIPYs with PEG substituents attached to the boron, whereas in the second series, PEG substituents are attached to the aryl at the meso positions of BODIPY. For both series of arrays, excitation of BODIPY at 500 nm results in efficient energy transfer to and bright emission of hydroporphyrin in the deep-red (640–660 nm) or near-infrared (740–760 nm) spectral windows. In aqueous solution of nonionic surfactants (Triton X-100 and Tween 20) arrays from the second series exhibit significant quenching of fluorescence, whereas properties of arrays from the first series are comparable to those observed in polar organic solvents. Reported arrays possess large effective Stokes shift (115–260 nm), multiple excitation wavelengths, and narrow, tunable deep-red/near-IR fluorescence in aqueous surfactants, and are promising candidates for a variety of biomedical-related applications.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3aboron 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3achlorins 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3amicelles 3anonionic surfactants 3aoctoxynol 3aoptical properties 3aorganic chemistry 3apolysorbates 3asolvents 3awavelengths1 aSatraitis, Andrius1 aAkhigbe, Joshua1 aSanthanam, Nithya1 aSwaminathan, Subramani1 aEhudin, Melanie1 aPtaszek, Marcin0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2017 June 16, v. 82, no. 12 p.6054-6070dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.joc.7b003573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01872naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245009900173300001600272520079700288592002801085650001501113650001101128650001901139650002301158650001301181650001301194650001101207700002101218700003501239700002101274700002001295700003101315773007101346856008401417852000901501655001201510IND60559523820221119204507.0170720e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055952382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2015.10.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBandosz, Teresa J.10aEvidence for CO2 reactive adsorption on nanoporous S- and N-doped carbon at ambient conditions  ap. 856-863.  aCO2 interactions with nanoporous S- and N-doped polymer-derived carbon and commercial wood-based carbon were investigated in a broad range of conditions. The results showed that during CO2 adsorption nitrogen and sulfur species as well as water were released from the carbon surface as a result of chemical reactions of the surface groups with CO2. Inelastic neutron scattering experiments provided the unprecedented ability to characterize very small amounts of CO2 and H2O and revealed for the first time their physical/chemical status in the confined space of nanoporous carbons. The results obtained suggest that the reactivity of the carbon surface should be considered when CO2 storage media are chosen and when CO2 is used as a probe to determine the microporosity of carbon materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3achemical reactions 3aneutrons 3anitrogen 3asulfur1 aSeredych, Mykola1 aRodríguez-Castellón, Enrique1 aCheng, Yongqiang1 aDaemen, Luke L.1 aRamírez-Cuesta, Anibal J.0 tCarbon.g2016 Jan., v. 96 p.856-863dElsevier Ltdx0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2015.10.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02915naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005700140245010800197500002000305520148600325592002801811650000801839650002001847650002001867650001401887650001301901650002701914650002301941650001301964650002001977650001401997650001402011700006102025700002202086700006202108700006102170700006402231773012602295856007502421852000902496655001202505IND60789510820221122231455.0220821e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078951082DNAL7 a10.1002/aps3.114102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFolk, Ryan A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5333-927310aHigh‐throughput methods for efficiently building massive phylogenies from natural history collections  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPREMISE: Large phylogenetic data sets have often been restricted to small numbers of loci from GenBank, and a vetted sampling‐to‐sequencing phylogenomic protocol scaling to thousands of species is not yet available. Here, we report a high‐throughput collections‐based approach that empowers researchers to explore more branches of the tree of life with numerous loci. METHODS: We developed an integrated Specimen‐to‐Laboratory Information Management System (SLIMS), connecting sampling and wet lab efforts with progress tracking at each stage. Using unique identifiers encoded in QR codes and a taxonomic database, a research team can sample herbarium specimens, efficiently record the sampling event, and capture specimen images. After sampling in herbaria, images are uploaded to a citizen science platform for metadata generation, and tissue samples are moved through a simple, high‐throughput, plate‐based herbarium DNA extraction and sequencing protocol. RESULTS: We applied this sampling‐to‐sequencing workflow to ~15,000 species, producing for the first time a data set with ~50% taxonomic representation of the “nitrogen‐fixing clade” of angiosperms. DISCUSSION: The approach we present is appropriate at any taxonomic scale and is extensible to other collection types. The widespread use of large‐scale sampling strategies repositions herbaria as accessible but largely untapped resources for broad taxonomic sampling with thousands of species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3acitizen science 3adata collection 3adatabases 3aherbaria 3ainformation management 3amanagement systems 3ametadata 3anatural history 3aphylogeny 3aprotocols1 aKates, Heather R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8490-22011 aLaFrance, Raphael1 aSoltis, Douglas E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8638-41371 aSoltis, Pamela S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9310-86591 aGuralnick, Robert P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6682-15040 tApplications in plant sciences.g2021 Feb., v. 9, no. 2 p.e11410-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:19710x2168-04507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aps3.114103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02894naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245014700169300001600316520146700332592002801799650001801827650002501845650003101870650002501901650001301926650001501939650001201954650002101966650002201987650001102009650003002020650002502050650001102075650001802086653002702104653001602131653002302147653001602170700001902186700002102205773011902226856008202345852000902427655001202436IND60533635620221121112432.0190411e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053363562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2015.06.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Shiang-Peng10aModulatory effect of CpG oligodeoxynucleotide on a DNA vaccine against nervous necrosis virus in orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides)  ap. 919-926.  aWe report the development of a DNA vaccine pcMGNNV2 against nervous necrosis virus (NNV), a leading cause of mass mortality in grouper larvae. In addition, the modulatory effect of CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN), a Toll-like receptor 9 agonist, on the DNA vaccine was evaluated. The DNA vaccine alone elicited the production of NNV-specific antibodies, indicating that the vaccine was capable of triggering adaptive humoral response. Furthermore, significant induction of TLR9, Mx and IL-1β was observed in the spleen on day 7 post-vaccination, supporting that the vaccine could trigger TLR9 signaling. The incorporation of CpG ODN at high dose did not significantly affect the level of NNV-specific antibodies, but was able to moderately enhance the expression of Mx and IL-1β on day 7, indicating its ability in modulating innate response. After challenge with NNV, the vaccine alone enhanced the survival rate in infected larvae at both 1 and 2 weeks post-vaccination. The combination of CpG ODN further increased the survival rate at week 1 but not week 2. Interestingly, at week 2 the ODN appeared to induce a Th1-like response, as indicated by upregulation of T-bet (a Th1 marker) and downregulation of GATA-3 (a Th2 marker). Thus, the results suggest that the boosted Th1 response by CpG ODN does not augment the protection efficacy of pcMGNNV2 vaccine. To our best knowledge, this is the first report of a successful DNA vaccine against NNV in grouper.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetanodavirus 3aEpinephelus coioides 3aGATA transcription factors 3aToll-like receptor 9 3aagonists 3aantibodies 3agrouper 3ahumoral immunity 3ainterleukin-1beta 3alarvae 3aoligodeoxyribonucleotides 3arecombinant vaccines 3aspleen 3asurvival rate 0aNervous necrosis virus 0aDNA vaccine 0aToll-like receptor 0aEpinephelus1 aPeng, Ran-Hong1 aChiou, Pinwen P.0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2015 Aug., v. 45, no. 2 p.919-926dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2015.06.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02959naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245012100166300001400287520151800301592002801819650002701847650002701874650000901901650001701910650001101927650001601938650000901954650001301963650001501976650001301991650001102004650001902015650001802034651001002052653002702062653001902089653002702108653001602135653003202151700002002183700001302203700005602216773010902272856008702381852000902468655001202477IND60582948820221120152615.0181002e20171201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058294882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2017.07.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Fan10aRole of biological soil crusts in affecting soil evolution and salt geochemistry in hyper-arid Atacama Desert, Chile  ap. 54-64.  aEight soil profiles, either barren or covered with biological soil crusts (BSCs), were sampled at multiple depths in a remote valley in the Atacama Desert, Chile, to explore the impact of BSCs on soil evolution and salt geochemistry. BSC sites had thicker soil profiles compared to non-BSC sites, which could be a result of past geological processes and also partially accounted for by the establishment of BSCs that can help limit erosion and promote significant soil accumulation. The greater abundances of fine particles below BSCs could essentially be attributed to the ability of BSCs to trap more fine grains. The generally higher salt ion inventories but smaller salt ion concentrations in soil profiles beneath BSCs were probably due to that BSCs can promote the retention of salt ions and insoluble dust simultaneously, but the latter to a greater extent. Nitrate oxygen isotopes indicated the predominant existence of atmospheric nitrate in the soils, suggesting biological processes of BSCs may not significantly impact the ion accumulation or distribution in the underlying soils. A mechanism of consistent soil accumulation via the retention of atmospheric deposition and occasional interruption of subsurface collapsing due to erosion processes was proposed to explain the development of soil profiles and different landscape features as well as the role of BSCs in soil evolution in this study area. The soil ages were estimated to be around 440ky based on the proposed soil accumulation mechanism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric deposition 3abiological soil crusts 3adust 3ageochemistry 3agrains 3ainventories 3aions 3aisotopes 3alandscapes 3anitrates 3aoxygen 3asoil formation 3asoil profiles 3aChile 0aBiological soil crusts 0aAtacama Desert 0aNitrate oxygen isotope 0aChlorine 36 0aSoil accumulation mechanism1 aMichalski, Greg1 aLuo, Hao1 aCaffee, Marc1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6846-89670 tGeoderma.g2017 Dec. 01, v. 307 p.54-64dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl16374x0016-70617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2017.07.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02858naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005900140245007800199500002000277520139700297592002801694596004201722596004201764650001901806650001301825650001401838650001201852650001801864650001301882650001501895650002201910650001801932650002001950650002001970700002401990700002102014700005302035700006402088700006202152773012602214856007502340852000902415655001202424IND60789511020221123001205.0220821e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078951102DNAL7 a10.1002/aps3.114092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarx, Hannah E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3526-787810aPilot RNA‐seq data from 24 species of vascular plants at Harvard Forest  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPREMISE: Large‐scale projects such as the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) collect ecological data on entire biomes to track climate change. NEON provides an opportunity to launch community transcriptomic projects that ask integrative questions in ecology and evolution. We conducted a pilot study to investigate the challenges of collecting RNA‐seq data from diverse plant communities. METHODS: We generated >650 Gbp of RNA‐seq for 24 vascular plant species representing 12 genera and nine families at the Harvard Forest NEON site. Each species was sampled twice in 2016 (July and August). We assessed transcriptome quality and content with TransRate, BUSCO, and Gene Ontology annotations. RESULTS: Only modest differences in assembly quality were observed across multiple k‐mers. On average, transcriptomes contained hits to >70% of loci in the BUSCO database. We found no significant difference in the number of assembled and annotated transcripts between diploid and polyploid transcriptomes. DISCUSSION: We provide new RNA‐seq data sets for 24 species of vascular plants in Harvard Forest. Challenges associated with this type of study included recovery of high‐quality RNA from diverse species and access to NEON sites for genomic sampling. Overcoming these challenges offers opportunities for large‐scale studies at the intersection of ecology and genomics.  aPublisher supplied data  a#1550838cNational Science Foundation  a#1750280cNational Science Foundation 3aclimate change 3adiploidy 3aevolution 3aforests 3agene ontology 3agenomics 3apolyploidy 3asequence analysis 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3avascular plants1 aJorgensen, Stacy A.1 aWisely, Eldridge1 aLi, Zheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6894-96161 aDlugosch, Katrina M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7302-66371 aBarker, Michael S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7173-13190 tApplications in plant sciences.g2021 Feb., v. 9, no. 2 p.e11409-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:19710x2168-04507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aps3.114093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02349naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245011000167300001600277520127300293592002801566650002201594650001301616650001301629650001101642650002101653650001901674650003701693700001501730700001901745700002401764700001501788700002001803773007101823856008401894852000901978655001201987IND60559524120221119204712.0170720e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055952412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2015.10.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Weiwei10aInterface and interfacial reactions in multi-walled carbon nanotube-reinforced aluminum matrix composites  ap. 919-928.  aThe interface and interfacial reactions in Al-matrix composites reinforced with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were thoroughly investigated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy combined with a precisely controlled heat treatment in the solid state. It was shown that MWCNT (002) formed a coherent interface with the low-index Al planes of Al (111), Al (220), and Al (002), realizing a stable interface. Aluminum carbides (Al4C3) were preferentially formed at the active prism plane edges sited at the open ends and acid treatment-induced surface nanodefects of MWCNTs. The Al4C3 maintained the shape of the pristine MWCNT and showed a typical orientation relationship with the Al matrix, that is, Al (111)//Al4C3 (001). It was suggested that the diffusion of Al atoms through Al4C3 dominated the growth of Al4C3; the Al4C3 originated at the open MWCNT tips may quickly grow in the <100> direction of the MWCNT, while the nanodefect-originated Al4C3 may grow simultaneously in the <110> and <100> directions of the MWCNT. The activation energy of Al4C3 formation, the appearance of twinning in single-crystal Al4C3, and the possible influence of the Al4C3 formation on the enhancement of load transfer at the MWCNT/Al interface were also studied.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aaluminum 3acarbides 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3aheat treatment 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aBang, Sora1 aKurita, Hiroki1 aMiyazaki, Takamichi1 aFan, Yuchi1 aKawasaki, Akira0 tCarbon.g2016 Jan., v. 96 p.919-928dElsevier Ltdx0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2015.10.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03923naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002200190245016400212300001800376506007600394520183900470592002802309506003702337650003602374650002102410650002302431650002002454650001202474650001402486650001402500650002702514650002102541650001302562650001802575700006302593700006302656700001702719700001902736700001802755700002202773700002002795700002002815700001502835700002402850700006002874700006202934700005602996700002003052700006403072773011703136856008303253852000903336655001203345IND60600783720221207092127.0180704e20180516xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060078372DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.8b000882doi7 aPMC71877282pmcid7 a297679602pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOdokonyero, Denis10aComparison of Alicyclobacillus acidocaldariuso-Succinylbenzoate Synthase to Its Promiscuous N-Succinylamino Acid Racemase/o-Succinylbenzoate Synthase Relatives  ap. 3676-3689.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aStudying the evolution of catalytically promiscuous enzymes like those from the N-succinylamino acid racemase/o-succinylbenzoate synthase (NSAR/OSBS) subfamily can reveal mechanisms by which new functions evolve. Some enzymes in this subfamily have only OSBS activity, while others catalyze OSBS and NSAR reactions. We characterized several NSAR/OSBS subfamily enzymes as a step toward determining the structural basis for evolving NSAR activity. Three enzymes were promiscuous, like most other characterized NSAR/OSBS subfamily enzymes. However, Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius OSBS (AaOSBS) efficiently catalyzes OSBS activity but lacks detectable NSAR activity. Competitive inhibition and molecular modeling show that AaOSBS binds N-succinylphenylglycine with moderate affinity in a site that overlaps its normal substrate. On the basis of possible steric conflicts identified by molecular modeling and sequence conservation within the NSAR/OSBS subfamily, we identified one mutation, Y299I, that increased NSAR activity from undetectable to 1.2 × 10² M–¹ s–¹ without affecting OSBS activity. This mutation does not appear to affect binding affinity but instead affects kcₐₜ, by reorienting the substrate or modifying conformational changes to allow both catalytic lysines to access the proton that is moved during the reaction. This is the first site known to affect reaction specificity in the NSAR/OSBS subfamily. However, this gain of activity was obliterated by a second mutation, M18F. Epistatic interference by M18F was unexpected because a phenylalanine at this position is important in another NSAR/OSBS enzyme. Together, modest NSAR activity of Y299I AaOSBS and epistasis between sites 18 and 299 indicate that additional sites influenced the evolution of NSAR reaction specificity in the NSAR/OSBS subfamily.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAlicyclobacillus acidocaldarius 3abinding capacity 3acatalytic activity 3aenzyme activity 3aenzymes 3aepistasis 3aevolution 3agermplasm conservation 3amolecular models 3amutation 3aphenylalanine1 aMcMillan, Andrew W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8005-52251 aRamagopal, Udupi A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1045-98381 aToro, Rafael1 aTruong, Dat P.1 aZhu, Mingzhao1 aLopez, Mariana S.1 aSomiari, Belema1 aHerman, Meghann1 aAziz, Asma1 aBonanno, Jeffrey B.1 aHull, Kenneth G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3697-95511 aBurley, Stephen K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2487-97131 aRomo, Daniel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3805-092X1 aAlmo, Steven C.1 aGlasner, Margaret E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1818-19650 tBiochemistry.g2018 May 16, v. 57, no. 26 p.3676-3689dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19162x1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b000883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02956naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245011700170300001700287520158600304592002801890650001901918650002001937650001501957650001001972650001701982650002101999650001602020650001302036650003302049650001502082650001602097650001402113650001602127651001102143700002202154700002202176700002102198700002002219700002502239700002602264773011802290856008102408852000902489655001202498IND60523241320221119170118.0160609e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052324132DNAL7 a10.1007/s10482-016-0700-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLinnakoski, Riikka14aThe Ophiostoma clavatum species complex: a newly defined group in the Ophiostomatales including three novel taxa  ap. 987-1018.  aTwo species of blue-stain fungi with similar morphologies, Ophiostoma brunneo-ciliatum and Ophiostoma clavatum, are associates of bark beetles infesting Pinus spp. in Europe. This has raised questions whether they represent distinct taxa. Absence of herbarium specimens and contaminated or mistakenly identified cultures of O. brunneo-ciliatum and O. clavatum have accentuated the uncertainty regarding their correct identification. The aim of this study was to reconsider the identity of European isolates reported as O. brunneo-ciliatum and O. clavatum by applying DNA-based identification methods, and to provide appropriate type specimens for them. Phylogenetic analyses of the ITS, βT, TEF-1α and CAL gene sequences revealed that the investigated isolates represent a complex of seven cryptic species. The study confirmed that ITS data is insufficient to delineate species in some Ophiostoma species clusters. Lectotypes and epitypes were designated for O. clavatum and O. brunneo-ciliatum, and three new species, Ophiostoma brunneolum, Ophiostoma macroclavatum and Ophiostoma pseudocatenulatum, are described in the newly defined O. clavatum-complex. The other two species included in the complex are Ophiostoma ainoae and Ophiostoma tapionis. The results suggest co-evolution of these fungi in association with specific bark beetles. The results also confirm the identity of the fungus associated with the pine bark beetle Ips acuminatus as O. clavatum, while O. brunneo-ciliatum appears to be mainly associated with another pine bark beetle, Ips sexdentatus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIps acuminatus 3aIps sexdentatus 3aOphiostoma 3aPinus 3abark beetles 3ablue-stain fungi 3acoevolution 3aherbaria 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3alectotypes 3anew species 3aphylogeny 3auncertainty 3aEurope1 aJankowiak, Robert1 aVillari, Caterina1 aKirisits, Thomas1 aSolheim, Halvor1 aBeer, Z.

We presented the polarization-dependent, periodic DIC images and intensities of single AuNSs at their localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) wavelengths with high sensitivity. Furthermore, we demonstrated that single AuNSs protrude multiple branches that can be used as individual sensors with DIC polarization anisotropy. Thus, unlike conventional Au nanorod (AuNR) probes, single AuNSs were presented as multispectral optical sensors that can provide detailed information such as rotational motions and rotational speeds at different branches of their star-like structure in dynamic environments.  aRetracted: July 22022, v.58(57), p.8000 ; 10.1039/d2cc90238azWe, the named authors, hereby wholly retract this Chemical Communications article.

However, at reduced temperature, the high surface tension of Ga causes the limited spreading-ability over the supporting substrate, which prevents the formation of large-area graphene. Here we present that the addition of Cu could efficiently decrease the surface tension of Ga, thus achieving a larger coverage. We succeeded in growing large-area, uniform and single-layer graphene at 800 °C by atmospheric chemical vapour deposition using CH4 as the carbon source.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acopper 3agraphene 3amethane 3asurface tension 3atemperature 3avapors1 aChen, Linfeng1 aWu, Nian1 aKong, Zhizhi1 aZeng, Mengqi1 aZhang, Tao1 aZhuang, Lin1 aFu, Lei0 tCarbon.g2016 Jan., v. 96 p.799-804dElsevier Ltdx0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2015.10.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02583naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245015300162300001800315520126400333592002801597650001701625650002601642650001301668650001001681650001501691650001401706650001401720650001401734650001801748650002201766651001001788700001901798700001801817700001301835700001601848700001501864700001501879700001501894700001901909773011901928856008102047852000902128655001202137IND60523241520221119170237.0160609e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052324152DNAL7 a10.1007/s10482-016-0702-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Yanxia10aComparative analyses of phenotypic methods and 16S rRNA, khe, rpoB genes sequencing for identification of clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae  ap. 1029-1040.  aThe present work aimed to evaluate 16S rRNA, khe and rpoB gene sequencing for the identification of Klebsiella pneumoniae in comparison with phenotypic methods. Fifteen clinical isolates were examined, which were initially identified as K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae using the automated VITEK 32 system in two hospitals in Enshi City, China. Their identity was further supported by conventional phenotypic methods on the basis of morphological and biochemical characteristics. Using Bayesian phylogenetic analyses and haplotypes network reconstruction, 13 isolates were identified as K. pneumoniae, whereas the other two isolates (K19, K24) were classified as Shigella sp. and Enterobacter sp., respectively. Of the three genes, 16S rRNA and khe gene could discriminate the clinical isolates at the genus level, whereas rpoB could discriminate Klebsiella at the species and even subspecies level. Overall, the gene tree based on rpoB is more compatible with the currently accepted classification of Klebsiella than those based on 16S rRNA and khe genes, showing that rpoB can be a powerful tool for identification of K. pneumoniae isolates. Above all, our study challenges the utility of khe as a species-specific marker for identification of K. pneumoniae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterobacter 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3aShigella 3agenes 3ahaplotypes 3ahospitals 3aphenotype 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3aChina1 aGuo, Xianguang1 aXiang, Shifei1 aLi, Jiao1 aLi, Xiaoqin1 aXiang, Hui1 aHe, Jinlei1 aChen, Dali1 aChen, Jianping0 tAntonie van Leeuwenhoek.g2016 July, v. 109, no. 7 p.1029-1040dSpringer International Publishingx0003-60727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10482-016-0702-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03192naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100002400167245014500191300001600336520146900352592002801821650002101849650002501870650002801895650001101923650001401934650001801948650001601966650001301982650001601995650001602011650001602027650001202043650001402055650002302069650003702092650003702129650001202166650004302178650004502221650004202266650005102308650004502359650003802404700001902442773012002461856008402581852000902665655001202674IND4458803120221119224024.0141111e20110715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445880312DNAL7 a215964442pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2011.04.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHulme-Moir, K. Lisa10aSub-cellular localisation of alkaline phosphatase activity in the cytoplasm of tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii) neutrophils and eosinophils  ap. 126-132.  aAlkaline phosphatase (ALP) has been used in studies of neutrophil morphology and function as a marker for identifying different granule populations. In human neutrophils, ALP is found within secretory vesicles, a rapidly mobilisable vesicle population important for upregulating membrane receptors during early activation. Intra-cellular ALP activity in the heterophils of rabbits and guinea pigs, in contrast, is found only in secondary granules. The neutrophils and eosinophils of tammar wallabies (Macropus eugenii) have previously been reported to contain large amounts of ALP activity when stained using routine cytochemical techniques. To define the subcellular location of ALP in this species, cell suspensions were examined using cerium chloride cytochemistry and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). ALP was found in 2 distinct cytoplasmic compartments. One compartment displayed morphology consistent with a subpopulation of secondary granules while a second tubulo-vesicular population appeared similar to the secretory vesicles of human neutrophils. Thin tubular vesicles containing ALP were also identified within the cytoplasm of tammar wallaby eosinophils. Large numbers of ALP-containing vesicles have not been recognised previously in eosinophils and this may represent a novel cytoplasmic compartment. In both cell types, ALP-containing structures showed alteration in morphology following stimulation with N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP) and PMA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMacropus eugenii 3aalkaline phosphatase 3acell suspension culture 3acerium 3achlorides 3acytochemistry 3aeosinophils 3agranules 3aguinea pigs 3aheterophils 3aneutrophils 3arabbits 3areceptors 3asecretory granules 3atransmission electron microscopy 2aAlkaline Phosphatasexmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aCytoplasmxenzymologyxultrastructure. 2aEosinophilsxenzymologyxultrastructure. 2aMacropodidaeximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Transmissionxveterinary 2aNeutrophilsxenzymologyxultrastructure. 2aSubcellular Fractionsxenzymology1 aClark, Phillip0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2011 July 15, v. 142, no. 1-2 p.126-132dElsevier B.V.x0165-24277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2011.04.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01964naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245007300168300001600241520100500257592002801262650001301290653004401303653003201347653003501379700002001414700002201434773012701456856008201583852000901665655001201674IND60599898520221122225732.0180702e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059989852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csda.2012.07.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHorová, Ivana,10aFull bandwidth matrix selectors for gradient kernel density estimate  ap. 364-376.  aThe most important factor in multivariate kernel density estimation is a choice of a bandwidth matrix. This choice is particularly important, because of its role in controlling both the amount and the direction of multivariate smoothing. Considerable attention has been paid to constrained parameterization of the bandwidth matrix such as a diagonal matrix or a pre-transformation of the data. A general multivariate kernel density derivative estimator has been investigated. Data-driven selectors of full bandwidth matrices for a density and its gradient are considered. The proposed method is based on an optimally balanced relation between the integrated variance and the integrated squared bias. The analysis of statistical properties shows the rationale of the proposed method. In order to compare this method with cross-validation and plug-in methods the relative rate of convergence is determined. The utility of the method is illustrated through a simulation study and real data applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3avariance 0aAsymptotic mean integrated square error 0aMultivariate kernel density 0aUnconstrained bandwidth matrix1 aKoláček, Jan,1 aVopatová, Kamila0 tComputational statistics & data analysis.g2013 Jan., v. 57, no. 1 p.364-376dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3109x0167-94737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2012.07.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02372naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245012400165500002000289520115400309592002801463596005301491650002401544650001201568650001301580650001401593650002601607650001801633700001901651700002001670700006301690700005901753773012601812856007501938852000902013655001202022IND60789511420221123001048.0220821e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078951142DNAL7 a10.1002/aps3.114182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurtscher, Wesley P.10aArea from image analyses accurately estimates dry‐weight biomass of juvenile tissue from the moss Ceratodon purpureus  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPREMISE: Mosses have long served as models for studying many areas of plant biology. Investigators have used two‐dimensional measurements of juvenile growth from photographs as a surrogate for dry‐weight biomass. The relationship between area and biomass, however, has not been critically evaluated. METHODS: Here we grew axenic tissue cultures of 10 Ceratodon purpureus isolates to study the relationship between these parameters. We measured area and biomass on replicate cultures with two distinct starting inoculum sizes each week for three weeks. We then examined the correlation between area and biomass as well as the influence of variation in inoculum size on both parameters. RESULTS: We found a strong correlation between area and biomass after two weeks of growth. Furthermore, we found inoculum size affected biomass during the first week of growth but not in subsequent weeks and inoculum size had no detectable effect on area. DISCUSSION: These analyses provide experimental confirmation that area is a suitable proxy for biomass and provide clear guidelines for when inoculum size variation may affect downstream growth estimates.  aPublisher supplied data  aDEB 1541005cDirectorate for Biological Sciences 3aCeratodon purpureus 3abiomass 3ainoculum 3ajuveniles 3amosses and liverworts 3aplant biology1 aList, Marna A.1 aPayton, Adam C.1 aMcDaniel, Stuart F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5435-73771 aCarey, Sarah B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6431-06600 tApplications in plant sciences.g2021 Apr., v. 9, no. 4 p.e11418-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:19710x2168-04507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aps3.114183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03729naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245017000165300001400335520197700349592002802326650001102354650001002365650001902375650002402394650001102418650002802429650002602457650002302483650001702506650002902523650002202552650001402574650001802588650001302606650000702619650001002626650001502636650002902651650001802680650003702698651001002735653003302745653002602778653001802804653002602822653001702848700001402865700001402879700001502893700001402908700002002922773010302942856008503045852000903130655001203139IND60645579520221118065542.0190617e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064557952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2019.05.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Zhi10aSoil chemical properties and geographical distance exerted effects on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal community composition in pear orchards in Jiangsu Province, China  ap. 18-24.  aArbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are considered to be natural biofertilizers because they provide the host with mineral nutrients, particularly phosphorus. However, there is insufficient information on AMF community compositions and their determining factors in pear orchard soils. In this study, hypotheses tested were that both soil characteristics and geographical distance influence the variation in AMF community composition. The community composition and diversity of AMF were examined using MiSeq sequencing in nine pear orchard soils in Jiangsu Province, China. Our data showed that a total of 108 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified, with the majority belonging to Glomus (>90%). Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) plots and PERMANOVA based on Bray-Curtis distance showed a clear separation of soil samples, suggesting significant dissimilarities in the AMF communities among the nine sampling sites. Distance-decay relationship (DDR) curves revealed that both geographical distance and soil chemical properties affect AMF community composition. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and forward selection were used to examine the significance of environmental factors in more detail, and found that soil chemical properties and geographical distance correlated with AMF community composition. Particularly, pH, available phosphorus (AP) and Cu were the most significant soil properties that affected AMF communities. Partial CCA demonstrated that soil chemical properties exerted the primary influence on the assembly of the AMF communities in pear orchard soils, while geographical distance was less influential, which was supported by a partial Mantel analysis. Overall, we concluded that soil chemical properties and geographical distance were important parameters that affected AMF communities in Jiangsu Province, China, and the soils with moderate level of AP and low contents of heavy metals may preserve diverse AMF communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlomus 3aPyrus 3abiofertilizers 3acommunity structure 3acopper 3acorrespondence analysis 3aenvironmental factors 3afungal communities 3aheavy metals 3amultidimensional scaling 3amycorrhizal fungi 3anutrients 3aorchard soils 3aorchards 3apH 3apears 3aphosphorus 3asoil chemical properties 3asoil sampling 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3aChina 0aArbuscular mycorrhizal fungi 0aCommunity composition 0aSoil property 0aGeographical distance 0aPear orchard1 aZhao, Fei1 aWang, Min1 aQi, Kaijie1 aWu, Juyou1 aZhang, Shaoling0 tApplied soil ecology.g2019 Oct., v. 142 p.18-24dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl55717x0929-13937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2019.05.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02310naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245012800170300001600298520095300314536019001267592002801457650001801485650001601503650001601519653002101535653002601556653001901582653003001601700001401631700002701645700001401672700002601686700001901712773011101731856008501842852000901927655001201936IND60731576020221121184448.0210320e20210317xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073157602DNAL7 a10.1080/07373937.2019.16777042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndrés, R.

These systems have been successfully used to assist drying of different products at laboratory level. This work deals with the development, integration, and testing of a new APU transducer with a stepped-grooved circular radiator as an initial step in scaling up the process and the results achieved in experiments of airborne atmospheric freeze-drying (AFD) of apples. The results confirm that ultrasound application leads to a significant intensification of the processes. The modeling shows that the increase of kinetic parameters was lower than those obtained with cylindrical transducers having the same electrical input. This fact is attributed to the treatment of greater volume.  aThis work has been supported by the project DPI2012-37466-C03-01 funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competiveness and by the project RTA2015-00060-C04-02 funded by INIA-ERDF.  aPublisher supplied data 3afreeze drying 3atemperature 3aultrasonics 0aPower ultrasound 0aultrasonic processing 0amass transport 0aatmospheric freeze-drying1 aRiera, E.1 aGallego-Juárez, J.

A total of 12,800 aerial prey items were identified from 32 food boluses. 97.3% of the prey items were insects, most of which (96%) were from the orders Coleoptera, Diptera, Hemiptera and Hymenoptera. Other orders represented were Dermaptera, Ephemeroptera, Lepidoptera, Mecoptera, Psocoptera and Thysanoptera. Spiders made up 2.6% of the prey items. Prey sizes ranged from 0.5 mm (body length) to 9.7 mm (average 2.46 mm, SD 0.90). There was substantial variation in the prey types among the 32 food boluses, both at the level of orders and of families. Prey size was more similar among the boluses suggesting that prey size was more important than prey type to the swifts. The results are in agreement with previous studies of swift diets.  aPublisher supplied data 0aPlain Swift 0aApus unicolor 0anestling diet 0afeeding ecology 0aTenerife 0aCanary Islands 0aoceanic islands1 aCollins, Charles T.1 aVolpone, Nicholas W.0 tArdea.g2010 Oct., v. 98, no. 2 p.211-215dNetherlands Ornithologists' Unionx0373-22667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5253%2F078.098.02113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03168naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245013100154300001800285500001900303520186400322592002802186650001102214650001602225650001302241650002902254650001902283650002502302650001402327650002002341650001902361650001102380650001502391650001702406650001802423650001402441650000902455700001702464700001802481700001502499773012502514856007402639852000902713655001202722IND60714751320221118114952.0201024e20201005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071475132DNAL7 a10.1039/d0gc01505a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Kai10aAmino acid-functionalized polyampholytes as natural broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents for high-efficient personal protection  ap. 6357-6371.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAirborne pollutants including particulate matter (PM) and microorganisms threaten public health. Fibrous filters in personal protection equipment have shown good PM removal ability but a poor biocidal effect. Herein, a series of highly biocompatible amino acid-grafted enzymatic hydrolysis lignin derivatives (EHL-AA-x) with both cationic/anionic groups were synthesized by nucleophilic substitution. The structures of EHL-AA-x were characterized by NMR, FT-IR, GPC, DLS, potentiometric titration, surface charge and elemental analysis. In vitro biological assays showed that the inhibition efficiency of EHL-AA-x against Gram-negative bacteria increased from 10 to 57% when the grafting amount of amino acids varied from 0 to 0.62 mmol g⁻¹ at a concentration of 10 mg mL⁻¹, while that against Gram-positive bacteria reached 99%. It is not only 4 times higher than that of birch wood hydrotropic lignin, but also comparable to that of lignin/nanosilver composites. The morphological changes observed by SEM indicated that EHL-AA-x damaged the cell membrane of bacteria, suggesting a membrane disruption mechanism. QCM-D and AFM analysis showed that the increase of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between EHL-AA-x and bacteria is the key factor for the improvement of the antimicrobial activity. Subsequently, a mask fabricated from the optimal EHL-AA-x-coated non-woven fabrics could inhibit >95% bacteria in 30 min, while a number of living bacteria were detected on the inner layer of the control commercial mask. In addition, the mask with EHL-AA-x could prevent the adhesion of bacteria by the formation of anionic and cationic hydration layers. Using this strategy, ideal lignin-based antimicrobial materials with good bacteriostatic activity and anti-bio-adhesion properties could be designed and used in personal protection equipment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetula 3aLewis bases 3aadhesion 3aantibacterial properties 3acell membranes 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aequipment 3agreen chemistry 3ahydrophobicity 3alignin 3ananosilver 3aparticulates 3apublic health 3atitration 3awood1 aQiu, Xueqing1 aYang, Dongjie1 aQian, Yong0 tGreen chemistry.g2020 Oct. 5, v. 22, no. 19 p.6357-6371dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0gc01505a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02982naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013300164300001600297520126400313592002801577650002501605650002001630650001501650650001601665650001601681650000901697650001001706650001501716650002001731650002101751650002201772650001201794650001401806650001401820650001501834650001101849650001601860650003201876650002901908650001601937650001301953650001401966653002501980653004102005653002402046653000902070653001202079700001502091700001602106700001302122700001802135700001702153773011902170856008202289852000902371655001202380IND60533636220221120152654.0190411e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053363622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2015.06.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Nannan10aProtective efficacy of recombinant hemolysin co-regulated protein (Hcp) of Aeromonas hydrophila in common carp (Cyprinus carpio)  ap. 297-304.  aMotile aeromonad septicemia (MAS) caused by Aeromonas hydrophila is one of the common bacterial causes of fish mortalities. Prophylactic vaccination against this and other diseases is essential for continued growth of aquaculture. The type VI secretion system (T6SS) plays a crucial role in the virulence of A. hydrophila. The hemolysin co-regulated protein (Hcp) is an integral component of the T6SS apparatus and is considered a hallmark of T6SS function. Here, the T6SS effector Hcp was expressed and characterized, and its immunogenicity and protective efficacy were evaluated in common carp (Cyprinus carpio). Hcp secretion was found to be strongly induced by low temperature in A. hydrophila. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that Hcp is conserved among A. hydrophila strains of different origins. The vaccination with recombinant Hcp resulted in an increased survival (46.67%) in common carp during a 10-day challenge time compared to non-vaccinated fish (7.14%). The vaccinated fish also showed the significantly increased levels of IgM antibody in serum and cytokines such as inerleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in kidney, spleen and gills. The recombinant Hcp shows promise as a vaccine candidate against A. hydrophila.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAeromonas hydrophila 3aCyprinus carpio 3aantibodies 3aaquaculture 3ablood serum 3afish 3agills 3ahemolysins 3aimmune response 3aimmunoglobulin M 3ainterleukin-1beta 3akidneys 3amortality 3asecretion 3asepticemia 3aspleen 3atemperature 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3atype VI secretion system 3avaccination 3avaccines 3avirulence 0aAeromonas hydrophila 0aHemolysin co-regulated protein (Hcp) 0aProtective efficacy 0aFish 0aVaccine1 aWu, Yafeng1 aPang, Maoda1 aLiu, Jin1 aLu, Chengping1 aLiu, Yongjie0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2015 Oct., v. 46, no. 2 p.297-304dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2015.06.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02734naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245011900162300001600281520165800297592002801955653002301983653002202006653002202028653003502050653001702085653001402102700002202116700003102138700002002169700002202189773009802211856007802309852000902387655001202396IND60125071520221122232523.0151102e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012507152DNAL7 a10.5253/078.098.02122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoisbleau, Maud10aSexual Dimorphism and use of Morphological Measurements to Sex Adults, Immatures and Chicks of Rockhopper Penguins  ap. 217-224.  aFollowing recent phylogenetic work, Rockhopper Penguins were suggested to consist of two or three species. For the Southern Rockhopper Penguin Eudyptes c. chrysocome, sexual dimorphism has not been studied in detail, and only a few previous studies on penguins have investigated sexual dimorphism in immatures and chicks. Using data in the literature, we examined whether the sexual dimorphism of adults varies among the three taxa of Rockhopper Penguins and then we investigated the most reliable measurements to sex adult Rockhopper Penguins. We observed that bill length is the most useful measurement to separate males from females. To allow for sex discrimination in the field, we also examined a large dataset of Southern Rockhopper Penguins from New Island, Falkland Islands, including adults sexed via observation of behaviour, and immatures and chicks sexed genetically. We found that male adults and immatures were larger than females in bill length and bill depth and, to a lesser degree, in flipper lengths. We thus derived discriminant functions from bill length and bill depth and correctly sexed 96.2% of adults and 91.8% of immatures. In newly hatched chicks, males had a longer bill than females, but sexing was only successful for 63.5% of hatchlings. Just before the crèèche age (18 and 19 days) and after the pre-fledging moult (55 days and older), all morphological measurements of chicks were significantly different between sexes, and sex determination was successful for 68.2% and 84.3% of chicks in these age groups, respectively. Consistently among age groups, bill length was the most dimorphic character in this population.  aPublisher supplied data 0aRockhopper Penguin 0asex determination 0asexual dimorphism 0adiscriminant function analysis 0agrowth curve 0aage class1 aDemongin, Laurent1 aNoordwijk, Hendrika J. van1 aStrange, Ian J.1 aQuillfeldt, Petra0 tArdea.g2010 Oct., v. 98, no. 2 p.217-224dNetherlands Ornithologists' Unionx0373-22667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5253%2F078.098.02123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01552naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245032700161300001600488520030700504592002800811650002800839650001300867650001400880653001900894653002700913653002800940653001300968700002100981773015001002856007701152852000901229655001201238IND60521801220221120052942.0160531e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052180122DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1987-02182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMöhrle, Hans10aLactamacetale als potentielle Enamin-Synthone in Heterocyclensynthesen 3.

To this end, we report here a novel strategy to simultaneously detect genetic and metabolic markers using commercial PCR kits with cucurbit[8]urils (CB[8]) implemented to manipulate the activity of Taq DNA polymerase. CB[8] binds with the nonionic surfactants and displaces them from the polymerase surface, resulting in decreased enzyme activity. Meanwhile, the inhibited enzyme can be reversibly activated when spermine, the downstream metabolite of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), is present in the sample, which competitively binds to CB[8] and recovers polymerase activity. CB[8] was implemented in conventional PCR kits not only to reduce false-positive results but also to extend the detection range of PCR technology. With this novel method to detect ODC in cell lysates containing both the nucleotides and intracellular metabolites, positive results were only observed in highly active HEK 293T cells, whereas silent cells treated with ODC inhibitor showed negative readouts, therefore providing a simple but elegant dual-modality PCR method for precision diagnosis.  aPublisher supplied data  aNSFCc, National Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aBE2020696cGovernment of Jiangsu Provincedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002949 3aDNA-directed DNA polymerase 3aanalytical chemistry 3aenzyme activity 3ametabolites 3anucleotides 3aornithine decarboxylase 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aspermine 3atranscription (genetics)1 aXu, Mingjie1 aZhou, Huimin1 aYan, Kun1 aDuan, Shiqi1 aXue, Dandan1 aWang, Youmei1 aDi, Bin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1907-17361 aHu, Chi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9720-27620 tAnalytical chemistry.g2022 June 07, v. 94, no. 24 p.8715-8723dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c011033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03398naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245009800158500001400256520192600270592002802196650001602224650001402240650001302254650001902267650001202286650002802298650002602326650001202352650001902364650001102383650001102394650001402405650001902419650001502438650001502453650001102468650001602479650001702495650003202512650001602544650001602560650001002576650001102586651001102597700003302608700002402641773012102665856007302786852000902859655001202868IND60718891520221116214512.0201126e20201123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071889152DNAL7 a10.3390/f111112312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMura, Claudio 10aStable Allometric Trajectories in Picea abies (L.) Karst. Trees along an Elevational Gradient  aNAL-light  aThe effect of temperature on tree phenology and growth has gained particular attention in relation to climate change. While a number of reports indicate that warming can extend the length of the growing season and enhance tree growth rates, it is still debated whether temperature also affects biomass partitioning. Addressing the question of whether trees grown at different elevations invest similarly in various organs, we established four sites along an elevational gradient (320 to 595 m a.s.l.) in managed Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karts) stands regenerating after clearcuts in central Norway. There, differences in temperature, bud break, tree growth, and allometric scaling were measured in small spruce trees (up to 3 m height). The results showed that bud break and shoot growth are affected by temperature, as lower sites completed the bud break process 5 days earlier than the higher sites did. There was some evidence indicating that the summer drought of 2018 affected tree growth during the season, and the implications of this are discussed. The allometric scaling coefficients did not change for the crown volume (slope value range 2.66–2.84), crown radius (0.77–0.89), and tree diameter (0.89–0.96) against tree height. A slight difference was found in the scaling coefficients of crown length against tree height (slope value range 1.04–1.12), but this did not affect the general scaling of the crown volume with tree height. Our results showed that different local environmental conditions affect both the growth rate and phenology in Norway spruce trees but, on the contrary, that the biomass partitioning among different parts of the tree remains essentially unchanged. This demonstrates that the allometric approach is an important tool for unraveling true vs. apparent plant plasticity, which in turn is an essential awareness for predicting plant responses to environmental changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea abies 3aallometry 3abudbreak 3aclimate change 3adrought 3adry matter partitioning 3aenvironmental factors 3aforests 3agrowing season 3akarsts 3alength 3aphenology 3aplant response 3aplasticity 3aprediction 3asummer 3atemperature 3atrajectories 3atree and stand measurements 3atree growth 3atree height 3atrees 3avolume 3aNorway1 aStrømme, Christian  Bianchi1 aAnfodillo, Tommaso 0 tForests.g2020 Nov. 23, v. 11, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f111112313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02928naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245011200167300001600279520147600295592002801771650001701799650004201816650001801858650002301876650002601899650002801925650001501953650001101968650004401979650001502023653001402038653003602052653001802088653002302106653002402129700001702153700001702170700001302187700001702200700001602217700001802233700001802251773008402269856008402353852000902437655001202446IND60564864920221121124729.0170713e20160915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056486492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2016.06.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOu, Changjin10aCoupling of iron shavings into the anaerobic system for enhanced 2,4-dinitroanisole reduction in wastewater  ap. 457-466.  aPacking of iron powder into anaerobic system is attractive for enhancing removal of recalcitrant pollutants from wastewater, but is limited by various inherent drawbacks of iron powder, such as easy precipitation and poor mass transfer. To address the above issues, iron shavings were packed into an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) for enhancing 2,4-dinitroanisole (DNAN) reduction in this study, with system stability and microbial biodiversity emphasized. The results showed that both DNAN reduction and 2,4-diaminoanisole (DAAN) formation could be notably improved in the iron shavings coupled UASB system. Moreover, the ability to resist environmental stress was also strengthened through the addition of iron shavings in the UASB reactor. Compared with a loose and rough surface of the sludge in the control UASB reactor, the sludge in the coupled system presented a compact, rigid and granular appearance under iron shavings simulation. Furthermore, high throughput sequencing analysis indicated that the diversity of microbial community in the iron shavings coupled UASB system was significantly higher than that of the control UASB reactor. Additionally, species related to DNAN reduction and methane production were enriched in the coupled system. The observed long-term stable performance highlights the full-scale application potential of iron shavings coupled anaerobic sludge process for the treatment of nitroaromatic compounds containing wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3amass transfer 3amethane production 3amicrobial communities 3anitroaromatic compounds 3apollutants 3asludge 3aupflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor 3awastewater 0aReduction 0aUpflow anaerobic sludge blanket 0aIron shavings 0a2,4-Dinitroanisole 0aMicrobial community1 aShen, Jinyou1 aZhang, Shuai1 aMu, Yang1 aHan, Weiqing1 aSun, Xiuyun1 aLi, Jiansheng1 aWang, Lianjun0 tWater research.g2016 Sept. 15, v. 101 p.457-466dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2016.06.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03723naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001500141245009400156300001600250500002000266520165000286592002801936596004101964596010202005596008602107650000902193650001202202650001202214650001902226650001102245650001602256650001402272650001202286650001402298650001002312650001702322650001002339650001602349650000802365650000902373650002402382650002102406650002202427650001102449650001302460650001302473650001102486650002602497650000902523650002002532650001802552650001202570650001502582650001402597650002302611650002002634650001002654651001502664651001102679651002302690700001502713700002302728773014302751856007602894961002202970852000902992655001203001IND60621158920221121114706.0200115e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062115892DNAL7 a10.1093/ajae/aav0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlen, Beau10aIrrigation Decisions for Major West Coast Crops: Water Scarcity and Climatic Determinants  ap. 254-275.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis article uses the 2007 Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey database developed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to assess the impact of water scarcity and climate on irrigation decisions for producers of specialty crops, wheat, and forage crops. We estimate an irrigation management model for major crops in the West Coast (California, Oregon, and Washington), which includes a farm‐level equation of irrigated share and crop‐specific equations of technology adoption and water application rate (orchard/vineyard, vegetable, wheat, alfalfa, hay, and pasture). We find that economic and physical water scarcity, climate, and extreme weather, such as frost, extreme heat, and drought, significantly impact producers’ irrigation decisions. Producers use sprinkler technologies or additional water applications to mitigate risk of crop damage from extreme weather. Water application rates are least responsive to surface water cost or groundwater well depth for producers of orchard/vineyard. Water supply institutions influence producers’ irrigation decisions. Producers who receive water from federal agencies use higher water application rates and are less likely to adopt water‐saving irrigation technologies for some crops. Institutional arrangements, including access to distinct water sources (surface or ground) and whether surface water cost is fee based, also affect the responsiveness of water application rates to changes in surface water cost. The analysis provides valuable information about how producers in irrigated agricultural production systems would respond and adapt to water pricing policies and climate change.  aPublisher supplied data  a1039192cNational Science Foundation  a2012‐70002‐19388cU.S. Department of Agriculture's National Institute of Food and Agriculture  a58‐0111‐14‐020cU.S. Department of Agriculture's Office of Chief Economists 3aUSDA 3aalfalfa 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acoasts 3acrop damage 3adatabases 3adrought 3aequations 3afarms 3aforage crops 3afrost 3agroundwater 3ahay 3aheat 3ainnovation adoption 3airrigation rates 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3aorchards 3apastures 3aprices 3aproduction technology 3arisk 3aspecialty crops 3asurface water 3asurveys 3avegetables 3avineyards 3awater conservation 3awater shortages 3awheat 3aCalifornia 3aOregon 3aWashington (state)1 aWu, JunJie1 aLangpap, Christian0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g2016 Jan., v. 98, no. 1 p.254-275dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44932x0002-90927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ajae/aav0363Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/OCEUSDA/NIFA  aDNAL 7aarticle02657naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245011300164300002000277520157400297592002801871650001701899650003101916650001101947650001301958650001101971650002301982650001302005650002702018650001402045650001602059700001802075773012302093856008202216852000902298655001202307IND60562281220221118103047.0170206e20161110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056228122DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b086962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Peng-Wei10aSynergistic Effects of Bound Micelles and Temperature on the Flexibility of Thermoresponsive Polymer Brushes  ap. 11595-11606.  aThe persistence length is a key parameter for the quantitative interpretation of the flexibility of polymers. We have studied complexes composed of a spherical poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) brush and a sodium dodecyl sulfate micelle in an effort to characterize the flexibility of tethered PNIPAM below the lower critical solution temperature TLCST. An analytical mean-field model is used to describe the persistence length Lₚ in a broad range of ψ, the number of bound micelles per chain. The persistence length of micelle-constrained PNIPAM is quantitatively correlated with the thermal energy kBT, electrostatic repulsion fC, and effective excluded-volume parameter νₑff. The persistence length per ψ, which depends on T and fC, is found to scale with a synergistic effect fC/(ψkBT). The results reveal that the bound-micelle charges affecting the persistence length are analogous to the fixed charges of polyelectrolytes, though the bound micelles are separated by a large number of neutral monomers. The extension ⟨L⟩ of micelle-constrained PNIPAM decreases as ⟨L⟩ ∼ fC–ᵝF with fC, where βF ≈ 0.58–0.8 depending on ψ, but as the universal power law ⟨L⟩ ∼ (fC/kBT)⁻⁰.⁶ with the synergistic effect fC/(kBT), irrespective of ψ. In spite of the intricate interplay among the multiple components in the system, the extension scales as a function of νₑff as ⟨L⟩ ∼ (νₑff/ψLₚ)⁻ᵝⱽ, where βV ≈ 0.35 for the significant monomer interaction and βV ≈ 0.2 for the weak or negligible monomer interaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrolytes 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aenergy 3amicelles 3amodels 3aphysical chemistry 3apolymers 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3asynergism 3atemperature1 aChen, Luguang0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2016 Nov. 10, v. 120, no. 44 p.11595-11606dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcb.6b086963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02654naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001200150245009300162300001800255520105500273592002801328596009801356596008401454596012801538650002501666650001501691650001401706650001701720650001101737650001301748650001601761650001701777650002801794650002601822700001901848700001301867700001601880700001201896700001801908700005901926773012901985856008502114852000902199655001202208IND60780680820221119020442.0220621e20220606xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078068082DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.2c011132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Yu10aOptogenetic Control of Background Fluorescence Reduction for CRISPR-Based Genome Imaging  ap. 8724-8731.  aThe CRISPR/dCas9 system has become an essential tool for live-cell imaging of genomic loci, but it has limited applications in imaging low-/non-repetitive genomic loci due to the strong nuclear background noise emerging from many untargeted fluorescent modules. Here, we propose an optogenetically controlled background fluorescence reduction strategy that combines the CRISPR-SunTag system with a light-inducible nuclear export tag (LEXY). Utilizing the SunTag system, multiple copies of LEXY-tagged sfGFP were recruited to the C-terminal dCas9, recognizing the target genomic loci. As the nuclear export sequence at the C-terminal LEXY could be exposed to pulsed blue light irradiation, the untargeted nuclear labeling modules were light controllably transferred to the cytoplasm. Consequently, genomic loci containing as few as nine copies of repeats were clearly visualized, and a significant increase in the signal-to-noise ratio was achieved. This simple and controllable method is expected to have a wide range of applications in cell biology.  aPublisher supplied data  a21890743cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aXDB29050100cChinese Academy of Sciencesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002367  a2017YFA0205503cMinistry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002855 3aanalytical chemistry 3ablue light 3acytoplasm 3afluorescence 3agenome 3agenomics 3airradiation 3aoptogenetics 3aphysiological transport 3asignal-to-noise ratio1 aWang, Dianbing1 aLu, Song1 aGuo, Dongge1 aLi, Min1 aCui, Mengmeng1 aZhang, Xian'en,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1347-31680 tAnalytical chemistry.g2022 June 06, v. 94, no. 24 p.8724-8731dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c011133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02882naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002700154245010200181300001200283520124200295592002801537650002301565650002001588650002901608650002601637650002301663650001601686650002501702650001501727650001401742650001001756650002001766650001001786650001801796650001801814650002001832650001601852653002301868653002601891653002301917653001201940653002001952700002901972700003002001700002602031700003102057700003302088700002302121773009802144856008902242852000902331655001202340IND60526866620221122001049.0190410e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052686662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocontrol.2015.12.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Mota, Paulo Roberto10aExpression analysis of the α-1,2-mannosidase from the mycoparasitic fungus Trichoderma harzianum  ap. 1-4.  aA range of hydrolytic enzymes are involved in mycoparasitism, including chitinases, β-glucanases and proteases. Recent studies of Trichoderma harzianum interaction with certain phytopathogens have shown that other enzymes may also be involved in this mechanism, among them α-1,2-mannosidases. These enzymes play an essential role in glycoprotein recycling in filamentous fungi, but nothing is known about their role in mycoparasitism. The aim of this work was to study the expression of the α-1,2-mannosidase gene from T. harzianum (Th) after growth on cell walls of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (CWSS), Fusarium solani (CWFS) and Fusarium oxysporum (CWFO). The expression of this gene was also analyzed during the interaction between T. harzianum and these phytopathogens in dual culture. A significant increase in expression was observed when T. harzianum was grown in the presence of CWSS (4.5-fold), CWFS (18-fold) and CWFO (75-fold), compared to the control. In dual culture experiments a marked upregulation (58-fold) was observed during Th x F. oxysporum confrontation. These data suggest that the composition of the cell wall of F. oxysporum is an important inducer of expression of the α-1,2-mannosidases gene from T. harzianum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium oxysporum 3aFusarium solani 3aSclerotinia sclerotiorum 3aTrichoderma harzianum 3abiological control 3acell growth 3acell wall components 3acell walls 3achitinase 3afungi 3agene expression 3agenes 3aglycoproteins 3amycoparasites 3aplant pathogens 3aproteinases 0aBiological control 0aTrichoderma harzianum 0aα-1,2-mannosidase 0aqRT-PCR 0aGene expression1 aRibeiro, Marcela Suriani1 ade Castro Georg, Raphaela1 aSilva, Gabrielle Rosa1 ade Paula, Renato Gracciano1 aSilva, Roberto do Nascimento1 aUlhoa, Cirano Jose0 tBiological control.g2016 Apr., v. 95 p.1-4dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48419x1049-96447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2015.12.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01748naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245010800161300001600269520035500285536037300640592002801013650001501041650001601056650001201072651001001084653002001094653001901114653001301133653002701146700001701173700001901190773009701209856008301306852000901389655001201398IND60760982520221120144642.0211224e20211203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076098252DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.1074.728232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Bing10a﻿Four new species of the spider genus Synagelides Strand, 1906 from South China (Araneae, Salticidae)  ap. 175-189.  a﻿AbstractFour new species of the jumping spider genus Synagelides Strand, 1906 from Guizhou and Yunnan, China are described: Synagelides angustus sp. nov.

Spatial patterns of diversity were overlaid on a patch‐based graphical model and then compared within and among three species that co‐occurred across five Great Plains watersheds. Species differing in reproductive strategy (benthic vs. pelagic‐spawning) were hypothesized to have different patterns of genetic diversity, but the overriding factor shaping contemporary patterns of diversity was the signature of past climates and geological history. Allelic diversity was significantly higher at southern latitudes for Cyprinella lutrensis and Hybognathus placitus, consistent with northward expansion from southern Pleistocene refugia. Within the historical context, all species exhibited lowered occupancy and abundance in heavily fragmented and drier upstream reaches, particularly H. placitus; a pelagic‐spawning species, suggesting rates of extirpation have outpaced losses of genetic diversity in this species. Within most tributary basins, genetically diverse populations of each species persisted. Hence, reconnecting genetically diverse populations with those characterized by reduced diversity (regardless of their position within the riverine network) would provide populations with greater genetic and demographic resilience. We discuss cases where cross‐basin transfer may be appropriate to enhance genetic diversity and mitigate negative effects of climate change. Overall, striking similarities in genetic patterns and in response to fragmentation and dewatering suggest a common strategy for genetic resource management in this unique riverine fish assemblage.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCyprinella lutrensis 3aHybognathus 3abasins 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adewatering 3afish 3agenetic variation 3alandscapes 3alatitude 3amodels 3arefuge habitats 3aresource management 3arivers 3aspecies diversity 3awatersheds 3aGreat Plains region1 aPerkin, Joshuah S.1 aGido, Keith B.1 aTurner, Thomas F.0 tMolecular ecology.g2014 Dec., v. 23, no. 23 p.5663-5679dBlackwell Scientific Publicationsx0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.129703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02213naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245011700169300002000286520108200306592002801388650001901416650002501435650001101460650002901471650002201500650001101522650002401533650001601557700002001573700002201593773016901615856008201784852000901866655001201875IND60678091320221121121916.0191213e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067809132DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-019-06638-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUmmalla, Mallesh10aNexus among the hydropower energy consumption, economic growth, and CO2 emissions: evidence from BRICS countries  ap. 35010-35022.  aThe present paper investigates the effects of hydropower energy consumption on economic growth and CO₂ emissions in the BRICS countries, spanning the period 1990–2016. To achieve this aim of the study, we employ the panel autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model and panel quantile regression (PQR) estimations. The results confirm that hydropower energy consumption has a positive association with economic growth in the long run and short run, and negative association with CO₂ emissions in the long run. Further, our panel quantile regression showed that the effects of independent variables on economic growth and CO₂ emissions are heterogeneous across the quantiles. Specifically, the effect of hydropower energy use significantly promotes economic growth across all quantiles (expect 10th quantile), while hydropower energy use has a negative and positive impact on CO₂ emissions in the lower and higher quantiles, respectively. Given these findings, our study offers substantial value to empirical literature and also provides important policy implications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aeconomic development 3aenergy 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3aregression analysis 3awater power1 aSamal, Asharani1 aGoyari, Phanindra0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2019 Dec., v. 26, no. 34 p.35010-35022dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-06638-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02948naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245013400160300001800294520166800312592002801980650001102008650001902019650001902038650002202057650002502079650001602104650001202120650002002132650002102152650001802173650002202191650000902213650001802222650002602240651001602266700001702282700001702299773012602316856007502442852000902517655001202526IND60758609320221120180638.0211130e20211129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075860932DNAL7 a10.1039/d1gc02997e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Dongseong10aEvaluating the environmental impacts of formic acid production from CO₂: catalytic hydrogenation vs. electrocatalytic reduction  ap. 9470-9478.  aCarbon capture and utilization (CCU) technology provides a promising approach for minimizing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and fossil resource depletion. Formic acid (FA) is a valuable chemical that can be produced using various CCU technologies; so it is necessary to explore the environmental impacts of potential FA production technologies. This study quantified the two major environmental impacts (climate change and fossil depletion) for two CCU strategies (catalytic and electrocatalytic CO₂-based FA production) and compared them with the conventional strategy. Life cycle assessments were conducted for the integrated conversion and separation processes carried out in the Yeosu Industrial Complex in the Republic of Korea based on the literature data and simulation study. The results showed that the CCU strategies could reduce GHG emissions by 97%–132% (1.43–1.95 kg of CO₂ eq. per kg of pure FA) and save 69%–94% (0.56–0.78 kg oil eq. per kg of pure FA) of fossil resources compared with the conventional strategy. The major environmental drivers were identified for all strategies, and it was clear that the utility input was a major contributor to the environmental burden in all strategies. Scenarios in which the utility source and raw material supply were varied were analyzed to determine how to effectively reduce the environmental impact of CO₂-based FA production. Finally, several implications were proposed for the development of an environmentally feasible electrocatalytic CO₂-based FA production strategy: (1) improving the energy efficiency in reaction and separation and (2) introducing renewable electricity sources.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3aenergy efficiency 3aenvironmental impact 3aformic acid 3afossils 3agreen chemistry 3agreenhouse gases 3ahydrogenation 3amineral resources 3aoils 3araw materials 3arenewable electricity 3aSouth Korea1 aByun, Jaewon1 aHan, Jeehoon0 tGreen chemistry.g2021 Nov. 29, v. 23, no. 23 p.9470-9478dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1gc02997e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02807naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245008000172300001600252520126900268592002801537650002701565650002001592650002101612650002101633650002301654650002601677650002601703650001801729650001701747650001501764650001001779650001301789650001601802650004401818650001001862651001701872653002001889653001801909653002601927653002101953653002101974653002701995700002502022700002002047773014002067856008502207852000902292655001202301IND60678702720221120130133.0200121e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067870272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytol.2019.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohamed, Gamal A.10aAntimicrobial metabolites from the endophytic fungus Aspergillus versicolor  ap. 152-155.  aTwo new diaryl ether derivatives [aspergillethers A (4) and B (5)] and five known metabolites [(22E,24R)-stigmasta-5,7,22-trien-3-β-ol (1), stigmasta-4,6,8(14),22-tetraen-3-one (2), orcinol (3), and butyrolactones I (6) and VI (7)] were separated from the endophytic fungus Aspergillus versicolor (Aspergillaceae) isolated from the roots of Pulicaria crispa Forssk (Asteraceae) growing in Saudi Arabia.

Moreover, their catalytic activity in terms of calcination temperature during preparation was investigated, and the HSiW@ZrO₂ hybrids calcinated at 300 °C exhibited the highest activity and the oleic acid (OA) conversion of 94.0% owing to the presence of the relatively high surface area, appropriate pore size and strong acidity. It was also revealed that the hybrids maintained as high as 82.0% even after nine cycles.

Based on both analysis and characters a new cave-dwelling species is described: Tityus (Tityus) spelaeussp. nov. from the Russão II cave, Posse, state of Goiás, Central Brazil. Characters such as the glandular regions of the female pectinal basal piece and basal middle lamellae of pectines, and the distribution of the ventral setae of telotarsi I–IV proved to be useful to constructing the taxonomy of species and species groups of Tityus. The new species is a member of the Tityus trivittatus species-group of Tityus (Tityus) and can be readily recognized by the immaculate coloration pattern and the more developed glandular region on the female pectinal basal piece. In addition, we provide a discussion of the phylogenetic relationships observed within Tityus, on the relevance of the new phenotypic characters to the modern taxonomy of the genus Tityus, and to the records of Brazilian cave scorpions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTityus 3acolor 3afemales 3anew species 3aphenotype 3aphylogeny 3asurveys 3aBrazil 0aCave 0aNeotropics 0ascorpion 0aSouth America 0astate of Goiás1 aPinto-da-Rocha1, Ricardo1 aGallão2, Jonas E.0 tZooKeys.g2021 Dec. 07, v. 1075 p.33-75dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2141x1313-29707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.1075.674593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03513naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245009200165300001800257520132100275592002801596596009801624596009801722596009801820596009801918596011202016596012802128596007602256596009502332650000802427650001802435650002502453650001102478650001302489650001202502650002102514700001602535700001202551700001802563700001602581700001802597700001502615700001802630700005802648700001402706700005202720773012902772856008502901852000902986655001202995IND60780681320221119020542.0220621e20220607xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078068132DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.2c013592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Jiao10aDNA-Programmed Orientation-Ordered Multivalent Microfluidic Interface for Liquid Biopsy  ap. 8766-8773.  aAptamer-functionalized microfluidic interfaces hold great potential for liquid biopsies owing to their programmable nature. However, most previous studies have focused on development of multivalent aptamers to improve binding affinity, while ignoring aptamer orientation on microfluidic interfaces, resulting in suboptimal accessibility and affinity. Herein, we report a Cubic DNA Nanostructure (CDN)-programmed strategy to precisely control the orientation and valency of the Aptamer on a microfluidic interface (CDN–Apt–Chip) for enhancing the capture and release of circulating tumor cells (CTCs). We demonstrate that the ordered orientation and multivalent configuration can synergistically increase the binding affinity of aptamers toward CTCs. By using CDN–Apt–Chip, we successfully isolated CTCs from the peripheral blood of T-cell leukemia patients and discriminated T-cell leukemia patients from healthy volunteers. Furthermore, the captured CTCs were nondestructively released via nuclease treatment. We then performed T-cell receptor sequencing on the released cells to demonstrate the compatibility with downstream analysis. Overall, this study provides a new paradigm for interface regulation of functional microfluidic chips and advances the clinical translation of aptamer-based liquid biopsy.  aPublisher supplied data  a21735004cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a21904085cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a21974112cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a21974113cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a20720210001cMinistry of Education of the People's Republic of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002338  a2021YFA0909400cMinistry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002855  a3502Z20189005cMedical and Health Program of Xiamendhttps://doi.org/NA  aJ1310024cNational Science Fund for Fostering Talents in Basic Sciencedhttps://doi.org/NA 3aDNA 3aT-lymphocytes 3aanalytical chemistry 3abiopsy 3aleukemia 3aliquids 3aoligonucleotides1 aLiu, Yilong1 aSu, Rui1 aZeng, Liuqing1 aHuo, Zixuan1 aPeng, Ruixiao1 aYu, Xiyuan1 aZhang, Huimin1 aYang, Chaoyong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2374-53421 aYang, Liu1 aZhu, Zhi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3287-49200 tAnalytical chemistry.g2022 June 07, v. 94, no. 24 p.8766-8773dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c013593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03218naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002900139245016900168300001800337520181900355592002802174650001602202650002002218650001402238650001302252650001302265650002802278650000902306650002702315650002502342650001502367650003502382651001802417700002102435700002102456700001802477700002202495700001802517700002002535700002202555773011302577856007302690852000902763655001202772IND60133287020221119064502.0150518e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013328702DNAL7 a10.1111/mec.129722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoore, Jean‐Sébastien10aConservation genomics of anadromous Atlantic salmon across its North American range: outlier loci identify the same patterns of population structure as neutral loci  ap. 5680-5697.  aAnadromous Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is a species of major conservation and management concern in North America, where population abundance has been declining over the past 30 years. Effective conservation actions require the delineation of conservation units to appropriately reflect the spatial scale of intraspecific variation and local adaptation. Towards this goal, we used the most comprehensive genetic and genomic database for Atlantic salmon to date, covering the entire North American range of the species. The database included microsatellite data from 9142 individuals from 149 sampling locations and data from a medium‐density SNP array providing genotypes for >3000 SNPs for 50 sampling locations. We used neutral and putatively selected loci to integrate adaptive information in the definition of conservation units. Bayesian clustering with the microsatellite data set and with neutral SNPs identified regional groupings largely consistent with previously published regional assessments. The use of outlier SNPs did not result in major differences in the regional groupings, suggesting that neutral markers can reflect the geographic scale of local adaptation despite not being under selection. We also performed assignment tests to compare power obtained from microsatellites, neutral SNPs and outlier SNPs. Using SNP data substantially improved power compared to microsatellites, and an assignment success of 97% to the population of origin and of 100% to the region of origin was achieved when all SNP loci were used. Using outlier SNPs only resulted in minor improvements to assignment success to the population of origin but improved regional assignment. We discuss the implications of these new genetic resources for the conservation and management of Atlantic salmon in North America.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmo salar 3adata collection 3adatabases 3agenomics 3agenotype 3aintraspecific variation 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apopulation structure 3aprovenance 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aNorth America1 aBourret, Vincent1 aDionne, Mélanie1 aBradbury, Ian1 aO'Reilly, Patrick1 aKent, Matthew1 aChaput, Gérald1 aBernatchez, Louis0 tMolecular ecology.g2014 Dec., v. 23, no. 23 p.5680-5697dBlackwell Scientific Publicationsx0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.129723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02961naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002100154245014900175300001400324520127300338592002801611650002901639650002501668650001101693650000901704650001401713650002301727650001201750650001201762650001201774650001301786650001201799650001001811650001401821650001801835650000901853650002201862650001401884650001601898650001501914650001601929650000901945653002801954653003001982653002902012653003602041700001902077700002202096700002102118700001802139773011502157856008902272961001302361852000902374655001202383IND60526867120221121030400.0190410e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052686712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocontrol.2016.01.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoble, Tarryn A.10aConidial production, persistence and pathogenicity of hydromulch formulations of Metarhizium brunneum F52 microsclerotia under forest conditions  ap. 83-93.  aMicrosclerotia granules of Metarhizium brunneum Petch strain F52 (Hypocreales: Clavicipitaceae) in a hydromulch formulation (water, wheat straw, and tackifier) were sprayed onto bark or wood samples, which were subsequently exposed on tree trunks for 4–30d, during two spray trials in 2013 and six spray trials in 2014. Microsclerotial granules in this formulation continued to produce many infective conidia over a 30d period in a forest. Greater conidial production was associated with periods of increased temperature, relative humidity and rainfall. When F52-hydromulch-treated samples, in the 2014 spray trials, were evaluated against adult Asian longhorned beetles, Anoplophora glabripennis (Motschulsky) (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), in 2 d-quarantine bioassays, insect mortality varied greatly for males (14–92%) and females (56–100%). Highest conidial densities (5.5×106conidia/cm2) were reached after 20–30d in the field and at these densities, female beetle median survival times ranged from 15.5 to 21.5d. Males died significantly slower in all spray trials.

More than a century of national annual data (1910–2011) is used in the empirical analysis. No constraints on asset fixity are imposed. Results indicate that, with rational expectations, both output categories as well as all input categories exhibit quasi‐fixity in response to market change and stochastic climate change. Crops adjust more than twice as fast as livestock—49% versus 20% of the way toward their long‐run equilibrium in one year. Fertilizer adjusts most rapidly toward equilibrium levels (88% in one year), and capital adjusts most slowly (5% in one year). Labor oscillates rather than converging smoothly toward equilibrium; its distance from equilibrium is the same as if it adjusted 59% of the way toward its optimal level in one year. Failing to anticipate climate change dramatically slows the estimated rate of adjustment for two netputs and modestly speeds the rate for two others, thus likely increasing overall adjustment costs. Failing to account for uncertainty in anticipated climate change has little impact on adjustment rates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural economics 3aassets 3acapital 3aclimate change 3acrops 3aempirical research 3afertilizers 3alabor 3amarkets 3amodels 3auncertainty 3aUnited States1 aShumway, C.

Browne is a genus of trees, strictly related to Toona, in the Meliaceae, a family of flowering plants in the order Sapindales, which is among the most diverse sources of secondary metabolites in the Angiospermae. The most abundant metabolites in these genera are limonoids, tetranortriterpenes possessing diverse structural features, apotirucallanes, tirucallanes, and other triterpenes. The chemical constituents isolated from the genera Cedrela and Toona over the past decades, together with their biological activities, have been compiled in this article. The allelochemical and the phytotoxic activity of limonoids and triterpenoids seem to play a crucial role in the ecological function of these metabolites. While, the most promising use in human field seems related to their antimalarial and anti-inflammatory effects, even that further investigation are still needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCedrela 3aToona 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantimalarials 3achemical composition 3aecological function 3ahumans 3alimonoids 3aphytotoxicity 3asecondary metabolites 3atrees1 aMilella, Luigi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5874-12371 aBraca, Alessandra1 aDe Tommasi, Nunziatina0 tPhytochemistry reviews.g2018 Aug., v. 17, no. 4 p.751-783dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870073x1568-77677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11101-018-9557-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02758naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002300154245011700177300001400294520152900308592002801837650002301865650001501888650002301903650001301926650002201939650001701961650001201978650001201990650001102002650001302013650001002026650002102036650001102057650002302068650001402091650001002105700002402115700002102139773010002160856005502260852000902315655001202324IND50064968420221119164700.0130413e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006496842DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1526-100X.2012.00907.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeisberg, Peter J.10aGallery Forest or Herbaceous Wetland? The Need for Multi‐Target Perspectives in Riparian Restoration Planning  ap. 12-16.  aMuch riparian restoration focuses on establishment of gallery forests, with relatively limited effort to restore herbaceous wetlands as key components of riparian landscape mosaics. Multiple reasons for this include inherent cultural or esthetic preferences, greater availability of scientific knowledge to support riparian forest restoration, and choices of ecological indicators commonly used for monitoring and assessment. Yet riparian herbaceous wetlands have declined dramatically as a result of river regulation and agricultural development, leading to losses of important habitats and ecosystem services that differ from those provided by gallery forests. As an alternative to a single‐minded focus on tree establishment, we advocate restoration of diverse and dynamic habitat mosaics in the context of natural variability of flow and sediment regimes. Landscape context should inform active restoration activities at the local scale, such that riparian forests are not planted in ecologically inappropriate sites. Models are needed to match life history requirements of particular wetland herbaceous plant species with details of flow and sediment transport regimes. We emphasize the importance of herbaceous wetlands as a critical and often overlooked component of riparian ecosystems, and the need for both passive and active restoration of fluvial marshes, sloughs, wet meadows, alkali meadows, off‐channel ephemeral ponds, and other critical floodplain communities associated with herbaceous plant dominance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aforest restoration 3ahabitats 3aherbaceous plants 3alife history 3amarshes 3ameadows 3amodels 3aplanning 3aponds 3ariparian forests 3arivers 3asediment transport 3asediments 3atrees1 aMortenson, Susan G.1 aDilts, Thomas E.0 tRestoration ecology.g2013 Jan., v. 21, no. 1 p.12-16dWiley Periodicals, Inc.x1061-29717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1526-100X.2012.00907.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03379naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245013000164520200400294592002802298650001502326650001702341650001602358650001502374650001502389650001102404650001502415650000902430651001002439653001502449653001502464653001702479653001502496653001902511653003002530700002102560700002202581700001702603700001502620700001602635700001702651700001602668700001502684773010402699856008502803852000902888655001202897IND60721074120221120073714.0211030e20210320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072107412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enggeo.2020.1059752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Xinli10aLandslide displacement prediction using kinematics-based random forests method: A case study in Jinping Reservoir Area, China  aPurely empirical and numerical methods are widely used in landslide movement prediction because they can forecast the failure time and consider influence factors, respectively. However, the combination of these two methods for prediction is rare. This paper develops an integrated landslide movement prediction model that can fully consider landslide kinematics and external influence factors using the Verhulst inverse function (VIF) and the random forest (RF) algorithm. The VIF is applied to describe the kinematic behavior of landslides using the rationale of three-stage creep deformation. The RF algorithm is to quantify the response of landslide displacement to the influence of external factors such as reservoir water level and rainfall intensities. The novelty of the VIF-RF model is illustrated by applying to a reservoir landslide, Gapa Landslide, in Southwestern China. The results show that the VIF-RF model shows significant improvement in predicting landslide movement compared with the VIF or RF model. The error analysis confirms that the root mean square error of the VIF-RF decreases by more than 20% compared with the VIF and RF models. In addition, the mean absolute percentage error of the VIF-RF models is less than 5%, a decrease by 2.3% and 10.1% compared to the VIF and RF models, respectively. The feasibility of the VIF-RF model for predicting movement of other reservoir landslides was successfully verified by the Majiagou landslide in the TGRA. The developed VIF-RF model indicates the Gapa landslide deformation is at the primary stage over the monitoring period. The displacement at the G1 and G2 monitoring locations of the Gapa landslide is projected to increase to 2719.8 and 2438.8 mm in January 2021, respectively, and the average rate in the accelerated deformation periods is projected to be 67.8 mm/month. The presented VIF-RF model provides an effective approach for predicting the long-term landslide deformation and identifying its deformation stage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acase studies 3adeformation 3akinematics 3alandslides 3amodels 3aprediction 3arain 3aChina 0aLandslides 0aPrediction 0aDisplacement 0aKinematics 0aRandom forests 0aVerhulst inverse function1 aWu, Shuangshuang1 aChang, Donald K.,1 aZheng, Wenbo1 aLiu, Chang1 aHe, Chuncan1 aLiu, Zhongxu1 aGuo, Xuyuan1 aZhang, Han0 tEngineering geology.g2021 Mar. 20, v. 283 p.105975-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12441x0013-79527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2020.1059753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02671naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245008500177520133300262592002801595650001501623650001101638650001101649650001601660650001401676650002401690650002401714650002301738650001601761651001501777653002701792653002201819653002901841653002801870653001201898653002101910700002201931700002701953700002101980700002202001773011102023856008202134852000902216655001202225IND60749564420221118051742.0211129e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074956442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2021.1126532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aViolante-Carvalho, Nelson10aDiffraction of irregular ocean waves measured by altimeter in the lee of islands  aDespite the importance of diffraction of irregular ocean waves, there is a lack of reported measurements over scales larger than a few tens of wavelengths. In the coastal zone, Satellite Altimetry is hindered because the backscatter characteristics of waveforms deviate from Brown's theoretical model, specially up to 20 km from the coastline. Here, we combine a novel set of retracked — reprocessed — altimeter data with directional buoy spectra and simulations with a spectral numerical model where diffraction is computed with an approximation based on the Mild Slope Equation. The Channel Islands, off the coast of California, is an ideal spot for the analysis because of the sharp variations in bathymetry in the vicinity of the archipelago, increasing the relative importance of diffraction over refraction. Spatial variations of wave energy in the lee of the islands are investigated along and across the wave propagation direction. For the first time the lateral rate of energy spreading — across the wave propagation direction — was computed in oceanic conditions and are of the same magnitude as those found in previously published experiments in a wave tank. The importance of diffraction as a non-dissipative process during wave propagation in situations normally encountered in the ocean is also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltimeters 3acoasts 3aenergy 3aenvironment 3aequations 3amathematical models 3asatellite altimetry 3atheoretical models 3awater power 3aCalifornia 0aWater wave diffraction 0aCoastal altimetry 0aRetracked altimeter data 0aSignificant wave height 0aJASON-2 0aWave propagation1 aArruda, Wilton Z.1 aCarvalho, Luiz Mariano1 aRogers, W.

The primary target of breeding programs is to develop new tomato cultivars that are resistant to pests and diseases, in combination with high quality and yield, well-adaptation and good firmness. Among the different tomato types, cherry and cocktail tomatoes are widely preferred by consumers due to their better taste and appearance. In this study, two female tester lines were crossed with four male lines to obtain new tomato hybrids. The eight F₁ hybrids and two commercial hybrids were planted in a randomised complete block design with two replications in a greenhouse in Antalya. The tomatoes of the hybrids and lines were harvested at fully ripened stage to evaluate yield, total soluble solids (TSS), fruit firmness, lycopene content and fruit colour parameters. TSS values of the cultivars and lines ranged from 4.5 to 9.5 °Bx, fruit firmness from 7.94 to 11.85 kg cm⁻², lycopene from 52.10 to 55.88 mg kg⁻¹, yield from 554.3 to 1336.7 g/plant. Hybrid AK0020 was found the best for both yield and quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3acherries 3acultivars 3afemales 3afirmness 3afruit color 3afruit quality 3agreenhouses 3ahybrids 3alycopene 3amales 3ataste 3atomatoes 0adifferent type 0atomato quality 0aSolanum lycopersicum1 aErsoy, A.1 aZengin, S.1 aGolukcu, M.0 tActa alimentaria.g2021 Mar. 05, v. 50, no. 1 p.65-73dAkadémiai KiadówJournal:J000000038x1588-25357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1556/066.2020.001353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03068naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245016700166300001600333520155700349592002801906650002201934650001901956650001201975650001601987650001202003650001102015650002402026650001102050650001302061650001202074650003302086650001102119650001702130650001402147650001502161650000902176653002502185653001702210653001202227653002302239653001602262653001902278700001402297700001402311700001702325700001902342773008402361856008402445852000902529655001202538IND60564865720221121192340.0170713e20160915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056486572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2016.06.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdapa, L.M.10aComparative study of chemical and physical methods for distinguishing between passive and metabolically active mechanisms of water contaminant removal by biofilms  ap. 574-581.  aIn this study, physical and chemical approaches were employed to distinguish between passive and active mechanisms in biofilms removing contaminants in waste waters and their relative merits were assessed. Respiration, post-exposure recovery and scanning electron microscopic analysis demonstrated that both ultraviolet (UV) treatment (300 mJ/cm2) and sodium azide (10 mM) completely inhibited metabolic activity at 5 and 24 h exposure, respectively, whilst not damaging the integrity of the biofilms. Amongst the commonly used chemical inhibitors, only sodium azide showed complete inhibition after 24 h incubation with only about 10% (±4%) of biofilm carbon released into the bulk solution, compared to 33–41% (±8%) when exposed to 5 mM and 10 mM 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) and 69–80% (±5%) when exposed to 2% and 5% w/v formalin, respectively. Biofilm inhibition with UV and sodium azide was found to be equally effective at inhibiting biofilms for treatment of triethanolamine (TEA) and benzotriazole (BTA): the results confirming that the dominant removal mechanism was biodegradation. However, the rates of glucose removal by sodium azide-inhibited biofilms were similar to controls, suggesting that chemical inhibitors were not effective for distinguishing the removal mechanisms of simple sugars. Statistically similar amounts of metal were removed by biofilms treated with UV and sodium azide in zinc, copper and cadmium single-systems: the results indicated that the removal mechanism is predominantly a passive biosorption process.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4-dinitrophenol 3abiodegradation 3abiofilm 3abiosorption 3acadmium 3acarbon 3achemical inhibitors 3acopper 3aformalin 3aglucose 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asodium 3asodium azide 3atriazoles 3awastewater 3azinc 0aMetabolic inhibitors 0aUV treatment 0aBiofilm 0aRemoval mechanisms 0aBiosorption 0aBiodegradation1 aAzimi, Y.1 aSingh, S.1 aPorcelli, D.1 aThompson, I.P.0 tWater research.g2016 Sept. 15, v. 101 p.574-581dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2016.06.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02700naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006000140245005800200300001600258520137600274592002801650650002301678650001301701650002801714650002001742650001401762650001201776650001101788650002101799650001401820650000901834650000901843650001901852650002001871650001501891650001301906653002101919653001801940653001901958700002001977700002701997773013502024856007402159852000902233655001202242IND60673643820221119212856.0191018e20180209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067364382DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/tox3392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFischer, Andreas1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5922-841110aNatural Compounds as Spider Repellents: Fact or Myth?  ap. 314-318.  aAlthough some spiders are globally invasive, found at high densities, and may be considered pests (particularly those that are toxic to humans), there are few pest management methods based on experimental data. ‘Common wisdom’ and advertisements on internet websites assert that a number of natural substances repel spiders. We tested whether the three substances cited most frequently (lemon oil, peppermint oil, and chestnut-fruits) effectively repelled female spiders or whether these were myths. We presented each of the putative repellents versus a control in a two-choice assay and tested responses of females of three invasive spider species in two different families: theridiids, Latrodectus geometricus C. L. Koch (Araneae: Theridiidae) and Steatoda grossa C. L. Koch (Araneae: Theridiidae) and the araneid, Araneus diadematus Clerck . Chestnuts (Araneae: Araneidae) and mint oil strongly repelled L. geometricus and A. diadematus. S. grossa was less sensitive to these chemicals but had a slight tendency to avoid chestnuts. However, lemon oil, the substance most likely to be cited as a repellent (over 1,000,000 hits on Google), had no effect on any of these spiders. We conclude that volatiles released by mint oil and chestnuts may be effective in deterring spider settlement in two different families of spiders, but lemon oil as a repellent is a myth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAraneus diadematus 3aInternet 3aLatrodectus geometricus 3aSteatoda grossa 3achestnuts 3afemales 3ahumans 3ainvasive species 3alemon oil 3amint 3aoils 3apeppermint oil 3apest management 3arepellents 3atoxicity 0aspider repellent 0aessential oil 0ainternet myths1 aAyasse, Manfred1 aAndrade, Maydianne C B0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2018 Feb. 09, v. 111, no. 1 p.314-318dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl46276x1938-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/tox3393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03175naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002700139245011500166500001400281520183700295592002802132650000902160650001702169650001202186650001102198650001302209650001202222650001202234650001002246650001202256650000902268650002002277650001602297650001002313650000902323650002002332650001102352650002402363650001302387650001602400650001002416651001402426700002002440700001802460773012102478856007302599852000902672655001202681IND60718892720221116214530.0201126e20201028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071889272DNAL7 a10.3390/f111111412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aT.U.N., Kaluarachichi 10aTemperature Reduction in Urban Surface Materials through Tree Shading Depends on Surface Type Not Tree Species  aNAL-light  aTrees play a vital role in urban cooling. The present study tested if key canopy characteristics related to tree shade could be used to predict the cooling potential across a range of urban surface materials. During the austral summer of 2018–2019, tree and canopy characteristics of 471 free-standing trees from 13 species were recorded across Greater Sydney, Australia. Stem girth and tree height, as well as leaf area index and ground-projected crown area was measured for every tree. Surface temperatures were recorded between noon (daylight saving time) and 3:00 p.m. under the canopy of each tree in the shade and in full sun to calculate the temperature differential between adjacent sunlit and shaded surfaces (∆Tₛ). The limited control over environmental parameters was addressed by using a large number of randomly selected trees and measurement points of surface temperatures. Analyses revealed that no systematic relationship existed among canopy characteristics and ∆Tₛ for any surface material. However, highly significant differences (p < 0.001) in ∆Tₛ existed among surface materials. The largest cooling potential of tree shade was found by shading bark mulch (∆Tₛ = -24.8 °C ± 7.1), followed by bare soil (∆Tₛ = -22.1 °C ± 5.5), bitumen (∆Tₛ = -20.9 °C ± 5.8), grass (∆Tₛ = -18.5 °C ± 4.8) and concrete pavers (∆Tₛ = -17.5 °C ± 6.0). The results indicate that surface material, but not the tree species, matters for shade cooling of common urban surfaces. Shading bark mulch, bare soil or bitumen will provide the largest reductions in surface temperature, which in turn results in effective mitigation of radiant heat. This refined understanding of the capacity of trees to reduce thermal loads in urban space can increase the effectiveness of urban cooling strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarea 3abark mulches 3abitumen 3acanopy 3aconcrete 3acooling 3aforests 3agirth 3agrasses 3aheat 3aleaf area index 3ameasurement 3ashade 3asoil 3asolar radiation 3asummer 3asurface temperature 3asurfaces 3atree height 3atrees 3aAustralia1 aM.G., Tjoelker 1 aS., Pfautsch 0 tForests.g2020 Oct. 28, v. 11, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f111111413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03759naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003000150245015700180300001600337520172000353592002802073653002402101653003902125653002002164653001502184653002902199653004102228653002202269653000902291653002402300653001902324653001302343653002602356653003702382700003602419700003302455700002802488700003802516700003602554700003002590700002302620700003602643700002702679700003102706700003102737700003802768700003102806700002802837700003502865700002002900773018002920856008403100852000903184655001203193IND60554596220221122190850.0161024e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055459622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmhimx.2015.11.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRizzoli-Córdoba, Antonio10aEvaluación diagnóstica del nivel de desarrollo en niños identificados con riesgo de retraso mediante la prueba de Evaluación del Desarrollo Infantil  ap. 397-408.  aThe Child Development Evaluation (or CDE Test) was developed in Mexico as a screening tool for child developmental problems. It yields three possible results: normal, slow development or risk of delay. The modified version was elaborated using the information obtained during the validation study but its properties according to the base population are not known. The objective of this work was to establish diagnostic confirmation of developmental delay in children 16- to 59-months of age previously identified as having risk of delay through the CDE Test in primary care facilities.A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted in one Mexican state. CDE test was administered to 11,455 children 16- to 59-months of age from December/2013 to March/2014. The eligible population represented the 6.2% of the children (n=714) who were identified at risk of delay through the CDE Test. For inclusion in the study, a block randomization stratified by sex and age group was performed. Each participant included in the study had a diagnostic evaluation using the Battelle Development Inventory, 2nd edition.From the 355 participants included with risk of delay, 65.9% were male and 80.2% were from rural areas; 6.5% were false positives (Total Development Quotient ˃90) and 6.8% did not have any domain with delay (Domain Developmental Quotient <80). The proportion of delay for each domain was as follows: communication 82.5%; cognitive 80.8%; social-personal 33.8%; motor 55.5%; and adaptive 41.7%. There were significant differences in the percentages of delay both by age and by domain/subdomain evaluated.In 93.2% of the participants, developmental delay was corroborated in at least one domain evaluated.  aPublisher supplied data 0aDesarrollo infantil 0aRiesgo de retraso en el desarrollo 0aPrueba de tamiz 0aPrueba EDI 0aEvaluación diagnóstica 0aInventario de Desarrollo de Battelle 0aChild development 0aRisk 0aDevelopmental delay 0aScreening tool 0aCDE Test 0aDiagnostic evaluation 0aBattelle Developmental Inventory1 aCampos-Maldonado, Martha Carmen1 aVélez-Andrade, Víctor Hugo1 aDelgado-Ginebra, Ismael1 aBaqueiro-Hernández, César Iván1 aVillasís-Keever, Miguel Ángel1 aReyes Morales, Hortensia,1 aOjeda-Lara, Lucía1 aDavis-Martínez, Erika Berenice1 aO'Shea-Cuevas, Gabriel1 aAceves Villagrán, Daniel,1 aCarrasco-Mendoza, Joaquín1 aVillagrán-Muñoz, Víctor Manuel1 aHalley-Castillo, Elizabeth1 aSidonio-Aguayo, Beatriz1 aPalma-Tavera, Josuha Alexander1 aMuñoz, Onofre,0 tBoletín Médico del Hospital Infantil de México.g2015 Nov.,  Dec., v. 72 p.397-408dMasson Doyma México S.A.aHospital Infantil de México Federico Gómezx1665-11467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmhimx.2015.11.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02420naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002000141245009000161300001600251500002000267520126600287592002801553650001801581650002701599650002301626650001101649650002501660650001901685650001501704650001901719650001301738650002101751650001601772700003001788773014301818856007601961852000902037655001202046IND60621159920221122062509.0200115e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062115992DNAL7 a10.1093/ajae/aav0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBonnet, Celine,10aOrganic Label, Bargaining Power, and Profit‐sharing in the French Fluid Milk Market  ap. 113-133.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe paper determines how the value‐added created by an organic label is shared in a vertical chain among manufacturers and retailers. Using purchase data on the French fluid milk sector, we develop a structural econometric model of demand and supply that takes into account the bargaining power between manufacturers and retailers. Our results suggest that the organic label segment is more profitable, as it permits the existence of higher margins. Moreover, an organic label allows manufacturers to achieve more bargaining power relative to retailers, and hence to obtain a higher share of total margins. The econometric model is then used to assess the impact of an environmental policy in favor of the organic segment based on a mechanism of price support. Our results suggest that while a subsidy policy towards organic products benefits both manufacturers and retailers, a tax policy toward conventional products benefits manufacturers of national brands at the expense of retailers and manufacturers that provide the private labels. The benefits of such policies on the environment is relatively small. All such policies tend to increase the impact on global warming and land use, but reduce the impact on eutrophication, acidification, and energy use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3aagricultural subsidies 3aeconometric models 3aenergy 3aenvironmental policy 3aeutrophication 3afluid milk 3aglobal warming 3aland use 3aproduct labeling 3avalue added1 aBouamra-Mechemache, Zohra0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g2016 Jan., v. 98, no. 1 p.113-133dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44932x0002-90927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ajae/aav0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03350naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003600150245016200186300001600348520137100364592002801735653001501763653002001778653002401798653001701822653002301839653001301862653001901875653002201894653001601916653001701932700003001949700002801979700003602007700002802043700003202071700003002103700002702133700003102160700003102191700003802222700003802260700003102298700003802329700003202367700004002399700003502439700002902474700002002503773018002523856008402703852000902787655001202796IND60554596320221122190756.0161024e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055459632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmhimx.2015.11.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVillasís-Keever, Miguel Ángel10aDiseño de un modelo de supervisión para la aplicación de la prueba de Evaluación del Desarrollo Infantil en las unidades de atención primaria en México  ap. 385-396.  aThe Child Development Evaluation (CDE) test designed and validated in Mexico has been used as a screening tool for developmental problems in primary care facilities across Mexico. Heterogeneous results were found among those states where these were applied, despite using the same standardized training model for application. The objective was to evaluate a supervision model for quality of application of the CDE test at primary care facilities.A study was carried out in primary care facilities from three Mexican states to evaluate concordance of the results between supervisor and primary care personnel who administered the test using two different methods: direct observation (shadow study) or reapplication of the CDE test (consistency study).There were 380 shadow studies applied to 51 psychologists. General concordance of the shadow study was 86.1% according to the supervisor: green 94.5%, yellow 73.2% and red 80.0%. There were 302 re-test evaluations with a concordance of 88.1% (n=266): green 96.8%, yellow 71.7% and red 81.8%. There were no differences between CDE test subgroups by age.Both shadow and re-test study were adequate for the evaluation of the quality of the administration of the CDE Test and may be useful as a model of supervision in primary care facilities. The decision of which test to use relies on the availability of supervisors.  aPublisher supplied data 0aPrueba EDI 0aPrueba de tamiz 0aDesarrollo infantil 0aSupervisión 0aAtención primaria 0aCDE Test 0aScreening tool 0aChild development 0aSupervision 0aPrimary care1 aRizzoli-Córdoba, Antonio1 aDelgado-Ginebra, Ismael1 aMares-Serratos, Blanca Berenice1 aMartell-Valdez, Liliana1 aSánchez-Velázquez, Olivia1 aReyes Morales, Hortensia,1 aO'Shea-Cuevas, Gabriel1 aAceves Villagrán, Daniel,1 aCarrasco-Mendoza, Joaquín1 aAntillón-Ocampo, Fátima Adriana1 aVillagrán-Muñoz, Víctor Manuel1 aHalley-Castillo, Elizabeth1 aBaqueiro-Hernández, César Iván1 aPizarro-Castellanos, Mariel1 aMartain-Pérez, Itzamara Jacqueline1 aPalma-Tavera, Josuha Alexander1 aVargas-López, Guillermo1 aMuñoz, Onofre,0 tBoletín Médico del Hospital Infantil de México.g2015 Nov.,  Dec., v. 72 p.385-396dMasson Doyma México S.A.aHospital Infantil de México Federico Gómezx1665-11467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmhimx.2015.11.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04102naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245012400164500001400288520251500302592002802817650001502845650002602860650001102886650001402897650002902911650001102940650001502951650001302966650002202979650001603001650002103017650002303038650001703061650001103078650002203089650002103111650001403132650001103146650002503157650001303182650001303195650001403208650002903222650001103251650001403262700002303276700002503299700002103324773012103345856007303466852000903539655001203548IND60718892820221116214551.0201126e20201022xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071889282DNAL7 a10.3390/f111111242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJacobs, Douglass  F.10aNursery Cultural Techniques Facilitate Restoration of Acacia koa Competing with Invasive Grass in a Dry Tropical Forest  aNAL-light  aAnthropogenic activity has caused persistent and prominent losses of forest cover in dry tropical forests. Natural regeneration of forest trees in grazed areas often fails due to lack of seed sources and consumption by ungulates. To address this, the effective restoration of such sites often requires fencing and outplanting nursery-grown seedlings. In the degraded, dry forests of tropical Hawaii, USA, an additional challenge to restoration of native forest trees is the introduced kikuyu grass (Cenchrus clandestinus). This invasive, rapidly growing rhizomatous plant forms deep, dense mats. We studied the use of nursery cultural techniques to facilitate the establishment of koa (Acacia koa) seedlings outplanted amidst well-established kikuyu grass on a volcanic cinder cone on the dry, western side of Hawaii Island. Seedlings were grown four months in three container sizes (49, 164, 656 cm³) and with four rates (0, 4.8, 7.2, and 9.6 kg m⁻³) of 15–9–12 (NPK) controlled-release fertilizer incorporated into media prior to sowing. After 16 months in the field, seedling survival was > 80% for all treatments with two exceptions: the non-fertilized 49 cm³ (78%) and 164 cm³ (24%) containers. After 10 years, only these two treatments had significantly lower survival (35% and 10%, respectively) than the other treatments. One year following planting, none of the non-fertilized seedlings had transitioned to phyllodes from juvenile true leaves, regardless of container size. For the fertilized 656 cm³ container treatment, 78%–85% of seedlings had phyllodes, with mean values increasing by fertilizer rate. Phyllodes are known to confer greater drought resistance than true leaves in koa, which may help to explain the improved survival of fertilized trees on this relatively dry site. Overall, nursery fertilization was more influential on seedling height and diameter response than container size after outplanting. However, the largest container (656 cm³) with the addition of fertilizer, produced significantly larger trees than all other treatments during the early regeneration phase; early growth differences tended to fade at 10 years due to inter-tree canopy competition. Although koa is able to fix atmospheric nitrogen through rhizobium associations, our data confirm the importance of nursery fertilization in promoting regeneration establishment. Nursery cultural techniques may play an important role in forest restoration of dry tropical sites invaded by exotic vegetation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcacia koa 3aCenchrus clandestinus 3aHawaii 3aRhizobium 3aanthropogenic activities 3acanopy 3acontainers 3adiameter 3adrought tolerance 3adry forests 3afertilizer rates 3aforest restoration 3aforest trees 3aheight 3aintroduced plants 3ainvasive species 3ajuveniles 3aleaves 3anatural regeneration 3anitrogen 3aplanting 3aseedlings 3aslow-release fertilizers 3asowing 3aungulates1 aDavis, Anthony  S.1 aDumroese, R.

The aim of this study was to identify cobweb disease (Cladobortyum dendroides) caused cap spotting and brownish rot on the mushroom sporocarp, and to find a proper discrimination method in the case of this infection.Fruiting body samples were divided into 4 groups, a control one and three others treated with different chemicals that are tested against fungal infections. The groups were subdivided into 2 portions and the first was infected with cobweb disease. Images of the caps were recorded and their hyperspectral images were acquired in the wavelength range of 900–1700 nm.On the hyperspectral images infected and healthy areas were selected, on these average spectra differences were found around the known water peaks (1200 and 1450 nm). The spatial distribution of the water content can be used for the detection of the spoilage, because the infected areas showed different reflection values at these water absorption peaks.Support Vector Machine method was applied successfully to discriminate between the infected and control groups and Monte Carlo cross-validation was carried out.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgaricus bisporus 3acobweb disease 3afruiting bodies 3amushrooms 3aspoilage 3awater content 3awater uptake 3awavelengths 3aAustralia 3aEurope 0amushroom 0aCladobotryum 0aDactylium 0aHSI 0aSVM 0aMCCV1 aFelföldi, J.1 aBaranyai, L.1 aGeösel, A.1 aFirtha, F.0 tActa alimentaria.g2014 Nov. 1, v. 43, no.

To investigate the underlying genetic processes of population bottlenecks, we apply an innovative approach for assessing genetic diversity in the last known population of the endangered Pale‐headed Brushfinch (Atlapetes pallidiceps) in Ecuador. First, we measure genetic diversity at eleven neutral microsatellite loci and adaptive SNP variation in five Toll‐like receptor (TLR) immune system genes. Bottleneck tests confirm genetic drift as the main force shaping genetic diversity in this species and indicate a 99 % reduction in population size dating back several hundred years. Second, we compare contemporary microsatellite diversity with historic museum samples of A. pallidiceps, finding no change in genetic diversity. Third, we compare genetic diversity in the Pale‐headed Brushfinch with two co‐occurring‐related brushfinch species (Atlapetes latinuchus, Buarremon torquatus), finding a reduction of up to 91% diversity in the immune system genes but not in microsatellites. High TLR diversity is linked to decreased survival probabilities in A. pallidiceps. Low TLR diversity is thus probably an adaptation to the specific selection regime within its currently very restricted distribution (approximately 200 ha), but could severely restrict the adaptive potential of the species in the long run. Our study illustrates the importance of investigating both neutral and adaptive markers to assess the effect of population bottlenecks and for recommending specific management plans in endangered species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aToll-like receptors 3abirds 3aendangered species 3agenes 3agenetic drift 3agenetic variation 3aimmune system 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apopulation dynamics 3apopulation size 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aspecies diversity 3aEcuador1 aSchaefer, H.

There is thus potentially high dietary exposure of humans to AA, which can induce significant oxidative stress. Hesperidin (HS) and diosmin (DS) are flavone glycosides that have antioxidant properties. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects of HS and DS against AA toxicity. Fifty-six adult male Wistar albino rats were divided into seven groups. The first group was orally administered 0.5% (w/v) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and considered as the control group. The second and third groups were orally administered 10 mg/kg/day of HS or DS, respectively. The fourth group received 20 mg/kg/day of AA orally for 14 days. The fifth and sixth groups were given 10 mg/kg/day of HS or DS, respectively, followed by AA. The seventh group was given both HS and DS after AA administration. AA intoxication significantly (p ≤ 0.05) increased serum levels of liver function enzymes (ALT, AST, and ALP), kidney function products (urea and creatinine), oxidative DNA damage marker (OHdG), proinflammatory markers (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6), lipid peroxidation marker (malondialdehyde), and nitric oxide (NO). On the other hand, it significantly (p ≤ 0.05) decreased levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) in the liver, kidney, and brain. The activities of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) in the liver, kidney, and brain tissues were also reduced. HS and DS supplementation prevented lipid peroxidation, normalized the serum parameters altered by AA, and enhanced the tissue concentrations and activities of antioxidant biomarkers. It could be concluded that HS and DS have potent protective effects against oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, and DNA damage induced by AA toxicity in rats.  aPublisher supplied data  aRG 1439-60cDeanship of Scientific Research, King Saud University 3aDNA damage 3aFrench fries 3aacrylamides 3aadults 3aalanine transaminase 3aalbino 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidant biomarkers 3aaspartate transaminase 3ablood serum 3abrain 3abreads 3acatalase 3acookies 3acreatinine 3adietary exposure 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3aenzyme activity 3aflavones 3aglutathione 3aglutathione peroxidase 3agrains 3aheat treatment 3ahesperidin 3ahumans 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-6 3akidneys 3alaboratory animals 3alipid peroxidation 3aliver 3aliver function 3amales 3amalondialdehyde 3ameat products 3anitric oxide 3aoral administration 3aoxidative stress 3apoisoning 3apotato chips 3aprotective effect 3arats 3arenal function 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atoxicity 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3aurea1 aAlBasher, Gadah1 aAlfarraj, Saleh1 aAlmeer, Rafa1 aBahbah, Eshak I.1 aFouda, Maged M.

Several types of optical satellite sensors have recently shown potential to support this task. Spaceborne imaging spectrometers measuring in the 400–2500 nm spectral range belong to this group. These instruments measure the solar radiation reflected by the Earth in hundreds of spectral channels with a typical spectral resolution of 10 nm and a spatial resolution of 30 m. The PRISMA mission from the Italian Space Agency is the first system of this type providing data openly to the international scientific community. In this work, we evaluate the potential of PRISMA to map methane point emissions, which are typical for fossil fuel production activities. Our retrieval of methane concentration enhancements is based on a matched-filter based algorithm applied to PRISMA spectra in the 2300 nm shortwave infrared spectral region. We perform a simulation-based sensitivity analysis to assess the retrieval performance for different sites. We find that surface brightness and homogeneity are major drivers for the detection and quantification of methane plumes with PRISMA, with retrieval precision errors ranging from 61 to 197 parts-per-billion in the evaluated images. The potential of PRISMA for methane mapping is further illustrated by real plume detections at different methane hotspot regions, including oil and gas extraction fields in Algeria, Turkmenistan, and the USA (Permian Basin), and coal mines in the Shanxi region in China. Our study reports several important findings regarding the potential and limitations of PRISMA for methane mapping, most of which can be extrapolated to upcoming satellite imaging spectroscopy missions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPermian period 3aalgorithms 3abasins 3aclimate change 3acoal 3aenvironment 3afuel production 3amethane 3aoils 3asatellites 3aspectral analysis 3aspectrometers 3aspectroscopy 3aAlgeria 3aChina 3aTurkmenistan 0aMethane retrieval 0aPRISMA satellite mission 0aImaging spectroscopy 0aPoint emissions 0aSpectral calibration1 aIrakulis-Loitxate, Itziar1 aGorroño, Javier1 aSánchez-García, Elena1 aCusworth, Daniel H.1 aVaron, Daniel J.1 aCogliati, Sergio1 aColombo, Roberto0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2021 Nov., v. 265 p.112671-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11735x0034-42577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2021.1126713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02548naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245016200163300001200325520121000337592002801547650002201575650002001597650002401617650004101641650003301682650001601715650001201731650002601743650000901769700002201778700002201800700002601822700002001848700002601868700002301894773014201917856008202059852000902141655001202150IND60609096420221120092628.0180917e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060909642DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-018-3939-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlkan, Emel10aSimultaneous Determination of Phorate and Oxyfluorfen in Well Water Samples with High Accuracy by GC-MS After Binary Dispersive Liquid-Liquid Microextraction  ap. 298.  aThe potential risk of pesticides to cause harm to humans and other organisms even at trace levels calls for sensitive and accurate analytical techniques for their simultaneous qualitative and quantitative determinations. In this study, a sensitive binary dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (B-DLLME) strategy was developed for the simultaneous determination of phorate and oxyfluorfen by gas chromatography mass spectrometry after extraction/preconcentration from aqueous solution. An experimental design was used to optimize parameters of the B-DLLME method to obtain maximum outcome. Under the optimum conditions of B-DLLME, the limit of detection (LOD) for phorate and oxyfluorfen were found to be 0.41 μg L⁻¹ and 0.54 μg L⁻¹, respectively. The detection limits correlate to about 37 and 73 folds enhancement in detection powers when compared to direct GC-MS determination of phorate and oxyfluorfen, respectively. In order to find out the applicability of developed method to real samples, recovery tests were performed for 20 μg L⁻¹ of phorate and oxyfluorfen spiked in well water samples. Percent recovery values were found to be 94.5% for phorate and 101.9% for oxyfluorfen.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3adetection limit 3aexperimental design 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aliquid-phase microextraction 3aoxyfluorfen 3aphorate 3aquantitative analysis 3arisk1 aKapukıran, Fatih1 aEr, Elif Öztürk1 aChormey, Dotse Selali1 aKeyf, Seyfullah1 aÖzdoğan, Nizamettin1 aBakırdere, Sezgin0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2018 Sept., v. 229, no. 9 p.298-298dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl4876x0049-69797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-018-3939-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04412naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245017600171520255600347592002802903650001102931650001602942650000902958650001702967650002502984650002003009650001103029650001103040650001903051650004003070650002103110650001603131650002503147650001503172653004703187653002503234653002603259653002103285653002503306653002403331653001803355700001703373700001503390700001303405700001903418700002303437700001903460700002003479700001503499700001703514700002103531700001703552700001403569773011103583856008203694961001303776852000903789655001203798IND60749565020221118051619.0211129e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074956502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2021.1126722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Christine Y.10aUnpacking the drivers of diurnal dynamics of sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF): Canopy structure, plant physiology, instrument configuration and retrieval methods  aSun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) from spaceborne sensors is a promising tool for global carbon cycle monitoring, but its application is constrained by insufficient understanding of the drivers underlying diurnal SIF dynamics. SIF measurements from ground-based towers can reveal diurnal SIF dynamics across biomes and environmental conditions; however, meaningful interpretation of diurnal variations requires disentangling impacts from canopy structure, plant physiology, instrument configuration and retrieval methods, which often interact with and confound each other. This study aims to unpack these drivers using 1) concurrent ground and airborne canopy-scale and leaf-scale measurements at a corn field, 2) a mechanistic SIF model that explicitly considers the dynamics of photochemistry (via the fraction of open photosystem II reaction centers, qL) and photoprotection (via nonphotochemical quenching, NPQ) as well as their interactive dependence on the sub-canopy light environment, and 3) cross-comparison of SIF instrument configurations and retrieval methods. We found that crop row orientations and sun angles can introduce a distinctive midday dip in SIF in absence of stress, due to a midday drop of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) when crop rows are north-south oriented. Canopy structure caused distinctive responses in both qL and NPQ at different positions within the vertical canopy that collectively influenced fluorescence quantum yield (ΦF) at the leaf scale. Once integrated at the canopy scale, diurnal dynamics of both APAR and canopy escape probability (ε) are critical for accurately shaping diurnal SIF variations. While leaf-level qL and NPQ exhibited strong diurnal dynamics, their influence was attenuated at the canopy scale due to opposing effects on SIF at different canopy layers. Furthermore, different system configurations (i.e., bi-hemispherical vs. hemispherical-conical) and retrieval methods can bias the SIF magnitude and distort its diurnal shapes, therefore confounding the interpretation of inherent strength and dynamics of SIF emission. Our findings demonstrate the importance of crop row structures, interactive variations in canopy structure and plant physiology, instrument configuration, and retrieval method in shaping the measured dynamics of diurnal SIF. This study highlights the necessity to account for these factors to accurately interpret satellite SIF, and informs future synthesis work with different SIF instrumentation and retrieval methods across sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanopy 3achlorophyll 3acorn 3afluorescence 3aglobal carbon budget 3ainstrumentation 3aleaves 3amodels 3aphotochemistry 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3aplant physiology 3aprobability 3aradiation resistance 3asatellites 0aSun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) 0aDiurnal SIF dynamics 0aMechanistic SIF model 0aCanopy structure 0aCrop row orientation 0aSIF instrumentation 0aSIF retrieval1 aWen, Jiaming1 aHan, Jimei1 aKira, Oz1 aLeVonne, Julie1 aMelkonian, Jeffrey1 aRiha, Susan J.1 aSkovira, Joseph1 aNg, Sharon1 aGu, Lianhong1 aWood, Jeffrey D.1 aNäthe, Paul1 aSun, Ying0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2021 Nov., v. 265 p.112672-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11735x0034-42577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2021.1126723Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02540naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245015800162300001400320520120400334592002801538650001801566650001701584650001001601650002001611650002001631650003001651650001601681650001901697653001701716653002901733653002201762653001901784653002001803653001501823700001801838700001801856700001801874700002701892773009501919856008302014852000902097655001202106IND60760983620221120141014.0211224e20211209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076098362DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.1076.372782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIse, Yuji10aFirst record of the genus Discorhabdella (Porifera, Demospongiae, Poecilosclerida, Crambeidae) from Sagami Bay, Japan with description of two new species  ap. 67-81.  aTwo new species of Discorhabdella are described from Sagami Bay, Japan. Discorhabdella has been suggested to have an ancient Tethyan origin according to discovery of their unique pseudoastrose acanthostyles from late Eocene to Oligocene deposits. This is the first record of the genus from the northwest Pacific and first record of the family Crambeidae from Japan. Discorhabdella hispida sp. nov. is distinctive within the genus by possession of special sigmoid microscleres and C-shaped isochelae with short alae. Discorhabdella misakiensis sp. nov. is characterized by short choanosomal subtylostyles, and their length overlapped with that of the ectosomal subtylostyles. Only one other species, Discorhabdella tuberosocapitata (Topsent, 1890), has the same spicule composition. However, all spicule types are larger in D. tuberosocapitata than those of D. misakiensis sp. nov., and the shape of the isochelae is different: the alae are more widely opened in D. tuberosocapitata. An identification key to species of the genus Discorhabdella is also provided. The discovery of two new species from warm temperate northwest Pacific extends the geographical distribution of the genus Discorhabdella.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcanthostyles 3aEocene epoch 3aJapan 3aOligocene epoch 3aPoecilosclerida 3ageographical distribution 3anew species 3ataxonomic keys 0abiodiversity 0aCentral Kuroshio Current 0anorthwest Pacific 0arelict species 0asponge taxonomy 0aTethys Sea1 aVacelet, Jean1 aIzumi, Takato1 aWoo, Sau Pinn1 aTan, Aileen Shau-Hwai,0 tZooKeys.g2021 Dec. 09, v. 1076 p.67-81dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2141x1313-29707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.1076.372783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03384naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003800139245018700177500001400364520178800378592002802166650001502194650001402209650001602223650001702239650002202256650001302278650001202291650001002303650003302313650001602346650001402362650002102376650001202397650001002409651001102419651000902430651001402439651001102453651001102464651001802475700003302493700003802526700002702564700003502591700003702626773012102663856007302784852000902857655001202866IND60718893020221122065856.0201126e20201028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071889302DNAL7 a10.3390/f111111422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJuan Alfredo, Hernández-García 10aPhylogenetic Position of Geosmithia spp. (Hypocreales) Living in Juniperus spp. Forests (Cupressaceae) with Bark Beetles of Phloeosinus spp. (Scolytinae) from the Northeast of Mexico  aNAL-light  aGeosmithia members are mitosporic filamentous fungi commonly recorded and isolated from bark beetles of the Scolytinae subfamily and their respective host’s species. This genus includes 18 species formally described and 38 phylogenetic species recorded in several localities from Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, and North and South America, where they exhibit frequent associations with phloeophagous and wood-boring bark beetles. Among phloephagous bark beetle species, specifically, in members of the genus Phloeosinus Chapuis, almost 10% of Geosmithia strains have been isolated. By its physiographic elements and high bark beetle and conifer species richness, Mexico is a potential region to host a high diversity of Geosmithia species and potential new species. In the present study, we systematically sampled and isolated, cultured, and molecularly identified members of the Geosmithia species associated with Phloeosinus spp. and their Juniperus spp. host trees at the north of Sierra Madre Oriental, at Nuevo Leon State, Mexico. Phylogenetic analyses based on 378 internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) sequences supported the presence of strains from Geosmithia langdonii-Geosmithia sp. 32 clade associated with Phloeosinus serratus vector and with Juniperus coahuilensis (JC) host, and the presence of strains from Geosmithia sp. 21-Geosmithia xerotolerans clade with Phloeosinusdeleoni and Juniperus flaccida (JF) in this geographical region. The genetic and morphological differences found in our strains with respect to those previously described in the species from both clades (Geosmithia langdonii-Geosmithia sp. 32 and Geosmithia sp. 21-G. xerotolerans) suggest that both Geosmithia lineages from Nuevo Leon correspond to two potential new species in the genus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGeosmithia 3aJuniperus 3aPhloeosinus 3abark beetles 3achemical elements 3aconifers 3aforests 3afungi 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3anew species 3aphylogeny 3aspecies richness 3astrains 3atrees 3aAfrica 3aAsia 3aAustralia 3aEurope 3aMexico 3aSouth America1 aGerardo, Cuellar-Rodríguez 1 aNallely Guadalupe, Aguirre-Ojeda 1 aLourdes, Villa-Tanaca 1 aCésar, Hernández-Rodríguez 1 aFrancisco, Armendáriz-Toledano 0 tForests.g2020 Oct. 28, v. 11, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f111111423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03651naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024004200132024002200174024001900196024001100215040001800226100002100244245008400265300001800349500001500367506007600382506017300458520166800631506003702299650002502336650001302361650002902374650002602403650001502429650001902444650001602463650002502479650001402504650001802518650001002536650001702546650002202563650001102585650001402596653002002610700002202630773010302652856011202755856008802867956012402955961000903079852000903088655001203097IND60006211520221214231450.0160316e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000621152DNAL7 a2727062aris7 a10113/621152hdl7 a10.1111/j.1364-3703.2012.00805.x2doi7 aPMC66386312pmcid7 a225128722pmid8 ans9447  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNAUMANN, Todd A.10aTruncation of class IV chitinases from Arabidopsis by secreted fungal proteases  ap. 1135-1139.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aPlant class IV chitinases have a small, amino-terminal chitin binding domain and a larger chitinase domain. Previous work on Zea mays chitinases ChitA and ChitB showed that their chitin binding domains bind insoluble chitin, that their catalytic domains degrade short, soluble forms of chitin, and that the chitin-binding domain is removed by proteases secreted by fungal pathogens. Here we analyze four chitinases from the model dicot Arabidopsis thaliana. We show that some of their chitin-binding domains bind insoluble chitin and that their chitinase domains degrade short, soluble forms of chitin and catalyze transglycosylation. Moreover, the chitin binding domain of some can be removed by Fv-cmp, a fungalysin protease produced by Fusarium verticillioides. Recombinant chitinases were expressed in Pichia pastoris. The basic chitinases AtchitIV3 and AtchitIV4 were purified by chitin affinity. Acidic chitinases AtchitIV1 and AtchitIV5 did not bind insoluble chitin, and were purified by other methods. The recombinant chitinases all degraded GlcNAc oligomers with degree of polymerization (dp) 6. The four chitinases also produced dp5 without production of dp1, indicating transglycosylation activity. Incubation of chitinases with Fv-cmp resulted in truncation of AtchitIV3 and AtchitIV5 while incubation with secreted proteins from Alternaria brassicae, a pathogen of A. thaliana and brassica crops, led to trunction of AtchitIV3 and AtchitIV4. Our finding that both A. thaliana and Z. mays class IV chitinases are truncated by proteases secreted by specialized pathogens of each plant suggests that this is a general mechanism of fungal pathogenicity.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aZea mays 3aFusarium verticillioides 3aKomagataella pastoris 3acole crops 3apolymerization 3aproteinases 3aAlternaria brassicae 3apathogens 3apathogenicity 3afungi 3aactive sites 3aprotein secretion 3achitin 3achitinase 0aPichia pastoris1 aPRICE, Neil P.

In the present investigation, microalgae Scenedesmus rubescens KACC 2 isolated from catchment region of River Noyyal was found to be efficient in removing nitrogen, phosphorus, and heavy metals from industrial and domestic effluents, which was optimized through central composite design matrix for higher biomass generation. Nutrient requirements for the growth were optimized and evaluated using Plackett–Burman design to check the effect of variables. Three variables, viz., nitrate, phosphate, and inoculums, were found to be significant among the 11 variables tested, and the interaction between these variables and its optimum concentrations were statistically studied using central composite design matrix. The optimized growth conditions of this strain were found to be as nitrate (0.2%), phosphate (0.018%), and inoculums (7.5%). These conditions yielded a higher biomass of 0.73 g/L from the optimized media which was 5.4 times higher than the regular growth media. FT-IR analysis showed the variations in the spectra and also in biomolecular composition with 2-fold increase in the lipid and protein region when grown in optimized culture conditions. Lipid profile showed the presence of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids in the biomass accepting it as a source of energy feedstock. This study concludes that nitrate, phosphate, and inoculums play a significant role in biomass production of S. rubescens with phycoremediation potential that can be exploited for simultaneous wastewater treatment–coupled biomass production.  aPublisher supplied data  aSB/FT/LS-389/2012cScience and Engineering Research Board 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aScenedesmus 3abiomass production 3acost effectiveness 3aculture media 3aeffluents 3aenergy 3aenvironmental sustainability 3afeedstocks 3aheavy metals 3ainoculum 3alipid composition 3amicroalgae 3amonounsaturated fatty acids 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anutrient requirements 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3arivers 3awastewater 3awatersheds1 aThomas, Jibu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8132-62290 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2019 Dec., v. 26, no. 34 p.34702-34712dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-4012-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02937naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245006900167300001600236520149600252592002801748650002101776650001601797650001201813650001301825650002001838650003201858650001701890650001001907650001201917650002601929650001301955650001401968653002301982653001202005653001202017653001802029653002902047700001702076700001902093700001702112700001602129700001702145700001302162700002302175700001602198700001802214773008202232856008402314852000902398655001202407IND60564866220221121192317.0170713e20170515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056486622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2017.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhong, Liang10aNitrate effects on chromate reduction in a methane-based biofilm  ap. 130-137.  aThe effects of nitrate (NO3−) on chromate (Cr(VI)) reduction in a membrane biofilm reactor (MBfR) were studied when CH4 was the sole electron donor supplied with a non-limiting delivery capacity. A high surface loading of NO3− gave significant and irreversible inhibition of Cr(VI) reduction. At a surface loading of 500 mg Cr/m2-d, the Cr(VI)-removal percentage was 100% when NO3− was absent (Stage 1), but was dramatically lowered to < 25% with introduction of 280 mg N m−2-d NO3− (Stage 2). After ∼50 days operation in Stage 2, the Cr(VI) reduction recovered to only ∼70% in Stage 3, when NO3− was removed from the influent; thus, NO3− had a significant long-term inhibition effect on Cr(VI) reduction. Weighted PCoA and UniFrac analyses proved that the introduction of NO3− had a strong impact on the microbial community in the biofilms, and the changes possibly were linked to the irreversible inhibition of Cr(VI) reduction. For example, Meiothermus, the main genus involved in Cr(VI) reduction at first, declined with introduction of NO3−. The denitrifier Chitinophagaceae was enriched after the addition of NO3−, while Pelomonas became important when nitrate was removed, suggesting its potential role as a Cr(VI) reducer. Moreover, introducing NO3− led to a decrease in the number of genes predicted (by PICRUSt) to be related to chromate reduction, but genes predicted to be related to denitrification, methane oxidation, and fermentation increased.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChitinophagaceae 3aMeiothermus 3abiofilm 3achromium 3adenitrification 3adenitrifying microorganisms 3afermentation 3agenes 3amethane 3amicrobial communities 3anitrates 3aoxidation 0aChromate reduction 0aNitrate 0aMethane 0aMicroorganism 0aMembrane biofilm reactor1 aLai, Chun-Yu1 aShi, Ling-Dong1 aWang, Kai-Di1 aDai, Yu-Jie1 aLiu, Yao-Wei1 aMa, Fang1 aRittmann, Bruce E.1 aZheng, Ping1 aZhao, He-Ping0 tWater research.g2017 May 15, v. 115 p.130-137dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2017.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04453naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245014100165520276400306592002803070650001603098650002203114650001603136650001803152650001803170650001303188650003103201650002403232650002003256650001003276650002003286650001103306650001903317650004003336650002303376650002003399653000803419653003203427653002103459653003603480653001803516653002703534653000903561700001803570700002503588700001903613700002303632700003903655773012603694856008203820852000903902655001203911IND60749565120221118051759.0211129e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074956512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2021.1126732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRegaieg, Omar10aAssessing impacts of canopy 3D structure on chlorophyll fluorescence radiance and radiative budget of deciduous forest stands using DART  aAlthough remote sensing (RS) of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is increasingly used as a valuable source of information about vegetation photosynthetic activity, the RS SIF observations are significantly influenced by canopy-specific structural features (i.e., canopy architecture including leaf area index and presence of woody components), atmospheric conditions during their acquisition (e.g., proportion of direct and diffuse irradiance) and observational geometric configurations (e.g., sun and viewing directions). Radiative transfer (RT) models have the potential to provide a better understanding of the canopy structural effects on the SIF emission and RS signals. Here, we used the DART model to assess the daily influence, from morning to evening, of forest 3D architecture on SIF nadir radiance, emission, escape factor and nadir yield of eight 100 m × 100 m forest study plots established in a temperate deciduous forest of the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (Edgewater, MD, USA). The 3D architecture of each plot was derived from airborne LiDAR. DART simulations of these 3D forest plots and their 1D (i.e., vertical profile of sun-adapted and shade-adapted leaves) and 0D (i.e., homogeneous layer of sun-adapted leaves above an homogeneous layer of shade-adapted leaves) abstractions were compared to assess the relative errors (ε₁D₋₃D and ε₀D₋₃D) associated with horizontal and vertical structural heterogeneity, respectively. Forest 3D structure, especially horizontal heterogeneity, had a great influence on forest nadir SIF radiance, resulting in ε₁D₋₃D up to 55% at 8:00 and 18:00 (i.e., for oblique sun directions). The key indicators of this impact, in the descending order of importance, were the SIF escape factor (ε₁D₋₃D up to 40%), the attenuation of incident photosynthetically active radiation (ε₁D₋₃D less than 5%), and the SIF emission yield (ε₁D₋₃D less than 2%). The influence of forest architecture on the nadir SIF escape factor and SIF yield (ε₁D₋₃D up to 40%) varied over time, with differences in forest stand structure, and per spectral domain, being always larger between 640 and 700 nm than between 700 and 850 nm. In addition, woody elements demonstrated a large influence on forest SIF radiance due to their “shading” effect (ε up to 17%) and their “blocking” effect (ε ≈ 10%), both of them higher for far-red than for red SIF. These results underline the importance of 3D forest canopy architecture, especially 2D heterogeneity, and inclusion of woody elements in RT modeling used for interpretation of the RS SIF signal, and subsequently for the estimation of gross primary production and detection of vegetation stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorophyll 3adeciduous forests 3aenvironment 3aforest canopy 3aforest stands 3ageometry 3agross primary productivity 3ainformation sources 3aleaf area index 3alidar 3alight intensity 3amodels 3aphotosynthesis 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3aradiative transfer 3astand structure 0aSIF 0aRadiative transfer modeling 0aRadiative budget 0aPhotosynthetic active radiation 0aEscape factor 0a3D forest architecture 0aWood1 aYin, Tiangang1 aMalenovský, Zbyněk1 aCook, Bruce D.1 aMorton, Douglas C.1 aGastellu-Etchegorry, Jean-Philippe0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2021 Nov., v. 265 p.112673-dElsevier Inc.aElsevier Inc.wJournal:11735x0034-42577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2021.1126733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02497naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245009300170520093700263592002801200650002601228650002201254650001401276650003601290650004601326650002401372650004401396650002301440650002501463650002201488650002101510653003001531653001801561653003401579653003701613653003101650700001701681700001501698700001701713700001601730700001301746700001901759700001701778700001301795773009801808856008801906852000901994655001202003IND60749561820221118051850.0211114e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074956182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2021.1129202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Yanqiao10aEudesmane-type and agarospirane-type sesquiterpenes from agarwood of Aquilaria agallocha  aEleven previously unreported sesquiterpenes, including nine eudesmane-type (agalleudesmanol A-I) and two agarospirane-type sesquiterpenes (agarospiranic aldehyde A-B), together with eight known sesquiterpenes, were isolated from the agarwood of Aquilaria agallocha Roxb.

In the case of a parasitoid that looks for profitable patches, this design forces it to use the single host density patch available, and therefore the possibility of selection by the parasitoid is not considered at all. A selective functional response, in which the host is distributed in discrete patches at different densities, could be a solution to avoid such a limitation. However, the disadvantage of this design is that it does not meet the independence assumption required to perform a parametric statistical analysis. Nevertheless, the use of nonparametric analyses such as GAM and GAMM models allows the performance of this kind of design, making the relationship between the response and the explanatory variable more flexible, looking for general behavioral patterns. The behavior of the fruit fly parasitoid Diachasmimorpha longicaudata (Ashmead) in a patched condition was assessed in order to demonstrate that nonparametric analyses are useful tools when studying the selective functional response. Results showed that the functional response changed from a “sigmoid curve” to a “bell-shape curve” when the parasitoid had the chance to choose freely among different host densities. The female parasitoid distributed their ovarian load among the eight host densities. The present study suggests that the bell-shape curve displays a general behavior pattern of the parasitoid population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDiachasmimorpha longicaudata 3aexperimental design 3afemales 3afruit flies 3amodels 3aparasitoids 3astatistical analysis 0afunctional response 0aDiachasmimorpha longicaudata 0ahost–parasitoid system 0apatchy environment 0afruit fly1 aBenitez-Vieyra, S.1 aGorla, D.

The current study elucidated Pb-induced changes in nutrient solution pH and its effect on physiology of two Solanum melongena L. cultivars (cv. Chuttu and cv. VRIB-13). Plants were grown in black plastic containers having 0, 15, 20, and 25 mg L⁻¹ PbCl₂ in nutrient solutions with starting pH of 6.0. pH changes by roots of S. melongena were continuously monitored for 8 days, and harvested plants were analyzed for physiological and biochemical attributes. Time scale studies revealed that cv. Chuttu and cv. VRIB-13 responded to Pb stress by causing acidification and alkalinization of growth medium during the first 48 h, respectively. Both cultivars increased nutrient solution pH, and maximum pH rise of 1.21 units was culminated by cv. VRIB-13 at 15 mg L⁻¹ Pb and 0.8 units by cv. Chuttu at 25 mg L⁻¹ Pb treatment during the 8-day period. Plant biomass, photosynthetic pigments, ascorbic acid, total amino acid, and total protein contents were significantly reduced by Pb stress predominantly in cv. Chuttu than cv. VRIB-13. Interestingly, chlorophyll contents of cv. VRIB-13 increased with increasing Pb levels. Pb contents of roots and shoots of both cultivars increased with applied Pb levels while nutrient (Ca, Mg, K, and Fe) contents decreased predominately in cv. Chuttu. Negative correlations were identified among Pb contents of eggplant roots and shoots and plant biomasses, leaf area, and free anthocyanin. Taken together, growth medium alkalinization, lower root to shoot Pb translocation, and optimum balance of nutrients (Mg and Fe) conferred growth enhancement, ultimately making cv. VRIB-13 auspicious for tolerating Pb toxicity as compared with cv. Chuttu. The research outcomes are important for devising metallicolous plant-associated strategies based on plant pH modulation response and associated metal uptake to remediate Pb-polluted soil.  aPublisher supplied data  aGrant No: PD-IPFP/HRD/HEC/2013/3021cHigher Education Commision, Pakistan 3aSolanum melongena 3aacidification 3aalkalinization 3aamino acids 3aanthocyanins 3aascorbic acid 3acalcium 3achlorophyll 3acontainers 3acultivars 3aculture media 3aeggplants 3airon 3alead 3aleaf area 3amagnesium 3anutrient solutions 3anutrients 3apH 3aphytomass 3aplant physiology 3apolluted soils 3apollution 3apotassium 3aprotein content 3aroots 3ashoots 3atoxicity1 aHabib, Noman1 aAkram, Muhammad Sohail1 aQāsim ʻAlī Nīshāpūrī,1 aHaider, Muhammad Zulqurnain1 aTanwir, Kashif1 aShauket, Asia1 aChaudhary, Hassan Javed0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2019 Nov., v. 26, no. 33 p.34633-34644dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-06575-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03489naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245012900167520187500296592002802171650002602199650001802225650002502243650002302268650001002291650002102301650001702322650001302339650002102352650001502373650001602388650001702404650002402421650002102445651002502466653002802491653002002519653002002539653003302559653003502592653003602627700001702663700001502680700001802695700001702713700001502730700001502745773010502760856008502865852000902950655001202959IND60753358220221122001831.0211213e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075335822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2021.1042622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Marco, A.10aDifferences in soil carbon and nitrogen pools between afforested pine forests and natural shrublands in a Mediterranean area  aPlant cover and microclimatic conditions can profoundly alter the balance between productivity and decay, with relevant effects on soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) pools. Despite their importance, the combined effects of plant cover and microclimatic conditions on soil C and N pools have been poorly assessed, especially in the Mediterranean environment. Therefore, the aims of the present study were to assess how, in Mediterranean areas, C and N pools differ between afforested pine forests and natural shrublands and to highlight the different impacts of plant cover on C and N sequestration at low and high elevations Along a forest floor-mineral soil continuum, plant cover and elevation effects were evaluated through measurements of C and N pools and water-soluble fractions, molecular characterization by ¹³C and ¹H NMR, and microbial and fungal amounts and activities. Our data show that C accumulated more in afforested pine forest soils than in shrubland soils, especially at low elevations. In pine forests, the higher content of aromatic and O alkyl compounds in the upper organic layers and the abundance of aromatic and carboxylic components in the soluble fraction suggest a greater stability of soil organic matter than in shrublands. Additionally, the high concentration of N in the upper organic layer and its reduction in the fermentative layer stimulate soil C accumulation mainly in pine forests at low elevations. The abundant organic mass at high elevations in pine forests improves microbial growth, whereas the greater recalcitrance of organic residues at low elevations in pine forests leads to a decrease in the bacterial component compared with the fungal component.In conclusion, the plant cover effect appears to be strongly conditioned by elevation, and afforestation with pine at low elevations could favour long-term soil C storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMediterranean climate 3aafforestation 3acarbon sequestration 3aconiferous forests 3afungi 3amicrobial growth 3amicroclimate 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3ashrublands 3asoil carbon 3asoil ecology 3asoil organic matter 3awater solubility 3aMediterranean region 0aLow and high elevations 0aC sequestration 0aN concentration 0aWater-soluble organic matter 0aMicrobial biomass and activity 0aOrganic layers and mineral soil1 aPanico, S.C.1 aMemoli, V.1 aSantorufo, L.1 aZarrelli, A.1 aBarile, R.1 aMaisto, G.0 tApplied soil ecology.g2022 Feb., v. 170 p.104262-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl55717x0929-13937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2021.1042623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03025naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001800141245009000159300001600249520166700265592002801932650002001960650001101980650002101991650001302012650001102025650001902036650001402055650002302069650001102092650001002103650001302113650001002126650001402136650001502150650001602165650001002181651001202191653002002203653001402223653001602237653001502253653001302268700001602281773014902297856007602446852000902522655001202531IND60621157520221123044307.0181116e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062115752DNAL7 a10.1093/aesa/saw0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl Iraqui, S.10aImpact of Temperatures on the Voltinism of Cydia pomonella (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae)  ap. 698-704.  aCydia pomonella (L.) is a worldwide dreadful pest in apple fruit production. In Morocco, where high temperatures are prevailing in a growing season, sexual traps demonstrate a massive flight of codling moth leading to an intensive chemical control. In Morocco, data concerning its life cycle are imprecise. Thus, its voltinism and the impact of temperatures on the progress of its generations were investigated during six growing seasons (2010–2015) in a Moroccan apple orchard. The degree days method was also investigated to verify the adaptability of codling moth populations to phenological models. Results revealed that codling moth flight consisted on three generations per year, whereas an additional fourth generation of moths is expected when the beginning of the life cycle (first generation) matches with high temperatures. The present study highlighted the importance of the first generation on codling moth control, as it represented around 50% of captures per year. The accumulation of an average of 360 degree days during April and May allowed an earlier and faster development of the first generation, which impacted the progress of the following generations, extended the presence of the insect, and consequently increased its voltinism. Moreover, temperatures during the period conducive to insect diapause (July to early August) are always high in Moroccan conditions and thus inhibit insect diapause. Finally, the estimated generations, based on degree days method, were in concordance with codling moth flight dynamics based on sexual traps captures, making possible the prediction of insect development pattern using a phenological model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCydia pomonella 3aapples 3achemical control 3adiapause 3aflight 3agrowing season 3aheat sums 3ainsect development 3amodels 3amoths 3aorchards 3apests 3aphenology 3aprediction 3atemperature 3atraps 3aMorocco 0aCydia pomonella 0avoltinism 0atemperature 0adegree-day 0adiapause1 aHmimina, M.0 tAnnals of the Entomological Society of America.g2016 Sept., v. 109, no. 5 p.698-704dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44731x1938-29017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aesa/saw0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01964naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002300142245006400165500001400229520085500243592002801098650002301126650001801149650003001167650002301197650001501220650002701235650001001262650001101272650001601283650001601299650001101315650001101326650001101337700002601348773011901374856007601493852000901569655001201578IND60718890020221116214638.0201126e20201106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071889002DNAL7 a10.3390/foods91116122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoskou, Dimitrios 10aOlive Oil: Processing Characterization, and Health Benefits  aNAL-light  aThe Mediterranean diet is now well known worldwide and recognized as a nutrition reference model by the World Health Organization.

By combining remotely sensed data with fieldwork, system dynamics modelling and qualitative research methods, we examine local level realities of land use and availability in the Malen Chiefdom of Southern Sierra Leone. Here, local communities are experiencing the outcomes of large-scale investments in oil palm for biodiesel and other industrial purposes by the SOCFIN Agricultural Company. We find that beyond agricultural production, there are other land uses that are vital for the socio-cultural, economic and environmental realities of communities. The Company does not respect engagements promised to local people to set aside buffer zones around living areas to serve as biodiversity corridors. Local communities are severely deprived of agricultural land and other land resources. The operations of SOCFIN do not take account of present or future land needs of local people. A baseline requirement of food crop land should be set aside for each community, to ensure the attainment of food security in communities affected by land acquisitions. Such baseline requirement should be augmented with local level needs assessments to meet new demand for cropland necessitated by changing demography. This model of land planning can be applied to other land use and additional engagements of large-scale land investors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElaeis guineensis 3abiodiesel 3abiodiversity 3acropland 3ademography 3afood crops 3afood security 3aland use 3amodels 3apeople 3aplanning 3aqualitative analysis 3aremote sensing 3aresearch methods 3aSierra Leone1 aArmah, Frederick Ato0 tGeoJournal.g2016 Feb., v. 81, no. 1 p.103-122dSpringer Netherlandsx0343-25217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10708-014-9606-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01975naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002200112245013700134300001800271520078200289592002801071650001201099650002601111650001201137650002701149650002601176650001101202650001401213650001301227650001301240650001901253650000901272651001001281653001601291653001701307653002301324653001401347700001801361700002401379773015301403852000901556655001201565IND60706473820221122051546.0200807e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070647382DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShetty, S.

Schistosomiasis is a chronic disease that affects over 260 million people globally, particularly in tropical and sub-tropical regions. One strategy that has been proposed as a way to prevent human infection by the parasite, involves the use of pheromone traps to lure the snail host away from areas of human activity. This requires an understanding of chemosensory communication in B. glabrata, especially of the chemoattractive factors. Although evidence indicates that specific chemical communication takes place, little is known about chemoattractants produced by the snail itself. Here, we report on the functional characterization of an endogenously produced temptin-like protein (BgTemptin) from B. glabrata and demonstrate that recombinant BgTemptin is attractive to this snail. Exposure of B. glabrata to BgTemptin results in 81% (lane maze) and 70% (T-maze) time spent near to the BgTemptin source. This effect, which is dependent on the concentration of the protein, provides another tool that can be further developed and used in efforts to control and eliminate schistosomiasis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBiomphalaria glabrata 3aSchistosoma mansoni 3achemical communication 3achemoattractants 3achronic diseases 3afreshwater 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3aintermediate hosts 3aparasites 3apheromone traps 3apheromones 3aschistosomiasis 3asnails 3asubtropics1 aPeck, Shauna J.1 aHanington, Patrick C.0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g2017 Oct., v. 203, no. 10 p.855-866dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0340-75947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00359-017-1198-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02396naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006600148245012900214520111900343592002801462650002001490650001501510650002201525650002001547650002301567650001101590650002401601653003801625653002101663653002001684653003301704653001601737653002001753653003701773773012001810856008301930852000902013655001202022IND60682285420221119004240.0200221e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068228542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csda.2020.1069242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJhwueng, Dwueng-Chwuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5893-364510aModeling rate of adaptive trait evolution using Cox–Ingersoll–Ross process: An Approximate Bayesian Computation approach  aOver the past decades, Gaussian processes have been widely used to study trait evolution. In particular, two members of Gaussian processes, Brownian motion and the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process, have been frequently applied for describing continuous trait evolution. Several models (OUBM, OUOU, OUBMBM, OUOUBM) have been proposed to study the impact on the optimum of a trait by other traits. Applying the Cox–Ingersoll–Ross (CIR) process on rate of evolution, which prevents rates from becoming negative, is a potentially useful extension developed here as the OUBMCIR and OUOUCIR models. Since the likelihood functions of the OUBMCIR and the OUOUCIR models are intractable, a heuristic algorithm for parameter estimation and inference under Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) is proposed. Simulation studies show that new models perform well. Empirical analysis using several data sets from literature also provides evidence of the validity and utility of the new models.

However, throttling losses are high when air is stored at high pressure into tanks. In this work, vortex tubes are proposed to convert part of the excess pressure into useful heating and cooling. Vortex tubes are optimized for the specific need of the community of Aupaluk using two different multi-objective algorithms and validated thermodynamic models for both vortex tubes and the compressed air energy storage system. Results show that vortex tubes increase the performance of the system for five different performance metrics and that they may generate liquid carbon dioxide from atmospheric air as an additional by-product. This work demonstrated the potential of vortex tubes in compressed air energy storage systems, but experimental and numerical works are necessary to confirm their performance at high inlet pressure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3aair 3abyproducts 3acarbon dioxide 3aenergy conversion 3aheat 3aliquids 3arenewable energy sources 0aCompressed-air energy storage system 0aRanque-Hilsch vortex tube 0aTrigeneration 0aThrottling losses 0aThermodynamic model 0aMultiobjective optimization1 aLagrandeur, Junior1 aCheayb, Mohamad1 aPoncet, Sébastien0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2021 July 15, v. 240 p.114225-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2021.1142253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02310naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245013900131300001800270520105400288592002801342650002101370650001501391650001401406650001301420650002501433650001201458650001501470650002701485650002501512650001401537650000901551650002201560650001001582650001601592651001001608653001301618653001101631653000801642653001501650700002201665700001501687773015301702852000901855655001201864IND60706474020221121062330.0200807e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070647402DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShivakumar, L.10aInfluence of Tempeature, Rainfall and Relative Humidity on Productivity of Groundnut in Northern Transition Zone (Zone 8) of Karnataka  ap. 3502-3505.  aThe groundnut cultivar JL 24 was tried during kharif season of 2012 the experiment was designed in randomized complete block design consisting of three replications and eleven ratios of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P₂O₅) fertilizers with potassium level as constant (25 kg K₂O ha⁻¹) at MARS, UAS, Dharwad.

It is therefore surprising that certain ionic liquids (ILs) were found to interact with PEDOT and thereby to a large extent disrupt the ordered structure. The current work demonstrates the expansion of the interlayer distance (d₁₀₀) of PEDOT and the composite of PEDOT with poly(ethyleneglycol) (PEDOT(PTS):PEG) in the presence of IL mixtures containing triisobutylmethylphosphonium tosylate (P₁₄₄₄PTS) and water. In presence of the mixtures, the PEDOT(PTS):PEG film expands up to ∼100% while the PEDOT(PTS) film expanded ∼50%. The expansion did not increase the electrical resistance but increased the absorption in the π–π* range, which can be explained by increased shielding of the PEDOT chains by the IL. The incorporation of P₁₄₄₄PTS increased the capacitance by 350%, compared to the theoretical capacitance of PEDOT(PTS), due to the formation of additional double-layer capacitance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acapacitance 3aelectrical resistance 3aelectrochemistry 3aethylene glycol 3aionic liquids 3apolyethylene glycol1 aRivnay, J.q(Jonathan),1 aMalliaras, George1 aWinther-Jensen, Bjorn0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2013 July 31, v. 135, no. 30 p.11309-11313dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja405032c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01478naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245008300168520044300251592002800694650002500722650000900747650003000756653003000786653001500816653002500831653001800856653001400874700002000888700005900908773009400967856008201061852000901143655001201152IND60746536320221122065146.0210820e20210827xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074653632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2021.1323672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBehera, Sagarika10aGold(III) catalyzed stereoselective synthesis of dialkyl dihydrofuran acetates  aA gold (III) catalyzed stereoselective cycloisomerization of 5-disubstituted-5-hydroxypent-2-yn alkanoate is described.

The rice cultivars tested showed 80, 68 and 64 polymorphism percentages amongst them as revealed by rice marker SSR, SRAP and RAPD analyses respectively. The SSR, SRAP and RAPD analyses showed 18, 8 and 17 genotype-specific markers respectively. The dendrogram constructed based on the statistics gathered from different molecular markers explain the genetic relationship amongst the six Egyptian rice cultivars. The rice genome was screened for ten SSR locus associated with insects resistance genes which is located in distinctive chromosomes started from chromosome number 7 to number 12. The cultivars showed different number of alleles and Sakha 103 exhibited the highest allelic number (17 alleles) compared to the other cultivars tested. The genotype specific markers and the insect associated SSR markers can be used for cultivar identification at the molecular level and can be considered as useful markers for rice breeding and the effective management strategy to control pest.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChilo suppressalis 3aDNA 3aOryza sativa 3achromosome number 3acultivar identification 3acultivars 3aevolution 3agenetic relationships 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3ainsects 3aloci 3apest control 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3arice 3astatistics1 aKhashaba, Etr H.

Although the associated increase in seal-related soil disturbance is known to impact indigenous vegetation, the effect of increasing fur seal numbers on exotic plant species is not yet clear. Here, we compare plant species composition and cover between 26 sites with high fur seal impact paired with nearby control sites on sub-Antarctic Marion Island. Seal-affected sites had a significantly higher number and cover of exotic plants, specifically of the widespread sub-Antarctic invaders, Poa annua and Sagina procumbens, than control sites. Furthermore, some of the native species, most notably the disturbance-sensitive species, Blechnum penna-marina, were significantly less abundant in seal-affected sites compared to controls. We propose that this is a result of both physical trampling, which opens up niches for exotics by damaging natives, and nutrient enrichment of the soils, giving exotic species a competitive advantage over natives. While other studies have noticed associations between exotic plant species and indigenous animal disturbance, this is, to the best of our knowledge, the first study to empirically show that the successful recovery of fur seal populations can have undesirable side-effects such as the enhanced persistence of exotic plant species. We recommend that alien plant management plans specifically include areas of increased animal disturbance into their programmes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArctocephalus 3aBlechnum 3aPoa annua 3aSagina 3aadverse effects 3adisturbed soils 3aground cover plants 3aharvesting 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced plants 3aislands 3aoceans 3aseals 3asoil nutrients 3aspecies diversity 3avegetation 0aExotic plants 0aFur seals 0aMarion Island 0aNutrient enrichment 0aPhysical soil disturbance 0asub-Antarctic1 aRudolph, Elizabeth M.1 aKalwij, Jesse M.1 aMcIntyre, Trevor0 tBiological conservation.g2013 June, v. 162 p.33-40dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2013.03.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02691naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245009300169300001600262500001400278520123900292592002801531596004401559650001301603650001801616650001801634650001301652650001601665650001901681650001401700650001301714650001901727650001001746650001401756650001701770650001301787650001101800650002201811650001001833650001001843650001601853700001801869700002401887700002201911700003101933773013001964856008202094852000902176655001202185IND60724645720221122032244.0210122e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072464572DNAL7 a10.1007/s10924-020-01884-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavid, Grégoire10aUpcycling of Vine Shoots: Production of Fillers for PHBV-Based Biocomposite Applications  ap. 404-417.  aNAL-light  aThis paper aims at investigating the potential of vine shoots (ViSh) upcycling as fillers in novel poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) based biocomposites. ViSh particles of around 50 µm (apparent median diameter) were obtained combining dry grinding processes, and mixed with PHBV using melt extrusion. Thermal stability and elongation at break of biocomposites were reduced with increasing contents of ViSh particles (10, 20 and 30 wt%), while Young’s modulus and water vapor permeability were increased. It was shown that a surface gas-phase esterification allowed to significantly increase the hydrophobicity of ViSh particles (increase of water contact angles from 59° to 114°), leading to a reduction of 27% in the water vapor permeability of the biocomposite filled with 30 wt% of ViSh. The overall mechanical performance was not impacted by gas-phase esterification, demonstrating that the interfacial adhesion between the virgin ViSh particles and the PHBV matrix was already good and that such filler surface treatment was not required in that case. It was concluded that ViSh particles can be interestingly used as low cost fillers in PHBV-based biocomposites to decrease the overall cost of materials.  aPublisher supplied data  a688338cH2020 European Research Council 3aadhesion 3abiocomposites 3acontact angle 3adiameter 3aenvironment 3aesterification 3aextrusion 3agrinding 3ahydrophobicity 3apaper 3aparticles 3apermeability 3apolymers 3ashoots 3athermal stability 3avines 3awater 3awater vapor1 aHeux, Laurent1 aPradeau, Stéphanie1 aGontard, Nathalie1 aAngellier-Coussy, Hélène0 tJournal of polymers and the environment.g2021 Feb., v. 29, no. 2 p.404-417dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3870065x1566-25437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10924-020-01884-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02779naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245011800164300001400282520140300296592002801699650002901727650002201756650001101778650000901789650001601798650001101814650001101825650001201836650002701848650001701875650001701892650001601909653002201925653002201947653002901969653001301998653001202011700005402023700001802077700001802095773011602113856008302229852000902312655001202321IND60539884320221120082018.0190318e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053988432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jspr.2014.01.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaoua, I.B.10aTriple bag hermetic technology for post-harvest preservation of Bambara groundnut (Vigna subterranea (L.)

Verdc.). One set of experiments used grain heavily infested by Callosobruchus maculatus (F.) while a second set began with a low level infestation. Each experiment consisted of V. subterranea grain kept in four replicate 50 kg PICS bags or two replicate woven bags as controls. Two to five days after the beginning of the experiments, oxygen level inside the bags averaged about 21% (v/v) in the controls but decreased significantly in PICS bags, reaching 10% (v/v) with the heavily infested grain but falling only slightly in the lightly infested grain. After 7 months of storage, (i) the number of C. maculatus adults found between and within the grains, (ii) the 100 seed weight, (iii) the number of seed with holes, and (iv) the percentage germination of grain stored in PICS bags did not differ from what had been measured on the day that the experiment was set up. In woven bags, by contrast, there was a massive increase in C. maculatus numbers with means of 309 and 251 adults per 500 g in heavily and lightly infested grain, respectively. Grain weight losses in the woven bag controls ranged from 8 to 19% and the percentage of C. maculatus emergence holes per 100 seed increased from 51 to 135%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCallosobruchus maculatus 3aVigna subterranea 3aadults 3abags 3agermination 3agrains 3aoxygen 3apeanuts 3apostharvest technology 3astorage time 3astored grain 3aweight loss 0aBambara groundnut 0aVigna subterranea 0aCallosobruchus maculatus 0aHermetic 0aStorage1 aAmadou, L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5139-99851 aBaributsa, D.1 aMurdock, L.L.0 tJournal of stored products research.g2014 July, v. 58 p.48-52dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45775x0022-474X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jspr.2014.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02977naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245011600211520125900327592002801586650002401614650002101638650002101659650002701680650001301707650002901720650001001749650001201759650001301771650001601784650001701800650001301817650003701830650001001867650001401877650001301891650002401904653001101928653002501939653002501964653001301989700006402002700006302066700002402129700003202153700002502185700002402210773012102234856008302355852000902438655001202447IND60760089020221122073847.0220228e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076008902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jevs.2021.1038402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLisboa, Fernando P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5157-150610aIn Vitro Antimicrobial Activity of Selected Essential Oils Against Endometritis-Causing Microorganisms in Mares  aThis study aimed to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of essential oils (EO) from Ocimum basilicum (basil), Rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary), and Cymbopogon citratus (lemongrass) on endometritis-causing microorganisms in mares. Serial concentrations of the EO from 30.00 mg/mL to 0.47 mg/mL were tested. The major compounds of O. basilicum EO were linalyl acetate (33.32 wt.%) and citronellal (25.06 wt.%); of R. officinalis EO were borneol (26.48 wt.%), trans-β-ocimene (16.76 wt.%), camphene (12.45 wt.%), and α-phellandrene (11.08 wt.%); and of C. citratus EO were geranial (45.96 wt.%) and neral (32.62 wt.%). Regarding antimicrobial activity, C. citratus EO has had the highest inhibition percentage (73.9%), followed by O. basilicum (67.2%) and R. officinalis (58.7%). P. aeruginosa was the only pathogen unable to establish the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values for the studied EO. The EOs were effective against all other microorganisms (S. equi, S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, E. coli, and C. Albicans). In conclusion, the EOs of O. basilicum, R. officinalis, and C. citratus have presented in vitro antimicrobial activity against microorganisms causing endometritis in mares.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCymbopogon citratus 3aEscherichia coli 3aOcimum basilicum 3aRosmarinus officinalis 3aacetates 3aantimicrobial properties 3abasil 3aborneol 3acamphene 3acitronellal 3aendometritis 3ageranial 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3aneral 3apathogens 3arosemary 3aveterinary medicine 0aEquine 0aBacterial resistance 0aPhytopharmaceuticals 0aTerpenes1 aSilvestre, Wendel P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9376-64051 aCastro, Jéssica O.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1664-39861 aMartins, Gabriel V.1 aSegabinazzi, Lorenzo G.T.M.1 aPauletti, Gabriel F.1 aDell'Aqua, José A.0 tJournal of equine veterinary science.g2022 Mar., v. 110 p.103840-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl33309x0737-08067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2021.1038403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02813naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245014200166300001400308520151500322592002801837650002601865650001601891650001501907650001201922650003501934650002101969650001501990650001502005650001502020650001202035651001102047653002302058653001502081653001802096653001002114653001902124700002502143700002002168773009702188856008502285852000902370655001202379IND60537774720221121015426.0190416e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053777472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoser.2015.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, Greg10aPhysical landscape associations with mapped ecosystem values with implications for spatial value transfer: An empirical study from Norway  ap. 19-34.  aThe identification of spatial associations between perceived ecosystem values and physical landscapes is confronted by a diversity of mapping methods, heterogeneous human populations, and variability in physical landscape classification systems. This study reviews previous research on spatial associations and reports new empirical findings from Norway to describe the potential for spatial “value transfer” methods that extrapolate ecosystem values to other locations. Public participation GIS (PPGIS) survey methods were implemented in two separate study areas in Norway to identify ecosystem values and to analyze their spatial association with land cover data. The ecosystem value associations with land cover were generally consistent with global findings reported elsewhere, with forested areas providing multiple ecosystem “bundles” supporting both recreation-related and provisioning values. Alternative value transfer methods were demonstrated using recreation value to compare actual with predicted distributions using land cover indices derived from value proportions, deviations from expected distribution, and correlation coefficients with ecosystem value bundles. The use of simple ecosystem value percentages located within land cover classes provided the best predictive results for value transfer in this study. The limitations and potential for value transfer methods based on spatial associations between mapped ecosystem values and physical landscape characteristics are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acitizen participation 3acorrelation 3aecosystems 3aforests 3ageographic information systems 3ahuman population 3aland cover 3alandscapes 3arecreation 3asurveys 3aNorway 0aEcosystem services 0aLand cover 0aSocial values 0aPPGIS 0aValue transfer1 aHelene Hausner, Vera1 aLægreid, Eiliv0 tEcosystem services.g2015 Oct., v. 15 p.19-34dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21609x2212-04167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2015.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01704naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245015700172300001400329520045900343592002800802650001500830650001400845650001700859650001400876650001700890651001400907653001300921653002000934653002400954653002200978653002501000653002501025653001801050700002301068773013701091856008101228852000901309655001201318IND60747487920221122063710.0210813e20200512xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074748792DNAL7 a10.1654/1525-2647-87.1.932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoldberg, Stephen R.10aNew Helminth Records for the Robust Ctenotus, Ctenotus robustus, and the Copper-tailed Skink, Ctenotus taeniolatus (Squamata: Scincidae), from Australia  ap. 93-94.  aEight robust ctenotus individuals, Ctenotus robustus Storr, 1970, and 8 copper-tailed skinks, Ctenotus taeniolatus (White, 1790), from Australia were examined for helminths.

The degree of genetic similarity between parents may influence the number and viability of offspring. Females may therefore mate with several males as an insurance against sterile, low quality or genetically incompatible mates, but also to obtain half sibling offspring that are genetically and phenotypically more diverse. We examine the links between polyandry, multiple paternity and offspring phenotypic diversity in the color polymorphic pygmy grasshopper Tetrix subulata. By experimentally mating virgin females and genotyping the resulting offspring using microsatellite markers, we demonstrate that polyandrous females can produce offspring sired by different males. Analyses of microsatellite data and color patterns of captive reared families produced by wild caught females that were not mated in the laboratory, confirmed that multiple paternity occurs in the wild, and that it may increase color morph diversity among half-siblings. Polyandrous mating behavior may thus influence the evolutionary dynamics and maintenance of color polymorphism in this species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTetrix subulata 3acolor 3agenetic markers 3agenotyping 3agrasshoppers 3ainsurance 3amales 3amating behavior 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aparents 3apaternity 3aphenotypic variation 3apolyandry 3aprogeny 3arearing 3aviability 3avirgin females 0acolor polymorphism 0agrasshoppers 0amicrosatellites 0amultiple paternity 0aoffspring diversity 0aOrthoptera 0apolyandry 0arelatedness 0aTetrix subulata1 aCaesar, Sofia1 aForsman, Anders0 tJournal of orthoptera research.g2013 Dec., v. 22, no. 2 p.79-85dOrthopterists' Societyx1082-64677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1665%2F034.022.02043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03358naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245016900168300001600337500001900353520174200372592002802114650004402142650002202186650001102208650001902219650001302238650003502251650001502286650001602301650001302317650001702330700003002347700002702377700002202404700002502426700003102451700002602482700002102508700002202529700002802551700001802579700006002597773012802657856008202785852000902867655001202876IND60738969820221118171058.0210524e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073896982DNAL7 a10.1007/s00441-020-03374-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHashemi, Sheida10aComparison of osteogenic differentiation potential of induced pluripotent stem cells and buccal fat pad stem cells on 3D-printed HA/β-TCP collagen-coated scaffolds  ap. 403-421.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aProduction of a 3D bone construct with high-yield differentiated cells using an appropriate cell source provides a reliable strategy for different purposes such as therapeutic screening of the drugs. Although adult stem cells can be a good source, their application is limited due to invasive procedure of their isolation and low yield of differentiation. Patient-specific human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) can be an alternative due to their long-term self-renewal capacity and pluripotency after several passages, resolving the requirement of a large number of progenitor cells. In this study, a new biphasic 3D-printed collagen-coated HA/β-TCP scaffold was fabricated to provide a 3D environment for the cells. The fabricated scaffolds were characterized by the 3D laser scanning digital microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and mechanical test. Then, the osteogenesis potential of the hiPSC-seeded scaffolds was investigated compared to the buccal fat pad stem cell (BFPSC)-seeded scaffolds through in vitro and in vivo studies. In vitro results demonstrated up-regulated expressions of osteogenesis-related genes of RUNX2, ALP, BMP2, and COL1 compared to the BFPSC-seeded scaffolds. In vivo results on calvarial defects in the rats confirmed a higher bone formation in the hiPSC-seeded scaffolds compared to the BFPSC-seeded groups. The immunofluorescence assay also showed higher expression levels of collagen I and osteocalcin proteins in the hiPSC-seeded scaffolds. It can be concluded that using the hiPSC-seeded scaffolds can lead to a high yield of osteogenesis, and the hiPSCs can be used as a superior stem cell source compared to BFPSCs for bone-like construct bioengineering.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadults 3abone formation 3acollagen 3afluorescent antibody technique 3amicroscopy 3aosteocalcin 3aresearch 3atherapeutics1 aMohammadi Amirabad, Leila1 aFarzad-Mohajeri, Saeed1 aRezai Rad, Maryam1 aFahimipour, Farahnaz1 aArdeshirylajimi, Abdolreza1 aDashtimoghadam, Erfan1 aSalehi, Mohammad1 aSoleimani, Masoud1 aDehghan, Mohammad Mehdi1 aTayebi, Lobat1 aKhojasteh, Arash1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5378-852X0 tCell and tissue research.g2021 May, v. 384, no. 2 p.403-421dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl14430x0302-766X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-020-03374-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01138naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003400151245008300185300001600268520025500284592002800539650002400567650001000591650001300601650001000614650001600624651001100640773010300651856008500754852000900839655001200848IND60595617320221118012258.0180605e20171002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059561732DNAL7 a10.1080/00063657.2017.13855922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTurzańska-Pietras, Katarzyna10aBlue Tits Cyanistes caeruleus breeding in a House Martin Delichon urbicum nest  ap. 562-564.  aThis paper describes a breeding attempt by Blue Tits Cyanistes caeruleus in the nest of House Martins Delichon urbicum on the wall of a block of flats in Wrocław, Poland.

Most available assays are optimized for human medicine, but there is strong equine cross-reactivity because of the highly conserved nature of insulin. To identify an accurate and reliable assay for equine insulin, 6 commercial immunoassays were evaluated for precision, accuracy, and specificity. Only 1 assay initially reached the requisite standard: Mercodia Equine Insulin Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Plasma matrix interferences were identified when the provided assay buffer was used with the Siemens Count-a-Coat Insulin radioimmunoassay (RIA) but not when charcoal-stripped equine plasma was used as the diluent. This modified RIA and the Mercodia Equine Insulin ELISA were evaluated further by directly examining accuracy by comparing their results for 18 equine plasma samples with values obtained using liquid chromatography and high-resolution/high-accuracy mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Compared with LC-MS measurements, the modified Siemens Insulin RIA rendered a moderate Lin's concordance coefficient (ρc) of 0.41, whereas the Mercodia Equine Insulin ELISA rendered a very poor ρc of 0.06. This suggests that the Siemens Insulin RIA is appropriate to use for routine evaluations when LC-MS is not available.  aPublisher supplied data 3across reaction 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ahorses 3ainsulin 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3aradioimmunoassays 2aAnimals 2aHorsesxblood 2aInsulinxblood 2aRadioimmunoassayxveterinary 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSensitivity and Specificity1 aWynn, P.C.1 aBoston, R.C.1 aHarris, P.A.1 aSillence, M.N.1 aThevis, M.1 aThomas, A.1 aNoble, G.K.0 tDomestic animal endocrinology.g2011 Aug., v. 41, no. 2 p.81-90dElsevier Inc.x0739-72407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.domaniend.2011.05.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02886naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010700167300001500274520128900289592002801578650001301606650002201619650001901641650001001660650001101670650001401681650001501695650001201710650001401722650001701736650001901753650001601772650001301788650002101801650001901822650001601841650001601857650001601873651001201889653002301901653000901924653001401933700001901947700002001966700002201986700002402008700001902032700001802051700002302069773013802092856008102230852000902311655001202320IND60747488120221122063643.0210813e20200521xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074748812DNAL7 a10.1654/1525-2647-87.1.992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerrouch, Salma10aFirst Investigation of The Occurrence of Toxoplasma gondii Oocysts in Urban Soil in Marrakesh, Morocco  ap. 99-102.  aHumans can become infected by Toxoplasma gondii oocysts released in the environment along with felid feces through the accidental ingestion of contaminated raw meat, water, fruits and vegetables, or through direct contact with contaminated soil. Documenting the extent of soil contamination by T. gondii oocysts is necessary to prevent infection caused by this protozoan. The aim of our study is to determine the occurrence of T. gondii oocysts in urban soil in Marrakesh, Morocco. A total of 42 soil samples were collected from 9 sites in the urban area of Marrakesh. Oocysts were extracted by the flotation method, and detected by microscopy using both bright-field and UV. The frequency and spatial distribution of T. gondii in soil were analyzed considering the factors that could affect the mode of contamination, such as the presence of cats and the survival conditions of oocysts. All analyzed soil samples from Marrakesh were negative. The results of the present study are correlated to the sensitivity of our detection method as well as the presence of cats, the main reservoir of this parasite. In addition, temperature, moisture, and soil composition can significantly influence oocysts survival, and consequently affect the probability of human contamination through food.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProtozoa 3aToxoplasma gondii 3adirect contact 3afeces 3ahumans 3aingestion 3amicroscopy 3aoocysts 3aparasites 3aparasitology 3apolluted soils 3aprobability 3araw meat 3asoil composition 3asoil pollution 3atemperature 3aurban areas 3aurban soils 3aMorocco 0asoil contamination 0acats 0aMarrakesh1 aAjgoune, Hasna1 aHoummadi, Laila1 aAmraouza, Yassine1 aMaarouf, Abdelmalek1 aBoularbah, Ali1 aAdmou, Brahim1 aHafid, Jamaleddine0 tComparative parasitology.g2020 May 21, v. 87, no. 1 p.99-102dHelminthological Society of WashingtonwJournal:18529x1525-26477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1654/1525-2647-87.1.993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02012naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010200166300001300268520079400281592002801075650002901103650001201132650002501144650002501169650001201194650001701206650002401223650001701247651001901264653001101283653001301294653001501307653001601322653002901338653001201367700001601379773011501395856008301510852000901593655001201602IND60539884620221120082116.0190318e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053988462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jspr.2014.02.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurdock, L.L.10aOn Purdue Improved Cowpea Storage (PICS) technology: Background, mode of action, future prospects  ap. 3-11.  aHermetic or airtight storage of grain to suppress development of destructive populations of storage insect pests is an ancient technology that is finding modern applications in developing nations. Unprotected cowpea grain can be destroyed by unchecked growth of the bruchid, Callosobruchus maculatus (Walp). If the grain is kept in triple-layer hermetic plastic bags, losses are averted. The history, development and mode of action of triple-layer bagging for cowpea storage is reviewed here, as are lessons learned while bringing the technology to low-resource farmers in the developing nations of West and Central Africa.

Despite these measurements being fundamental to understanding the mechanisms and flow paths that deliver these constituents to river networks, there is a paucity of such data for headwater agricultural catchments. The aim of this paper is to deduce the dominant mechanisms for the delivery of fine sediment and phosphorus to an upland river network in the UK through characterisation of the temporal variability of hydrological fluxes, and associated soluble and particulate concentrations for the period spanning March 2012–February 2013. An assessment of the factors producing constituent hysteresis is undertaken following factor analysis (FA) on a suite of measured environmental variables representing the fluvial and wider catchment conditions prior to, and during catchment-wide hydrological events. Analysis indicates that suspended sediment is delivered to the fluvial system predominantly via rapidly responding pathways driven by event hydrology. However, evidence of complex, figure-of-eight hysteresis is observed following periods of hydrological quiescence, highlighting the importance of preparatory processes. Sediment delivery via a slow moving, probably sub-surface pathway does occur, albeit infrequently and during low magnitude events at the catchment outlet. Phosphorus is revealed to have a distinct hysteretic response to that of suspended sediment, with sub-surface pathways dominating. However, high magnitude events were observed to exhibit threshold-like behaviour, whereby activation and connection of usually disconnected depositional zones to the fluvial networks results in the movement of vast phosphorus fluxes. Multiple pathways are observed for particulate and soluble constituents, highlighting the challenges faced in mitigating the delivery of contaminant fluxes to headwater river systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural watersheds 3aenvironmental factors 3afactor analysis 3agrasslands 3ahighlands 3ahysteresis 3amonitoring 3aphosphorus 3arivers 3asediments 3asuspended sediment 3atemporal variation 3aturbidity 3aUnited Kingdom 0aFluvial 0aSuspended sediment 0aPhosphorus 0aDiffuse pollution 0aWater quality 0aHeadwater 0aConnectivity 0aGrassland1 aOwen, G.J.1 aBenskin, C.McW.H.1 aJonczyk, J.1 aDeasy, C.1 aBurke, S.1 aReaney, S.M.1 aHaygarth, P.M.0 tScience of the total environment.g2015 Aug. 01, v. 523 p.178-190dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.03.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04637naa a2200829 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002800171245013400199300001800333500001500351520227300366592002802639650000902667650001402676650001302690650001702703650001602720650001102736650001002747650001002757650002002767650003002787650001002817650001602827650001502843650001102858650002402869650001102893650001402904650001602918650001002934650001202944650005002956650002403006650002403030650002403054650001703078650001103095650002503106650000903131650002903140650002303169650004403192650001403236650001503250650003403265650000903299650002203308650002503330650001603355653001503371700002303386700001803409700002203427700001903449700002003468700002503488700002403513700001703537700002203554700002203576700002003598773011303618856005503731852000903786655001203795IND4465735520221122044453.0120727e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446573552DNAL7 a218837872pmid7 a10.1111/j.1462-2920.2011.02533.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan den Abbeele, Pieter10aArabinoxylans and inulin differentially modulate the mucosal and luminal gut microbiota and mucin‐degradation in humanized rats  ap. 2667-2680.  a2019-12-06  aThe endogenous gut microbiota affects the host in many ways. Prebiotics should favour beneficial intestinal microbes and thus improve host health. In this study, we investigated how a novel class of potential prebiotic long‐chain arabinoxylans (LC‐AX) and the well‐established prebiotic inulin (IN) modulate the gut microbiota of humanized rats. Six weeks after axenic rats were inoculated with a human faecal microbiota, their colonic microbiota was similar to this inoculum (∼ 70%), whereas their caecal microbiota was enriched with Verrucomicrobia and Firmicutes concomitant with lower abundance of Bacteroidetes. Moreover, different Bifidobacterium species colonized the lumen (B. adolescentis) and mucus (B. longum and B. bifidum). Both LC‐AX and IN increased SCFA levels and induced a shift from acetate towards health‐promoting propionate and butyrate respectively. By applying a high‐resolution phylogenetic micro‐array (HITChip) at the site of fermentation (caecum), IN and LC‐AX were shown to stimulate bacterial groups with known butyrate‐producers (Roseburia intestinalis, Eubacterium rectale, Anaerostipes caccae) and bifidobacteria (B. longum) respectively. Prebiotic administration also resulted in lower caecal abundances of the mucin‐degrading Akkermansia muciniphila and potentially more mucin production by the host. Both factors might explain the increased caecal mucin levels for LC‐AX (threefold) and IN (sixfold). These mucins were degraded along the colon, resulting in high faecal abundances of Akkermansia muciniphila for LC‐AX and especially IN‐treated rats. Finally, the microbial changes caused an adaptation period for the host with less weight gain, after which the host fine‐tuned the interaction with this altered microbiota. Our results demonstrate that next to IN, LC‐AX are promising prebiotic compounds by stimulating production of health‐promoting metabolites by specific microbes in the proximal regions. Further, prebiotic supplementation shifted mucin degradation to distal regions, where mucin‐degraders may produce beneficial metabolites (e.g. propionate by Akkermansia muciniphila), so that prebiotics may potentially improve gut health along the entire length of the intestine.  aPublisher supplied data 3arats 3abutyrates 3aacetates 3afermentation 3aweight gain 3ahumans 3ahosts 3acecum 3aBifidobacterium 3abeneficial microorganisms 3amucus 3apropionates 3aprebiotics 3amucins 3aEubacterium rectale 3ainulin 3aRoseburia 3ametabolites 3acolon 2aAnimals 2aBacteriaxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCecumxmicrobiology 2aColonxmicrobiology 2aFecesxmicrobiology 2aFermentation 2aHumans 2aInulinxpharmacology 2aMale 2aMetagenomexdrug effects 2aMucinsxmetabolism 2aOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis 2aPhylogeny 2aPrebiotics 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aRats 2aRats, Inbred F344 2aXylansxpharmacology 2aYoung Adult 0aadaptation1 aGérard, Philippe,1 aRabot, Sylvie1 aBruneau, Aurélia1 aEl Aidy, Sahar1 aDerrien, Muriel1 aKleerebezem, Michiel1 aZoetendal, Erwin G.1 aSmidt, Hauke1 aVerstraete, Willy1 aVan de Wiele, Tom1 aPossemiers, Sam0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2011 Oct., v. 13, no. 10 p.2667-2680dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1462-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2011.02533.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02683naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245012800209300001800337520135200355592002801707650002001735650001201755650001101767650001401778650002101792650001001813650001401823650001401837650001901851650002101870650001801891650001101909650001101920650000901931650001101940650001001951651001001961700001401971700002501985773013602010856008202146852000902228655001202237IND60742931920221120050642.0210627e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074293192DNAL7 a10.1007/s10722-021-01196-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrasad, Heerendra1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5088-177X10a“Kalpa 1” a new late colour development apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) bud sport originated from cv. Starking Delicious  ap. 2273-2279.  aBreeding in perennial fruit crops is time consuming process with relatively low success rate as compared with annual crops. Apple fruit coloration is painstaking as noticeable marker of maturity (early to late) and outer quality during the fruit breeding. The occurrence of spontaneous bud mutations in plants has often led to their subsequent development as commercial cultivars. Keeping in view, present investigation was undertaken to identify bud sports in apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) in H.P. of India. In this study, based upon pre-selection criteria such as time of colour development and time of fruit maturation were implemented, one bud sport ‘Kalpa 1’ was identified as distinctive late in fruit skin development as compared to fully red coloured fruits on its mother tree of cv. Starking Delicious in H.P. India with red streaked fruits over yellow ground colour on the bud sports did not mature even at harvesting, respectively. Apart from the distinguishing character for which the bud sports were identified, they also differed in fruit shape and size, fruit firmness, fruit maturity, TSS, acidity and starch iodine test strain area. The identified bud sport has unique character of late maturity indices in H.P. This unique variety can be grown in other temperate regions of India with the same soil and climatic condition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMalus domestica 3aacidity 3aapples 3abud sport 3aclimatic factors 3acolor 3acultivars 3aevolution 3afruit maturity 3afruit morphology 3afruit quality 3afruits 3aiodine 3asoil 3astarch 3atrees 3aIndia1 aKumar, K.1 aThakur, Dinesh Singh0 tGenetic resources and crop evolution.g2021 Aug., v. 68, no. 6 p.2273-2279dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl49569x0925-98647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10722-021-01196-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02947naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245009700174300001400271500001400285520154300299592002801842596006101870596004701931650001501978650001501993650002302008650002002031650002202051650000902073650001602082650002502098650001002123650001402133650002602147650000902173650002402182700002102206700003202227700002102259773013002280856008202410852000902492655001202501IND60724646420221120175459.0210122e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072464642DNAL7 a10.1007/s11259-020-09784-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHardwick, Laura J. A.10aBreed-related expression patterns of Ki67, γH2AX, and p21 during ageing in the canine liver  ap. 21-30.  aNAL-light  aCellular senescence is a molecular hallmark of ageing that is associated with multiple pathologies, and DNA damage marker γH2AX, together with cell cycle inhibitor p21, have been used as senescence markers in multiple species including dogs. Idiopathic canine chronic hepatitis has recognised breed-related differences in predisposition and prognosis, but reasons behind this are poorly understood. This retrospective study using archived post mortem tissue aimed to provide insight into liver ageing in 51 microscopically normal canine livers across seven breed categories, including those with and without increased risk of chronic hepatitis. Immunohistochemistry was conducted for γH2AX, p21, and cell proliferation marker Ki67, and the mean number of positive hepatocytes per high power field was determined. All three markers were strongly correlated to each other, but no age-dependent expression was seen in the combined study population. Overall expression levels were low in most dogs, with median values representing less than 1.5% of hepatocytes, but this increased to 20–30% in individual dogs at the upper end of the range. Individual breed differences were noted in two breeds that have increased risk of chronic hepatitis, with English Springer Spaniels having lower expression of Ki67 than other dogs, and Labradors having higher expression of Ki67 and γH2AX than other dogs. These results warrant further investigation in these breeds and highlight a need to validate reliable markers of cellular senescence in dogs.  aPublisher supplied data  aResearch FellowshipcPeterhouse, University of Cambridge  aRG99279cKennel Club Charitable Trust (UK) 3aDNA damage 3acell cycle 3acell proliferation 3acell senescence 3achronic hepatitis 3adogs 3ahepatocytes 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aliver 3aprognosis 3aretrospective studies 3arisk 3aveterinary medicine1 aKortum, Andre J.1 aConstantino-Casas, Fernando1 aWatson, Penny J.0 tVeterinary research communications.g2021 Feb., v. 45, no. 1 p.21-30dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl32719x0165-73807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11259-020-09784-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03288naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011400166300001600280520188800296592002802184650003302212650002502245650003002270650002102300650001602321650002302337650002502360650002302385650001502408650002002423650001302443650002102456650002902477650001902506650003902525650001602564650001102580700001502591700001402606700001502620773013802635856004802773852000902821655001202830IND50063648420221122231750.0130325e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006364842DNAL7 a10.1007/s00343-013-2170-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Xiaoling10aEffects of different enzymatic hydrolysis methods on the bioactivity of peptidoglycan in Litopenaeus vannamei  ap. 374-383.  aThe effects of different hydrolysis methods on peptidoglycan (PG) were assessed in terms of their impact on the innate immunity and disease resistance of Pacific white shrimp, Litop enaeus vannamei. PG derived from Bifidobacterium thermophilum was prepared in the laboratory and processed with lysozyme and protease under varying conditions to produce several different PG preparations. A standard shrimp feed was mixed with 0.05% PG preparations to produce a number of experimental diets for shrimp. The composition, concentration, and molecular weight ranges of the soluble PG were analyzed. Serum phenoloxidase and acid phosphatase activity in the shrimp were determined on Days 6—31 of the experiment. The protective activity of the PG preparations was evaluated by exposing shrimp to white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). Data on the composition of the PG preparations indicated that preparations hydrolyzed with lysozyme for 72 h had more low-molecular-weight PG than those treated for 24 h, and hydrolysis by protease enhanced efficiency of hydrolysis compared to lysozyme. SDS-PAGE showed changes in the molecular weight of the soluble PG produced by the different hydrolysis methods. Measurements of serum phenoloxidase and acid phosphatase activity levels in the shrimp indicated that the PG preparations processed with enzymes were superior to the preparation which had not undergone hydrolysis in enhancing the activity of the two serum enzymes. In addition, the preparation containing more low-molecular-weight PG enhanced the resistance of the shrimp to WSSV, whereas no increased resistance was observed for preparations containing less low-molecular-weight PG. These findings suggest that the immunity-enhancing activity of PG is related to its molecular weight and that increasing the quantity of low-molecular-weight PG can fortify the effect of immunity enhancement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBifidobacterium thermophilum 3aLitopenaeus vannamei 3aWhite spot syndrome virus 3aacid phosphatase 3ablood serum 3adisease resistance 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aexperimental diets 3ahydrolysis 3ainnate immunity 3alysozyme 3amolecular weight 3amonophenol monooxygenase 3apeptidoglycans 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aproteinases 3ashrimp1 aZhang, Yue1 aWei, Song1 aHuang, Jie0 tChinese journal of oceanology and limnology.g2013 Mar., v. 31, no. 2 p.374-383dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:J000001677x0254-40597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-013-2170-7  aDNAL 7aarticle01837naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002500146245016500171300001200336520060100348592002800949650001100977650002000988650003001008650001201038650001701050650001101067651001301078653001601091653002701107653001501134653001601149653002101165653002101186700001901207773013601226856008001362852000901442655001201451IND60747488420221122055407.0210813e20210125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074748842DNAL7 a10.1654/1525-2647-88.1.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcAllister, Chris T.10aPfeifferinella gugleri (Apicomplexa: Pfeifferinellidae) in Half-Lidded Ovals, Patera binneyana (Gastropoda: Stylommatophora: Polygyridae), from Oklahoma, U.S.A.  ap. 1-3.  aFecal samples collected in April 2019 from 10 half-lidded ovals, Patera binneyana (Pilsbry, 1899) (Gastropoda), in McCurtain County, Oklahoma, U.S.A., were examined for coccidial parasites.

Among various molecular parameters, cohesive interactions between polymer chains are found to play a key role in influencing the thermomechanical response of glass-forming polymers. Here, we employ atomistically informed coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG-MD) simulations to study the mechanical properties of the polymer material in a glassy state. Built upon the recently developed “energy renormalization” (ER) coarse-graining approach, we take polycarbonate (PC) as a model system to systematically explore the shear response and dynamical heterogeneity of polymers under the influence of cohesive interactions. Our results show that the polymer with a larger cohesive interaction exhibits a greater shear modulus and a higher degree of dynamical heterogeneity, which is uncovered by evaluating the local molecular stiffness. This pronounced dynamical heterogeneity with increasing cohesive interactions is found to be closely correlated to the packing frustration at a molecular level, which can be quantified by the glass “fragility”, a measure of the relative strength of the temperature dependence of relaxation. Our findings highlight the critical role of cohesive interaction on the mechanical behavior of glassy polymers and provoke the idea of achieving a tailored design of polymer materials via molecular-level engineering.  aPublisher supplied data 3aengineering 3aglass 3amechanical properties 3amodels 3amodulus of elasticity 3amolecular dynamics 3apolymers 3atemperature1 aXia, Wenjie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7870-01280 tMacromolecules.g2020 Mar. 27, v. 53, no. 7 p.2754-2763dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.0c000673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03059naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002600153245018600179300001600365520166200381592002802043650002602071650003002097650002102127650001202148650001102160650002102171650003502192650005002227650001302277650001602290653000902306653001002315653001602325653001602341653003502357700002302392700002002415773010602435856008702541852000902628655001202637IND60545708920221120182345.0160902e20150815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054570892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.02.1062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiagkouridis, Ioannis10aPhysical–chemical properties and evaluative fate modelling of ‘emerging’ and ‘novel’ brominated and organophosphorus flame retardants in the indoor and outdoor environment  ap. 416-426.  aSeveral groups of flame retardants (FRs) have entered the market in recent years as replacements for polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), but little is known about their physical–chemical properties or their environmental transport and fate. Here we make best estimates of the physical–chemical properties and undertake evaluative modelling assessments (indoors and outdoors) for 35 so-called ‘novel’ and ‘emerging’ brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and 22 organophosphorus flame retardants (OPFRs). A QSPR (Quantitative Structure-Property Relationship) based technique is used to reduce uncertainty in physical–chemical properties and to aid property selection for modelling, but it is evident that more, high quality property data are required for improving future assessments. Evaluative modelling results show that many of the alternative FRs, mainly alternative BFRs and some of the halogenated OPFRs, behave similarly to the PBDEs both indoors and outdoors. These alternative FRs exhibit high overall persistence (Pov), long-range transport potential (LRTP) and POP-like behaviour and on that basis cannot be regarded as suitable replacements to PBDEs. A group of low molecular weight alternative BFRs and non-halogenated OPFRs show a potentially better environmental performance based on Pov and LRTP metrics. Results must be interpreted with caution though since there are significant uncertainties and limited data to allow for thorough model evaluation. Additional environmental parameters such as toxicity and bioaccumulative potential as well as functionality issues should be considered in an industrial substitution strategy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental factors 3aenvironmental performance 3aflame retardants 3amarkets 3amodels 3amolecular weight 3apolybrominated diphenyl ethers 3aquantitative structure-activity relationships 3atoxicity 3auncertainty 0aBFRs 0aOPFRs 0aIndoor fate 0aPersistence 0aPhysical–chemical properties1 aCousins, Anna Palm1 aCousins, Ian T.0 tScience of the total environment.g2015 Aug. 15, v. 524-525 p.416-426dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.02.1063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02455naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245013900172300001400311520090400325592002801229650001901257650002501276650001601301650001201317650001201329650001501341650002201356650001601378650001101394650001401405650001101419650001701430650001101447650001001458651001301468651001301481653001401494653001301508653001001521653001001531653001701541653001401558700002201572700002101594700002401615700002601639700002001665773013801685856008101823852000901904655001201913IND60747488520221122055309.0210813e20210211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074748852DNAL7 a10.1654/1525-2647-88.1.222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcAllister, Chris T.10aParasites of Southern Short-Tailed Shrews, Blarina carolinensis (Mammalia: Eulipotyphla: Soricidae) from Arkansas and Oklahoma, U.S.A.  ap. 22-33.  aFrom November 2016 to October 2020, 14 adult southern short-tailed shrews, Blarina carolinensis (Bachman), were collected from Arkansas (n = 10) and Oklahoma (n = 4) and examined for parasites.

In this study, the genetic diversity and relationships of eight cultivated populations of A. tsao-ko grown in Southwest China were examined using sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) and inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers. The results showed that 139 (99.29%) of 140 and 185 (99.46%) of 186 bands were polymorphic by SRAP and ISSR primers amplification, respectively. The polymorphic information content of detected bands were 0.270 (SRAP) and 0.232 (ISSR), respectively. The average Nei’s gene diversity (H = 0.217) and Shannon’s information index (I = 0.348) at the species level generated by SRAP primer were higher than those by ISSR analysis (H = 0.158, I = 0.272). Genetic differentiation coefficients and molecular variance analysis (AMOVA) indicated that the genetic variance of A. tsao-ko mainly occurred within populations rather than among populations. The high genetic identity among populations was revealed by SRAP (0.937) and ISSR (0.963). Using UPGMA cluster analysis, principal coordinate analysis, and population structure analysis, the accessions were categorized into two major groups. Overall, results obtained here will be useful for A. tsao-ko germplasm characterization, conservation, and utilization.  aPublisher supplied data  a31460380cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a202001BA070001-181cSpecial Basic Cooperative Research Programs of Yunnan Provincial Undergraduate Universities’ Association  a2014GG0101cYouth Academic Backbone Project of Honghe University  a2018ZDXK02cAgricultural Discipline Construction Project of Honghe University 3aAmomum tsao-ko 3aOriental traditional medicine 3acluster analysis 3aevolution 3agenetic variance 3agenetic variation 3agermplasm evaluation 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amultidimensional scaling 3apopulation structure 3avariance 3aChina1 aWang, Tiantao1 aLu, Bingyue1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0410-15760 tGenetic resources and crop evolution.g2021 Aug., v. 68, no. 6 p.2655-2667dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl49569x0925-98647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10722-021-01204-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01907naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245006300168300001800231520083000249592002801079650001501107650001301122650001001135650002601145650002301171650002201194650002401216650001101240650002101251700001801272700001701290700001601307700001401323773010601337856008101443852000901524655001201533IND60120512120221123020347.0150207e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012051212DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-013-7484-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarbonaro, C.

It was found that the optical properties of the coumarin, which are not affected by the polymeric PEG support, are preserved upon loading into the silica porous support.

We report on the real-time mass spectrometric analysis of human breath as a potential method to be used in this field. The breath of 12 subjects was analyzed during 9 days by secondary electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (SESI-MS). The samples were collected during four time slots: morning (8:00–11:00), before lunch (11:00–13:00), after lunch (13:00–15:00), and late afternoon (15:00–18:00). A total of 203 mass spectra were statistically analyzed. Univariate analysis revealed a number of features with a marked temporal behavior. Principal component analysis/canonical analysis showed a clear temporal evolution of the breath patterns. A blind cross-validation yielded 84% of correct classifications of the time slot at which the breath samples were collected. We conclude that this approach seems to have potential for the investigation of biological clocks, including the description of internal body time, which may have important implications for the timing of pharmacotherapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiological clocks 3abreath tests 3adiurnal variation 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3ahumans 3alunch 3ametabolome 3amonitoring 3aprincipal component analysis1 aKohler, Malcolm1 aZenobi, Renato0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2013 Jan. 02, v. 85, no. 1 p.369-373dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ac30290973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02450naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245012200169300001400291520115200305592002801457650001101485650001601496650001701512650001401529650001101543653003701554653002001591653001201611653002001623653002101643653001501664653001701679653001301696653001101709653003301720700002601753700002201779773013701801856008101938852000902019655001202028IND60747488620221122055424.0210813e20210302xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074748862DNAL7 a10.1654/1525-2647-88.1.342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerzog, Kaylee S.12aA New Species of Tapeworm in the Genus Stillabothrium (Rhinebothriidea: Escherbothriidae) from a Stingray from Borneo  ap. 34-40.  aExamination of spiral intestines from Himantura tutulBorsa, Durand, Shen, Arlyza, Solihin, and Berrebi, 2013 (=Himantura uarnak 3 sensu Naylor et al.

The new species is distinguished from its congeners by features of the scolex and proglottids, including a vagina that recurves well anterior to the cirrus sac, as well as a unique locular arrangement not previously reported for members of this genus: 4 horizontally oriented loculi in the anterior region of the bothridia and 7 vertically oriented loculi in the posterior region of the bothridia.

Denver Water, as part of the EPA's Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule 2 (UCMR2) monitoring campaign, found detectable levels of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) at all sites of maximum residency within the distribution system. To better understand the occurrence of nitrosamines and nitrosamine precursors, Denver Water undertook a comprehensive year-long monitoring campaign. Samples were taken every two weeks to monitor for NDMA in the distribution system, and quarterly sampling events further examined 9 nitrosamines and nitrosamine precursors throughout the treatment and distribution systems. NDMA levels within the distribution system were typically low (>1.3 to 7.2ng/L) with a remote distribution site (frequently >200h of residency) experiencing the highest concentrations found. Eight other nitrosamines (N-nitrosomethylethylamine, N-nitrosodiethylamine, N-nitroso-di-n-propylamine, N-nitroso-di-n-butylamine, N-nitroso-di-phenylamine, N-nitrosopyrrolidine, N-nitrosopiperidine, N-nitrosomorpholine) were also monitored but none of these 8, or precursors of these 8 [as estimated with formation potential (FP) tests], were detected anywhere in raw, partially-treated or distribution samples. Throughout the year, there was evidence that seasonality may impact NDMA formation, such that lower temperatures (~5–10°C) produced greater NDMA than during warmer months. The year of sampling further provided evidence that water quality and weather events may impact NDMA precursor loads. Precursor loading estimates demonstrated that NDMA precursors increased during treatment (potentially from cationic polymer coagulant aids). The precursor analysis also provided evidence that precursors may have increased further within the distribution system itself. This comprehensive study of a large-scale drinking water system provides insight into the variability of NDMA occurrence in a chloraminated system, which may be impacted by seasonality, water quality changes and/or the varied origins of NDMA precursors within a given system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aN-nitrosodimethylamine 3adiethylnitrosamine 3adrinking water 3amonitoring 3apollutants 3apolymers 3arisk 3atemperature 3awater quality 3aweather 0aN-nitrosodimethylamine 0aFull-scale 0aDistribution system 0aSeasonality 0aDisinfection by-products 0aOccurrence1 aTrenholm, Rebecca A.1 aHale, Bruce1 aCampbell, Zeke1 aDickenson, Eric R.V.0 tScience of the total environment.g2015 July 01, v. 520 p.120-126dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.03.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03364naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005400148245013400202300001800336520158100354592002801935596008401963596011002047650001402157650002302171650002202194650001102216650002902227650001402256650001202270650001202282650001402294650002702308650001302335650001202348650002502360650003302385650001602418651001002434651001802444700001402462700001202476700001302488700001802501700001502519700001402534700005902548773013602607856008202743852000902825655001202834IND60742932420221121144732.0210627e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074293242DNAL7 a10.1007/s10722-021-01137-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Diansi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9679-895810aGenetic diversity and population structure of popcorn germplasm resources using genome-wide SNPs through genotyping-by-sequencing  ap. 2379-2389.  aPopcorn is a kind of snack food and has a breeding history of nearly 40 years in China, however, there are relatively few studies on its genetic diversity. Therefore, we present a genetic diversity and population structure analysis of 103 popcorn accessions, including 10 landraces from Latin America, 8 landraces from Southwest China and 76 and 9 popcorn breeding lines from China and the US, respectively, using polymorphic single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) developed by genotyping-by-sequencing. A total of 40,120 high-quality SNPs (19.21 SNPs per 1 Mb) were identified across the genome. Relative kinship analysis showed that the kinship coefficients for 0.3% of the pairs of lines were above 0.300, which agrees with the pedigree. The 103 accessions could be classified into three major groups based on model-based population structure, Neighbor-joining clustering, and principal component analysis based on the genetic background of the parents used for breeding. Group I consisted of landraces from both China and the Latin American countries, with some improved lines from landraces, while Group II and Group III consisted of lines primarily developed from popcorn commercial varieties, but with different levels of popping expansion ability. The average linkage disequilibrium decay distance in the entire panel under r² < 0.1 was 0.28 Mb and varied among different groups, indicating a narrow genetic resource. The information provided in this study will be helpful for breeders to incorporate identified genetic variation into hybrid breeding programs.  aPublisher supplied data  aG2015060102cShanghai Agriculture Applied Technology Development Program, China  a31801364cNational Outstanding Youth Science Fund Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China 3aevolution 3agenetic background 3agenetic variation 3agenome 3agenotyping by sequencing 3agermplasm 3ahybrids 3akinship 3alandraces 3alinkage disequilibrium 3apedigree 3apopcorn 3apopulation structure 3aprincipal component analysis 3asnack foods 3aChina 3aLatin America1 aWang, Hui1 aGu, Wei1 aQin, Tao1 aSun, Pingdong1 aLu, Youlin1 aShi, Biao1 aZheng, Hongjian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5606-30920 tGenetic resources and crop evolution.g2021 Aug., v. 68, no. 6 p.2379-2389dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl49569x0925-98647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10722-021-01137-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04423naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245009400167300001600261520182100277536057502098592002802673596006702701596002202768596008802790596002302878596002002901596002302921650002202944650001802966650001302984650001302997650001703010650001303027650001203040650001503052650002403067650001303091650001503104650001503119650002203134650001203156650001803168650001003186650001403196650001603210650002903226650002503255650001003280651001203290700001803302700002103320700003003341700001603371700001903387700001803406700002503424700001903449700001803468700001903486700002303505773010303528856008503631852000903716655001203725IND60595617920221118012239.0180605e20171002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059561792DNAL7 a10.1080/00063657.2017.14085652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLusby, John10aBreeding ecology and habitat selection of Merlin Falco columbarius in forested landscapes  ap. 445-454.  aCapsule: Long-term trends in Merlin Falco columbarius breeding performance remained stable during a period of extensive afforestation in Ireland, where Merlin predominantly select conifer plantations for nesting. Aims: To determine breeding performance and habitat selection of Merlin in a landscape significantly altered by afforestation. Methods: We compiled data on Merlin to determine long-term trends in breeding performance and to examine habitat selection in a country with one of the fastest rates of afforestation in Europe. Results: Merlin predominantly nested in trees (99.5%; n = 183 pairs), with a strong preference for conifer plantations, which accounted for over 12 times more nests than expected by random selection. Moors and heathland were strongly selected as land-uses adjacent to nest sites. Most nests were located within 10 m of the forest edge, and in forests aged between 31 and 40 years. Merlin showed positive selection for moors and heathland, peat bogs and natural grasslands within breeding territories, and breeding success was positively related to the proportion of these land-uses surrounding nests. Breeding was successful for 74% of nests (n = 300), and mean productivity was 2.1 young per breeding attempt (n = 265) between 1982 and 2014. Breeding parameters remained constant over the 33-year study period, despite an increase of more than 75% in forest cover during this time. Conclusion: Merlin breeding performance showed no long-term effects of increased afforestation. Although Merlin predominantly nested in conifer plantations, the presence of nearby open suitable foraging habitats influenced nest site selection and breeding success. The nesting preference of Merlin makes them vulnerable to disturbance from forest operations, which requires mitigation.  aThis study was undertaken as part of the ‘Avian Diversity and Afforestation Planning Tools’ project at University College Cork and BirdWatch Ireland, which was funded by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in Ireland through COFORD (Project Ref 13/C/452).

The results showed a monotonical increase in Ti content worn off the milling media and introduced into the milled powders. This gradual doping led to homogeneous distribution of fine Ti particles into the Mg/MgH₂ powder matrix without agglomeration or compositional fluctuations at the micro-level. During the activation stage of the powders, achieved at 350 °C/35 bar H₂ prior to hydrogenation kinetics measurements, elemental Ti reacted with H₂ to form fine TiH₂ particles. Our proposed in situ mechanically induced catalyzation approach was found to be mutually beneficial for decreasing the apparent activation energy of decomposition. In addition, introducing 5.3 wt% of TiH₂ to the MgH₂ powder obtained after 50 h led to the achievement of superior enhancement of gas uptake/release kinetics at relatively low temperatures. The nanocomposite MgH₂/5.3 TiH₂ powder possessed fast hydrogenation/dehydrogenation kinetics behaviors and revealed long cycle lifetimes. This system was successfully employed as a solid-state hydrogen source to charge the battery of a cell-phone device using an integrated Ti-tank/commercial proton exchange membrane-fuel cell system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3adehydrogenation 3afuel cells 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogenation 3amagnesium 3amilling 3ananocomposites 3apowders 3atemperature 3athermal stability1 aAlkandary, Abdullah1 aAldakheel, Fahad1 aAl-Saidi, Mariam1 aAl-Ajmi, Fahad1 aBanyan, Mohammad0 tRSC advances.g2018 Nov. 14, v. 8, no. 67 p.38175-38185dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra06570e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03575naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002300169245010200192300001600294500002000310500001500330520202000345592002802365650001302393650001702406650001802423650002402441650001002465650001002475650001602485650001302501650002602514650002202540650001102562650001402573650002402587650001002611650001302621650001402634650001202648650000902660650002602669650001302695650001402708650001102722650001302733653002002746700002002766773013002786856010802916852000903024655001203033IND60587520320221118231717.0180319e200306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058752032DNAL7 a10.1890/1051-0761(2003)013[0829:IOAIHA]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoone, Michelle D.10aInteractions of an insecticide, herbicide, and natural stressors in amphibian community mesocosms  ap. 829-841.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a2019-12-06  aAmphibians developing in wetlands embedded within or near agricultural lands may frequently encounter chemical mixtures. The objectives of our study were to determine the effects that post‐application concentrations of an insecticide (carbaryl) and an herbicide (atrazine) have on body mass, development, and survival of two anuran species (southern leopard frog, Rana sphenocephala; American toad, Bufo americanus) and two caudate species (spotted salamander, Ambystoma maculatum; small‐mouthed salamander, A. texanum) reared in outdoor cattle tank mesocosms. In one experiment, we manipulated tadpole density (low or high), carbaryl exposure (0, 3.5, 7.0 mg/L), and atrazine exposure (0 or 200 μg/L) to test for effects on development, mass, and survival of larvae. In a second experiment, we manipulated pond hydroperiod (constant or drying), carbaryl exposure (0 or 5 mg/L), and atrazine exposure (0 or 200 μg/L) to test for effects on mass, time, and survival to metamorphosis. Salamanders were virtually eliminated in carbaryl treatments, indicating that at realistic levels, this insecticide could cause population declines for salamanders in contaminated habitats. Carbaryl also had negative effects on toad survival. Exposure to atrazine had negative effects on body size, development, and time to metamorphosis in anuran species, which were associated with reduced chlorophyll levels. Both chemicals interacted significantly with density or hydroperiod, indicating that the environmental conditions could influence the impact of a contaminant. A significant atrazine‐by‐carbaryl interaction resulted in smaller and less developed spotted salamander larvae than in control ponds. Atrazine exposure, however, appeared to moderate negative effects of carbaryl for spotted salamanders. Our research suggests that important changes in the community's food web result from chemical exposure, which influence the susceptibility of amphibian species to contaminants.

Sex-specific scents and overmarking  ap. 31-42.  aOvermarking occurs when one individual places its scent mark directly on top of the scent mark of another individual. Although it is almost ubiquitous among terrestrial mammals, we know little about the function of overmarking and detailed field observations are rare. We investigated the chemical composition of scents and patterns of overmarking by wild banded mongooses, Mungos mungo. Chemical analyses of anal gland secretions showed that scents were sexually dimorphic. Both male and female adults were more likely to overmark the scents of same-sex individuals. An analysis of responses to two scents on the same site suggested that the sex of the top or most recent scent was more important than that of the bottom or original scent in determining overmarking response. Juveniles also overmarked scents at high rates, but did not respond to scents in a sex-specific way. Same-sex-specific patterns within groups have not been described in any other species, and may reflect a social system with intense intrasexual competition for reproduction within both sexes. Banded mongooses live in large mixed-sex groups, with intense competition between males for females, owing to the heavily male-biased adult sex ratio and highly synchronized oestrous cycles. Oestrous synchronization may also promote intrasexual competition for males within females, as females compete simultaneously for high-quality males. Female competition for males may also be enhanced by the rewards of male-biased parental care. This investigation highlights the need for detailed studies of overmarking in the natural context, to confirm and expand upon laboratory findings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHerpestidae 3aadults 3aanal glands 3achemical analysis 3achemical composition 3aestrus synchronization 3afemales 3ajuveniles 3amales 3amammals 3amarking behavior 3amating competitiveness 3aodors 3aparental behavior 3asecretion 3asex ratio 3awild animals1 aManser, Marta B.1 aMwanguhya, Francis1 aKyabulima, Solomon1 aRüedi, Peter,1 aCant, Michael A.0 tAnimal behaviour.g2011 Jan., v. 81, no. 1 p.31-42dElsevier Ltdx0003-34727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.07.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02182naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012200164300001800286520100400304592002801308650001401336650002101350650001701371650000901388650001201397650002601409650001901435650001301454650001301467650001501480650001201495700002201507700001701529700001701546700002501563773010601588856008101694852000901775655001201784IND60120512620221123003248.0150207e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012051262DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-013-7489-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCosta, C. M.10aEffect of fiber orientation in gelled poly(vinylidene fluoride) electrospun membranes for Li-ion battery applications  ap. 6833-6840.  aBattery separators based on electrospun membranes of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) have been prepared in order to study the effect of fiber alignment on the performance and characteristics of the membrane. The prepared membranes show an average fiber diameter of ~272 nm and a degree of porosity of ~87 %. The gel polymer electrolytes are prepared by soaking the membranes in the electrolyte solution. The alignment of the fibers improves the mechanical properties for the electrospun membranes. Further, the microstructure of the membrane also plays an important role in the ionic conductivity, being higher for the random electrospun membrane due to the lower tortuosity value. Independently of the microstructure, both membranes show good electrochemical stability up to 5.0 V versus Li/Li⁺. These results show that electrospun membranes based on PVDF are appropriate for battery separators in lithium-ion battery applications, the random membranes showing a better overall performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3agels 3alithium 3amechanical properties 3amicrostructure 3apolymers 3aporosity 3aseparators 3asoaking1 aNunes-Pereira, J.1 aSencadas, V.1 aSilva, M.

The initial anaesthesia-sensitive memory (ASM) can be replaced by anaesthesia-resistant memory (ARM), and/or by protein synthesis-dependent, long-term memory (LTM). We previously showed that two closely related parasitic wasp species differ in learning rate and memory consolidation. In Cotesia glomerata, LTM lasting at least 24h was formed after single-trial conditioning, whereas single-trial conditioning led to ARM that waned before 24h in Cotesia rubecula. This species formed LTM only after repeated conditioning trials spaced in time. Here, we used artificial selection on learning rate to investigate whether selection for a low learning rate in C. glomerata would result in C. rubecula-like memory dynamics. Memory consolidation was tested by using cold-shock anaesthesia and protein synthesis inhibitors. After single-trial conditioning, ARM was consolidated within hours in unselected C. rubecula, but directly, without an intermediate ARM phase, into LTM in unselected C. glomerata. We obtained low learning rate selection lines of C. glomerata wasps that, like C. rubecula, did not form LTM after single-trial conditioning, to see whether such wasps would then consolidate ARM instead of LTM. We showed that this was not the case. The selected wasps formed LTM after repeated, spaced conditioning trials, but formed only ASM without consolidation of ARM or LTM after single-trial learning. Ecological consequences of this type of memory formation are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCotesia glomerata 3aCotesia rubecula 3aanesthesia 3aanimal behavior 3aanimals 3aartificial selection 3amemory 3aparasitic wasps 3aprotein synthesis inhibitors1 aDuivenvoorde, Loes1 aWang, Guohong1 aTribuhl, Silja1 aBukovinszky, Tibor1 aVet, Louise E.M.1 aDicke, Marcel1 aSmid, Hans M.0 tAnimal behaviour.g2011 Jan., v. 81, no. 1 p.325-333dElsevier Ltdx0003-34727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02052naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245011000176300001600286520035800302536031300660592002800973596006001001596005001061596005901111596002301170596002401193596005101217596001601268650001701284650001101301650001101312650001901323650002201342651001101364651002001375700002001395700001801415773010301433856008501536852000901621655001201630IND60595618120221118011914.0180605e20171002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059561812DNAL7 a10.1080/00063657.2017.14096962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSander, Martha Maria10aFlight range estimation of migrant Yellow-browed Warblers Phylloscopus inornatus on the East Asian Flyway  ap. 569-572.  aFat loads were quantified for 2125 Yellow-browed Warblers Phylloscopus inornatus trapped at a stop-over site in Far East Russia during autumn migration.

The lability (E-value) of Zn was assessed as the fraction isotopically exchangeable with 70Zn2+; comparative extractions included 0.005M DTPA, 0.43M HNO3 and a Tessier-style sequential extraction procedure (SEP). Because of the extremely low concentration of labile Zn the E-value was determined in soils suspended in 0.0001M Na2-EDTA which provided reliable analytical conditions in which approximately 20% of the labile Zn was dissolved. On average, only 2.4% of soil Zn was isotopically exchangeable. This corresponded closely to Zn solubilised by extraction with 0.005 DTPA and by the carbonate extraction step (F1+F2) of the Tessier-style SEP. Crucially, although the majority of the soil CaCO3 was dissolved in F2 of the SEP, the DTPA dissolved only a very small proportion of the soil CaCO3. This suggests a superficial carbonate-bound form of labile Zn, accessible to extraction with DTPA and to isotopic exchange. Zinc solubility from soil suspended in 0.01M Ca(NO3)2 (PCO2 controlled at 0.03) was measured over three days. Following solution speciation using WHAM(VII) two simple solubility models were parameterised: a pH dependent ‘adsorption’ model based on the labile (isotopically exchangeable) Zn distribution coefficient (Kd) and an apparent solubility product (Ks) for ZnCO3. The distribution coefficient showed no pH-dependence and the solubility model provided the best fit to the free ion activity (Zn2+) data, although the apparent value of log10 Ks (5.1) was 2.8log units lower than that of the mineral smithsonite (ZnCO3).  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acalcareous soils 3acalcium carbonate 3acalcium nitrate 3afractionation 3airrigated soils 3amodels 3anitric acid 3apH 3asmithsonite 3asolubility 3awastewater irrigation 3azinc 3aPakistan 0aZinc 0aWastewater 0aCalcareous soils 0aMetal solubility 0aE-values 0aDTPA extraction 0aPakistan1 aMarzouk, E.R.1 aParvīn, Shahnāz,1 aCrout, N.M.J.1 aYoung, S.D.0 tScience of the total environment.g2015 June 15, v. 518-519 p.310-319dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.03.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01639naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245011300176300001400289520040700303592002800710650001800738650002000756650001400776650001200790650001400802650001700816653001800833653002200851653001100873700001900884700002300903700002700926700001700953700002600970700001900996773013601015856008101151852000901232655001201241IND60747489120221122055502.0210813e20210503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074748912DNAL7 a10.1654/1525-2647-88.1.672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYildirimhan, Hikmet Sami10aEndoparasites of the Golden Grass Skink Heremites auratus (Linnaeus, 1758) (Squamata: Scincidae) from Turkey  ap. 67-69.  aWe examined 35 golden grass skinks Heremites auratus (Linnaeus, 1758) (Squamata: Scincidae), obtained from various locations in Turkey, for helminth parasites.

Chemical analyses included the evaluation of chromium in the fish kidney tissue and sediment. The highest and lowest concentrations of chromium were measured in the kidney of fish and sediment collected from Konarak (47.53±1.23 and 110±1.4μg g–1) and the mouth of Chabahar Bay (3.43±1.31 and 13.5±3.23μg g–1), respectively. There was significant difference (P<0.05) of EPO plasma levels between Konarak, Beris and Ramin stations with the mouth of Chabahar Bay as the cleanest station. Reduction of Bowman's space, occlusion of the tubule lumen, leukocytes infiltration, melanomacrophage centers aggregation, nuclear vacuolation, nuclei hypertrophy of tubule cells, necrosis of the tubules, lifting of the tubular basement membrane and dilatation of glomerular capillaries were the most alterations observed in the kidney. The HAI values of Epaulet grouper from Konarak, Beris and Ramin stations were significantly higher than other stations (P<0.05). It was concluded that selected biomarkers as a first investigation could be useful tools to environmental biomonitoring programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEpinephelus 3abasement membrane 3abiomarkers 3achemical analysis 3achromium 3aerythropoietin 3agrouper 3ahypertrophy 3akidneys 3aleukocytes 3anecrosis 3apollution 3asediments 3aOman 0aHAI 0aEPO 0aBiomarker 0aChromium 0aEpinephelus stoliczkae 0aErythropoietin 0aKidney1 aKazerouni, Faranak1 aSavari, Ahmad1 aMovahedinia, Abdolali1 aSafahieh, Alireza1 aAjdari, Daniel0 tScience of the total environment.g2015 June 15, v. 518-519 p.554-561dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.03.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02768naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245016100163300001800324520140900342592002801751650004401779650002301823650001101846650002101857650004901878650001801927650001601945650001201961650002101973650001401994650002402008650001702032650001102049700003002060700001802090700002002108700002202128773010602150856008102256852000902337655001202346IND60120513120221121004857.0150207e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012051312DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-013-7451-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastell, P.12aA novel approach to the chemical stabilization of gamma-irradiated ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene using arc-discharge multi-walled carbon nanotubes  ap. 6549-6557.  aA complete study was made of the stabilization of gamma-irradiated ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) using arc-discharge multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as inhibitors of the oxidative process. MWCNTs were efficiently incorporated into the polymer matrix by ball milling and thermo-compression processes at concentrations up to 5 wt% and subsequently gamma irradiated at 90 kGy. Raman spectroscopy demonstrated the generation of radicals on the walls of the MWCNTs and that the G/D ratio was altered by their generation. The same spectra showed interactions between the polymer chains as a series of shifts are observed in the UHMWPE bands. The effect of the MWCNTs as inhibitors for the oxidative process of the UHMWPE was evaluated by means of Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) and Fourier Transformed Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). ESR detection of the radiation-induced radicals proved the radical scavenger behaviour of MWCNTs. FTIR measurements were performed to ascertain the influence of the irradiation and of the accelerated ageing protocol in the oxidation index of the polymer and the composites. The results pointed to the positive contribution of the MWCNTs in increasing the oxidative stability of the composite when compared to pure UHMWPE. A comparison is made between composites obtained using MWCNTs produced by the carbon vapour deposition and arc-discharge methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aRaman spectroscopy 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3afree radicals 3airradiation 3amilling 3amolecular weight 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stability 3apolyethylene 3avapors1 aMartínez-Morlanes, M.

By employing alkyl derivatives of pyranine as donors, we could exploit the strong CT interactions between pyranine and viologen to reversibly modify the pore size and philicity. The fast binding of the donors enables quick and facile functionalization within minutes at room temperature. The modularity of the approach enables modification of pores with custom-designed compositions, components, and functions. The high selectivity exhibited by viologen on the pore wall facilitated its use in a CT affinity column.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aengineering 3aporosity 3aporous media 3asilica1 aVēṅkaṭarāvu, Khariḍēhāl,1 aSoumya, T.1 aGeorge, Subi J.1 aEswaramoorthy, M.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2013 July 31, v. 135, no. 30 p.10902-10905dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja40354723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02905naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245012600165300001600291520146800307592002801775650001301803650001301816650001901829650001501848650001901863650002001882650003101902650001301933650001501946650003701961650001401998650001702012653002702029653001202056653000902068653001502077653001902092700001502111700001702126700001302143700001702156700001202173773014602185856008302331852000902414655001202423IND60619057520221118232001.0181127e20181130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061905752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.10.1172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Qunhui10aExpression profile analysis of differentially expressed genes in ruptured intracranial aneurysms: In search of biomarkers  ap. 548-556.  aIntracranial aneurysms (IAs) result from the bulging of arterial walls secondary to several factors such as flow, vessel morphology, and genetics. Subarachnoid hemorrhage occurs when such walls rupture, leading to high disability and mortality. Despite numerous investigations pertaining to the relationship between geometric characteristics and IA rupture, only a few have obtained consistent results. This study aimed to further identify the potential genes associated with the pathogenesis of IAs, which may provide novel molecular biomarkers. We downloaded and reanalyzed six datasets, which were divided into four groups. IA walls and blood samples were screened for differentially expressed genes (DEGs); then, functional and pathway enrichment analyses were conducted. In total, 158 common DEGs were identified from Groups 1–3 and 396 genes (187 upregulated and 209 downregulated genes) were differentially expressed in Group 4. The functional analysis revealed that the DEGs were mainly associated with the major histocompatibility complex class II protein complex and antigen processing and presentation. Finally, we identified nine key genes, both in aneurysm tissue samples and blood samples, of which three were mostly associated with the progression and rupture of IAs. Bioinformatics was used to analyze the datasets of the ruptured IAs and identify potential biomarkers, which may provide information for the early detection and treatment of IAs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaneurysm 3aantigens 3abioinformatics 3abiomarkers 3ablood sampling 3adata collection 3agene expression regulation 3ageometry 3ahemorrhage 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3amortality 3apathogenesis 0aIntracranial aneurysms 0aRupture 0aDEGs 0aBiomarkers 0aBioinformatics1 aChen, Xuan1 aYi, Dazhuang1 aSong, Yu1 aZhao, Yu-Hao1 aLuo, Qi0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 Nov. 30, v. 506, no. 3 p.548-556dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.10.1173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01578naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002000112245012700132300001800259520051200277592002800789650001400817650001900831650002200850650001500872650001700887650000900904650001000913650001300923650001900936653002400955653001300979653001700992700002201009700002301031773015301054852000901207655001201216IND60706470020221120223854.0200807e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070647002DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAngeeswaran, R.10aMass and Energy Balance of the Natural Draft Gasification System for Thermal Application in Arecanut Processing Industries  ap. 3321-3324.  aMethods of mass and energy balance are adopted for evaluating the overall performance of energy conversion systems.

Initiation factor eIF4A is known to unwind the secondary structures of the 5’UTRs encountered by the PIC during its initial binding to the mRNA and while scanning for the initiation codon. In Giardia, homologs for eIF4E (GleIF4E2) and eIF4A (GleIF4A) have been identified but not for eIF4G. To address how PIC is recruited to the 5’ end of mRNA in the absence of eIF4G homolog, we have used yeast two-hybrid assays to identify potential interactions of GleIF4E2 with the components of the PIC. The results show that GleIF4E2 can interact with the β subunit of the initiation factor GleIF2, a component of the PIC. ZDOCK modeling of the GleIF4E2-GleIF2β complex revealed that the dorsal side of GleIF4E2 is likely involved in binding to GleIF2β, which mimics the interaction of mammalian eIF4E with eIF4G, and with eIF4E binding proteins. These results suggest that GleIF4E2 can facilitate the recruitment of the PIC to the 5’end of the mRNA by binding directly to the components of the PIC. The role of GleIF4A in translation initiation in Giardia is not clearly understood as the short 5’ UTRs of the mRNA are unlikely to form secondary structures. Interestingly, Pateamine A, a specific inhibitor of human eIF4A, inhibited the growth of Giardia in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that the activity of GleIF4A is probably required for translation. Using yeast two-hybrid assays, we have identified a novel interaction of GleIF4A with i subunit of the initiation factor GleIF3 (GleIF3i), another component of the PIC. These results indicate that the GleIF4A can also interact directly with the components of the PIC. ZDOCK modeling of the GleIF3i-GleIF4A complex suggests that GleIF3i could serve as a stimulator of GleIF4A activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3a5' untranslated regions 3aDEAD-box RNA helicases 3aGiardia lamblia 3abinding proteins 3adose response 3aeukaryotic cells 3ahumans 3amodels 3aprotein-protein interactions 3ascaffolding proteins 3astart codon 3atranslation (genetics) 3atwo hybrid system techniques 3ayeasts 0aGleIF4E2 0aGleIF4A 0aGleIF2β 0aGleIF3i 0a3AT 0aDMDA-PatA 0aPPI 0aGiardia lamblia 0aYeast two hybrid assay 0aProtein–protein interactions 0aTranslation initiation factors1 aMcMahan, Timothy1 aNeal, John Patrick1 aHamal Dhakal, Siddhartha1 aJois, Seetharama1 aRomo, Daniel1 aHull, Ken1 aGarlapati, Srinivas0 tMolecular and biochemical parasitology.g2020 Mar., v. 236 p.111258-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl32344x0166-68517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molbiopara.2020.1112583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03897naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005600150245013300206520221800339592002802557650001502585650002402600650002502624650001302649650002402662650001702686650001502703650002302718650002602741650002502767650001502792650001902807650001302826650002102839650002502860650001002885653002402895653001902919653002402938653002902962653002302991653002203014700001703036700001403053700002003067700001803087700001303105700001603118700001803134773009703152856008503249852000903334655001203343IND60755207020221120134232.0220214e20211201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075520702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2021.1178142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xiaohui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9084-168410aPerformance and mechanism of sulfamethoxazole removal in different bioelectrochemical technology-integrated constructed wetlands  aSulfamethoxazole (SMX) has a high concentration and detection frequency in aquatic environments due to the poor removal efficiency of traditional biological treatment processes. Bioelectrochemical technology-integrated constructed wetlands (CWs) have great potential for SMX removal; however, the process of SMX removal in different bioelectrochemical technology-integrated CWs (microbial fuel cell (MFC) and direct current (EC)) remains unclear. To address this, we examined the mechanism of SMX removal in MFCCW and ECCW. The results revealed that the SMX removal efficiency can reach 96.0 ± 2.4% in the ECCW and 97.2 ± 2.2% in the MFCCW. The enhancement of MFC for SMX removal in CW was slightly better than that in direct current (p > 0.05). It was found that the adsorption process of SMX in the substrate promoted by EC was more enhanced than that by MFC. Furthermore, bioelectrochemical technology improved plant activity, including root and enzymatic (superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and catalase) activities, and fluorescence parameters (photochemical quenching coefficient, non-photochemical quenching coefficient, and quantum efficiency of PS II). Significant differences were found between CW and ECCW (p < 0.05), while no significant differences were found between CW and MFCCW (p > 0.05). The microbial activity and abundance in CW were improved by bioelectrochemical technology, and the microbial community structure was optimised to be simpler and more stable. However, EC tended to promote microbial and plant activity in CW, whereas MFC tended to optimise the microbial community and improve the tightness and stability of the module. The enhanced difference might also account for the changes in the SMX degradation pathway. 4-aminobenzenesulfonic acid (TP174), 3-amino-5-methylisoxazole (TP99) and 5-methylisoxazole (TP84) were all common products in the three reactors, whereas TP99 underwent further ring-opening in MFCCW and TP174 underwent further hydrolysis in ECCW. This study provided an important reference for the targeted regulation of plants and microorganisms in constructed wetlands via different bioelectrochemistry to enhance characteristic pollutants degradation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abioelectrochemistry 3abiological treatment 3acatalase 3acommunity structure 3afluorescence 3ahydrolysis 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobial communities 3amicrobial fuel cells 3aperoxidase 3aphotochemistry 3aresearch 3asulfamethoxazole 3asuperoxide dismutase 3awater 0aMicrobial fuel cell 0aDirect current 0aConstructed wetland 0aSulfamethoxazole removal 0aEnhanced mechanism 0aRemoval mechanism1 aLu, Shaoyong1 aLiu, Ying1 aWang, Yongqiang1 aGuo, Xiaochun1 aChen, Yi1 aZhang, Jian1 aWu, Fengchang0 tWater research.g2021 Dec. 01, v. 207 p.117814-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2021.1178143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02901naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245009700168300001300265520151100278592002801789650002101817650002201838650001901860650001701879650001001896650002901906650001701935650001401952650001501966650001401981653002501995653001802020653002602038653003602064653002402100653001702124700002102141700001702162700001302179700001502192700001802207773011102225856008602336852000902422655001202431IND60737704720221119123033.0210708e20210710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073770472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2021.05.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Shangui14aThe reversal of chemotherapy-induced multidrug resistance by nanomedicine for cancer therapy  ap. 1-20.  aMultidrug resistance (MDR) of cancer is a persistent problem in chemotherapy. Scientists have considered the overexpressed efflux transporters responsible for MDR and chemotherapy failure. MDR extremely limits the therapeutic effect of chemotherapy in cancer treatment. Many strategies have been applied to solve this problem. Multifunctional nanoparticles may be one of the most promising approaches to reverse MDR of tumor. These nanoparticles can keep stability in the blood circulation and selectively accumulated in the tumor microenvironment (TME) either by passive or active targeting. The stimuli-sensitive or organelle-targeting nanoparticles can release the drug at the targeted-site without exposure to normal tissues. In order to better understand reversal of MDR, three main strategies are concluded in this review. First strategy is the synergistic effect of chemotherapeutic drugs and ABC transporter inhibitors. Through directly inhibiting overexpressed ABC transporters, chemotherapeutic drugs can enter into resistant cells without being efflux. Second strategy is based on nanoparticles circumventing over-expressed efflux transporters and directly targeting resistance-related organelles. Third approach is the combination of multiple therapy modes overcoming cancer resistance. At last, numerous researches demonstrated cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) had a deep relation with drug resistance. Here, we discuss two different drug delivery approaches of nanomedicine based on CSC therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aABC transporters 3ablood circulation 3acancer therapy 3adrug therapy 3adrugs 3amultiple drug resistance 3ananomedicine 3aneoplasms 3aorganelles 3asynergism 0aMultidrug resistance 0aNanoparticles 0aP-glycoprotein (P-gp) 0aSubcellular organelle targeting 0aCombination therapy 0aCSCs therapy1 aKhan, Abdur Rauf1 aYang, Xiaoye1 aDong, Bo1 aJi, Jianbo1 aZhai, Guangxi0 tJournal of controlled release.g2021 July 10, v. 335 p.1-20dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12462x0168-36597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2021.05.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02425naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245013100174300001600305520113600321592002801457650001701485650001301502650002101515650001201536650001401548650004301562650001501605650001601620650001301636650000701649650001601656700003201672700003501704700002301739700003101762700002901793773010301822856008101925852000902006655001202015IND60481464220221116225107.0160205e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048146422DNAL7 a10.1007/s10337-015-3011-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPereira, Andrea Garcia10aMethod Development and Validation for Determination of Cocaine, its Main Metabolites and Pyrolytic Products by HPLC–UV–CAD  ap. 179-187.  aA method was developed using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC), a versatile mode of liquid chromatography, to determine cocaine, its main degradation products, benzoylecgonine and ecgonine, main pyrolytic products, anhydroecgonine and anhydroecgonine methyl ester, to be used as standards, and a frequent contaminant, levamisole. Detection of all compounds was achieved using two detectors connected in series: charged aerosol detector (CAD) and ultraviolet detector (UV). No method was found in the literature using HILIC coupled to CAD and UV to determine these compounds. The method was carried out with a Phenomenex Kinetex HILIC (150 mm × 4.6 mm ID; 2,6 µm) column with mobile-phase acetonitrile: 10 mM ammonium acetate pH 6.3 (75:25 v/v) with flow rate 0.8 mL min⁻¹ and oven temperature set at 30 °C. CAD detection was performed using a nitrogen pressure of 35 psi, range of 100 pA and the UV detection at 200 nm. Validation parameters such as selectivity, linearity, precision and accuracy were evaluated. Methods were successfully validated to detect and quantify all related substances.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3aaerosols 3aammonium acetate 3acocaine 3adetectors 3ahydrophilic interaction chromatography 3alevamisole 3ametabolites 3anitrogen 3apH 3atemperature1 aD’Avila, Felipe Bianchini1 aFerreira, Pamela C.

The capacity of such crops to meet the requirements of young livestock and reproducing animals for sodium (Na), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca) and potassium (K) is reviewed. The growth responses of young stock to Na and/or Mg supplements when grazing wheat are discussed. These responses differ from ‘literature expectation’ in that they are rapid in onset and involve no clinical signs. We demonstrate that more insight about the variability in supplement response, both between and between crops species, is obtained when mineral contents are viewed from the perspective of their frequency distributions, rather than their mean values. The pivotal importance of high K concentration, low Na and the resultant K:Na ratio of forage is stressed, as is the interaction of these minerals in relation to Mg absorption. We also present frequency distributions for a range of mineral indices that ‘capture’ mineral interactions, including the ‘tetany index’, forage K: (Na+Mg) ratio and dietary cation–anion difference. It is concluded that the last two indices warrant a much closer investigation. Possible effects of forage aluminium and organic acid contents are briefly discussed; these also deserve closer examination. As research in this area continues, it would be prudent to provide Na and/or Mg supplements for livestock grazing wheat and possibly oats and barley, and calcium supplements for livestock grazing oats or for reproducing animals grazing all three cereals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aaluminum 3abarley 3acalcium 3acanola 3acrops 3adietary cation anion difference 3aforage 3agrazing 3alivestock 3amagnesium 3amineral content 3aminerals 3aoats 3apotassium 3asodium 3awheat 3awinter 3aAustralia 0abarley 0adual-purpose crop 0ahypomagnesaemia 0aoats1 aMasters, D.

It is important tounderstand how the consumer reacts to the sudden price changes in the market as it would help governments to decide whether to subsidize the food commodities or not. In this study, Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) model has been employed to estimate the system of demand functions for cereals, pulses, oils, salt and spices, meat, milk, and sugar. The statistical significance of the coefficients suggested that the demand for various food commodities was responsive to prices. The expenditure elasticities were positive and significant for all the commodities. All the food commodities were found to be normal goods. In addition all the goods were also found to be income elastic. This implied that the expenditure share on these commodities would increase with an increase in real income and vice-versa. The own price elasticities of the commodities revealed that the subsidized commodities (cereals, pulses, oil and sugar) were found to comprise the predominant source of food basket of the rural households and their signs were also expectedly positive. At the same time since the other remaining commodities including being not subsidized, their signs were found to be negative. Further, as all the commodities (except sugar) were price elastic any change in their prices would have strong negative or positive effect on expenditure basket of the households. Thereby the possibility of food inflation could severely hamper their consumption status and make the households vulnerable to food security.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlmost Ideal Demand System 3ademand elasticities 3ademand functions 3afood intake 3afood security 3agrains 3ahouseholds 3aincome 3ainflation 3alegumes 3amarkets 3ameat 3amilk 3aoils 3apoverty 3aprices 3aspices 3asugars 0aConsumption Behaviour 0aPrice Elasticity 0aIncome Elasticity 0aTamil Nadu1 aChinnadurai, M.1 aSwaminathan, B.0 tTrends in Biosciences.g2014 Oct., v. 7, no. 20 p.3325-3330dSociety for Advancement of Science and Rural DevelopmentwJournal:2106x0976-24857nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02029naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245008800175300001600263520082300279592002801102650001201130650001101142650001701153650001501170650001401185650001101199650001901210650002101229653002701250653002201277653003001299653002101329653001401350700006301364773011901427856008801546852000901634655001201643IND60597994720221120174612.0201111e20181015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059799472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.05.1922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorton, Phoebe A.10aVegetation matters: Correcting chamber carbon flux measurements using plant volumes  ap. 769-772.  aChamber carbon flux measurements are routinely used to assess ecosystem carbon sink/source dynamics. Often these point measurements enclose considerable vegetation biomass, with fluxes upscaled in space and time for each vegetation type. Here we assess the importance of including the volume of peatland dwarf shrub vegetation in chamber flux calculations and outline a simple but effective method of assessing plant volumes. We show that inclusion of plant volumes significantly affects fluxes and that this effect becomes greater as the proportion of chamber volume occupied by plants increases. Moreover, we demonstrate that, with an initial destructive laboratory assessment for each plant species and a little practice at volume estimation, plant volumes can be accurately assessed non-destructively in the field.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acarbon sinks 3aecosystems 3apeatlands 3ashrubs 3aspace and time 3avegetation types 0aNet ecosystem exchange 0aVegetation volume 0aChamber flux measurements 0aCalluna vulgaris 0aPeatlands1 aHeinemeyer, Andreas1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3151-24660 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Oct. 15, v. 639 p.769-772dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.05.1923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05287naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005600149245009100205520358400296592002803880596006503908650003203973650002004005650000804025650002804033650003904061650002504100650002904125650000904154650001004163650001604173650002604189650001104215650002004226650003004246650001004276650001404286650001504300650002204315650001104337650001904348650001204367651001004379651001204389653001704401653002604418653001104444700001304455700001604468700001404484773013004498856008404628852000904712655001204721IND60768997120221118001835.0220228e20220228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076899712DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-05-21-0944-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKiemo, F.

It forms synergies with other viruses in sweet potato, leading to yield loss of 30 to 100% (Qin et al. 2014). In summer 2020, 62 symptomatic and 38 symptomless sweet potato vines were randomly collected in farmers’ fields in the south (Ásotthalom, Szeged) and central (Galgahévíz) parts of Hungary and transplanted in an insect-proof greenhouse. Six of the plants expressed SPCSV-like symptoms, including stunting, vein clearing, and leaf purpling. To check for common viruses of sweet potato, total RNA and DNA were extracted from leaves of each of the 100 plants using Trizolate reagent (UD-GenoMed, Debrecen, Hungary) and a ZenoGene kit (Zenon Bio, Szeged, Hungary), respectively. Primer pair Ch2N was designed using Primer3 (v. 0.4.0) to amplify a 194-bp fragment of SPCSV RNA1. Presence of the RNA viruses was checked by qPCR using a qPCRBIO SyGreen 1-step qPCR kit (PCR Biosystems, London, U.K.), and DNA viruses were checked by PCR using DreamTaq DNA Polymerase (Thermo Scientific, Vilnius, Lithuania), followed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. Four samples (labeled A5.1, A6.1, A6V9-1, and A6V9-2) out of the 100 tested positive for SPCSV. Two of them (A6V9-1 and A6V9-2) were coinfected with SPCSV, a badnavirus sweet potato pakakuy virus (SPPV), and a potyvirus sweet potato virus 2 (SPV2), whereas the other two (A5.1 and A6.1) lacked SPV2. Plants infected with SPCSV, SPV2, and SPPV displayed more severe symptoms. To confirm the results, cDNA synthesized from the four SPCSV-positive samples using a RevertAid first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo Scientific, Vilnius, Lithuania) underwent PCR (94°C for 4 min, 94°C for 1 min, 53°C for 30 s, 72°C for 70 s, and 72°C for 10 min for a total of 30 cycles) using primers CL43U and CL43L for the viral heat shock protein 70 gene (Maliogka et al. 2020). An expected band size of 486 bp was obtained in all cases. The amplicon from sample A6.1 was sequenced and found to be identical to SPCSV Guatemalan isolate GT:B3:08 (accession JF699628). RNA1 and RNA2 complete sequences from sample A6.1 were obtained via PCR amplifications of cDNA using primers designed (from accession KC888966 for RNA1 and accession KC888963 for RNA2) to amplify overlapping fragments of a West African strain of SPCSV. QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was used to purify the PCR fragments, which were then cloned into pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and sequenced using Sanger sequencing technique (Biomi, Gödöllő, Hungary). BLASTn search revealed that RNA1 of our isolate Hun_01 (accession MW892835) had 99.63% sequence identity to SPCSV isolate su-17-10 (accession MK802073), whereas RNA2 of Hun_01 (accession MW892836) was 99.68% similar to SPCSV isolate min-17-1 (accession MK802078) and isolate 24-1 (accession MK802080). Phylogenetic analysis using MegAlign (v. 7.1.0, 44.1) showed a close relationship between our isolate and those isolated in China, suggesting that they may have a common origin. Severe stunting and leaf yellowing symptoms developed in Ipomoea setosa indicator plants grafted with SPCSV-infected sweet potato scions. qPCR test for the virus confirmed its presence in the I. setosa leaves. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the occurrence of SPCSV in Hungary and the third in Europe (EPPO 2021; Valverde et al. 2004).  aPublisher supplied data  aScholarship for Christian Young PeoplecHungary Helps Agency 3aDNA-directed DNA polymerase 3aIpomoea batatas 3aRNA 3aSweet potato badnavirus 3aSweet potato chlorotic stunt virus 3aSweet potato virus 2 3aagar gel electrophoresis 3agels 3agenes 3agreenhouses 3aheat-shock protein 70 3aleaves 3amixed infection 3aoligodeoxyribonucleotides 3apests 3aphylogeny 3aquarantine 3asequence analysis 3asummer 3asweet potatoes 3aviruses 3aChina 3aHungary 0asweet potato 0achlorotic stunt virus 0aEurope1 aToth, Z.1 aSalamon, P.1 aSzabo, Z.0 tPlant disease.g2022 Feb. 28, v. 106, no. 2 p.773-dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-05-21-0944-PDN3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02313naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245016900159300002000328520112800348592002801476650001401504650002301518650001801541650001201559650001801571650001901589650001201608650003301620700002201653700001901675700002001694700001901714773013401733856007501867852000901942655001201951IND60538902720221118011622.0160815e20130731xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053890272DNAL7 a10.1021/ja40360162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGotō, Atsushi,10aReversible Generation of a Carbon-Centered Radical from Alkyl Iodide Using Organic Salts and Their Application as Organic Catalysts in Living Radical Polymerization  ap. 11131-11139.  aA new method of producing carbon-centered radicals was discovered through the reaction of an alkyl iodide (R-I) with organic salts to reversibly generate the corresponding alkyl radical (R•). Via this new reaction, the organic salts were used as new and highly efficient organic catalysts in living radical polymerization. The catalysts included common and inexpensive compounds such as tetrabutylammonium iodide and methyltributylphosphonium iodide. Notably, the catalysts were highly reactive. They enabled the synthesis of high-molecular-weight polymers (up to Mₙ = 140 000) and the control of acrylate polymerization, which had been difficult with other organic catalysts. The organic salt catalysts were highly versatile, reacting with methacrylate, acrylate, styrene, acrylonitrile, and functional methacrylate monomers. Well-defined block copolymers were also prepared by using this method. A kinetic study quantitatively confirmed the high reactivity of these catalysts. Attractive features of this system include its low cost, its ease of operation, and its ability to access a wide range of polymer designs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acomposite polymers 3afree radicals 3aiodides 3aorganic salts 3apolymerization 3astyrene 3atetrabutylammonium compounds1 aOhtsuki, Akimichi1 aOhfuji, Haruki1 aTanishima, Miho1 aKaji, Hironori0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2013 July 31, v. 135, no. 30 p.11131-11139dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja40360163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02638naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001900154245013000173520130200303592002801605650003501633650003001668650001101698650001201709650003301721650001201754650003001766650001801796650002201814653002601836653001001862653000801872653002201880653001701902653000901919700002201928700002001950700002501970773012301995856008902118852000902207655001202216IND60682282720221119005307.0211003e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068228272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molbiopara.2020.1112602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArbabi, Mohsen10aMolecular detection of Trichostrongylus species through PCR followed by high resolution melt analysis of ITS-2 rDNA sequences  aPolymerase chain reaction followed by high resolution melting (PCR-HRM) analysis is a simple, rapid and accurate method for molecular detection of various nematode species. The objective of the present study was, for the first time, to develop a PCR-HRM assay for the detection of various animal Trichostrongylus spp. A pair of primers targeting the ITS-2 rDNA region of the Trichostrongylus spp. was designed for the development of the HRM assay. DNA samples were extracted from 30 adult worms of Trichostrongylus spp., the ITS-2-rDNA region was amplified using PCR, and the resultant products were sequenced and characterized. Afterwards, the PCR-HRM analysis was conducted to detect and discriminate Trichostrongylus spp. Molecular sequence analysis revealed that 24, 4, and 1 of the samples were T. colubriformis, T. vitrinus and T. capricola, respectively. Results from PCR-HRM indicated that complete agreement was relatively found between speciation by HRM analysis and DNA sequencing for the detection of Trichostrongylus species. The PCR-HRM analysis method developed in the present study is fast and low-cost; the method can be comparable with other molecular detection techniques, representing a reliable tool for the identification of various species within the Trichostrongylus genus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrichostrongylus colubriformis 3aTrichostrongylus vitrinus 3aadults 3aanimals 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amelting 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal DNA 3asequence analysis 0aTrichostrongylus spp. 0aSheep 0aPCR 0aITS-2-rDNA region 0aHRM analysis 0aIran1 aHooshyar, Hossein1 aLotfinia, Majid1 aBakhshi, Mohamad Ali0 tMolecular and biochemical parasitology.g2020 Mar., v. 236 p.111260-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl32344x0166-68517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molbiopara.2020.1112603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02750naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245013900174300001600313520135700329592002801686596001601714650002101730650004401751650002601795650002301821650002201844650002801866650001801894650001901912650000901931653001101940653002701951653002001978653001801998653001402016700001602030700002402046700001802070773013302088856008602221852000902307655001202316IND60779663020221122222830.0220614e20220304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077966302DNAL7 a10.1080/0972060X.2022.20689702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIranmanesh, Safora10aPreparation and Characterization of Zein Electrospun Fibers for Nano Encapsulation of Ajowan (Trachyspermum copticum L.)

The resulting electrospun zein fibers containing Ajowan essential oil were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), fourier transform infrared (FTIR). Antimicrobial properties of fibers against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were also determined by the disc diffusion method. GC/MS analysis was employed to identify the constituents of the Ajowan essential oil. The diameters of electrospun zein fibers increased with increasing concentration of Ajowan essential oil. Physical status of Ajowan essential oil in electrospun zein fibers was determined by XRD. Thermal properties of loaded electrospun fibers were studied by DSC. FTIR approved the encapsulation of essential oil in electrospun zein fibers. The encapsulation efficiency of Ajowan essential oil in electrospun zein fibers was about 100%. Antimicrobial results showed that the Ajowan essential oil loaded electrospun fibers were effective against S. aureus and E. coli. This could be due to the major constituents of Ajowan essential oil. Ajowan essential oil was successfully encapsulated in electrospun fibers for the first time.  aPublisher supplied data  aUOZ-GR-8414 3aEscherichia coli 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aTrachyspermum ammi 3aX-ray diffraction 3aatomic force microscopy 3aencapsulation 3aessential oils 3azein 0aAjowan 0aAntimicrobial activity 0aElectrospinning 0aEssential oil 0aNanofiber1 aAran, Mehdi1 aMiri, Mohammad Amin1 aPirnia, Mahdi0 tJournal of essential oil-bearing plants.g2022 Mar. 04, v. 25, no. 2 p.219-233dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12282x0976-50267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0972060X.2022.20689703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03075naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006200139245013100201500002000332520171800352592002802070650001502098650002602113650002002139650002702159650001502186650001102201650001002212650002102222650001402243650001602257650002202273650002102295650001102316650001202327700006102339700006102400773012202461856007302583852000902656655001202665IND60748361220221118020727.0210827e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074836122DNAL7 a10.1111/rec.134822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarrell, Hannah L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8740-843614aThe effects of site preparation equal those of seeding at a dryland restoration site: 6 years of plant community development  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDryland ecosystems generally require active restoration to recover from severe land degradation caused by resource and energy extraction operations. While seeding remains one of the most used forms of active restoration, land managers in dryland systems have generally had difficulty re‐establishing desirable plant communities, due in part to alterations in supporting ecosystem processes and the episodic nature of resource availability. In this study, we examined the impacts of site preparation, seeding, and livestock grazing on developing plant communities after the construction of a buried natural gas pipeline corridor in the southwestern United States. We monitored plant species cover and composition beginning with the second season of growth through the sixth. Analysis of each individual year show that conclusions from the initial year of data collection did not well represent the findings in the following years. The site preparation and topsoil treatment had an ongoing positive effect on richness and cover compared to the nearby baseline conditions, while seeding only further increased cover and richness in the first year of monitoring (second season of growth). However, without seeding, the plant communities were driven by ruderal, annual species, whereas the seeded plant communities were driven by desirable seeded perennial grasses and forbs. Grazing and trampling effects were not significant overall, and the effects of livestock may have been confounded with effects of small mammals due to the exclosure configuration. We suggest that the site preparation, topsoil treatment, and configuration linearity of the disturbance corridor allowed for high levels of natural recruitment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarid lands 3acommunity development 3adata collection 3aecological restoration 3aecosystems 3aenergy 3aforbs 3aland degradation 3alivestock 3anatural gas 3aplant communities 3asite preparation 3asowing 3atopsoil1 aFehmi, Jeffrey S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0618-97401 aGornish, Elise S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2055-48740 tRestoration ecology.g2021 Aug., v. 29, no. 6 p.e13482-dWiley Periodicals, Inc.wJournal:jnl3867104x1061-29717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rec.134823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01853naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001700112245013100129300001800260520060200278592002800880650002000908650002300928650002200951650001300973650002300986650002001009650001001029650001101039650001101050650002101061650001901082650001701101650001301118650001301131653001301144653002301157653001801180700002101198700002101219700001701240773015301257852000901410655001201419IND60706470720221123003325.0200807e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070647072DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPawar, D.

Essential oil isolation was isolated using hydrodistillation and the chemical composition was based on GC/MS analysis. The antibacterial and antifungal activities of essential oils were assessed against 8 pathogenic bacteria and 4 yeast, and 3 different tests were used. GC/MS results showed that essential oil chemical composition is highly affected by plant species (P<0.001). GC/MS identification revealed that β-phellandrene (21.8%), β-caryophyllene (37.2%), α-pinene (24.7%) and camphor (22.4%) were identified as the major compounds of J. phoenicea, P. halepensis, J. oxycedrus and T. articulata essential oils, respectively. Interestingly, two volatile compounds: β-pinene and p-cymen-8-ol were present in all isolated essential oils with similar concentrations: 0.8 and 0.5% of the total identified componenents. Antibacterial results suggested that essential oils were efficient in arresting the growth of most tested bacteria with different extent depending on the studied plant and bacterial strains. Interestingly, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most resistant bacterium and Shigella sonnei was the most sensible to tested essential oils. Indeed, the lowest and the highest inhibition diameters were recorded for latter bacterial strains, respectively. Concerning the antifungal activity, results showed interesting efficiency against tested Candida strains. The most susceptible yeast was Candida glabrata, and the most resistant strain was Candida krusei, as the inhibition zone diameter generated by tested essential oils were the lowest and were limited to 13 mm (J. oxycedrus).  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida glabrata 3aCandida krusei 3aJuniperus oxycedrus 3aJuniperus phoenicea 3aPinus halepensis 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aShigella sonnei 3aTetraclinis articulata 3aantifungal properties 3abacteria 3acamphor 3achemical composition 3aessential oils 3ahydrodistillation 3amedicinal plants 3ayeasts 3aTunisia 0aTunisian medicinal plants 0aEssential oil 0aGC/MS analysis 0aAntimicrobial activity1 aSnoussi, Mejdi1 aFalleh, Hanen1 aHessini, Kamel1 aMsaada, Kamel1 aFlamini, Guido1 aKsouri, Riadh0 tJournal of essential oil-bearing plants.g2022 Mar. 04, v. 25, no. 2 p.338-355dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12282x0976-50267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0972060X.2022.20689713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02264naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002300180245007500203300002000278506007600298520103700374592002801411506003701439650002701476650001101503650002201514650001401536650001401550650001701564700001901581700002101600700002001621700001901641773013401660856007501794852000901869655001201878IND60538903020221207115255.0160815e20130731xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053890302DNAL7 a10.1021/ja403734n2doi7 aPMC38393002pmcid7 a238596022pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWarren, Jeffrey

We investigated the structures and reactivities of three different systems: RuH107NO₂YOH109, RuH124NO₂YOH122, and RuH126NO₂YOH122. RuH107NO₂YOH109, unlabeled H124NO₂YOH122, and unlabeled H126NO₂YOH122 were structurally characterized. The pKₐ’s of NO₂YOH at positions 122 and 109 are 7.2 and 6.0, respectively. Reduction potentials of 3-nitrotyrosinate (NO₂YO–)-modified azurins were estimated from cyclic and differential pulse voltammetry data: oxidation of NO₂YO–122 occurs near 1.1 versus NHE; oxidation of NO₂YO–109 is near 1.2 V.

In Experiment 1, 128 pigs were used (initial bodyweight (BW) of 9.41 ± 1.54 kg). Pigs were randomly allotted to four diets in a randomised complete block design. There were four pigs per pen and eight replicate pens per treatment. The corn used was ground to different particle sizes (i.e. 865, 677, 485 or 339 µm). In Experiment 2, three diets were formulated, including a low-fibre diet, a medium-fibre diet-, and a high-fibre diet. Each diet was divided into four batches after mixing and either fed in a meal form without further processing or pelleted, extruded, or extruded and pelleted. In total, 24 growing pigs (initial BW: 26.5 ± 1.5 kg) with a T-cannula installed in the distal ileum were allotted to the diets in a split-plot design, with eight pigs allotted to each level of fibre. Ileal digesta and faecal samples were collected and the apparent ileal digestibility of energy, crude protein and dry matter were calculated as was the metabolisable energy in each diet. Results of Experiment 1 indicated that final BW and average daily gain were not affected by corn particle size. However, average daily feed intake decreased (linear, P < 0.05) as mean particle size decreased from 865 to 677, 485 and 339 µm. Likewise, gain to feed ratio increased (linear, P < 0.05) from 0.65 to 0.66, 0.70 and 0.69 for pigs fed diets containing corn ground to a mean particle size of 865, 677, 485 and 339 µm, respectively. In Experiment 2, results indicated that pelleting, extrusion, or pelleting and extrusion improved (P < 0.05) the apparent ileal digestibility of energy and dry matter, but in most cases, there were no differences among the pelleted, the extruded, and the extruded and pelleted diets. Medium- and high-fibre diets that were extruded had greater metabolisable energy (P < 0.05) than the meal diets. In conclusion, results indicated that gain to feed of pigs fed diets containing corn with the smaller particle size was increased compared with diets containing corn with a greater particle size. In addition, energy utilisation may be improved by pelleting or extrusion or by a combination of the two technologies, but the response seems to be greater for extrusion in diets that are relatively high in fibre.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaverage daily gain 3abody weight 3acorn 3acrude protein 3adigesta 3adigestibility 3adigestible energy 3aenergy 3aextrusion 3afeces 3afeed intake 3ahigh fiber diet 3aileum 3aingredients 3alow fiber diet 3ametabolizable energy 3amixing 3aparticle size 3apelleting 3aswine 3aswine feeding 3aweanlings 0aenergy 0afeed processing 0aparticle size 0apig 0astarch1 aStein, H.

The primary mechanism of bio-mineralization used in this study was the urea hydrolysis process through bacterial enzymatic catalysis. Bacillus sp, which was isolated from river sediment, was used as a ureolytic bacteria. Various environmental conditions were set as different initial concentrations of Sr (10, 50, 100, 200, and 500 mg/L), and various ratios of Mg/Ca (4, 2, 1, 0.5, and 0.25). The concentrations of Sr²⁺, Ca²⁺, and Mg²⁺ in the solution of the batch experiment were measured to identify the bio-mineralization performance and the removal rate of Sr. In addition, the main Sr removal mechanism of ureolytic bacteria was identified. As a result, for Sr removal of bacteria, the bio-mineralization mechanism was more predominant than the adsorption of Sr. The rapid growth and high nucleation site production were observed when the initial concentration of Sr²⁺ increased and the Mg/Ca ratio was lowered, resulting in high biomineralization performance and Sr removal rate. The main phases of carbonate minerals formed in the presence of Sr, Ca, and Mg were SrCO₃ and SrCa(CO₃)₂. Mg²⁺ could retard the bacterial growth and participate in the formation of carbonate minerals, when a large amount of Mg²⁺ was present. Furthermore, the desorption rate of Sr²⁺ from bacterial pastes containing the carbonate minerals increased as the concentration of HCl increased, although the carbonate minerals were in a stable state.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus (bacteria) 3aadsorption 3abacterial growth 3abiomineralization 3acalcium 3acatalytic activity 3adesorption 3ahydrolysis 3ametabolism 3arivers 3asediments 3astrontium 3aurea 0aBio-mineralization 0aRadionuclides 0aAdsorptive removal 0aUrea hydrolysis 0aStrontium1 aSon, H.M.1 aLee, H.K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7259-42290 tChemosphere.g2022 Feb., v. 288 p.132586-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1325863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02930naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245014700184300001800331520091500349592002801264650001601292650002201308650001101330650002301341650001101364650001801375650001701393650001801410650001001428650001101438650001301449650003701462650002101499650001701520650001201537650002701549650002101576650003701597650001101634650003201645650003601677650004501713650002701758650005701785650006501842651001101907651001101918700001501929700002101944700002201965700001701987700001602004700001702020700002002037773011002057856008102167990002302248852000902271655001202280IND60090667420221121040402.0141102e20111115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009066742DNAL7 a216766192pmid7 a10.1016/j.bmc.2011.05.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCohen, Elazar10aNovel terpenoids of the fungus Aspergillus insuetus isolated from the Mediterranean sponge Psammocinia sp. collected along the coast of Israel  ap. 6587-6593.  aThree novel meroterpenoids, insuetolides A–C (1–3) and four drimane sesquiterpenes, the new (E)-6-(4′-hydroxy-2′-butenoyl)-strobilactone A (4) and the known 2α, 9α, 11-trihydroxy-6-oxodrim-7-ene (5), strobilactone A (6) and (E,E)-6-(6′,7′-dihydroxy-2′,4′-octadienoyl)-strobilactone A (7), were isolated from the EtOAc extract of the culture medium of the marine-derived fungus Aspergillus insuetus (OY-207), which was isolated from the Mediterranean sponge Psammocinia sp.

The process uses ozone and UV-C light to produce in situ radicals to oxidize pollution, generating particles that are removed by a filter; ozone is removed using a MnO₂ honeycomb catalyst. This combination of in situ processes removes a wide range of pollutants with a comparatively low specific energy input. Two proof-of-concept devices were built to test and optimize the process. The laboratory prototype was built of standard ventilation duct and could treat up to 850 m³/h. A portable continuous-flow prototype built in an aluminum flight case was able to treat 46 m³/h. Removal efficiencies of >95% were observed for propane, cyclohexane, benzene, isoprene, aerosol particle mass, and ozone for concentrations in the range of 0.4–6 ppm and exposure times up to 0.5 min. The laboratory prototype generated a OH• concentration derived from propane reaction of (2.5 ± 0.3) × 10¹⁰ cm–³ at a specific energy input of 3 kJ/m³, and the portable device generated (4.6 ± 0.4) × 10⁹ cm–³ at 10 kJ/m³. Based on these results, in situ gas-phase advanced oxidation is a viable control strategy for most volatile organic compounds, specifically those with a OH• reaction rate higher than ca. 5 × 10–¹³ cm³/s. Gas-phase advanced oxidation is able to remove compounds that react with OH and to control ozone and total particulate mass. Secondary pollution including formaldehyde and ultrafine particles might be generated, depending on the composition of the primary pollution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aaluminum 3abenzene 3acatalysts 3acombs (social insects) 3acyclohexanes 3aexposure duration 3aformaldehyde 3afree radicals 3agases 3aisoprene 3amanganese dioxide 3amethodology 3aozone 3aphotooxidation 3apollutants 3apollution control 3apropane 3aspecific energy 3aultraviolet radiation 3avolatile organic compounds1 aNilsson, Elna J.

We hypothesize that: (1) the release of phenolic compounds and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) depends on macrophyte species and its health status (broken macrophytes: BM, or healthy macrophytes: HM); (2) the repellency effect depends on zooplankton species, macrophyte species and its health status; and (3) higher concentrations of phenolic compounds and CDOM produce a stronger repellency effect. Phenolic compounds and CDOM were analyzed in exudates of BM and HM of Salvinia sp., Eichhornia crassipes, Pistia stratiotes, Azolla sp. and Ludwigia peploides. Through a flow-through experiment, the repellency produced by these exudates was assessed in two copepods (Notodiaptomus conifer and Argyrodiaptomus falcifer) and one cladoceran (Ceriodaphnia dubia). Our hypotheses were partially validated. The quantity of exudated phenolic compounds and CDOM depended on macrophyte species and, to a lesser extent, on the plant health status. The repellency effect was affected by macrophyte and zooplankton species but not by the health status of plants. Only C. dubia and A. falcifer increased their evasion behavior when phenolic compound and CDOM concentrations increased. In brief, the structuring effect of repellent substances depends on different factors. Under a certain threshold concentration, zooplankton behavior might depend on the information associated with the plant odor (e.g., predation risk, structural complexity) more than on the quantity of the released chemical compounds. Above this threshold, evasion would be the only possible option to avoid damaging effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAzolla 3aCeriodaphnia dubia 3aCopepoda 3aEichhornia crassipes 3aLudwigia peploides 3aPistia stratiotes 3aSalvinia 3aconifers 3adissolved organic matter 3ahabitat preferences 3ahealth status 3amacrophytes 3aodors 3aphenolic compounds 3aplant health 3apredation 3arisk 3azooplankton1 aMayora, Gisela0 tAquatic ecology.g2016 Mar., v. 50, no. 1 p.137-151dSpringer Netherlandsx1386-25887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-015-9561-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03252naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245014000154300001800294500002000312520158200332592002801914596004901942650001401991650001402005650001702019650001702036650001502053650001002068650001502078650002302093650002302116650001902139650001702158650002702175650001702202650000902219650002802228700001602256700001502272700001302287700001802300700001702318700001802335700002102353700001202374700001802386700002602404700005802430773012802488856007302616852000902689655001202698IND60663039820221120154830.0190909e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066303982DNAL7 a10.1002/tox.228082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Jinxia10ap53‐Dependent pathway and the opening of mPTP mediate the apoptosis of co‐cultured Sertoli‐germ cells induced by microcystin‐LR  ap. 1074-1084.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMicrocystin‐LR (MC‐LR), a potent endotoxin, can induce reproductive toxicity. In order to investigate the role and mechanisms of apoptosis (p53‐dependent and mitochondrial pathways) of germ cells induced by MC‐LR, the co‐cultured primary Sertoli‐germ cells from Sprague‐Dawley rats were used for the experiments. Expression levels of proteins, genes, and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were obtained after exposing co‐cultured Sertoli‐germ cells to MC‐LR with or without the addition of the p53 inhibitor, pifithrin‐α (PFT‐α), and MMP inhibitor, cyclosporin A (CsA). Results indicated that MC‐LR could activate p53‐dependent pathway‐associated proteins in Sertoli‐germ cells, leading to a decrease in MMP (indicating the opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pore [mPTP] and the release of Cytochrome‐c [Cyt‐c]) from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm and eventually the induction of apoptosis. PFT‐α inhibited the expression ofp53, ameliorated the MMP of the co‐cultured Sertoli‐germ cells, and prevented the release of Cyt‐c from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm, which reduces the occurrence of apoptosis. Similarly, the decreased release of Cyt‐c from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm and the declined level of apoptosis in Sertoli‐germ cells induced by MC‐LR were observed after the addition of CsA. These results indicated that the apoptosis of the co‐cultured Sertoli‐germ cells induced by MC‐LR was mediated by the p53‐dependent pathway, with the involvement of the opening of mPTP.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aapoptosis 3acoculture 3acyclosporine 3acytochrome c 3aendotoxins 3agenes 3agerm cells 3alaboratory animals 3amembrane potential 3amicrocystin-LR 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial membrane 3apermeability 3arats 3areproductive toxicology1 aLiu, Haohao1 aHuang, Hui1 aYuan, Le1 aLiu, Chuanrui1 aWang, Yueqin1 aCheng, Xuemin1 aZhuang, Donggang1 aXu, Min1 aChen, Xinghai1 aLosiewicz, Michael D.1 aZhang, Huizhen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0255-18560 tEnvironmental toxicology.g2019 Oct., v. 34, no. 10 p.1074-1084dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl57773x1520-40817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tox.228083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02922naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100007000139245016000209500002000369520164900389592002802038596003902066650002302105650001202128650001902140650002702159650001302186650001102199650001502210650001102225650001602236651000902252700002002261700006302281773012202344856007302466852000902539655001202548IND60748361520221118020759.0210827e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074836152DNAL7 a10.1111/rec.134922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhehsareh Ardestani, Elham1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4740-769810aPredicting optimal habitats of Haloxylon persicum for ecosystem restoration using ensemble ecological niche modeling under climate change in southeast Iran  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEcological restoration plays a vital role in the management of degraded ecosystems; nevertheless, the success of restoration plans depends to a large extent on determining optimal habitats for target species' growth and survival. Ecological niche modeling can be used to predict where climate is presently suitable for a particular species used in restoration, and where suitable climates will be located in the future. Here, we used ensemble ecological modeling to identify areas suitable for restoration of the arid shrub Haloxylon persicum in southeast Iran. We generated environmental suitability predictions for H. persicum restorations from eight different niche modeling algorithms and averaged these predictions to generate an ensemble model prediction. We present projections for the climate suitability of H. persicum for the present climate and the years 2050 and 2070 under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emissions scenarios and for three different global circulation models. Our model projected the optimum mean annual temperature for this species to be between 35.5 and 37°C, the optimum temperature of the coldest quarter to be between 3.5 and 13°C and the optimum precipitation of the coldest quarter to be between 65 to 90 mm. Based on our results, H. persicum is predicted to persist north of 27°N latitude in southeast Iran under current and future conditions; however, the availability of habitat suitable for H. persicum restoration is expected to dramatically diminish under future climate change. This study will help identify and prioritize locations for ecological restoration of this species in the face of climate change.  aPublisher supplied data  a96GRD1M1871cShahrekord University 3aHaloxylon persicum 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aecological restoration 3alatitude 3aniches 3aprediction 3ashrubs 3atemperature 3aIran1 aRigi, Hafizolah1 aHonarbakhsh, Afshin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0690-197X0 tRestoration ecology.g2021 Aug., v. 29, no. 6 p.e13492-dWiley Periodicals, Inc.wJournal:jnl3867104x1061-29717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rec.134923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03254naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009100166300001400257520208400271592002802355650002702383650001302410650001102423650001402434650001302448650000902461650000902470650001202479650001402491650001702505650001602522650001102538650001202549650001302561650001502574651001102589651001602600700002102616773009302637856008102730852000902811655001202820IND60481465120221116225143.0160205e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048146512DNAL7 a10.1007/s10452-015-9551-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPennuto, C. M.10aUpstream range expansion by invasive round gobies: Is functional morphology important?  ap. 45-57.  aRange expansion by invasive taxa can be facilitated by a wide variety of life history traits, by behavioral repertoires, or via human-aided translocation. The round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) continues to expand its range in Europe and the Great Lakes watershed by moving upstream in tributary rivers and streams. It is not clear whether in-stream barriers (e.g., waterfalls, culverts, dams) will prevent further upstream expansion. Since other species within the Gobiidae are adept waterfall climbers, we investigated whether body scaling morphometrics, fused pelvic fin adhesion, or swimming patterns in round gobies were suggestive of climbing capability. Behaviorally, round gobies swam less frequently, limited their swimming mode to caudal thrusts, and sought shelter more as velocity increased. Attachment to the substrate via the fused pelvic fins was documented in a laboratory flume. Fish smaller than 5 cm or having a body mass less than 1.5 g had passive pelvic fin adhesion power sufficient to remain in place on a wetted, inclined plane, whereas larger fish did not. Small fish had significantly smaller pelvic fin area/length ratios relative to larger fish (P < 0.001), but significantly greater pelvic fin area/mass ratios (P < 0.001). Caudal fin area, but not fused pelvic fin area, exhibited an allometric growth pattern versus weight in large gobies, whereas neither caudal nor pelvic fin area showed allometric increases versus weight in small round gobies. Pelvic fin area in both large and small fish grew allometrically compared to length, whereas caudal fin area increased allometrically relative to length only in small fish. Fin morphometric results suggest, theoretically, that neither adults nor juveniles have pelvic fin areas large enough to support their weight against gravity forces, but the areas are sufficient to withstand hydraulic drag forces. Collectively, our results suggest that in-stream barriers which force fish to overcome gravity should be impassable, but that barriers allowing fish to remain submerged could be navigable.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNeogobius melanostomus 3aadhesion 3aadults 3aallometry 3aculverts 3afins 3afish 3agravity 3ajuveniles 3alife history 3amorphometry 3arivers 3astreams 3aswimming 3awatersheds 3aEurope 3aGreat Lakes1 aRupprecht, S.

To mitigate severe urban water-related problems, China is implementing GI at the national scale under its Sponge City Program (SCP). The SCP is currently in a pilot period, however, little attention has been paid to the cost-effectiveness of GI implementation in China. In this study, an evaluation framework based on the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) and life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) was applied to undertake integrated assessments of the development of GI for flood mitigation, to support robust decision making regarding sponge city construction in urbanized watersheds. A baseline scenario and 15 GI scenarios under six design rainfall events with recurrence intervals ranging from 2–100 years were simulated and assessed. Model simulation results confirmed the effectiveness of GI for flood mitigation. Nevertheless, even under the most beneficial scenario, the results showed the hydrological performance of GI was incapable of eliminating flooding. Analysis indicated the bioretention cell (BC) plus vegetated swale (VS) scenario was the most cost-effective GI option for unit investment under all rainfall events. However, regarding the maximum potential of the implementation areas of all GI scenarios, the porous pavement plus BC + VS strategy was considered most reasonable for the study area. Although the optimal combinations are influenced by uncertainties in both the model and the GI parameters, the main trends and key insights derived remain unaffected; therefore, the conclusions are relevant regarding sponge city construction within the study area.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioretention areas 3aclimate change 3acost effectiveness 3adecision making 3agreen infrastructure 3ahydrology 3alife cycle costing 3apavements 3arain 3asimulation models 3auncertainty 3aurbanization 3awatersheds 3aChina 0aUrban flood 0aStorm water management model 0aLife cycle cost analysis 0aCost-effectiveness 0aLow impact development 0aUrbanization1 aLiu, Jiahong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4421-67811 aWang, Hao1 aYang, Zhiyong1 aDing, Xiangyi1 aShao, Weiwei0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Oct. 15, v. 639 p.1394-1407dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.05.1993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01987naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001800112245013600130300001800266520081000284592002801094650001001122650002301132650001501155650001401170650001601184650001101200650002101211650001101232650001701243650001101260653001001271653001401281653001001295653001201305653000901317700002301326700001601349700002101365700001701386773015301403852000901556655001201565IND60706471320221121020433.0200807e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070647132DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaur, Brijesh10aStudies on the Effect of Foliar Application of Micronutrients and Ga₃ on Yield and Reproductive Parameters of Winter Season Guava  ap. 3386-3389.  aThe present investigation entitled “Studies on the effect of foliar application of micronutrient and GA₃ on reproductive parameters and fruit yield of winter season guava “ was carried out in the Fruit Research Farm, Horticulture Unit, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi during the year 2010–2011.

This protocol involves the proline-catalyzed direct Mannich reaction-cyclization/IBX-mediated site-selective oxidation/NaBH₄-reduction sequence between glutaraldehyde and imines to generate in situ chiral 1,2-DHPs, followed by the diastereoselective Diels–Alder reaction with N-aryl maleimides furnishing isoquinuclidines in overall five steps. A variety of isoquinuclidines having five-contiguous chiral centers, including an all-carbon quaternary, were prepared with high yields (up to 78%) and excellent stereoselectivity (>50:1 dr, and up to >99:1 er). DFT calculations support the observed high stereoselective reaction outcome.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3achemical structure 3acycloaddition reactions 3adiastereoselective synthesis 3adiastereoselectivity 3aglutaraldehyde 3aimines 3aoxidation1 aPawar, Amol Prakash1 aIype, Eldhose1 aMir, Nisar A.1 aChoudhary, Sachin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1211-41151 aSharma, Devinder Kumar1 aKant, Rajni1 aKumar, Indresh1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4621-12360 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2019 Sept. 05, v. 84, no. 19 p.12408-12419dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19181x1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.9b018653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02421naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245013000165520109600295592002801391650001801419650002001437650002101457650001501478650001301493650001901506650002401525650001701549650001601566653001401582653001901596653002101615653002801636700001501664700005701679700001301736700001801749700001601767700001701783773009201800856008601892852000901978655001201987IND60746534120221121132550.0220830e20211201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074653412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2021.1227512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Hong10aFerrocene-reduced graphene oxide-polyoxometalates based ternary nanocomposites as electrochemical detection for acetaminophen  aDeveloping a convenient and accurate method for the determination of acetaminophen (APAP) content is very vital, and ferrocene (Fc) based nanocomposites coupled with polyoxometalates (POMs) as electrochemical sensor is a promising approach to address the issues. Herein, a new ternary nanocomposite of Fc based carbon nanomaterials (Fc-rGO) with PMo₁₂ (Fc-rGO/PMo₁₂, rGFP-n) was successfully fabricated, and the electrochemical activities and APAP detection of rGFP-n as electro-active materials were systematically investigated, and results of the differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) and electro-active surface area (0.0332 cm²) show that rGFP-1 is an excellent electrochemical sensor for APAP, and the proportion of Fc in rGFP-n can affect the charge transfer between APAP and rGFP. Under the optimal experimental conditions, rGFP-1 can be used to detect APAP with the limit of detection (LOD) of 13.27 nM (S/N = 3), the sensitivity of 36.81μA⋅μM−1cm−2, and the detection range from 1×10−6 to 1×10−3M, meeting the lowest plasma concentration of APAP (1.3 mM).  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetaminophen 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aferrocenes 3agraphene 3ananocomposites 3asensors (equipment) 3asurface area 3avoltammetry 0aFerrocene 0aGraphene oxide 0aPolyoxometalates 0aAcetaminophen detection1 aLiu, Chang1 aSha, Jingquan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5925-95651 aWang, Yu1 aDong, Chunyao1 aLi, Mingjun1 aJiao, Tiying0 tTalanta.g2021 Dec. 01, v. 235 p.122751-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2021.1227513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03252naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245013000167300001600297520177400313592002802087650001802115650001202133650002002145650002402165650000902189650001502198650002202213650003502235650001602270651002302286653002302309653002502332653001502357653002102372653000802393653002102401700002202422700001802444700006702462700002202529700003002551773010702581856008502688852000902773655001202782IND60619058320221118232211.0190214e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061905832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2018.09.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUlate, Karol10aConventional MPAs are not as effective as community co-managed areas in conserving top-down control in the Gulf of California  ap. 100-109.  aWhile undeniably successful in protecting nearshore marine ecosystems from overfishing, conventional marine reserves often impinge on the livelihoods of dependent coastal communities. Community co-managed areas may guarantee considerably more equity, but it is unclear if they can be as effective as conventional reserves in conserving critical trophic functions. We evaluated the effectiveness of different management regimes in the Gulf of California on fish biomass and echinoderm assemblages as proxies of key ecosystem processes on rocky shores. We compared multiple sites in a mixed (multi-use areas with regulated extraction) and core (no-extraction) federally-managed areas, a military MPA (where strict patrolling ensures no extraction), a co-managed reserve where government and communities are equally responsible, and unrestricted-access areas (non MPA). Fish biomass was higher in the military reserve and the community co-managed area reserve; echinoderm numbers were very low at these locations suggesting that they were strongly controlled by top-down processes. In contrast, federally-controlled reserves were virtually no different from unrestricted-access areas in numbers or composition of fish and echinoderms. Although federal managed reserves are the most common management regime across the Gulf, our data shows that they are highly ineffective in protecting ecosystem function. The relative effectiveness of co-managed reserves in this region suggests that fishers are more willing to comply when they have a stake in decision-making. Coastal conservation can benefit greatly by drawing from a wider suite of management options that engage local communities as key participants in the managing marine diversity and critical ecosystem functions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEchinodermata 3abiomass 3adecision making 3aecological function 3afish 3alivelihood 3amarine ecosystems 3anatural resources conservation 3aoverfishing 3aGulf of California 0aCoastal ecosystems 0aCommunity management 0aEchinoderm 0aMacroinvertivore 0aMPA 0aTrophic controls1 aAlcoverro, Teresa1 aArthur, Rohan1 aAburto-Oropeza, Octavio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8173-14321 aSánchez, Carlos,1 aHuato-Soberanis, Leonardo0 tBiological conservation.g2018 Dec., v. 228 p.100-109dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2018.09.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03337naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002300155245019500178520168000373592002802053650001202081650000902093650001502102650002302117650001302140650001402153650001402167650002902181650001402210650001202224650001902236650001202255651002102267651001502288651001802303653001802321653003402339653002402373653004402397653003402441700006702475700002302542700006502565700002302630773009102653856009002744852000902834655001202843IND60755208020221120130612.0211213e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075520802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1326372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPotapowicz, Joanna10aSources and composition of chemical pollution in Maritime Antarctica (King George Island), part 1: Sediment and water analysis for PAH sources evaluation in the vicinity of Arctowski station  aThe paper presents a study regarding the identification of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in fresh waters and surface sediments on the western shore of Admiralty Bay over four sampling seasons from 2017 to 2018. The results were compared to literature data from 2016 to provide a more comprehensive image of the environmental fate of PAHs over the years. The highest value of Σ PAHs was 82.9 ng/L and 445 ng/g dw in water and sediment samples, respectively. The analysis of PAH indicator ratio values showed that pyrogenic or mixed sources contribute to the PAH pollution in Antarctic sediments and water more than does petroleum. The main source is the combustion of biomass (e.g. as a result of fires) and coal, and PAHs are mostly associated with the activity of stations or are transported to a lesser extent by long-range atmospheric transport (LRAT) from South America. The values of the ΣLMW/ΣHMW ratio in sediments indicate that petrogenic sources contribute to PAH contamination, but among the six PAH ratios tested, petrogenic sources were identified as dominant in approximately 17–19% of cases. Lack of coherence in the obtained results confirms the mixed origin of PAHs in the studied samples. Although the differentiation of PAHs sources is still ambiguous, caution is recommended in light of the Antarctic system's evident and rapid response to global and local PAH emissions, and the dependency of accumulation and release cycle processes on weather conditions. A reduction in petrol usage in favour of renewable energy sources, and restriction of tourism are strongly recommended for better preservation of the pristine Antarctic environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acoal 3acombustion 3aenvironmental fate 3agasoline 3apetroleum 3apollution 3arenewable energy sources 3asediments 3atourism 3awater analysis 3aweather 3aAntarctic region 3aAntarctica 3aSouth America 0aAdmiralty bay 0aSediments and water chemistry 0aMaritime Antarctica 0aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) 0aPersistent organic pollutants1 aSzopińska, Małgorzata1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2186-77811 aSzumińska, Danuta1 aBialik, Robert Józef1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0254-63521 aPolkowska, Żaneta0 tChemosphere.g2022 Feb., v. 288 p.132637-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1326373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03000naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245010700170520162300277592002801900650001601928650002301944650001101967650001501978650001501993650001202008650001902020650001402039650001802053650002102071650001102092650001402103650001602117653002802133653001702161653002802178653002502206653001602231700001802247700001402265700001502279700001602294700001802310773009102328856009002419852000902509655001202518IND60755208120221120130543.0211213e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075520812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1326462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Liyuan10aMechanism study of CoS2/Fe(III)/peroxymonosulfate catalysis system: The vital role of sulfur vacancies  aPeroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation methods have attractive advantages in advanced oxidation process (AOPs) due to their powerful ability of directly or indirectly generating various reactive oxygen species (ROS). Herein, trace amount of Fe(III) ions were added into the commercial-CoS₂/PMS system to improve the CoS₂/PMS decomposition for organics removal. The organics removal efficiency could reach >90% towards methylene blue (MB), diclofenac sodium (DCF), sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and bisphenol A (BPA) in the CoS₂/Fe(III)/PMS system, with the kinetic apparent rate constant kₒbₛ of 0.141, 0.206, 0.247 and 0.091 min⁻¹, respectively. The synergistic effect between Fe(III) ions and sulfur-vacancies on CoS₂ for PMS degradation were revealed for the first time in cobalt sulfides/PMS system. Quenching experiments and ESR analysis proved that ¹O₂ was the major ROS and was produced mainly by the hydrolysis of SO₅•–. Besides, the high degradation efficiency was obtained by the contribution of SO₄•– and •OH. Electron spin–resonance spectroscopy (ESR), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and Raman spectrum data revealed that the addition of Fe(III) ions could optimize the intensity of sulfur vacancies on the CoS₂ surface, which hindered the PMS reduction ability of Co(II), but accelerated the PMS oxidation to form ¹O₂. The degradation path of MB was analyzed by liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometer (LC-MS). The mechanism studies speculated that the sulfur vacancies of CoS₂ provided the binding sites for Fe(III) ions with Co(II), which facilitated the PMS activation by Co(III).  aPublisher supplied data 3abisphenol A 3acatalytic activity 3acobalt 3adiclofenac 3ahydrolysis 3aliquids 3amethylene blue 3aoxidation 3aspectrometers 3asulfamethoxazole 3asulfur 3asynergism 3avoltammetry 0aCobalt disulfide (CoS2) 0aFe(III) ions 0aPeroxymonosulfate (PMS) 0aSinglet oxygen (1O2) 0aS vacancies1 aGuo, Pengpeng1 aWang, Xin1 aLi, Haiyan1 aLi, Angzhen1 aChen, Kai-Yu,0 tChemosphere.g2022 Feb., v. 288 p.132646-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1326463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02777naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100003100145245009100176300001800267500002000285520126300305592002801568596004301596650001601639650001201655650001801667650002001685650002601705650001201731650002401743650001801767650002801785650001901813650001301832650001301845650002801858700006201886700005701948700002202005700005802027773015802085856007902243852000902322655001202331IND60663040220221123035754.0190909e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066304022DNAL7 a10.1111/1541-4337.124832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWickramasinghe, Nirmani N.14aThe Predominance of Psychrotrophic Pseudomonads on Aerobically Stored Chilled Red Meat  ap. 1622-1635.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMicrobial spoilage of meat during chilled aerobic storage causes significant financial losses to the industry. Even with modern day preservation techniques, spoilage remains an unsolved problem. Spoilage of meat is a complex process that involves the activity of endogenous enzymes and microorganisms. Psychrotrophic Pseudomonas species are the key microorganisms that cause spoilage in aerobically stored chilled meat. Spoilage pseudomonads are highly robust and able to withstand stressful environmental conditions that would otherwise inhibit the growth of other spoilage organisms. In order to implement efficient control measures, and to minimize spoilage, a thorough understanding of the characteristics of spoilage pseudomonads is essential. This review focuses on the spoilage process and the key metabolic attributes of the main psychrotrophic spoilage Pseudomonas species to explain their predominance on meat over other psychrotrophic bacteria. This review also highlights less studied, but important, characteristics of psychrotrophic pseudomonads such as biofilm formation and quorum sensing in the context of meat spoilage. The importance of the use of model systems that are closely applicable to the food industry is also discussed in detail.  aPublisher supplied data  cAustralian Meat Processors Corporation 3aPseudomonas 3abiofilm 3achilled meats 3acontrol methods 3aenvironmental factors 3aenzymes 3afinancial economics 3afood industry 3apsychrotrophic bacteria 3aquorum sensing 3ared meat 3aspoilage 3aspoilage microorganisms1 aRavensdale, Joshua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3318-194X1 aCoorey, Ranil1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5261-13001 aChandry, Scott P.1 aDykes, Gary A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5014-92820 tComprehensive reviews in food science and food safety.g2019 Sept., v. 18, no. 5 p.1622-1635dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:J000000062x1541-43377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1541-4337.124833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03406naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100003200155245024900187520160200436592002802038650001602066650002502082650001502107650002402122650002902146650001002175650001502185650001402200650001902214650002302233650001202256650001502268651001102283653002202294653001802316653001702334653001602351653002402367700002802391700003502419700002602454700006602480700002702546700007602573700006102649773009102710856009002801852000902891655001202900IND60755208320221120130609.0211213e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075520832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1326492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPereira Righi, Bruna Duarte10aResponse of biomarkers to metals, hydrocarbons and organochlorine pesticides contamination in crabs (Callinectes ornatus and C. bocourti) from two tropical estuaries (São José and São Marcos bays) of the Maranhão State (northeastern Brazil)  aResponse of biomarkers to chemical contamination was evaluated in crabs of the Callinectes genus (Callinectes ornatus and C. bocourti) from two tropical estuaries (São José and São Marcos bays) of the Maranhão State (northeastern Brazil). Biomarkers evaluated included hepatopancreatic metallothionein-like proteins (MTLP) and lipid peroxidation (LPO), as well as muscle acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Tissue concentrations of metals (pereiopod muscle and hepatopancreas), hydrocarbons (hepatopancreas) and organochlorine pesticides (hepatopancreas) were also evaluated. Crab samples were collected in three sites of each estuary (São Marcos Bay and São José Bay). Sampling was performed in August/2012 (dry season), January/2013 (rainy season), August/2013 (dry season), and January/2014 (rainy season). Concentrations of chemical contaminants and responses of biomarkers showed significant spatial (São Marcos Bay and São José Bay) and/or seasonal (dry and rainy seasons) and annual (2012–2014) variability. However, a general higher Zn concentration was observed in hepatopancreas of crabs from São José Bay. In turn, a general higher Cd concentration paralleled by oxidative damage (LPO) was observed in hepatopancreas of crabs from São Marcos Bay. As expected, these findings support the idea that this bay is more intensively or chronically impacted by industrial activities while the São José Bay is likely more affected by domestic activities. Interestingly, LPO level in crab hepatopancreas showed to be the most reliable and adequate biomarker to distinguish the two bays.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCallinectes 3aacetylcholinesterase 3abiomarkers 3achemical pollutants 3achlorinated hydrocarbons 3acrabs 3adry season 3aestuaries 3ahepatopancreas 3alipid peroxidation 3amuscles 3awet season 3aBrazil 0aAquatic pollution 0aBiomonitoring 0aContaminants 0aCrustaceans 0aEstuarine pollution1 aAbujamara, Laís Donini1 aBarcarolli, Indianara Fernanda1 aJorge, Marianna Basso1 aZebral, Yuri Dornelles1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7418-31401 aCosta, Patrícia Gomes1 ados Reis Martinez, Claudia Bueno1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1467-51401 aBianchini, Adalto1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7627-76500 tChemosphere.g2022 Feb., v. 288 p.132649-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1326493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03539naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006300145245005100208300001800259500002000277520174600297592002802043596007302071596007302144596002002217650002002237650001802257650001102275650001802286650002802304650001902332650002502351650001302376650001102389650002202400650001302422650001702435650001102452650001202463650001902475650002002494650001402514650001702528650001202545650001002557650002202567650001102589700002002600700001802620700005802638700001902696773015802715856007902873852000902952655001202961IND60663040420221123035647.0190909e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066304042DNAL7 a10.1111/1541-4337.124752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrouns, F.q(Fred),1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5907-838810aAdverse Reactions to Wheat or Wheat Components  ap. 1437-1452.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWheat is an important staple food globally, providing a significant contribution to daily energy, fiber, and micronutrient intake. Observational evidence for health impacts of consuming more whole grains, among which wheat is a major contributor, points to significant risk reduction for diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and colon cancer. However, specific wheat components may also elicit adverse physical reactions in susceptible individuals such as celiac disease (CD) and wheat allergy (WA). Recently, broad coverage in the popular and social media has suggested that wheat consumption leads to a wide range of adverse health effects. This has motivated many consumers to avoid or reduce their consumption of foods that contain wheat/gluten, despite the absence of diagnosed CD or WA, raising questions about underlying mechanisms and possible nocebo effects. However, recent studies did show that some individuals may suffer from adverse reactions in absence of CD and WA. This condition is called non‐celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) or non‐celiac wheat sensitivity (NCWS). In addition to gluten, wheat and derived products contain many other components which may trigger symptoms, including inhibitors of α‐amylase and trypsin (ATIs), lectins, and rapidly fermentable carbohydrates (FODMAPs). Furthermore, the way in which foods are being processed, such as the use of yeast or sourdough fermentation, fermentation time and baking conditions, may also affect the presence and bioactivity of these components. The present review systematically describes the characteristics of wheat‐related intolerances, including their etiology, prevalence, the components responsible, diagnosis, and strategies to reduce adverse reactions.  aPublisher supplied data  aBB/P016855/1cBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council  aTKI16060BMNUcBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council  cTKI AGRI & FOOD 3aadverse effects 3aalpha-amylase 3abaking 3acarbohydrates 3acardiovascular diseases 3aceliac disease 3acolorectal neoplasms 3adiabetes 3aenergy 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aetiology 3afermentation 3agluten 3alectins 3arisk reduction 3asocial networks 3asourdough 3astaple foods 3atrypsin 3awheat 3awhole grain foods 3ayeasts1 avan Rooy, Gonny1 aShewry, Peter1 aRustgi, Sachin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6881-95011 aJonkers, Daisy0 tComprehensive reviews in food science and food safety.g2019 Sept., v. 18, no. 5 p.1437-1452dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:J000000062x1541-43377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1541-4337.124753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03604naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245016000185300001800345500001500363520142500378592002801803650001501831650001301846650002501859650001601884650001701900650001601917650001101933650001401944650001201958650003201970650002402002650001702026650001502043650006702058650006802125650004402193650001102237650002402248650005002272650006002322650003602382653001702418700002102435700001802456700001802474700002202492700001802514700002102532700002602553700002402579700002102603700001902624700001902643700002602662700002002688773010902708856008102817990002302898852000902921655001202930IND60090668220221121103459.0141102e20111201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009066822DNAL7 a220477992pmid7 a10.1016/j.bmc.2011.10.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarta, Antonio10aQuinoline tricyclic derivatives. Design, synthesis and evaluation of the antiviral activity of three new classes of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors  ap. 7070-7084.  a2019-12-06  aIn this study three new classes of linear N-tricyclic compounds, derived by condensation of the quinoline nucleus with 1,2,3-triazole, imidazole or pyrazine, were synthesized, obtaining triazolo[4,5-g]quinolines, imidazo[4,5-g]quinolines and pyrido[2,3-g]quinoxalines, respectively. Title compounds were tested in cell-based assays for cytotoxicity and antiviral activity against RNA viruses representative of the three genera of the Flaviviridae family, that is BVDV (Pestivirus), YFV (Flavivirus) and HCV (Hepacivirus). Quinoline derivatives were also tested against representatives of other RNA virus families containing single-stranded, either positive-sense (ssRNA⁺) or negative-sense (RNA⁻), and double-stranded genomes (dsRNA), as well as against representatives of two DNA virus families. Some quinolines showed moderate, although selective activity against CVB-5, Reo-1 and RSV. However, derivatives belonging to all classes showed activity against BVDV. Among the most potent were the bis-triazoloquinoline 1m, the imidazoquinolines 2e and 2h, and the pyridoquinoxalines 4h, 4j and 5n (EC₅₀ range 1–5μM). When tested in a replicon assay, compound 2h was the sole derivative to also display anti-HCV activity (EC₅₀=3.1μM). In enzyme assays, 1m, 2h, 5m and 5n proved to be potent inhibitors of the BVDV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), while only 2h also inhibited the recombinant HCV enzyme.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPestivirus 3areplicon 3aantiviral properties 3aHepacivirus 3acytotoxicity 3aDNA viruses 3agenome 3aquinoline 3aviruses 3aRNA-directed RNA polymerase 3adouble-stranded RNA 3aquinoxalines 3aFlavivirus 2aAntiviral Agentsxchemical synthesisxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxchemical synthesisxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aFlaviviridaexdrug effectsxenzymology. 2aHumans 2aMolecular Structure 2aQuinolinesxchemical synthesisxpharmacology. 2aRNA-Dependent RNA Polymerasexantagonists & inhibitors. 2aStructure-Activity Relationship 0acondensation1 aBriguglio, Irene1 aPiras, Sandra1 aCorona, Paola1 aBoatto, Giampiero1 aNieddu, Maria1 aGiunchedi, Paolo1 aMarongiu, Maria Elena1 aGiliberti, Gabriele1 aIuliano, Filippo1 aBlois, Sylvain1 aIbba, Cristina1 aBusonera, Bernardetta1 aLa Colla, Paolo0 tBioorganic & medicinal chemistry.g2011 Dec. 1, v. 19, no. 23 p.7070-7084dElsevier Ltdx0968-08967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2011.10.0093Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03327naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002500169245010000194300001600294500002000310520181500330592002802145650002202173650002002195650001402215650002202229650002402251650002002275650001502295650001502310650001302325650001102338650001502349650002102364650001502385650001602400650001302416650001502429650001402444650001802458651001202476700002102488700002302509700001802532700002502550773013002575856010702705852000902812655001202821IND60587517820221119061124.0180102e200304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058751782DNAL7 a10.1890/1051-0761(2003)013[0474:FROSDT]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFourqurean, James W.10aForecasting responses of seagrass distributions to changing water quality using monitoring data  ap. 474-489.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aExtensive data sets on water quality and seagrass distributions in Florida Bay have been assembled under complementary, but independent, monitoring programs. This paper presents the landscape‐scale results from these monitoring programs and outlines a method for exploring the relationships between two such data sets. Seagrass species occurrence and abundance data were used to define eight benthic habitat classes from 677 sampling locations in Florida Bay. Water quality data from 28 monitoring stations spread across the Bay were used to construct a discriminant function model that assigned a probability of a given benthic habitat class occurring for a given combination of water quality variables. Mean salinity, salinity variability, the amount of light reaching the benthos, sediment depth, and mean nutrient concentrations were important predictor variables in the discriminant function model. Using a cross‐validated classification scheme, this discriminant function identified the most likely benthic habitat type as the actual habitat type in most cases. The model predicted that the distribution of benthic habitat types in Florida Bay would likely change if water quality and water delivery were changed by human engineering of freshwater discharge from the Everglades. Specifically, an increase in the seasonal delivery of freshwater to Florida Bay should cause an expansion of seagrass beds dominated by Ruppia maritima and Halodule wrightii at the expense of the Thalassia testudinum‐dominated community that now occurs in northeast Florida Bay. These statistical techniques should prove useful for predicting landscape‐scale changes in community composition in diverse systems where communities are in quasi‐equilibrium with environmental drivers.

(Orthoptera: Acrididae) that Occurred After Inbreeding  ap. 175-177.  aGreen-colored hatchlings appeared in the 2ⁿᵈ generation of inbred family lines in Locusta migratoria L. Female adults collected in Tsukuba, Japan were kept individually and eggs collected from them. Locusts of the first generation from each female were reared in a group and eggs of the 2ⁿᵈ generation obtained from them. Green and normal-colored (fawn) hatchlings appeared together from the same egg pods, originating from 2 of the 34 family lines established. When they were reared together in the same cage, the green morph suffered from a high rate of mortality. A few green-morph female individuals attained the adult stage with light body coloration, but died without producing any eggs. Although no information is available about their genetic background, it seems likely these green morphs represent a recessive, semilethal trait that appeared after inbreeding of wild-caught female adults. Photographs of hatchlings, nymphs and adults are presented.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLocusta migratoria 3aadults 3acages 3acolor 3aegg masses 3aeggs 3afawns 3afemales 3agenetic background 3ainbreeding 3alocusts 3amigratory behavior 3amorphs 3amortality 3anymphs 3aphotographs 3arearing 3aJapan 0abody color 0aeye color 0ainbreeding 0aLocusta migratoria1 aNishide, Yudai0 tJournal of orthoptera research.g2012 Nov., v. 21, no. 2 p.175-177dOrthopterists' Societyx1082-64677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1665%2F034.021.02053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02308naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006300150245008700213300001800300520104900318592002801367650002401395650002101419650002201440650001401462650001301476650002201489650002101511650001501532650001901547650001301566650001401579650001301593650001401606700002101620700006101641773011401702856008501816852000901901655001201910IND60688504220221120045008.0210220e20200323xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068850422DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c005732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCavallaro, Giuseppe1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2145-016110aHalloysite Nanotubes: Interfacial Properties and Applications in Cultural Heritage  ap. 3677-3689.  aThe peculiar surfaces of halloysite nanotubes and their biocompatibility are attracting the interest of researchers based on the wide range of attainable applications. The large aspect ratio of this nanotubular material ensures promising properties as a reinforcing agent in polymeric matrixes, such as cellulose and its derivatives, that entail strengthening due to, for instance, aging-induced degradation. The halloysite cavity has a suitable size for hosting a large variety of active species such as deacidifying (calcium hydroxide) and flame retardant agents (fluorinated surfactants) for a controlled and sustained release relevant to the conservation of cultural heritage. Additionally, anionic surfactants can be selectively adsorbed at the inner surface generating inorganic micelles able to solubilize hydrophobic species in a controlled cleaning protocol. We briefly discuss how the natural halloysite nanotubes can be supportive in various conservation processes of cultural heritage and present an outlook for future perspectives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanionic surfactants 3abiocompatibility 3acalcium hydroxide 3acellulose 3acleaning 3acultural heritage 3aflame retardants 3ahalloysite 3ahydrophobicity 3amicelles 3ananotubes 3apolymers 3aprotocols1 aMilioto, Stefana1 aLazzara, Giuseppe1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1953-58170 tLangmuir.g2020 Mar. 23, v. 36, no. 14 p.3677-3689dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c005733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02344naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245013200163300001800295520114500313592002801458650001601486650002201502650001701524650003101541650002101572650001501593650001701608650001101625650002201636650001601658650002101674700001401695700005401709773011401763856008401877852000901961655001201970IND60688504320221120045044.0200414e20200330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068850432DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c006632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Wei10aInfluence of Surface Potential on the Capacitive Performance of the TiO₂ Thin-Film Electrode with Different Crystalline Forms  ap. 3836-3842.  aElectrochemical capacitor and capacitive deionization store energy through the interface layer formed between electrodes and electrolytes. The crystalline form and surface potential of the oxide electrode can be changed in order to improve the capacitance. By characterizing the surface property and crystalline form of the TiO₂ thin-film electrode at different sintering temperatures, it is showed that each electrode has its own surface potential which is affected by the crystalline structure. At elevated sintering temperature, TiO₂ transfers from anatase to rutile with an increased surface potential. The electrochemical tests show that the electrode capacitance increases from 19.50 to 41.82 mF/cm². Therefore, rutile TiO₂ has a higher surface potential and better capacitive performance when used on a positive electrode compared with anatase TiO₂. In general, the relation between the surface potential, the crystalline forms, and the capacitive performance is achieved in this work. We hope it can promote the investigation of oxide materials in the application for electrochemical capacitors and capacitive deionization.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3acrystal structure 3adeionization 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3afilms (materials) 3atemperature 3atitanium dioxide1 aGao, Tian1 aWang, Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1928-25060 tLangmuir.g2020 Mar. 30, v. 36, no. 14 p.3836-3842dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c006633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03054naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002300155245022700178520152800405592002801933650001801961650001601979650002101995650001402016650002702030650001902057650001402076653001102090653001902101653000802120653001102128653002002139700001802159700002202177700002202199700002702221700002002248700001902268700001802287700002402305700002402329700002002353773011202373856009002485852000902575655001202584IND60760087420221119033952.0220222e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076008742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2021.1069102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrzechowska, Kinga10aEffects of orexin A on PTGS2, PTGES, CBR1 and PGFS mRNA transcript abundances and prostaglandin E2 and F2α concentrations in culture medium of pig uterine explants collected during early gestation and the estrogenic cycle  aIn this study, aims were to evaluate orexin A (OXA) effects on mRNA abundance of important enzymes involved in prostaglandin production, such as cyclooxygenase 2 (PTGS2), microsomal PGE₂ synthase-1 (PTGES), PGF₂α synthase (PGFS) and carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1), as well as prostaglandin E₂ (PGE₂) and F₂α (PGF₂α) culture medium concentrations for endometrial and myometrial explants. Tissues were collected from gilts during specific phases of the estrogenic cycle or early gestational period. There were greater concentrations of PGE₂ with OXA treatments of endometrial tissues collected on days 12–13 and 27–28, as well as PGF₂α on days 10–11 of the gestational period. The PGF₂α concentrations were less in tissues collected on days 27–28 of the gestational period. The OXA treatments resulted in lesser concentrations of PGE₂ from myometrial tissues collected on days 10–11 and greater PGF₂α on days 10–11 of the gestational period and 10–11 of the estrogenic cycle. Effects of OXA may occur due to actions at PTGS2, PTGES, PGFS and CBR1 genes because mRNA abundances for proteins encoded by these genes were affected by OXA. Results indicate there is an OXA effect on mRNA abundances and prostaglandin culture medium concentrations of uterine tissue collected at different stages of the gestational period or estrogenic cycle using different doses of OXA. It, therefore, is concluded OXA may affect de novo synthesis and secretion of PGE₂ and PGF₂α in the uterus of pigs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aculture media 3aendometrium 3agestation period 3apregnancy 3aprostaglandin synthase 3aprostaglandins 3asecretion 0aOrexin 0aProstaglandins 0aPig 0aUterus 0aEarly pregnancy1 aKiezun, Marta1 aRytelewska, Edyta1 aGudelska, Marlena1 aKisielewska, Katarzyna1 aKopij, Grzegorz1 aDobrzyn, Kamil1 aZaobidna, Ewa1 aSzymanska, Karolina1 aKamiński, Tadeusz,1 aSmolinska, Nina0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2022 Feb., v. 237 p.106910-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11636x0378-43207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2021.1069103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02723naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245013500167300001600302500001500318520113500333592002801468650002601496650002401522650002801546650002901574650002501603650001701628650001801645650002101663650002101684650002701705650001201732650001601744650001201760650002201772650002101794650002701815650002601842650001701868650002301885650002101908700001901929700006001948773013002008856008202138852000902220655001202229IND60724643820221121100020.0210122e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072464382DNAL7 a10.1007/s10924-020-01893-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIbrahim, Saber10aBiodegradable, Antimicrobial and Antioxidant Biofilm for Active Packaging Based on Extracted Gelatin and Lignocelluloses Biowastes  ap. 472-482.  agolden set  aBlending of lignocellulosic fibers from Citrus trees trimming wastes and extracted gelatin (EG) was examined as low cost biobased active biofilm packaging materials imminent substitution for toxic and non-degradable petrochemical polymers.

This has always been problematic considering the wide range of tolerance to freeze thawing among vertebrate sperm. Furthermore, those providing leadership for genome banking should be proactive to preserve maximum genetic diversity, however, for many species there is little or no sperm motility after thawing of cryopreserved sperm. In this review article, there is the contention that a much wider range of tissues should be banked, and the range of evolving advanced reproductive and developmental technologies should be considered for conservation breeding programs, to realize the maximum opportunities of genome banking to contribute to conservation of animal species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial insemination 3acryopreservation 3agenetic variation 3agenome 3aleadership 3asperm motility 3aspermatozoa 3avertebrates 0aAdvanced reproductive technologies 0aGenome banking 0aWildlife conservation1 aClulow, J.q(John),0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2021 Dec. 16,  p.106911-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11636x0378-43207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2021.1069113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01245naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245006300161300001600224520021900240592002800459650001000487650001700497650001300514651001600527653001600543653001600559653001900575653001600594653001800610653001500628653001600643700002500659773011200684856007800796852000900874655001200883IND60129414720221120202106.0151124e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012941472DNAL7 a10.1665/034.021.02082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRowell, C.H.F.10aAdditions to the Acridoid Grasshopper Fauna of El Salvador  ap. 235-243.  aBased upon a week's field work in northwestern El Salvador, we add 14 species to the list of grasshoppers known from the country, increasing the count to 24 species.

In this work, sericin-coated magnetite nanoparticles (SC-MNPs) were synthesized from ferric salts (Fe³⁺), ferrous salts (Fe²⁺), and sericin in alkaline solution at room temperature. The sericin, a waste protein produced during silk degumming, was demonstrated to control the size and morphology of the magnetite nanoparticles. Transmission electron microscopy clearly showed the presence of a sericin coating, and the particle size decreased from 16 ± 5 nm for the untreated MNPs to 12 ± 4 nm for the sericin-coated MNPs. FT-IR spectroscopy also confirmed the presence of sericin on the nanoparticles. The SC-MNPs were approximately 40% more effective than the unmodified MNPs in adsorption of methylene blue (a cationic dye) from water. Adsorption equilibrium was reached within 120 min. A good fit was found between the empirical adsorption data and the Freundlich isotherm, suggesting that adsorption was physical in nature, and that multiple layers were formed.  aPublisher supplied data  aSciGR9/2563cFaculty of Science and Technology, Thammasat University 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aambient temperature 3adegumming 3aferromagnetism 3amagnetic fields 3amagnetic properties 3amagnetite 3amethylene blue 3ananoparticles 3aparticle size 3apolymers 3asalts 3asericin 3asilk 3asorption isotherms 3atransmission electron microscopy 3awastes 3awater 3awater treatment1 aInprasit, Thitirat1 aVanichvattanadecha, Chutima1 aThiangtrong, Apichya1 aAnukunwithaya, Patsaya1 aPisitsak, Penwisa0 tJournal of polymers and the environment.g2021 Feb., v. 29, no. 2 p.484-491dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3870065x1566-25437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10924-020-01891-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03145naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001200139245011600151300001600267520182100283592002802104650001402132650001602146650001402162650001702176650001202193650002302205650002702228650001402255650001402269650002602283650001402309650001902323650001402342700001702356700001702373700002002390700001202410700001302422700001302435700001902448700001602467773010802483856007502591852000902666655001202675IND60529193420221119041155.0160717e20130102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052919342DNAL7 a10.1021/ac30258122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Li10aInvestigation of Hypoxia-Induced Myocardial Injury Dynamics in a Tissue Interface Mimicking Microfluidic Device  ap. 235-244.  aMyocardial infarction is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. However, the methodological development of a spatiotemporally controllable investigation of the damage events in myocardial infarction remains challengeable. In the present study, we describe a micropillar array-aided tissue interface mimicking microfluidic device for the dynamic study of hypoxia-induced myocardial injury in a microenvironment-controllable manner. The mass distribution in the device was visually characterized, calculated, and systematically evaluated using the micropillar-assisted biomimetic interface, physiologically relevant flows, and multitype transportation. The fluidic microenvironment in the specifically functional chamber for cell positioning and analysis was successfully constructed with high fluidic relevance to the myocardial tissue. We also performed a microenvironment-controlled microfluidic cultivation of myocardial cells with high viability and regular structure integration. Using the well-established culture device with a tissue-mimicking microenvironment, a further on-chip investigation of hypoxia-induced myocardial injury was carried out and the varying apoptotic responses of myocardial cells were temporally monitored and measured. The results show that the hypoxia directionally resulted in observable cell shrinkage, disintegration of the cytoskeleton, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and obvious activation of caspase-3, which indicates its significant apoptosis effect on myocardial cells. We believe this microfluidic device can be suitable for temporal investigations of cell activities and responses in myocardial infarction. It is also potentially valuable to the microcontrol development of tissue-simulated studies of multiple clinical organ/tissue disease dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3abiomimetics 3acaspase-3 3acytoskeleton 3ahypoxia 3amembrane potential 3amitochondrial membrane 3amorbidity 3amortality 3amyocardial infarction 3ashrinkage 3atransportation 3aviability1 aLiu, Wenming1 aWang, Yaolei1 aWang, Jian-Chun1 aTu, Qin1 aXu, Juan1 aLiu, Rui1 aShen, Shao-Fei1 aWang, Jinyi0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2013 Jan. 02, v. 85, no. 1 p.235-244dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac30258123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02302naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245020400175300001600379520088300395592002801278650001801306650001501324650001601339650001201355650001501367650001201382650001401394650001701408650001501425650001801440651001201458653001601470653003201486653002401518653002201542653000801564653000901572653001901581700002501600773014001625856008201765852000901847655001201856IND60747486220221122121544.0210813e20200615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074748622DNAL7 a10.1654/1525-2647-87.1.1092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRubtsova, Nataliya Yu.10aMorphological Features and Structural Analysis of Plerocercoids of Spirometra erinaceieuropaei (Cestoda: Diphyllobothriidae) from European Pine Marten, Martes martes (Mammalia: Mustelidae) in Ukraine  ap. 109-117.  aWe report zoonotic Spirometra erinaceieuropaei (Rudolphi, 1819) Faust, Campbell and Kellogg, 1929 (Diphyllobothriidae), from its natural ecosystem in Europe from Martes martes in Ukraine.

Therefore, this study aims to investigate the properties of postconsumer recycled polypropylene (PPrec) composites with 20% (by weight) calcined mollusk shell waste. The calcination was carried out at 500 °C for 12, in order to deagglomerate the particles of the shell calcined (CS). Two more composites were prepared from calcined shell: one CS/CNSL, where CS was treated with the liquid from the cashew nut shell—CNSL (an agricultural by-product) and the other CS/PEG, where CS was treated with polyethylene glycol—PEG (a synthetic product). Based on morphological aspect, PPrec showed nanoparticles of calcium carbonate (CaCO₃) well dispersed with size around 290.9 nm. The surface treatment of CS with PEG resulted in composites with voids and agglomerated particles. Some of the CS particles were anchored as well as detached from the matrix. Some clusters involving the CaCO₃ nanoparticles and shell microparticles treated with CNSL were observed. The TGA curves revealed an ash content in the range of 9.46% for the recycled Polypropylene, suggesting the presence of CaCO₃. The thermal stability of the matrix was improved by adding the calcined shell and also by treating it with CNSL. From the DSC, the degree of crystallinity of the CS/CNSL and CS/PEG composites were similar to that of the PPrec. However, an 11.9% reduction in the crystallinity of composite with CS was observed, which exhibited a broader melting peak indicating that smaller polymer spherulites may be present. The investigation of Mechanical properties allowed to verify an increase in both the tensile and flexural modulus of the PPrec/CS, while CS/CNSL composite presents a mild decrease in the both. In addition, CS particles were more effective in improving the toughness of PPrec, increasing its impact strength by 41%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagroindustrial byproducts 3aash content 3acalcium carbonate 3acashew nuts 3acomposite materials 3acrystal structure 3aenvironment 3aimpact strength 3aliquids 3amanufacturing 3amelting 3amicroparticles 3ananoparticles 3apolyethylene 3apolypropylenes 3arecycling 3ashell (molluscs) 3athermal stability 3awastes 3aweight1 aMacêdo, O.

Actellic 2% dust® (Pirimiphos-methyl) was used as a standard insecticide. Most of the plants are used for culinary or medicinal purposes in Nigeria. Sample analyses were conducted before and after six months of storage. Cowpea seeds were stored with either pulverized plant materials at the rates of 2.5, 5.0 and 10.0 g/100 g seeds or Actellic 2% dust at the rates of 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 g/100 g seeds to determine the crude protein, crude fat, crude fibre, total ash and moisture content of the seeds. Organoleptic tests of cooked seeds for taste, odour, texture, appearance and overall acceptability and sensory tests for firmness and appearance of uncooked treated seeds relative to a control were evaluated at a single rate of 10.0 g plant powder or 3.0 g Actellic®/100 g seed. Viability tests on the seeds were carried out before commencement and six months after storage. All data were subjected to ANOVA and differences between means determined at 5% probability level. Sample analysis showed that all the plant products and Actellic® increased the moisture and crude fibre contents and decreased the crude protein content. The plant products and Actellic had no significant adverse effect on organoleptic characteristics and viability of the treated seeds. Sensory tests of uncooked seeds stored with most of the materials were also adjudged to be as good as the untreated control by a majority of the panelists.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBruchidae 3aVigna unguiculata 3aadverse effects 3aanalysis of variance 3aconsumer acceptance 3acowpeas 3acrude fiber 3acrude protein 3afirmness 3ainsecticidal properties 3anutritive value 3aodors 3apirimiphos-methyl 3aprobability 3aseeds 3astorage time 3ataste 3atexture 3aviability 3awater content 3aNigeria 0aSample analyses 0aOrganoleptic 0aSensory evaluation 0aViability 0aActellic®1 aKayode, R.M.O.0 tJournal of stored products research.g2014 Jan., v. 56 p.9-15dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45775x0022-474X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jspr.2013.11.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03424naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002800188245016200216300001200378506007600390520169600466592002802162506003702190650002102227650003202248650001502280650001302295650000802308650001402316650001602330650002602346650002002372650001502392650001002407650000902417650001602426650001402442650001102456650000902467650003002476650000902506650002202515650001202537650002402549651001402573700002402587700002202611700002202633773011202655856008202767852000902849655001202858IND60572641120221207142216.0190220e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057264112DNAL7 a10.1186/s13071-016-1920-82doi7 aPMC51600222pmcid7 a279788442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMascarelli, Patricia E.10aDetection of Mycoplasma haemocanis, Mycoplasma haematoparvum, Mycoplasma suis and other vector-borne pathogens in dogs from Córdoba and Santa Fé, Argentina  ap. 642.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: In Argentina, only very few reports are available for canine tick-borne diseases where most are related to parasitic diseases. The objective of this survey was to investigate the prevalence of tick-borne pathogens in 70 dogs from Santa Fé and Córdoba, Argentina. METHODS: Microscopic blood smear examination as well as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification using species-specific markers of Anaplasma, Babesia, Bartonella, Borrelia, Ehrlichia, Francisella, Mycoplasma (hemotropic group) and Rickettsia, followed by DNA sequencing were used to establish the prevalence of each infecting pathogen. RESULTS: Blood smear analysis showed 81% (57/70) prevalence of structures morphologically compatible with hemotropic mycoplasmas. No structures resembling either piroplasms or Anaplasma/Ehrlichia were detected. Hemotropic mycoplasma species (Mycoplasma haematoparvum, Mycoplasma haemocanis and Mycoplasma suis) were the most prevalent pathogens detected with an overall prevalence of 77.1%. Anaplasma platys was detected and identified in 11 of the 70 dogs (15.7%), meanwhile two Bartonella spp. (B. clarridgeiae and an uncharacterized Bartonella sp.) and Babesia vogeli were detected at 3 and 7% prevalence, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The work presented here describes a high molecular prevalence for hemotropic mycoplasma species in each of the five locations selected. Three Mycoplasma spp., including Mycoplasma suis, reported for the first time in dogs have been identified by DNA amplification and sequencing. This study highlights the risk that these bacterial pathogens represent for companion animals and, due to their potential zoonotic nature, also for people.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnaplasma platys 3aBabesia canis subsp. vogeli 3aBartonella 3aBorrelia 3aDNA 3aEhrlichia 3aFrancisella 3aMycoplasma haemocanis 3aMycoplasma suis 3aRickettsia 3ablood 3adogs 3aparasitoses 3apathogens 3apeople 3apets 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arisk 3asequence analysis 3asurveys 3atick-borne diseases 3aArgentina1 aTartara, Gustavo P.1 aPereyra, Norma B.1 aMaggi, Ricardo G.0 tParasites & vectors.g2016 Dec., v. 9, no. 1 p.642-642dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-016-1920-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle
