However, one can question if the optimal slaughter weight is the same for each sex. On three farms, crossbred pigs (n = 1128) were used to determine the effect of sex and slaughter weight on performance, carcass quality and gross margin per pig place per year. On each farm, an equal number of entire males (EMs), barrows (BAs), immunocastrates (IC) and gilts (GIs) were housed separately in group pens. Pens were randomly divided into three categories of different slaughter weights: 105, 117 and 130 kg BW. In BA, the high average daily feed intake (ADFI) and the lower capacity to gain muscle led to a higher feed conversion ratio (FCR) and lower lean meat percentage in comparison to EM and IC. In all sexes, ADFI and FCR increased with an increasing slaughter weight but the effect of slaughter weight on carcass quality varied between sexes. In BA and GI, slaughter weight had no effect on carcass quality, but in EM and IC, carcass quality improved at higher slaughter weights. Gross margin per pig place per year was calculated as gross margin per pig × barn turnover per year, taking into account fixed costs per round, feed costs and output price per pig. The slaughter weight that gained the highest gross margin per year differed between sexes. Slaughtering BA and GI at 130 kg BW, compared to 105 or 117 kg BW, decreased the gross margin per pig place per year due to the lower margin per pig and barn turnover at higher weights. In IC and EM, no difference in gross margin per pig place per year could be demonstrated between slaughtering at 105, 117 or 130 kg BW. In IC, the increasing gross margin per pig with increasing slaughter weights counteracted with the lower barn turnover. In EM, gross margin per pig did not differ between slaughter weights, but the effect of barn turnover was too small to demonstrate significant differences between slaughter weights on gross margin per pig place per year. In conclusion, slaughter weight has an impact on profitability in BA and GI: they should not be slaughtered at 130 kg BW but at lower weights, but no effect could be demonstrated in EM and IC.  aPublisher supplied data 3abarns 3acarcass quality 3afarm profitability 3afarms 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3alean meat 3amuscles 3aprofits and margins 3aslaughter 3aslaughter weight 0aeconomic analysis 0aentire male pigs 0aimmunocastration 0amarket weight 0agrowing-finishing pigs1 aLeen, F.1 aAluwé, M.1 aVan Meensel, J.1 aMillet, S.0 tAnimal.g2020 July, v. 14, no. 7 p.1546-1554dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl3938811x1751-73117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17517311190030333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02551naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002500145245010000170300001800270520129700288592002801585650002401613650002101637650002001658650000901678650001301687650002401700650001301724650001801737650001401755650003501769650001101804650001201815650001201827650001001839651001501849700002001864700002301884773013401907856007902041852000902120655001202129IND60580658720221118021558.0170925e20170126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058065872DNAL7 a10.1139/cjfas-2016-03952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrewitt, Kimberly S.10aHot eats and cool creeks: juvenile Pacific salmonids use mainstem prey while in thermal refuges  ap. 1588-1602.  aThermal refuges form important habitat for cold-water fishes in the face of rising temperatures. As fish become concentrated in refuges, food resources may become depleted. In this study, we used invertebrate drift sampling and fish density surveys to quantify potential in-refuge food limitation, temperature-sensitive radio-tagging studies to quantify thermal habitat use, and isotopic analyses to determine diet sources for juvenile Pacific salmonids using thermal refuges in California’s Klamath River. Juvenile salmonids using refuges formed by tributary junctions with the mainstem river obtained the majority (range = 47%–97%) of their diet from mainstem prey sources. Mean steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) body temperatures were significantly cooler (∼3.5 °C) than diet-inferred foraging temperatures. Thus, while fish seek cooler habitat for physiological benefits, they rely primarily on mainstem prey. Moreover, consistently high densities of fish in refuges (mean = 3.5 fish·m⁻²) could lead to density-dependent food limitation. Thus, mobile consumers like fish can exploit existing heterogeneity associated with cold-water refuges by gaining thermal benefits from a food-limited cold-water habitat while deriving the majority of their prey from the warm mainstem river.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3abody temperature 3acold-water fish 3adiet 3aforaging 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3ainvertebrates 3ajuveniles 3aradio frequency identification 3arivers 3astreams 3asurveys 3awater 3aCalifornia1 aDanner, Eric M.1 aMoore, Jonathan W.0 tCanadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences.g2017 Jan. 26, v. 74, no. 10 p.1588-1602dNRC Research Pressx1205-75337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2016-03953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03134naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245012400169300001800293500001900311520183400330592002802164650001202192650001502204650001802219650002202237650003002259650001402289650001502303650002802318650001502346650002002361653001102381653001102392653001102403653002102414653002802435700001602463700001702479773011402496856008102610852000902691655001202700IND60699446020221119000234.0200618e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069944602DNAL7 a10.1017/S17517311190030692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartin-Rosset, W.10aComparison of three systems for predicting the digestible energy value of natural grassland and lucerne hays for horses  ap. 1413-1421.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe accuracy and precision of the National Research Council (NRC), Gesellschaft für Ernährungsphysiologie (GfE) and Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA) systems for predicting the digestible energy (DE) value of hays were determined from the results of 15 digestibility trials with natural grassland hays and 9 digestibility trials with lucerne hays that all met strict experimental and a tight corpus of methods. The hays were harvested in the temperate zone. They covered broad ranges of chemical composition and DE value. The INRA system was more accurate than the other two systems, with the bias between the predicted and measured DE values of natural grassland and lucerne hays averaging −0.11 and −0.04 MJ/kg DM with the INRA system, 0.34 and −0.70 MJ/kg DM with the NRC system and −0.50 and −1.69 MJ/kg DM with the GfE system (P < 0.05). However, the precision of the three systems was similar; the standard error of prediction corrected by bias was not significantly different (P > 0.05). The GfE system underestimated the DE value of hays, especially of lucerne hays. The differences between the predicted and measured DE values resulted mainly from the errors in the prediction of organic matter digestibility and energy digestibility for both natural grassland and lucerne hays. Discrimination according to botanical family (grassland v. lucerne) can help improve the prediction of the DE value of hays. The choice of appropriate predictive variables is discussed in the light of differences in chemical composition and digestibility of the various cell wall components of grassland and lucerne hays. Neutral detergent fiber (NDF) may thus be preferable to ADF in the prediction equation of the DE value of lucerne hays, whereas ADF and NDF may both be relevant for natural grassland hays.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalfalfa 3acell walls 3adigestibility 3adigestible energy 3adigestible organic matter 3aequations 3agrasslands 3aneutral detergent fiber 3aprediction 3atemperate zones 0aequine 0aenergy 0aforage 0abotanical family 0afeed evaluation systems1 aAndueza, D.1 aVermorel, M.0 tAnimal.g2020 July, v. 14, no. 7 p.1413-1421dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl3938811x1751-732X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17517311190030693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03816naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002800113040001800141100002100159245019200180300001600372520174100388592002802129650002402157650001502181650001502196650001102211650001402222650001102236650001402247650001102261650001902272650001902291650002602310650001302336650002302349650001602372650001702388650003902405650003902444650004102483650001302524650004402537650003702581650001902618650004102637650001602678650002202694653002402716653002602740653002402766653002102790653002102811653001602832700001902848700001902867700002202886700002202908700002102930773012002951856007403071852000903145655001203154IND60118896620221119160502.0141127e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011889662DNAL7 a232933472pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/ers3532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrilli, Federico10aUltradian variation of isoprene emission, photosynthesis, mesophyll conductance, and optimum temperature sensitivity for isoprene emission in water-stressed Eucalyptus citriodora saplings  ap. 519-528.  aWater availability is a major limiting factor on plant growth and productivity. Considering that Eucalyptus spp. are among the few plant species able to produce both isoprene and monoterpenes, experiments were designed to investigate the response of isoprene emission and isoprenoid concentrations in Eucalyptus citriodora saplings exposed to decreasing fraction of transpirable soil water (FTSW). In particular, this study aimed to assess: (a) the kinetic of water stress-induced variations in photosynthesis, isoprene emission, and leaf isoprenoid concentrations during progressive soil water shortage as a function of FTSW; (b) the ultradian control of isoprene emission and photosynthesis under limited soil water availability; and (c) the optimum temperature sensitivity of isoprene emission and photosynthesis under severe water stress. The optimum temperature for isoprene emission did not change under progressive soil water deficit. However, water stress induced a reallocation of carbon through the MEP/DOXP pathway resulting in a qualitative change of the stored isoprenoids. The ultradian trend of isoprene emission was also unaffected under water stress, and a similar ultradian trend of stomatal and mesophyll conductances was also observed, highlighting a tight coordination between diffusion limitations to photosynthesis during water stress. The kinetics of photosynthetic parameters and isoprene emission in response to decreasing FTSW in E. citriodora are strikingly similar to those measured in other plant functional types. These findings may be useful to refine the algorithms employed in process-based models aiming to precisely up-scale carbon assimilation and isoprenoid emissions at regional and global scales.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorymbia citriodora 3aEucalyptus 3aalgorithms 3acarbon 3aemissions 3aleaves 3amesophyll 3amodels 3amonoterpenoids 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant available water 3asaplings 3asoil water deficit 3atemperature 3awater stress 2aButadienesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aEucalyptusxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aHemiterpenesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aKinetics 2aMesophyll Cellsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aPentanesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aPhotosynthesis 2aPlant Leavesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aTemperature 2aWaterxmetabolism 0aCarbon assimilation 0adiffusive limitations 0adiurnal variability 0adrought kinetics 0ahigh temperature 0aisoprenoids1 aTsonev, Tsonko1 aMahmood, Tariq1 aVelikova, Violeta1 aLoreto, Francesco1 aCentritto, Mauro0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2013 Jan., v. 64, no. 2 p.519-528dOxford University Press [etc.]x0022-09577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/ers3533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03906naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005400147245008700201300001800288500001900306520255100325592002802876650001502904650001502919650001402934650001202948650001602960650001002976650001802986650002403004650001903028650001403047650001103061653001803072653002003090700001703110700001503127700001703142700001603159700001803175700001603193700002303209773011403232856008103346852000903427655001203436IND60699446120221118235955.0200618e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069944612DNAL7 a10.1017/S17517311190034102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoncke, C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5551-854210aNet hepatic release of glucose from precursor supply in ruminants: a meta-analysis  ap. 1422-1437.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFor their glucose supply, ruminants are highly dependent on the endogenous synthesis in the liver, but despite the numerous studies that evaluated hepatic glucose production, very few simultaneously measured hepatic glucose production and uptake of all precursors. As a result, the variability of precursor conversion into glucose in the liver is not known. The present study aimed at investigating by meta-analysis the relationships between hepatic glucose net release and uptake of precursors. We used the FLuxes of nutrients across Organs and tissues in Ruminant Animals database, which gathers international results on net nutrient fluxes at splanchnic level measured in catheterized animals. Response equations were developed for intakes up to 41 g DM intake/kg BW per day of diets varying from 0 to 100 g of concentrate/100 g DM in the absence of additives. The net hepatic uptake of propionate, α-amino-N and l-lactate was linearly and better related to their net portal appearance (NPA) than to their afferent hepatic flux. Blood flow data were corrected for lack of deacetylation of the para-aminohippuric acid, and this correction was shown to impact the response equations. To develop response equations between the availability of precursors (portal appearance and hepatic uptake) and net glucose hepatic release, missing data on precursor fluxes were predicted from dietary characteristics using previously developed response equations. Net hepatic release of glucose was curvilinearly related to hepatic supply and uptake of the sum of precursors, suggesting a lower conversion rate of precursors at high precursor supply. Factors of variation were explored for the linear portion of this relationship, which applied to NPA of precursors ranging from 0.99 to 9.60 mmol C/kg BW per h. Hepatic release of glucose was shown to be reduced by the portal absorption of glucose from diets containing bypass starch and to be increased by an increased uptake of β-hydroxybutyrate indicative of higher body tissue mobilization. These relationships were affected by the physiological status of the animals. In conclusion, we established equations that quantify the net release of glucose by the liver from the net availability of precursors. They provide a quantitative overview of factors regulating hepatic glucose synthesis in ruminants. These equations can be linked with the predictions of portal absorption of nutrients from intake and dietary characteristics, and provide indications of glucose synthesis from dietary characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3ablood flow 3adatabases 3aglucose 3alactic acid 3aliver 3ameta-analysis 3aphysiological state 3apropionic acid 3aruminants 3astarch 0anutrient flux 0agluconeogenesis1 aNozière, P.1 aVernet, J.1 aLapierre, H.1 aBahloul, L.1 aAl-Jammas, M.1 aSauvant, D.1 aOrtigues-Marty, I.0 tAnimal.g2020 July, v. 14, no. 7 p.1422-1437dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl3938811x1751-732X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17517311190034103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03058naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001800141245010200159500001400261520166800275592002801943650003401971650001402005650001402019650001102033650001702044650001502061650000902076650001602085650000902101650002002110650001602130650000902146650001402155650001902169650001502188700002402203700003102227700002802258700002202286700001902308700002402327700002002351773012102371856007502492852000902567655001202576IND60711611620221123020432.0200928e20200910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071161162DNAL7 a10.3390/ani100916152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUzar, Tomasz 10aCongenital Malformations in a Holstein-Fresian Calf with a Unique Mosaic Karyotype: A Case Report  aNAL-light  aA Holstein-Fresian calf with multiple congenital malformations was subjected postmortem to anatomical and genetic investigation. The calf was small (20 kg), had shortened limbs and was unable to stand up. It lived only 44 days. Detailed anatomical investigation revealed the following features: head asymmetry, the relocation of the frontal sinus and eye orbits, hypoplastic thymus without neck part, ductus Botalli, unfinished obliteration in umbilical arteries, and a bilateral series of tooth germs in the temporal region. Cytogenetic examination, performed on in vitro cultured fibroblasts, showed a unique mosaic karyotype with a marker chromosome—60,XX[9 2%]/60,XX,+mar[8%], which was for the first time described in cattle. No other chromosome abnormalities indicating chromosome instabilities, like chromatid breaks or gaps were identified, thus teratogenic agent exposure during pregnancy was excluded. The marker chromosome (mar) was small and it was not possible to identify its origin, however, sequential DAPI/C (4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) band staining revealed a large block of constitutive heterochromatin, which is characteristic for centromeric regions of bovine autosomes. We suppose that the identified marker chromosome was a result of somatic deletion in an autosome and its presence could be responsible for the observed developmental malformations. In spite of the topographic distance among the affected organs, we expected a relationship between anatomical abnormalities. To the of our best knowledge, this is the first case of a mosaic karyotype with a cell line carrying a small marker chromosome described in a malformed calf.  aPublisher supplied data 3a4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole 3aasymmetry 3aautosomes 3acalves 3acase studies 3acell lines 3aeyes 3afibroblasts 3ahead 3aheterochromatin 3akaryotyping 3aneck 3apregnancy 3ateratogenicity 3atopography1 aSzczerbal, Izabela 1 aSerwanska-Leja, Katarzyna 1 aNowacka-Woszuk, Joanna 1 aGogulski, Maciej 1 aBugaj, Szymon 1 aŚwitoński, Marek,1 aKomosa, Marcin 0 tAnimals.g2020 Sept. 10, v. 10, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani100916153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02899naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245013700177300001600314520147800330592002801808650000801836650001301844650001201857650001401869650001701883650001901900650002201919650000901941650002301950650001101973650001601984650002102000650001702021650001602038653002502054653001202079653001102091653002102102653000802123653001402131700001802145700001902163700001602182773011202198856008602310852000902396655001202405IND60600224920221121022648.0180703e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060022492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2014.03.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPantaleo, Antonio M.10aIntegration of biomass into urban energy systems for heat and power. Part II: Sensitivity assessment of main techno-economic factors  ap. 362-376.  aThe paper presents the application of a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) methodology to optimize multi-biomass and natural gas supply chain strategic design for heat and power generation in urban areas. The focus is on spatial and temporal allocation of biomass supply, storage, processing, transport and energy conversion (heat and CHP) to match the heat demand of residential end users. The main aim lies on the assessment of the trade-offs between centralized district heating plants and local heat generation systems, and on the decoupling of the biomass processing and biofuel energy conversion steps. After a brief description of the methodology, which is presented in detail in Part I of the research, an application to a generic urban area is proposed. Moreover, the influence of energy demand typologies (urban areas energy density, heat consumption patterns, buildings energy efficiency levels, baseline energy costs and available infrastructures) and specific constraints of urban areas (transport logistics, air emission levels, space availability) on the selection of optimal bioenergy pathways for heat and power is assessed, by means of sensitivity analysis. On the basis of these results, broad considerations about the key factors influencing the use of bioenergy into urban energy systems are proposed. Potential further applications of this model are also described, together with main barriers for development of bioenergy routes for urban areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3abuildings 3aenergy costs 3aenergy density 3aenergy efficiency 3aheat 3alinear programming 3amodels 3anatural gas 3apower generation 3asupply chain 3aurban areas 0aUrban energy systems 0aBiomass 0aPellet 0aDistrict heating 0aCHP 0aLogistics1 aGiarola, Sara1 aBauen, Ausilio1 aShah, Nilay0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2014 July, v. 83 p.362-376dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2014.03.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02962naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245015600174300001600330500001500346520157300361592002801934650001801962650001601980650000901996650001402005650001602019650002702035650001702062650002502079650002402104650001702128650001302145650002102158650001602179650003202195650003502227650002202262653000902284700003402293700002002327773010002347856004802447852000902495655001202504IND50063354220221119055305.0130324e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006335422DNAL7 a10.1007/s10499-012-9583-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAzarm, Hamid Mohammadi10aGrowth response and fatty acid composition of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) fry fed diets containing different levels of soybean and egg lecithin  ap. 497-509.  a2019-12-06  aWe investigated the effect of soybean and chicken egg lecithin on the growth performance, fatty acid profile and body composition of rainbow trout fry. Seven isonitrogenous and isolipidic diets were prepared by replacing 0, 2, 4 and 6 % soybean and egg lecithin instead of soybean oil in diets. Trout fry with initial average weight 120 ± 4.08 mg were randomly distributed in twenty-one 90-L tanks. Triplicate groups (165 fish per tank) of fry were fed to visual satiation at six meals per day for 40 days. Incorporation of 2 and 4 % egg lecithin led to increase in final weight, specific growth rate and weight gain compared with control group. Also, 4 % soybean lecithin had moderate effects on growth performance of fry. The fatty acid compositions of fry were influenced by dietary fatty acid. Fish fed egg lecithin showed higher amount of monounsaturated fatty acid than soybean lecithin and control groups. Fry fed soybean lecithin had significantly higher levels of polyunsaturated and n-6 fatty acid than egg lecithin and control groups. Soybean and egg lecithin induced higher amount of highly unsaturated fatty acid in lecithin groups compared with control group. The lipid and ash content of whole-body tissues were positively affected by percentages of soybean and egg lecithin in the diets. So 6 % soybean and egg lecithin induced higher amounts of lipid and ash body content. The results of our study indicated that dietary egg lecithin had growth-promoting effect, and rainbow trout fry had moderate lecithin requirement (at least 2 % as fed).  aPublisher supplied data 3alipid content 3aweight gain 3adiet 3afish eggs 3asoybean oil 3afatty acid composition 3achicken eggs 3aphosphatidylcholines 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3alipid bodies 3asoybeans 3abody composition 3aash content 3amonounsaturated fatty acids 3ahighly unsaturated fatty acids 3aaquaculture tanks 0aeggs1 aAbedian-Kenari, Abdolmohammad1 aHedayati, Mehdi0 tAquaculture international.g2013 Apr., v. 21, no. 2 p.497-509dSpringer-Verlagx0967-61207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10499-012-9583-8  aDNAL 7aarticle02280naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245011800162300001500280520117800295592002801473650002401501650001601525650002601541650001901567650001901586650002401605650001301629651001301642651002601655700002101681700002501702773011601727856007801843852000901921655001201930IND60131611020221120171054.0151127e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013161102DNAL7 a10.3398/064.074.01102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHicks, Julia J.10aPresence of the Exotic Weevil Rhinocyllus conicus Fröelich at High Elevations in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado  ap. 99-107.  aWe examined the presence of the exotic weevil Rhinocyllus conicus Fröelich on native thistles at high elevations in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. We tested whether the distribution of R. conicus was related to elevation by performing 2 separate studies. First, transects along an elevation gradient were sampled in Rocky Mountain National Park and presence/absence of R. conicus was scored to infer relationships between environmental variables and weevil occurrence. Second, an experiment was conducted on Niwot Ridge to determine whether weevils were able to complete their reproductive cycle and overwinter at an elevation where they do not currently exist. Results of a logistic regression indicated that R. conicus presence was negatively correlated with elevation. In addition, weevils successfully reproduced at tree line, but climatic limitations suppressed their ongoing presence at this site. The ability of the weevils to utilize native thistles at tree line was unknown prior to this experiment, and our results suggest that within the context of climate warming, the range of R. conicus could expand to include more native alpine thistles in North America.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhinocyllus conicus 3acorrelation 3aenvironmental factors 3aglobal warming 3anational parks 3aregression analysis 3atreeline 3aColorado 3aRocky Mountain region1 aBeatty, Susan W.1 aSeastedt, Timothy R.0 tWestern North American naturalist.g2013 Dec., v. 74, no. 1 p.99-107dBrigham Young Universityx1527-09047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3398%2F064.074.01103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02183naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245008900172300001600261520100000277592002801277650002101305650002001326650001601346650001201362650001501374650001901389650001501408650002101423650002901444650002001473700005901493700006301552773011401615856008301729852000901812655001201821IND60721955720221119233548.0211129e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072195572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cois.2020.12.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVandenhole, Marilou10aShort term transcriptional responses of P450s to phytochemicals in insects and mites  ap. 117-127.  aCytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) play a key role in the detoxification of phytochemicals in arthropod herbivores. We present here an overview of recent progress in understanding the breadth and specificity of gene expression plasticity of P450s in response to phytochemicals. We discuss experimental setups and new findings in mechanisms of P450 regulation. Whole genome transcriptomic analysis of arthropod herbivores, either after direct administration of phytochemicals or after host plant shifts, allowed to integrate various levels of chemical complexity and lead to the unbiased identification of responsive P450 genes. However, despite progress in identification of inducible P450s, the link between induction and metabolism is still largely unexplored, and to what extent the overall response is biologically functional should be further investigated. In the near future, such studies will be more straightforward as forward and reverse genetic tools become more readily available.  aPublisher supplied data 3acytochrome P-450 3agene expression 3ahost plants 3ainsects 3ametabolism 3aphytochemicals 3aplasticity 3areverse genetics 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptomics1 aDermauw, Wannes1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4612-89691 aVan Leeuwen, Thomas1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4651-830X0 tCurrent opinion in insect science.g2021 Feb., v. 43 p.117-127dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23301x2214-57457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cois.2020.12.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02893naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005300146245010600199300001800305520132500323592002801648596010701676596011901783650000801902650001401910650001201924650002801936650001901964650002501983650001102008650002202019650001902041653002302060653002302083653002402106700001302130700005602143700006102199773012202260856008002382852000902462655001202471IND60655107920221119090254.0190730e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065510792DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175188074532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Hua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5767-031810aObtaining the thermal resistance of air enclosed at the interface of multilayer fabrics by simulation  ap. 3178-3188.  aAn air layer enclosed at the interface was largely responsible for the insulation results of multilayer fabrics obtained from experiments. In this study, a three-dimensional finite element method model, in which the air layer enclosed at the interface of multilayer fabrics was ignored, was developed to calculate the fabric thermal resistance, and the result obtained from the fabric model was independent of the air. A Thermolab II Tester KES-F7 was also used to measure the thermal resistance of fabrics, and the experimental results were influenced by the air layer. By comparing the simulation and experimental result, the air layer thermal resistance was determined, and then an estimating equation, which can be used to estimate the fabric and air layer thermal resistance for multilayer fabrics, was proposed. The results suggested that the surface roughness of fabrics was strongly related to the air layer thermal resistance, with a linear relationship between them. Moreover, for multiple layers stacked by different fabrics, the air layer thermal resistance at the interface was mainly decided by the fabric with the rougher surface. An estimating equation was also developed to predict the thermal resistance of multilayer fabrics and good correlation between predicted and experimental values was observed.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016QK034cGeneral Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine Technology Project  aNSFC 51673036cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809 3aair 3aequations 3afabrics 3afinite element analysis 3aheat tolerance 3ainsulating materials 3amodels 3asurface roughness 3atextile fibers 0athermal resistance 0amultilayer fabrics 0aheterogeneous model1 aTu, Lexi1 aYan, Xiaofei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3183-37881 aSukigara, Sachiko1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6368-75810 tTextile research journal.g2019 Aug., v. 89, no. 15 p.3178-3188dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x1746-77487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175188074533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03311naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100001800185245018500203300001800388506007600406520138800482592002801870506003701898650001501935650002001950650002801970650001601998650001402014650001502028650001702043650002002060650002802080650001702108650001602125650001402141650004302155650002102198650002502219650001602244650001702260700002502277700002102302700002002323700001802343700002302361700002002384700001902404700001702423700002002440700003302460700002302493773010602516856007802622852000902700655001202709IND60347075720221207140333.0150812e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034707572DNAL7 a10.1002/mnfr.2014007452doi7 aPMC50330092pmcid7 a259883742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBohn, Torsten10aMind the gap—deficits in our knowledge of aspects impacting the bioavailability of phytochemicals and their metabolites—a position paper focusing on carotenoids and polyphenols  ap. 1307-1323.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aVarious secondary plant metabolites or phytochemicals, including polyphenols and carotenoids, have been associated with a variety of health benefits, such as reduced incidence of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and several types of cancer, most likely due to their involvement in ameliorating inflammation and oxidative stress. However, discrepancies exist between their putative effects when comparing observational and intervention studies, especially when using pure compounds. These discrepancies may in part be explained by differences in intake levels and their bioavailability. Prior to exerting their bioactivity, these compounds must be made bioavailable, and considerable differences may arise due to their matrix release, changes during digestion, uptake, metabolism, and biodistribution, even before considering dose‐ and host‐related factors. Though many insights have been gained on factors affecting secondary plant metabolite bioavailability, many gaps still exist in our knowledge. In this position paper, we highlight several major gaps in our understanding of phytochemical bioavailability, including effects of food processing, changes during digestion, involvement of cellular transporters in influx/efflux through the gastrointestinal epithelium, changes during colonic fermentation, and their phase I and phase II metabolism following absorption.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabsorption 3abioavailability 3acardiovascular diseases 3acarotenoids 3adigestion 3aepithelium 3afermentation 3afood processing 3agastrointestinal system 3ainflammation 3ametabolites 3aneoplasms 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aoxidative stress 3aphytopharmaceuticals 3apolyphenols 3atransporters1 aMcDougall, Gordon J.1 aAlegría, Amparo1 aAlminger, Marie1 aArrigoni, Eva1 aAura, Anna‐Marja1 aBrito, Catarina1 aCilla, Antonio1 aEl, Sedef N.1 aKarakaya, Sibel1 aMartínez‐Cuesta, Marie C.1 aSantos, Claudia N.0 tMolecular nutrition & food research.g2015 July, v. 59, no. 7 p.1307-1323dWiley-VCHx1613-41257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mnfr.2014007453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01196naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245015800157300001800315520021400333592002800547650002300575650002700598650002300625650001400648700001400662700001200676773013400688856007500822852000900897655001200906IND60659025420221120230032.0190827e20110726xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065902542DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc12747k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Xiaolin13aAn unexpected palladium-catalyzed reaction of 2-alkynylhalobenzene with 2-alkynylaniline: a novel and efficient route to 11H-indeno[1,2-c]quinolin-11-ols  ap. 8967-8969.  aAn unexpected palladium-catalyzed cascade reaction of 2-alkynylhalobenzene with 2-alkynylaniline is reported, which provides a novel and efficient pathway for the synthesis of 11H-indeno[1,2-c]quinolin-11-ols.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3achemical communication 3achemical reactions 3apalladium1 aLuo, Yong1 aWu, Jie0 tChemical communications.g2011 July 26, v. 47, no. 31 p.8967-8969dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1cc12747k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02393naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245015600166300001800322520110500340592002801445650002301473650002101496650001101517650000901528650001201537650001401549650001201563650002301575650001401598650001301612650001401625650001301639650002701652650001001679700002101689700002401710700001501734773013401749856007901883852000901962655001201971IND60580659220221118022051.0170925e20170621xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058065922DNAL7 a10.1139/cjfas-2016-05322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOresland, Vidar,10aRecorded captures of American lobster (Homarus americanus) in Swedish waters and an observation of predation on the European lobster (Homarus gammarus)  ap. 1503-1506.  aThe intentional or unintentional release of American lobsters (Homarus americanus), imported through the European seafood trade, has resulted in findings of H. americanus in European waters. A total of 36 specimens was recorded within a smaller area, halfway along the Swedish west coast, between 2008 and 2016. The lobsters were caught by both recreational and professional fishermen and delivered to the Institute of Marine Research in Lysekil, where species identification, measurements, and genetic sampling were performed. Twenty-five of these lobsters were caught inside the sill of the Gullmar Fjord, most of them close to Lysekil harbor, where escapes from an illegal holding is suspected. Six females had eggs, which in two cases were hybrids. While there is no evidence to suggest that a population has been established in the Gullmar Fjord or elsewhere in Swedish waters, serious concerns must be raised regarding the possible consequences for the native species. An American lobster has for the first time been filmed eating a killed European lobster (Homarus gammarus) in Swedish waters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHomarus americanus 3aHomarus gammarus 3acoasts 3aeggs 3afemales 3afishermen 3ahybrids 3aindigenous species 3aingestion 3alobsters 3apredation 3aseafoods 3aspecies identification 3atrade1 aUlmestrand, Mats1 aAgnalt, Ann-Lisbeth1 aOxby, Gert0 tCanadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences.g2017 June 21, v. 74, no. 10 p.1503-1506dNRC Research Pressx1205-75337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2016-05323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02040naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245008100162300001600243520088500259592002801144650002401172650001301196650001201209650001501221650001001236650001201246650001401258650001001272650001301282650002501295650001901320650001301339651001701352700002201369700002001391773011701411856007801528961001501606852000901621655001201630IND60131611320221120171040.0151127e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013161132DNAL7 a10.3398/064.074.01132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLinz, George M.14aThe Influence of Breeding Experience on Nest Success in Red-Winged Blackbird  ap. 123-129.  aThe Red-winged Blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus) is a polygynous species, and females are typically responsible for the majority of parental care. Despite their limited involvement, males can contribute to reproduction through nest defense and the feeding of nestlings. Some aspects of nest defense may be learned, and older males are more likely to feed young, suggesting that males with previous breeding experience may enjoy higher nest success than their naïve counterparts. We manipulated territory ownership on 10 wetlands in central North Dakota in order to examine the influence of breeding experience on reproductive success. We found no evidence that breeding experience increased nest survival (= 23.0%) or increased the number of fledglings per nest (= 2.2). In this population, territory quality may contribute more to nesting success than male parental contributions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgelaius phoeniceus 3abreeding 3afemales 3afledglings 3amales 3anesting 3anestlings 3anests 3apolygyny 3areproductive success 3aterritoriality 3awetlands 3aNorth Dakota1 aSawin, Richard S.1 aLutman, Mark W.0 tWestern North American naturalist.g2013 Dec., v. 74, no. 1 p.123-129dBrigham Young Universityx1527-09047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3398%2F064.074.01133Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/APHIS  aDNAL 7aarticle02671naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006300140245013100203300001800334500001100352520117900363592002801542596005701570596006401627650001701691650002501708650001701733650000901750650001401759650001401773650001101787650002401798650002301822650001601845650000901861650002501870700006001895700005801955773015202013856007502165852000902240655001202249IND60777700420221118045629.0220519e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077770042DNAL7 a10.1111/ijfs.157402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Jatinder Pal1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0049-091110aPolyphenols in fig: a review on their characterisation, biochemistry during ripening, antioxidant activity and health benefits  ap. 3333-3342.  aREVIEW  aFig fruit (consumed either fresh or dried) is a rich source of polyphenols distributed throughout its peel and pulp. However, the peel part is superior in diversity of these compounds in comparison to the pulp. Fig polyphenols have been extracted both by conventional solid–liquid extraction and novel assisted methods (mainly ultrasound‐assisted and microwave‐assisted procedures). These can be characterised primarily into flavonoids (anthocyanins, flavan‐3‐ols and various flavonol glycosides) and phenolic acids. Figs contain good levels of anthocyanins (such as cyanidin‐3‐O‐glucoside, cyanidin‐3,5‐diglucoside and cyanidin‐3‐O‐rutinoside) which impart different colouring hues to these fruits during the ripening process. Moreover, fig polyphenols have associated antioxidant activities and impart many health benefits such as antihyperglycaemic, hepatoprotective and antispasmodic activities. This review provides a thorough information on the fig polyphenols, stressing on their extraction, characterisation as well as quantification, the biochemical changes during the ripening process, associated antioxidant activity and health benefits.  aPublisher supplied data  cScience and Engineering Research Board (SERB), India  cCouncil of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), India 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3afigs 3aflavanols 3aflavonols 3afruits 3amicrowave treatment 3aparasympatholytics 3apolyphenols 3apulp 3aultrasonic treatment1 aSingh, Balwinder1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7114-61791 aKaur, Amritpal1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2976-99400 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2022 June, v. 57, no. 6 p.3333-3342dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl41365x0950-54237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ijfs.157403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02218naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002200141245011300163500001400276520126600290592002801556650002401584650001101608650001901619650001601638700001801654700001801672700002101690773012101711856007501832852000901907655001201916IND60711611920221123003805.0200928e20200910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071161192DNAL7 a10.3390/ani100916182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiró, Francisco 10aMaxillary Incisors of the Horse before and at the Beginning of the Teeth Shedding: Radiographic and CT Study  aNAL-light  aTo gain insight into the radiographic appearance of maxillary deciduous incisors and dental germs of maxillary permanent incisors in the period prior to teeth shedding, radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of 25 horse skulls, with an estimated age of between 12 and 42 months, were studied. Data regarding morphology and development were obtained. Dental germs of first maxillary permanent incisors were identified radiographically as rounded radiolucent areas at the level of the apical parts of the first deciduous incisors, in skulls with an estimated age of twelve months. The first sign of crown mineralization of these dental germs appeared in skulls supposedly a few months older. Before teeth shedding, the unerupted, mineralized crowns of the first permanent incisor could be identified radiographically relatively caudal to the corresponding first deciduous incisors. The results of the present study indicate that radiographic intraoral images are suitable to identify the grade of development of the dental germs of maxillary permanent incisors. A detailed description of the radiographic appearance of deciduous incisors and dental germs of permanent incisors will help clinicians to expand their knowledge for diagnostic or treatment purposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputed tomography 3ahorses 3amineralization 3aradiography1 aManso, Carla 1 aDiz, Andrés 1 aNovales, Manuel 0 tAnimals.g2020 Sept. 10, v. 10, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani100916183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03296naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245013700163300001800300500001900318520171500337592002802052650001602080650001602096650001602112650001002128650003402138650001302172650001702185650002202202650003002224650002102254650001202275650002402287650002702311650003502338650002802373650001002401653002002411653001402431653001502445700001902460700001902479700001902498700001402517700001602531700001502547773011402562856008102676852000902757655001202766IND60699446620221119000421.0200618e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069944662DNAL7 a10.1017/S17517311200000992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCatillo, G.10aGenome-wide association study identifies quantitative trait loci regions involved in muscle acidic profile in Large White heavy pigs  ap. 1342-1350.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe widespread use of genome-wide association studies resulted in the discovery of genomic regions associated with fatty acid (FA) composition in different porcine tissues, but little information exists about the genes involved in FA composition of meat obtained from heavy pigs selected for the production of Italian dry-cured hams. To this objective, we genotyped with a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panel 795 Italian Large White heavy pigs to identify the markers and genomic regions associated with Semimembranosus muscle FA profile. Heritability estimates for intramuscular fat FA profile were of low-to-moderate magnitude, suggesting that these traits may be improved with genomic selection. On the whole, 45 SNPs were significantly associated with 14 FAs, and 4 of them (ALGA008109, ALGA0081097, CASI0010164 and SIRI0000267) were associated with more than 1 FA. The palmitoleic : palmitic and oleic : stearic ratios displayed the highest number of significant markers and the most significant associations (Bonferroni adjusted P < 5.00E−07). Of particular interest, the palmitoleic : palmitic ratio was strongly associated with markers located at 111 to 114 Mb on chromosome 14, in the same chromosomal region where Stearoyl-CoA desaturase Δ9 (SCD) gene is located. Several significant chromosomal regions were found; some of them harbour key genes playing pivotal roles in FA desaturation and elongation, such as SCD and some members of the Elongation of Very Long-Chain FA (ELOVL) gene family. The results suggest that the identification of causal mutations in these regions may provide a set of markers useful for selection schemes aimed at improving FA composition in pork products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLarge White 3achromosomes 3acured meats 3agenes 3agenome-wide association study 3agenomics 3aheritability 3aintramuscular fat 3amarker-assisted selection 3ameat composition 3amuscles 3aquantitative traits 3asemimembranosus muscle 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3astearoyl-CoA desaturase 3aswine 0agenetic markers 0aselection 0afatty acid1 aZappaterra, M.1 aZambonelli, P.1 aButtazzoni, L.1 aSteri, R.1 aMinelli, G.1 aDavoli, R.0 tAnimal.g2020 July, v. 14, no. 7 p.1342-1350dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl3938811x1751-732X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17517311200000993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02234naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245014900205300001600354500001500370520068500385592002801070650001401098650001401112650001901126650002301145650003101168650001701199650001301216650001001229653000801239653001201247653001001259653001101269653000801280653002301288653001101311653001801322653001901340653001101359653001001370653001101380653000901391700001901400700002401419700006101443773012101504856008201625852000901707655001201716IND60533215220221120062650.0160728e20150814xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053321522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.06.1422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshino, Yuki1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8077-030110aInhibition of invasion by glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta inhibitors through dysregulation of actin re-organisation via down-regulation of WAVE2  ap. 275-280.  a2019-12-06  aCancer cell invasion is a critical phenomenon in cancer pathogenesis. Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) has been reported to regulate cancer cell invasion both negatively and positively. Thus, the net effect of GSK-3β on invasion is unclear. In this report, we showed that GSK-3β inhibitors induced dysregulation of the actin cytoskeleton and functional insufficiency of focal adhesion, which resulted in suppressed invasion. In addition, WAVE2, an essential molecule for actin fibre branching, was down-regulated after GSK-3β inhibition. Collectively, we propose that the WAVE2-actin cytoskeleton axis is an important target of GSK-3β inhibitors in cancer cell invasion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aneoplasms 3abranching 3amicrofilaments 3atau-protein kinase 3aglycogen (starch) synthase 3apathogenesis 3aadhesion 3aactin 0aEMT 0aGSK-3β 0aWAVE2 0aN-WASP 0aMMP 0aActin cytoskeleton 0aIQGAP1 0acell invasion 0aFocal adhesion 0aARP2/3 0aCDC42 0aGSKi26 0aFAK11 aSuzuki, Manami1 aTakahashi, Hidekazu1 aIshioka, Chikashi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3023-12270 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2015 Aug. 14, v. 464 p.275-280dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.06.1423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01807naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245009800162300002000260520066000280592002800940650001600968650001500984650001100999650001201010650001701022650002301039650001701062700001501079700001601094700001601110700001901126700001701145700002001162700001801182773013001200856008201330852000901412655001201421IND60564276820221117184751.0170307e20150910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056427682DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b059402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTapley, Amy10aAssessing the Band Structure of CuInS2 Nanocrystals and Their Bonding with the Capping Ligand  ap. 20967-20974.  aCuInS₂ (CIS) nanocrystals (NCs) prepared optimally via a one-pot solvothermal method exhibit a high absorption coefficient and an ideal band gap for solar cell light-absorbing materials. We find that the initial Cu/In ratio in the synthesis determines the final composition of CIS, and this further dictates the photoelectrochemical performance of the CIS NC films. X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy excludes the presence of a secondary phase and suggests a difference in surface band bending and in ligand–CIS interaction. These findings will aid in optimizing the design of CIS NC films to achieve the highest possible photovoltaic efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aabsorption 3acopper 3aligands 3ananocrystals 3aphotovoltaic cells 3aspectroscopy1 aLiu, Lijia1 aCui, Xiaoyu1 aZuin, Lucia1 aLove, David A.1 aZhou, Jigang1 aSham, Tsun-Kong1 aDing, Zhifeng0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2015 Sept. 10, v. 119, no. 36 p.20967-20974dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.5b059403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03131naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024002800135040001800163100001800181245013100199300001600330506007600346520118700422592002801609506003701637650002501674650002501699650001701724650001301741650001001754650001801764650001401782650001901796650001301815650002701828650003001855650002601885650005201911650002601963650004601989650004002035650003102075650002402106653000802130653001302138653002602151653001802177653001902195653001102214700001802225700001602243700002002259700001702279700001802296773012002314856007402434852000902508655001202517IND60118897220221207094207.0141127e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011889722DNAL7 a232645182pmid7 aPMC35420532pmcid7 a10.1093/jxb/ers3602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJia, Chengguo10aMultiple phytohormone signalling pathways modulate susceptibility of tomato plants to Alternaria alternata f. sp. lycopersici   ap. 637-650.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThree phytohormone molecules – ethylene (ET), jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) – play key roles in mediating disease response to necrotrophic fungal pathogens. This study investigated the roles of the ET, JA, and SA pathways as well as their crosstalk during the interaction between tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) plants and a necrotrophic fungal pathogen Alternaria alternata f. sp. lycopersici (AAL). Both the ET and JASMONIC ACID INSENSITIVE1 (JAI1) receptor-dependent JA signalling pathways are necessary for susceptibility, while SA response promotes resistance to AAL infection. In addition, the role of JA in susceptibility to AAL is partly dependent on ET biosynthesis and perception, while the SA pathway enhances resistance to AAL and antagonizes the ET response. Based on these results, it is proposed that ET, JA, and SA each on their own can influence the susceptibility of tomato to AAL. Furthermore, the functions of JA and SA in susceptibility to the pathogen are correlated with the enhanced or decreased action of ET, respectively. This study has revealed the functional relationship among the three key hormone pathways in tomato defence against AAL.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAlternaria alternata 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3abiosynthesis 3aethylene 3afungi 3ajasmonic acid 3apathogens 3asalicylic acid 3atomatoes 2aAlternariaxphysiology 2aCyclopentanesximmunology 2aEthylenesximmunology 2aSolanum lycopersicumximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aOxylipinsximmunology 2aPlant Diseasesximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsximmunology 2aSalicylic Acidximmunology 2aSignal Transduction 0aAAL 0aethylene 0ahormonal interactions 0ajasmonic acid 0asalicylic acid 0atomato1 aZhang, Liping1 aLiu, Lihong1 aWang, Jiansheng1 aLi, Chuanyou1 aWang, Qiaomei0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2013 Jan., v. 64, no. 2 p.637-650dOxford University Press [etc.]x0022-09577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/ers3603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02437naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245013300164300001800297520135300315592002801668650002101696650001301717650001301730650000901743650002801752650001501780650001101795650001601806650001401822650001301836650001401849650001901863773010601882856007801988852000902066655001202075IND60347076220221118084933.0150812e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034707622DNAL7 a10.1002/mnfr.2014008712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsuda, Takanori10aPossible abilities of dietary factors to prevent and treat diabetes via the stimulation of glucagon‐like peptide‐1 secretion  ap. 1264-1273.  aThere is a pressing need for countermeasures against diabetes, which has increased in incidence, becoming a global issue. Glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1), a molecule secreted in enteroendocrine L cells in the lower small and large intestines, is thought to be one of the most important molecular targets for the prevention and treatment of diabetes. There has been increasing interest in the possible ability of dietary factors to treat diabetes via modulating GLP‐1 secretion. There is thought to be a close relationship between incretin and diet, and the purported best approach for using dietary factors to increase GLP‐1 activity is promotion of secretion of endogenous GLP‐1. It have been reported that nutrients as well as various non‐nutrient dietary factors can function as GLP‐1 secretogogues. Here, we present our findings on the GLP‐1 secretion‐stimulating functions of two dietary factors, curcumin and extract of edible sweet potato leaves, which contain caffeoylquinic acid derivatives. However, it is necessary to reveal in greater detail the stimulation of GLP‐1 secretion by dietary factors for preventing and treating diabetes. It is desirable to clarify the exact GLP‐1 secretory pathway, the effect of metabolites derived from dietary factors in gut lumen, and the relationship between incretin and meal.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorogenic acid 3acurcumin 3adiabetes 3adiet 3aglucagon-like peptide 1 3aintestines 3aleaves 3ametabolites 3anutrients 3asecretin 3asecretion 3asweet potatoes0 tMolecular nutrition & food research.g2015 July, v. 59, no. 7 p.1264-1273dWiley-VCHx1613-41257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mnfr.2014008713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02035naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005400148245007200202300001600274520087600290592002801166650001801194650001401212650002201226650001201248650002301260650001101283650001101294650001701305653000901322653002301331653002401354653002201378653001801400700001901418773012101437856008201558852000901640655001201649IND60533215320221120062753.0160728e20150814xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053321532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.06.1432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Rong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4053-365910aMolecular dynamics simulations of Na+ and leucine transport by LeuT  ap. 281-285.  aMolecular dynamics simulations are used to gain insight into the binding of Na+ and leucine substrate to the bacterial amino acid transporter LeuT, focusing on the crystal structures of LeuT in the outward-open and inward-open states. For both conformations of LeuT, a third Na+ binding site involving Glu290 in addition to the two sites identified from the crystal structures is observed. Once the negative charge from Glu290 in the inward-open LeuT is removed, the ion bound to the third site is ejected from LeuT rapidly, suggesting that the protonation state of Glu290 regulates Na+ binding and release. In Cl−-dependent transporters where Glu290 is replaced by a neutral serine, a Cl− ion would be required to replace the role of Glu290. Thus, the simulations provide insights into understanding Na+ and substrate transport as well as Cl−-independence of LeuT.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding sites 3achlorides 3acrystal structure 3aleucine 3amolecular dynamics 3aserine 3asodium 3atransporters 0aLeuT 0aMolecular dynamics 0aLeucine transporter 0aSubstrate binding 0aIon transport1 aChung, Shin-Ho0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2015 Aug. 14, v. 464 p.281-285dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.06.1433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01388naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245009100155300001800246520025900264592002800523650002300551650001300574650001100587650001500598650001600613650002100629700001600650700001600666700001600682700001700698700001400715700001600729700001500745700002600760773013300786856007400919852000900993655001201002IND60660225420221123022945.0190823e20140703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066022542DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc02919d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Cici10aCoordination reaction between tetraphenylporphyrin and nickel on a TiO₂(110) surface  ap. 8291-8294.  aIn situ metalation of tetraphenylporphyrin (2HTPP) (sub)monolayers with Ni on a TiO₂(110) surface to nickel(ii)-tetraphenylporphyrin (NiTPP) depends on temperature and order of deposition, and affects conformation and bonding geometry of the porphyrin.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3ageometry 3anickel 3aporphyrins 3atemperature 3atitanium dioxide1 aFan, Qitang1 aHu, Shanwei1 aJu, Huanxin1 aFeng, Xuefei1 aHan, Yong1 aPan, Haibin1 aZhu, Junfa1 aGottfried, J.

It can cause serious damage to the small intestine, which is the main absorption site of Cd and the primary target organ after oral administration. Our previous study found that zinc chelate of hydroxy analogue of methionine (Zn-HMTB), a new type of feed additive, decreased Cd accumulation in the liver and kidneys. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Zn-HMTB on Cd absorption and Cd-induced toxicity in the small intestine of piglets. Twenty-four piglets (Landrace × Large White, 13.22 ± 0.58 kg BW) were randomly divided into four dietary treatment groups: basal diet, and diets containing 30 mg/kg Cd from CdCl₂ and 0, 100 or 200 mg/kg Zn from Zn-HMTB. The experiment lasted 27 days. The feed intake and final BW of each piglet were recorded at the end of the experiment. Gastrointestinal (GI) tract tissue and samples of liver, kidney, spleen, heart, lung and longissimus muscle tissue and faeces were collected. The concentrations of Cd and metal trace elements in the GI tract and organs were analysed, as was the relative messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of inflammatory cytokines and metal element transporters in the small intestine, and epithelial apoptosis in the small intestine. The results showed that, compared with Cd-treated piglets, piglets in the Zn-HMTB and Cd cotreatment groups had less Cd deposition in the stomach, ileum, caecum, colon, liver, kidneys, spleen, lungs, heart and muscles (P < 0.05), and lower Cd concentrations in faeces (P < 0.05), suggesting that Zn-HMTB increased Cd absorption and the excretion of Cd in other forms (possibly urine). Zinc chelate of hydroxy analogue of methionine increased Zn deposition in the jejunum and the relative mRNA expression of divalent metal transporters 1 and zinc transporter 5 in the duodenum (P < 0.05), indicating that Zn-HMTB may promote the absorption and transportation of Cd and Zn together by upregulating metal element transporters. Competition between Zn and Cd may be responsible for accelerating Cd excretion. Furthermore, Zn-HMTB reduced Cd-induced apoptosis of enterocytes and inflammatory stimuli in the small intestine, suggesting that Zn-HMTB reduced Cd-induced toxicity to the small intestine. These results suggest that Zn-HMTB can be helpful in decreasing Cd accumulation in the GI tract and organs of piglets and relieving Cd-induced toxicity to the small intestine but cannot reduce the absorption of Cd.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLarge White 3aabsorption 3aapoptosis 3acadmium 3acecum 3acolon 3acytokines 3adiet 3adigestive tract 3adivalent metals 3aduodenum 3aenterocytes 3aexcretion 3afeces 3afeed additives 3afeed intake 3agene expression 3aheart 3aheavy metals 3aileum 3ajejunum 3akidneys 3alandraces 3aliver 3alongissimus muscle 3alungs 3amessenger RNA 3amethionine 3amuscle tissues 3anutritional intervention 3aoral administration 3apiglets 3aspleen 3astomach 3atoxicity 3atransportation 3aurine 3azinc 0apiglet 0asmall intestine 0ametal absorption1 aLiu, F.

Diet influences the composition of the BA pool. In the present study, we analyzed the impact of a dietary supplementation with a freeze-dried blueberry powder (BBP) on the fecal BA pool composition. The diet of 11 men and 13 women at risk of metabolic syndrome was supplemented with 50 g/day of BBP for 8 weeks, and feces were harvested before (pre) and after (post) BBP consumption. BAs were profiled using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. No significant changes in total BAs were detected when comparing pre- vs. post-BBP consumption samples. However, post-BBP consumption samples exhibited significant accumulations of glycine-conjugated BAs (p = 0.04), glycochenodeoxycholic (p = 0.01), and glycoursodeoxycholic (p = 0.01) acids, as well as a significant reduction (p = 0.03) in the secondary BA levels compared with pre-BBP feces. In conclusion, the fecal bileacidome is significantly altered after the consumption of BBP for 8 weeks. While additional studies are needed to fully understand the underlying mechanisms and physiological implications of these changes, our data suggest that the consumption of blueberries can modulate toxic BA elimination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abile 3abile acids 3ablueberries 3adietary supplements 3afeces 3afreeze drying 3aglucose 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3aimmunity 3ainflammation 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3alipid metabolism 3aliquid chromatography 3ametabolic syndrome 3arisk 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atoxicity1 aGarneau, Véronique 1 aTrottier, Jocelyn 1 aVerreault, Mélanie 1 aCouillard, Charles 1 aRoy, Denis 1 aMarette, André,1 aDrouin-Chartier, Jean-Philippe 1 aVohl, Marie-Claude 1 aBarbier, Olivier 0 tNutrients.g2022 Sept. 17, v. 14, no. 18dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu141838573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04022naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245017000160300001800330500001900348520259200367592002802959650002202987650002003009650001703029650001403046650001103060650002003071650003303091650000903124650001903133650001603152650001203168653002903180653001303209653001203222653001103234653001803245700001403263700001603277700001503293700001403308700001403322773011403336856008103450852000903531655001203540IND60699446920221119000357.0200618e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069944692DNAL7 a10.1017/S175173112000018X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGale, P.10aRisk assessment for recrudescence of avian influenza in caged layer houses following depopulation: the effect of cleansing, disinfection and dismantling of equipment  ap. 1536-1545.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFollowing an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) in a poultry house, control measures are put in place to prevent further spread. An essential part of the control measures based on the European Commission Avian Influenza Directive 2005/94/EC is the cleansing and disinfection (C&D) of infected premises. Cleansing and disinfection includes both preliminary and secondary C&D, and the dismantling of complex equipment during secondary C&D is also required, which is costly to the owner and also delays the secondary cleansing process, hence increasing the risk for onward spread. In this study, a quantitative risk assessment is presented to assess the risk of re-infection (recrudescence) occurring in an enriched colony-caged layer poultry house on restocking with chickens after different C&D scenarios. The risk is expressed as the number of restocked poultry houses expected before recrudescence occurs. Three C&D scenarios were considered, namely (i) preliminary C&D alone, (ii) preliminary C&D plus secondary C&D without dismantling and (iii) preliminary C&D plus secondary C&D with dismantling. The source-pathway-receptor framework was used to construct the model, and parameterisation was based on the three C&D scenarios. Two key operational variables in the model are (i) the time between depopulation of infected birds and restocking with new birds (TbDR) and (ii) the proportion of infected material that bypasses C&D, enabling virus to survive the process. Probability distributions were used to describe these two parameters for which there was recognised variability between premises in TbDR or uncertainty due to lack of information in the fraction of bypass. The risk assessment estimates that the median (95% credible intervals) number of repopulated poultry houses before recrudescence are 1.2 × 10⁴ (50 to 2.8 × 10⁶), 1.9 × 10⁵ (780 to 5.7 × 10⁷) and 1.1 × 10⁶ (4.2 × 10³ to 2.9 × 10⁸) under C&D scenarios (i), (ii) and (iii), respectively. Thus for HPAIV in caged layers, undertaking secondary C&D without dismantling reduces the risk by 16-fold compared to preliminary C&D alone. Dismantling has an additional, although smaller, impact, reducing the risk by a further 6-fold and thus around 90-fold compared to preliminary C&D alone. On the basis of the 95% credible intervals, the model demonstrates the importance of secondary C&D (with or without dismantling) over preliminary C&D alone. However, the extra protection afforded by dismantling may not be cost beneficial in the context of reduced risk of onward spread.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfluenza A virus 3aavian influenza 3adisinfection 3aequipment 3amodels 3apoultry housing 3aquantitative risk assessment 3arisk 3arisk reduction 3auncertainty 3aviruses 0anotifiable avian disease 0aoutbreak 0acontrol 0apolicy 0apoultry house1 aSechi, S.1 aHorigan, V.1 aTaylor, R.1 aBrown, I.1 aKelly, L.0 tAnimal.g2020 July, v. 14, no. 7 p.1536-1545dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl3938811x1751-732X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S175173112000018X3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02538naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245019400162520123800356592002801594650001501622650001201637650001601649650001401665650001501679650001401694650002201708650001201730650002201742650001101764650002201775700001901797700002101816700002001837700002401857700001601881700002301897773012401920856007502044852000902119655001202128IND60794292820221121030249.0220922e20220906xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079429282DNAL7 a10.3390/nu141836882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavies, Robert W.14aThe Effect of Fava Bean (Vicia faba L.) Protein Ingestion on Myofibrillar Protein Synthesis at Rest and after Resistance Exercise in Healthy, Young Men and Women: A Randomised Control Trial  aThe aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of feeding fava bean (Vicia faba L.) protein (FBP) on resting and post-exercise myofibrillar fractional synthetic rate (myoFSR). In a parallel, double-blind, randomised control trial, sixteen young, healthy recreationally active adults (age = 25 (5) years, body mass = 70 (15) kg, stature = 1.72 (0.11) m, mean (SD)) ingested 0.33 g·kg⁻¹ FBP (n = 8) or a negative control (CON, i.e., EAA-free mixture) (n = 8), immediately after a bout of unilateral knee-extensor resistance exercise. Plasma, saliva, and m. vastus lateralis muscle samples were obtained pre-ingestion and 3 h post-ingestion. MyoFSR was calculated via deuterium labelling of myofibrillar-bound alanine, measured by gas chromatography–pyrolysis–isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-Pyr-IRMS). Resistance exercise increased myoFSR (p = 0.012). However, ingestion of FBP did not evoke an increase in resting (FBP 29 [−5, 63] vs. CON 12 [−25, 49]%, p = 0.409, mean % change [95% CI]) or post-exercise (FBP 78 [33, 123]% vs. CON 58 [9, 107]%, p = 0.732) myoFSR. Ingestion of 0.33 g·kg⁻¹ of FBP does not appear to enhance resting or post-exercise myoFSR in young, healthy, recreationally active adults.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVicia faba 3aalanine 3abody weight 3adeuterium 3afaba beans 3aingestion 3amass spectrometry 3amuscles 3aprotein synthesis 3asaliva 3astrength training1 aKozior, Marta 1 aLynch, Arthur E.1 aBass, Joseph J.1 aAtherton, Philip J.1 aSmith, Ken 1 aJakeman, Philip M.0 tNutrients.g2022 Sept. 06, v. 14, no. 18dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu141836883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02879naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245016200163300001800325500002000343520137800363592002801741650001901769650001701788650001701805650002501822650001701847650000901864650001401873650001201887650001201899650002601911650001601937650001201953650001601965700002401981700002102005700002202026700001802048700002102066700006302087700002302150773015202173856007502325852000902400655001202409IND60777700920221118045328.0220519e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077770092DNAL7 a10.1111/ijfs.157132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBellachioma, Luisa10aValorisation of Crocus sativus flower parts for herbal infusions: impact of brewing conditions on phenolic profiling, antioxidant capacity and sensory traits  ap. 3838-3849.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSaffron production from Crocus sativus flowers produces large amounts of by‐products that may represent an excellent source of polyphenols. The aim of this work was to evaluate infusions originating from different brewing processes and from different saffron flower portions, in terms of both functional and sensory traits. For this aim, total polyphenols and total flavonoids, in vitro antioxidant assays and an untargeted phenolic profiling were applied. In general, tepals showed higher polyphenol and flavonoid content than stamen infusions, and their bioactive content depended more on brewing temperature than brewing time. These findings were consistent with both antioxidant capacity and phenolic profiling. Multivariate statistics highlighted polyphenols discriminating ‘boiled’ vs. ‘cold’ infusions, being mainly flavonoids, phenolic acids and the alkylphenol 5‐pentadecylresorcinol (showing a strong down‐accumulation at the higher brewing temperatures). Positive correlations could be highlighted between anthocyanins, flavones, flavonols and lignans, and the in vitro antioxidant assays. In general, cold brewing was successful in extracting phenolic compounds and provided better sensory properties, thus indicating that this may represent a valuable strategy to develop saffron‐based functional beverages with better consumers' acceptability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrocus sativus 3aalkylphenols 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acold 3aflavonols 3aflowers 3alignans 3amultivariate analysis 3apolyphenols 3asaffron 3atemperature1 aRocchetti, Gabriele1 aMorresi, Camilla1 aMartinelli, Erika1 aLucini, Luigi1 aFerretti, Gianna1 aDamiani, Elisabetta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7885-17831 aBacchetti, Tiziana0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2022 June, v. 57, no. 6 p.3838-3849dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl41365x0950-54237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ijfs.157133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02370naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100002600187245009400213300002000307506007600327520123100403592002801634506003701662650002301699650001901722650001601741650001601757700002001773700001801793773013001811856008201941852000902023655001202032IND60564277220221207083928.0170307e20150910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056427722DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b061102doi7 aPMC45685412pmcid7 a264011912pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aObersteiner, Veronika10aImpact of Anchoring Groups on Ballistic Transport: Single Molecule vs Monolayer Junctions  ap. 21198-21208.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTuning the transport properties of molecular junctions by chemically modifying the molecular structure is one of the key challenges for advancing the field of molecular electronics. In the present contribution, we investigate current–voltage characteristics of differently linked metal–molecule–metal systems that comprise either a single molecule or a molecular assembly. This is achieved by employing density functional theory in conjunction with a Green’s function approach. We show that the conductance of a molecular system with a specific anchoring group is fundamentally different depending on whether a single molecule or a continuous monolayer forms the junction. This is a consequence of collective electrostatic effects that arise from dipolar elements contained in the monolayer and from interfacial charge rearrangements. As a consequence of these collective effects, the “ideal” choice for an anchoring group is clearly different for monolayer and single molecule devices. A particularly striking effect is observed for pyridine-docked systems. These are subject to Fermi-level pinning at high molecular packing densities, causing an abrupt increase of the junction current already at small voltages.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achemical structure 3aelectric power 3aelectronics 3amethodology1 aEgger, David

A.10aMicelle Structure and Hydrophobic Hydration  ap. 10809-10815.  aDespite the ubiquity and utility of micelles self-assembled from aqueous surfactants, longstanding questions remain regarding their surface structure and interior hydration. Here we combine Raman spectroscopy with multivariate curve resolution (Raman-MCR) to probe the hydrophobic hydration of surfactants with various aliphatic chain lengths, and either anionic (carboxylate) or cationic (trimethylammonium) head groups, both below and above the critical micelle concentration. Our results reveal significant penetration of water into micelle interiors, well beyond the first few carbons adjacent to the headgroup. Moreover, the vibrational C-D frequency shifts of solubilized deuterated n-hexane confirm that it resides in a dry, oil-like environment (while the localization of solubilized benzene is sensitive to headgroup charge). Our findings imply that the hydrophobic core of a micelle is surrounded by a highly corrugated surface containing hydrated non-polar cavities whose depth increases with increasing surfactant chain length, thus bearing a greater resemblance to soluble proteins than previously recognized.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3abenzene 3ahexane 3ahydrophobicity 3amicelles 3aproteins 3asolubilization 3asurfactants1 aRankin, Blake M.1 aBen-Amotz, Dor0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2015 Aug. 26, v. 137, no. 33 p.10809-10815dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.5b066553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04358naa a2200769 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002800113040001800141100002100159245013100180300001600311520190300327592002802230650001602258650001802274650000802292650002002300650002102320650001202341650001602353650002602369650001602395650001202411650001002423650001302433650000902446650001802455650002302473650001202496650002502508650002302533650001402556650002102570650001102591650001502602650001802617650007302635650007502708650006902783650003802852650001602890650004602906650004202952650003802994653003203032653002203064653003703086653002003123653001503143653002003158653001503178653001903193700003403212700002903246700002003275700001903295700002003314700001803334700002103352773012003373856007403493852000903567655001203576IND60118897520221119160403.0141127e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011889752DNAL7 a233079182pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/ers3632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHébrard, Claire10aIdentification of differentially methylated regions during vernalization revealed a role for RNA methyltransferases in bolting  ap. 651-663.  aSugar beet (Beta vulgaris altissima) is a biennial root crop with an absolute requirement for cold exposure to bolt and flower, a process called vernalization. Global DNA methylation variations have been reported during vernalization in several plants. However, few genes targeted by DNA methylation during vernalization have been described. The objectives of this study were to identify differentially methylated regions and to study their involvement in bolting induction and tolerance. Restriction landmark genome scanning was applied to DNA from shoot apical meristems of sugar beet genotypes, providing a direct quantitative epigenetic assessment of several CG methylated genes without prior knowledge of gene sequence. Several differentially methylated regions exhibiting variations of gene-body DNA methylation and expression during cold exposure and/or between genotypes were identified, including an AROGENATE DEHYDRATASE and two RNA METHYLCYTOSINE TRANSFERASE sequences. One RNA METHYLCYTOSINE TRANSFERASE sequence displayed gene-body hypermethylation and activation of expression, while the other was hypomethylated and inhibited by cold exposure. Global RNA methylation and phenolic compound levels changed during cold exposure in a genotype-dependent way. The use of methyl RNA immunoprecipitation of total RNA and reverse transcription–PCR analysis revealed mRNA methylation in a vernalized bolting-resistant genotype for the FLOWERING LOCUS 1 gene, a repressor of flowering. Finally, Arabidopsis mutants for RNA METHYLCYTOSINE TRANSFERASE and AROGENATE DEHYDRATASE were shown to exhibit, under different environmental conditions, early or late bolting phenotypes, respectively. Overall, the data identified functional targets of DNA methylation during vernalization in sugar beet, and it is proposed that RNA methylation and phenolic compounds play a role in the floral transition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aBeta vulgaris 3aDNA 3aDNA methylation 3aapical meristems 3abolting 3acold stress 3aenvironmental factors 3aepigenetics 3aflowers 3agenes 3agenotype 3aloci 3amessenger RNA 3amethyltransferases 3amutants 3anucleotide sequences 3aphenolic compounds 3aphenotype 3aprecipitin tests 3ashoots 3asugar beet 3avernalization 2aArabidopsisxenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aBeta vulgarisxenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aFlowersxenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aMethylation 2aMethyltransferasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Plantxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aArabidopsis thaliana mutant 0abolting tolerance 0adifferentially methylated region 0aDNA methylation 0aepigenetic 0aRNA methylation 0asugar beet 0avernalization.1 aTrap-Gentil, Marie-Véronique1 aLafon-Placette, Clément1 aDelaunay, Alain1 aJoseph, Claude1 aLefebvre, Marc,1 aBarnes, Steve1 aMaury, Stéphane0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2013 Jan., v. 64, no. 2 p.651-663dOxford University Press [etc.]x0022-09577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/ers3633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02722naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245013300169300001500302520154700317592002801864650001501892650001701907650001601924650002001940650002501960650001101985650001601996653001502012653002302027653001002050653000902060653002202069653002302091700001602114773011102130856008602241852000902327655001202336IND60600225820221121043802.0180703e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060022582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2014.03.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShayeghi, H.10aProfit enhancement by a set of performance and robustness indices based design of dual-dimensional PODC and PSS2B in smart grids  ap. 99-109.  aExpansion of power systems is accompanied by innovations in smart grid solutions to power system operation and control. Profit enhancement by power oscillation damping controllers (PODC) and acceleration based power system stabilizer (PSS), model PSS2B, designed by the idea of pseudo-spectra based on multi-objective optimization is presented. The contribution of multi-objective functions in respect of performance and robustness criteria in stability enhancement is evaluated by considering the control actions of PODC and PSS2B as an ancillary service (AS). The robustness requirement is achieved by using the idea of pseudo-spectra to handle the changes of power system parameters and time delay introduced by processing of remote signals in the wide-area supplementary damping controller (WASDC). The weighted sum of six objective functions as performance and robustness criteria is selected as low-frequency oscillation damping index (LFODI). Two scenarios for the evaluation of small signal stability as an AS provided by PODC and PSS2B are considered. A multi-objective optimization approach based on LFODI, generation costs is formulated and improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (INSGA-II) is employed to solve this problem. Fuzzy decision making (FDM) is used to find the best compromise solution from the set of Pareto-solution obtained by INSGA-II. Comparative analysis of the results of the conventional method and the proposed design method is presented by case study on a modified 2-area 4-machine power system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acase studies 3acontrollers 3adecision making 3aelectrical equipment 3amodels 3astabilizers 0aSmart grid 0aElectricity market 0aWSADC 0aPODC 0aAncillary service 0aProfit enhancement1 aHashemi, Y.0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2014 July, v. 83 p.99-109dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2014.03.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02254naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005800152245013500210300001600345520110200361592002801463650001501491650002301506650001101529650001401540650001701554653002101571653002301592653002001615653002801635653002101663700001301684773011201697856008601809852000901895655001201904IND60600225920221121043745.0180703e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060022592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2014.03.0652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Weidong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8954-880310aDevelopment of an analytical method and its quick algorithm to calculate the solar energy collected by a heliostat field in a year  ap. 110-118.  aIn this paper, we firstly propose an analytical equation to calculate the energy collected by the heliostat field. A ray tracing method is developed based on the analytical equation. Then we introduce three approximations to reduce computation spending, and estimate the errors caused by these approximations. A fast and accurate algorithm is developed with the three approximations to calculate the energy collected by the heliostat field over a year. It was compared with the ray tracing results, which shows good consistency with them. With the method, the energy collected and efficiency of each heliostat in a year can be computed exactly and rapidly, the difference between the method and ray tracing method is less than 0.1% for the energy collected by a heliostat over a day. It needs only about 0.1% computation time used by ray tracing method to calculate the intercept factor of a heliostat at a moment, and 2.67h to compute the annual collected energy of PS10 heliostat field by using one CPU of i3 processor when the time span for integration is 5min and each heliostat is calculated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aanalytical methods 3aenergy 3aequations 3asolar energy 0aNumerical method 0aRay tracing method 0aHeliostat field 0aAnnual collected energy 0aPS10 tower field1 aXu, Qian0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2014 July, v. 83 p.110-118dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2014.03.0653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02530naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245010400160300001400264500001900278500002000297520129400317592002801611650002001639650002001659650001701679650003001696650001901726650001401745650002001759650001001779700002001789700003001809700002501839700006001864773013801924856007302062852000902135655001202144IND60679253820221121002518.0191221e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067925382DNAL7 a10.1111/jbg.124472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeishaar, Ramona10aSelecting the hologenome to breed for an improved feed efficiency in pigs—A novel selection index  ap. 14-22.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMost traits in animal breeding, including feed efficiency traits in pigs, are affected by many genes with small effect and have a moderately high heritability between 0.1 and 0.5, which enables efficient selection. Since the microbiota composition in the gastrointestinal tract is also partly heritable and was shown to have a substantial effect on feed efficiency, the host genes affect the phenotype not only directly by altering metabolic pathways, but also indirectly by changing the microbiota composition. The effect mi of the microbiota composition on the breeding value gi of an animal i is the conditional expectation of its breeding value, given the vector φi with microbiota frequencies, that is mi=Egi|φi. The breeding value gi of an animal can therefore be decomposed into a heritable contribution mi that arises from an altered microbiota composition and a heritable contribution pi that arises from altered metabolic pathways within the animal, so gi=mi+pi. Instead of selecting for breeding value g^i, an index comprising the two components m^i and p^i with appropriate weights, that is Ii=λ1m^i+λ2p^i, can be used. The present study shows how this breeding strategy can be applied in pig genomic selection breeding scheme for two feed efficiency traits and daily gain.  aPublisher supplied data 3adigestive tract 3afeed conversion 3aheritability 3amarker-assisted selection 3amicroorganisms 3aphenotype 3aselection index 3aswine1 aWellmann, Robin1 aCamarinha‐Silva, Amelia1 aRodehutscord, Markus1 aBennewitz, Jörn1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6450-11600 tJournal of animal breeding and genetics.g2020 Jan., v. 137, no. 1 p.14-22dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57793x0931-26687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jbg.124473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03951naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024002800135040001800163100002000181245010900201300001600310500001500326506007600341520192800417592002802345506003702373650001402410650001702424650001702441650001802458650003102476650002202507650001502529650001602544650001102560650001902571650001602590650001102606650001202617650002802629650003002657650002002687650002602707650003102733650004002764650002402804650002602828650001902854650004202873650003902915653001302954653001202967653002902979653001703008653003103025700002103056700002103077773012003098856007403218852000903292655001203301IND60118897620221207092600.0141127e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011889762DNAL7 a232645192pmid7 aPMC35420562pmcid7 a10.1093/jxb/ers3642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNabity, Paul D.10aHerbivore induction of jasmonic acid and chemical defences reduce photosynthesis in Nicotiana attenuata   ap. 685-694.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHerbivory initiates a shift in plant metabolism from growth to defence that may reduce fitness in the absence of further herbivory. However, the defence-induced changes in carbon assimilation that precede this reallocation in resources remain largely undetermined. This study characterized the response of photosynthesis to herbivore induction of jasmonic acid (JA)-related defences in Nicotiana attenuata to increase understanding of these mechanisms. It was hypothesized that JA-induced defences would immediately reduce the component processes of photosynthesis upon attack and was predicted that wild-type plants would suffer greater reductions in photosynthesis than plants lacking JA-induced defences. Gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, and thermal spatial patterns were measured together with the production of defence-related metabolites after attack and through recovery. Herbivore damage immediately reduced electron transport and gas exchange in wild-type plants, and gas exchange remained suppressed for several days after attack. The sustained reductions in gas exchange occurred concurrently with increased defence metabolites in wild-type plants, whereas plants lacking JA-induced defences suffered minimal suppression in photosynthesis and no increase in defence metabolite production. This suppression in photosynthesis occurred only after sustained defence signalling and defence chemical mobilization, whereas a short bout of feeding damage only transiently altered components of photosynthesis. It was identified that lipoxygenase signalling interacted with photosynthetic electron transport and that the resulting JA-related metabolites reduced photosynthesis. These data represent a metabolic cost to mounting a chemical defence against herbivory and link defence-signalling networks to the differential effects of herbivory on photosynthesis in remaining leaf tissues in a time-dependent manner.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNicotiana 3afluorescence 3agas exchange 3ajasmonic acid 3alinoleate 13S-lipoxygenase 3aelectron transfer 3aherbivores 3ametabolites 3acarbon 3aphotosynthesis 3achlorophyll 3aleaves 2aAnimals 2aChlorophyllxmetabolism 2aCyclopentanesxmetabolism 2aDown-Regulation 2aHerbivoryxphysiology 2aHost-Parasite Interactions 2aLipoxygenasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aManducaxphysiology 2aOxylipinsxmetabolism 2aPhotosynthesis 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTobaccoxmetabolismxparasitology. 0anicotine 0adefence 0achlorophyll fluorescence 0alipoxygenase 0aplant–insect interaction1 aZavala, Jorge A.1 aDeLucia, Evan H.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2013 Jan., v. 64, no. 2 p.685-694dOxford University Press [etc.]x0022-09577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/ers3643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01666naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245009500160300001800255520042700273592002800700650002700728650002300755650001300778650001500791650001600806650001700822650003100839700001700870700001800887700002000905700001800925700001900943700001600962700001700978700001800995700002501013773013401038856007501172852000901247655001201256IND60659026220221120235914.0190827e20110726xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065902622DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc12764k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Yu-Cheng12aA strategy to design highly efficient porphyrin sensitizers for dye-sensitized solar cells  ap. 8910-8912.  aWe designed highly efficient porphyrin sensitizers with two phenyl groups at meso-positions of the macrocycle bearing two ortho-substituted long alkoxyl chains for dye-sensitized solar cells; the ortho-substituted devices exhibit significantly enhanced photovoltaic performances with the best porphyrin, LD14, showing JSC = 19.167 mA cm⁻², VOC = 0.736 V, FF = 0.711, and overall power conversion efficiency η = 10.17%.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical communication 3achemical reactions 3amoieties 3aporphyrins 3asolar cells 3asolar energy 3avolatile organic compounds1 aWang, Jinli,1 aPan, Tsung-Yu1 aHong, Shang-Hao1 aLan, Chi-Ming1 aKuo, Hshin-Hui1 aLo, Chen-Fu1 aHsu, Hung-Yu1 aLin, Jingyao,1 aDiau, Eric Wei-Guang0 tChemical communications.g2011 July 26, v. 47, no. 31 p.8910-8912dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1cc12764k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01525naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001200142245012800154300002000282520054900302592002800851650001800879650001400897650002000911700001300931700001800944700002100962700001900983773013401002856007801136852000901214655001201223IND60541604220221121092435.0160822e20150826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054160422DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.5b066592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJi, Yue10aConcise Redox Deracemization of Secondary and Tertiary Amines with a Tetrahydroisoquinoline Core via a Nonenzymatic Process  ap. 10496-10499.  aA concise deracemization of racemic secondary and tertiary amines with a tetrahydroisoquinoline core has been successfully realized by orchestrating a redox process consisted of N-bromosuccinimide oxidation and iridum-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation.

The modified leno loom requires just a single shedding element to achieve the vertical and horizontal offset motion of the weft yarn system for pattern generation. These modifications allow the low-damage processing of coarse high-performance fibers in the warp (straight yarn) and the weft yarn systems to create leno fabrics. These leno fabrics produced with the modified loom are investigated experimentally. By means of a three-factorial analysis of variance, the influence of tensile forces operating during processing and weft density on the crimp and the tensile strength of the straight yarn is examined. It is revealed that the property degradation (tensile/breaking strength) of the straight yarn caused by the weaving process is drastically reduced to 4.2% compared to an unprocessed roving. The determined crimp of the straight yarn affected by process-inherent tensile forces is 0.1% at its maximum. Thus, the presented leno-woven fabrics offer an enormous application potential for the reinforcement of brittle matrices, such as ceramic or concrete.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of variance 3abrittleness 3aceramics 3aconcrete 3afabrics 3atensile strength 3atextile fibers 3aweaving 3ayarns 0aleno fabric 0aheavy tow 0ascrim1 aVorhof, M1 aBrünler, R1 aSennewald, C1 aHoffmann, G.,1 aCherif, Ch0 tTextile research journal.g2019 Aug., v. 89, no. 16 p.3326-3341dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x1746-77487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175188090493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02397naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100005600155245013400211300001600345520100800361592002801369650002801397650002401425650000901449650001801458650001101476650001701487650001101504650001401515650002401529650002201553650000901575650001601584653004201600653002301642653002601665653002501691700001901716700001201735700001601747773009001763856008901853852000901942655001201951IND60601670220221118012337.0180706e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060167022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2014.07.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Mingzhu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1907-055410aSynergistic effect of nano silicon dioxide and ammonium polyphosphate on flame retardancy of wood fiber–polyethylene composites  ap. 128-134.  aWood fiber-high density polyethylene composites (WPCs) with nano silicon dioxide (nano-SiO2) and ammonium polyphosphate (APP) were prepared to investigate the synergistic effects on the thermal stability and flame retardancy of WPCs. APP/nano-SiO2 has significant improvement on heat release rate (HRR), total heat release (THR), time to ignition (TTI), mass loss rate (MLR), and limited oxygen index (LOI). The most efficiency was appeared in APP 8%/nano-SiO2 6%. It reduced the average and peak HRR by 42% and, 44% respectively, and increased the TTI by 78%. In WPCs containing APP/nano-SiO2, APP can interact with nano-SiO2, wood fiber, leading to promote the thermal degradation of WPC take place earlier, and stabilize the char residues. The presence of nano-SiO2 can further form an intercalated network in char structure, enhancing the physical integrity. This char layer with more thermal stability and physical integrity results in an effectively synergistic effect on flame retardancy of WPCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium polyphosphates 3acomposite materials 3aheat 3ananomaterials 3aoxygen 3apolyethylene 3asilica 3asynergism 3athermal degradation 3athermal stability 3awood 3awood fibers 0aA.

Cry8Ea1 protein levels of the construct containing MARs were increased by 2.5 times. White grubs are now recognized as the most important pests of peanut worldwide. A synthetic cry8Ea1 gene, which was toxic to Holotrichia parallela larvae, was expressed in chimeric peanut roots using an Agrobacterium rhizogenes-mediated transformation system. The relative mRNA and protein levels of the cry8Ea1 gene were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR and ELISA, respectively. The effects of matrix attachment regions (MARs) on the expression and activity of the cry8Ea1 gene were analyzed. The average expression level of cry8Ea1 in peanut roots was higher for the plants harboring constructs flanked by MARs from tobacco. Moreover, differing from previous studies, the synthetic cry8Ea1 gene flanked by MARs showed more variation in protein levels than mRNA levels. These composite plants containing cry8Ea1 gene flanked by MARs exhibited a high toxicity against Holotrichia parallela larvae as shown by bioassay analysis, thus offering a potential effective combination to control subterranean insects in peanuts.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioassays 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agenes 3ainsect larvae 3ainsects 3amessenger RNA 3apeanuts 3apests 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aroots 3atobacco 3atoxicity 2aAnimals 2aArachisxgeneticsxparasitology. 2aColeopteraxphysiology. 2aBiological Assay 2aMatrix Attachment Regionsxgenetics 2aPlant Rootsxgeneticsxparasitology. 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aRecombinant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTranscription, Genetic 2aTransformation, Genetic1 aChi, Jing1 aShu, Changlong1 aGresshoff, Peter M.1 aSong, Fuping1 aHuang, Dafang1 aZhang, Jie0 tPlant cell reports.g2013 Aug., v. 32, no. 8 p.1211-1218dSpringer-Verlagx0721-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00299-013-1417-2  aDNAL 7aarticle04145naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100007000139245017000209300001400379500001900393500002000412520195800432592002802390596005002418596008002468596007702548596007902625596005802704650001602762650001602778650001302794650003702807650002302844650001002867650001302877650003002890650002402920700001902944700001902963700002102982700002003003700002203023700002403045700001803069700002203087700001703109700001603126700002103142700002403163700002903187700002303216700002003239700001903259700003303278773013803311856007303449852000903522655001203531IND60679253920221121024032.0191221e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067925392DNAL7 a10.1111/jbg.124322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMassacci, Francesca Romana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7235-630010aHost genotype and amoxicillin administration affect the incidence of diarrhoea and faecal microbiota of weaned piglets during a natural multiresistant ETEC infection  ap. 60-72.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEnterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is the aetiological agent of postweaning diarrhoea (PWD) in piglets. The SNPs located on the Mucine 4 (MUC4) and Fucosyltransferase 1 (FUT1) genes have been associated with the susceptibility to ETEC F4 and ETEC F18, respectively. The interplay between the MUC4 and FUT1 genotypes to ETEC infection and the use of amoxicillin in modifying the intestinal microbiota during a natural infection by multiresistant ETEC strains have never been investigated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of the MUC4 and FUT1 genotypes and the administration of amoxicillin through different routes on the presence of diarrhoea and the faecal microbiota composition in piglets naturally infected with ETEC. Seventy‐one piglets were divided into three groups: two groups differing by amoxicillin administration routes—parenteral (P) or oral (O) and a control group without antibiotics (C). Faecal scores, body weight, presence of ETEC F4 and F18 were investigated 4 days after the arrival in the facility (T0), at the end of the amoxicillin administration (T1) and after the withdrawal period (T2). The faecal bacteria composition was assessed by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene. We described that MUC4 and FUT1 genotypes were associated with the presence of ETEC F4 and ETEC F18. The faecal microbiota was influenced by the MUC4 genotypes at T0. We found the oral administration to be associated with the presence of diarrhoea at T1 and T2. Furthermore, the exposure to amoxicillin resulted in significant alterations of the faecal microbiota. Overall, MUC4 and FUT1 were confirmed as genetic markers for the susceptibility to ETEC infections in pigs. Moreover, our data highlight that group amoxicillin treatment may produce adverse outcomes on pig health in course of multiresistant ETEC infection. Therefore, alternative control measures able to maintain a healthy faecal microbiota in weaners are recommended.  aPublisher supplied data  cInstitut National de la Recherche Agronomique  cDepartment of Agricultural and Food Sciences (DISTAL) of Bologna University  acontract ANR‐10‐INBS‐09cFrance Génomique National infrastructure  aProgetto di Ricerca Corrente IZSUM RC 006/2016cItalian Ministry of Health  cCOST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology) 3aamoxicillin 3abody weight 3adiarrhea 3aenterotoxigenic Escherichia coli 3aetiological agents 3agenes 3agenotype 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aoral administration1 aTofani, Silvia1 aForte, Claudio1 aBertocchi, Micol1 aLovito, Carmela1 aOrsini, Serenella1 aTentellini, Michele1 aMarchi, Lucia1 aLemonnier, Gaetan1 aLuise, Diana1 aBlanc, Fany1 aCastinel, Adrien1 aBevilacqua, Claudia1 aRogel‐Gaillard, Claire1 aPezzotti, Giovanni1 aEstellé, Jordi1 aTrevisi, Paolo1 aMagistrali, Chiara Francesca0 tJournal of animal breeding and genetics.g2020 Jan., v. 137, no. 1 p.60-72dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57793x0931-26687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jbg.124323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02145naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245010400159300001800263500001900281520106900300592002801369650001401397650001701411650001401428650001801442650002601460650001201486650001101498650001301509650002401522700002401546773014201570856007401712852000901786655001201795IND60699447320221118235926.0200618e20200617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069944732DNAL7 a10.1039/c9tb02778e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerni, Stefano10aOptimisation and feature selection of poly-beta-amino-ester as a drug delivery system for cartilage  ap. 5096-5108.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDrug localisation is still one of the main challenges in treating pathologies affecting cartilage; poly-beta-amino-esters (PBAEs) drug conjugates are a possible solution; however, their efficacy highly depends on the polymer structure hence the full potential of this delivery system is still unknown. For the purpose of optimising the delivery system design, a large library of PBAEs was synthesised and dexamethasone (DEX) uptake in cartilage was determined. All three components of PBAE (amine, acrylate and end-capping) impacted the outcome. The most effective PBAE identified enhanced DEX uptake by 8 folds compared to an equivalent dose of the commercial formulation and also prevented, through delivery of DEX, the cartilage degradation caused by IL-1α (interleukine1α). A chemometrics based predictive model was constructed and PBAEs properties most affecting the performance of the drug delivery systems were identified. This model will allow further computer based PBAEs optimisation and fast track the bench to market process for this delivery system.  aPublisher supplied data 3acartilage 3achemometrics 3acomputers 3adexamethasone 3adrug delivery systems 3amarkets 3amodels 3apolymers 3asystems engineering1 aProkopovich, Polina0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2020 June 17, v. 8, no. 23 p.5096-5108dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9tb02778e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01702naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100001800162245013200180300001600312500001900328500000900347520054600356592002800902650002300930650002100953650001300974650001200987650002600999650002801025650001101053650001201064700001801076700001801094773012201112856009701234852000901331655001201340IND60663447520221120094559.0191122e196004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066344752DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1960.00021962005200040013x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaylor, T.

Rapid shifts in botanical composition occurred from season to season that could not be attributed to grazing or clipping managements. However, within a season Ladino clover did better under clipping than under grazing conditions. Orchardgrass persisted better on the grazed plots. Plant responses within a season are attributed to animal preference of clover over grass. Ladino was very susceptible to injury from drouth and heaving.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDactylis glomerata 3aTrifolium repens 3aagronomy 3aanimals 3abotanical composition 3adry matter accumulation 3aforage 3agrasses1 aWashko, J.

Moreover, their structure and bioactivities were evaluated through chemical and spectral means. The study results demonstrated that LPB8-0 was primarily composed of mannose and glucose and had an average molecular weight of 1.12 × 10⁴ Da, while LPB8-1 was composed of mannose, glucose, and galactose and had an average molecular weight of 1.78 × 10⁵ Da. Their carbohydrate contents were 96.2% ± 1.0% and 99.1% ± 0.5%, respectively. The backbone of LPB8-1 was composed of (1→2)-linked α-D-Manp and (1→6)-linked α-D-Manp. LPB8-0 and LPB8-1 had semicrystalline structures with good thermal stability (308.3 and 311.7 °C, respectively). SEM results displayed that both LPB8-0 and LPB8-1 had irregular thin-slice shapes and spherical body structures. Additionally, an emulsifying ability assay confirmed that LPB8-0 and LPB8-1 had good emulsifying activity against several edible oils, and this activity was retained under acidic, neutral, and high temperature conditions. Furthermore, an antioxidant assay confirmed that LPB8-1 had stronger scavenging activity than LPB8-0. Overall, these results provide a theoretical basis for the potential application of these two novel exopolysaccharides as natural antioxidants and emulsifiers in the food and pharmaceutical industries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3aexopolysaccharides 3agalactose 3aglucose 3amannose 3amolecular weight 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3aChina1 aLi, Ran 1 aHe, Juan 1 aYang, Li 1 aChen, Jia 1 aXu, Zhe 1 aZheng, Bijun 1 aYang, Yichen 1 aXia, Zhongmei 1 aTian, Yongqiang 0 tFoods.g2022 Aug. 04, v. 11, no. 15dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods111523273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02535naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100001900162245010400181300001600285500001900301500000900320520140500329592002801734650001501762650002101777650001301798650001701811650001501828650001601843650001401859650001601873650001101889651001301900700002001913773012301933856009602056852000902152655001202161IND60663447620221120094525.0191122e196709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066344762DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1967.00021962005900050017x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKittock, D.

Effects of desiccation on total yield and germination were determined. Yield, weight per 100 seeds, and germination were also determined for sequential racemes. Natural freeze was the check treatment. Yield increased at a uniform rate with delay of desiccation except in one test severely affected by Alternaria leaf spot disease. The average weekly increase in yield for the four tests was 199 kg per ha. Primary racemes were mature at the time of first treatments. The contribution of secondary, tertiary and quaternary racemes to yield increased during the entire course of the treatments. Seed weight from secondary and tertiary racemes increased with maturity. Germination was positively and significantly correlated with seed weight. The highest percentage germination was obtained from late September and early October desiccation treatments. Freezing of immature seeds and weathering of mature seeds reduced germination. Drying of seed following plant desiccation required about 10 days and did not reduce germination. Yield loss from 10 days' growth prior to freeze was calculated to be 284 kg per ha. On basis of low seed germinations obtained in these tests, the feasibility of castorbean production for seed in Nebraska would be questioned.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlternaria 3aRicinus communis 3aagronomy 3acastor beans 3adesiccants 3agermination 3aleaf spot 3aseed weight 3ayields 3aNebraska1 aWilliams, J.

Allocation of macro- and micronutrients into the eggs may be costly for the female, therefore, we expect that resource investment may be affected by the environmental and social conditions the mother experiences during egg formation. Here, we investigated whether environmental circumstances experienced by the reproducing female exert an influence on egg mass, yolk antioxidant (lutein and tocopherol) concentration, eggshell thickness, and the eggshell spotting patterns of Great Tits (Parus major). Our study showed that when caterpillars were less abundant, in colder weather and when breeding in an area of higher local breeding density, female Great Tits laid eggs of lower mass, suggesting that adverse environmental circumstances constrain the macronutrient investment into the eggs. However, we found no evidence that yolk antioxidant concentration and eggshell thickness were affected by environmental factors. Female Great Tits may use their endogenous stores or spend more time and energy in finding sufficient amounts of dietary antioxidants and calcium under unfavourable environmental conditions, which may have a cost effect on their own conditions. We found that birds that bred in the beginning of the season laid eggs with darker eggshell spots. Moreover, females laid more spotted eggs in colder weather and when breeding in higher density areas. Our results suggest that Great Tits deposit more of the potentially harmful pro-oxidant protoporphyrin pigment into the eggshell under unfavourable environmental conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParus major 3aantioxidants 3abirds 3abreeding 3abreeding sites 3acalcium 3aegg shell 3aegg shell thickness 3aeggs 3aenergy 3aenvironmental factors 3afemales 3ainsect larvae 3alutein 3amothers 3aoogenesis 3aprogeny 3aprotoporphyrin 3aweather1 aHerényi, Márton1 aNagy, Gergely1 aNyiri, Zoltán1 aEke, Zsuzsanna1 aTörök, János0 tJournal of ornithology.g2016 Oct., v. 157, no. 4 p.995-1006dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx2193-71927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10336-016-1348-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02094naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245008400164300001600248500001400264520045800278536011900736592002800855596003200883596003000915650001700945650002600962650001800988650001201006650001101018650001701029650001901046650003701065650002901102653002601131653004401157653003201201653005101233700001501284700002201299700001601321700002201337700002401359773013601383856008401519852000901603655001201612IND60692724920221121192233.0200503e20150102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069272492DNAL7 a10.1080/09168451.2014.9635032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Yue10aBenzyl isothiocyanate inhibits IL-13 expression in human basophilic KU812 cells  ap. 159-163.  aNAL-light  aAn allergen-stimulating cytokine, interleukin-13 (IL-13), plays a significant role in allergic inflammation.

The major aim was to investigate contributions and interactions of salt and fat on taste pleasantness and perception. The minor aim was to investigate individual fat taste sensitivity (detection threshold of oleic acid [C18:1]) on pleasantness for fat. In a complete factorial design, 49 participants (18–54 years, 12 males) tasted tomato soups with 4 different fat concentrations (0–20%) and 5 different salt concentrations (0.04–2.0%). The preferred concentration and the discrimination ability for both fat and salt were determined by ranking tests. Results show that salt and fat affected pleasantness separately (P < 0.01), with salt having the strongest effect. Fat concentrations 0%, 5%, and 10% did not differ in pleasantness, whereas 20% was less pleasant (P < 0.05). There were no interactions for fat and salt on pleasantness or saltiness and fattiness intensity. Fat taste sensitive participants preferred lower fat concentrations than less sensitive participants (P = 0.008). In conclusion, the strong effect of salt on pleasantness in this study suggests that salt, rather than fat, play a major role in the attraction to savory fatty foods.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adetection limit 3afood choices 3amales 3aoleic acid 3asaltiness 3asavory 3asoups 3ataste sensitivity 3atomatoes 0afat 0afat taste sensitivity 0asalt 0ataste intensity 0ataste preferences1 aNewman, Lisa P.1 aKeast, Russell S.J.0 tChemical senses.g2016 Mar. 01, v. 41, no. 3 p.189-195dOxford University PresswJournal:J000001303x1464-35537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/chemse/bjv0793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02631naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245013400169300001800303520118800321592002801509650002201537650002301559650001201582650001901594650001201613650002101625650001901646650001901665650001501684650001701699650001701716700001501733700001801748700002001766700002001786700005701806700005401863700005901917773012801976856008402104852000902188655001202197IND60642290020221118064952.0190507e20190410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064229002DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.9b003832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiang, Mei-Hao10aMitochondrion-Targeting Fluorescence Probe via Reduction Induced Charge Transfer for Fast Methionine Sulfoxide Reductases Imaging  ap. 5489-5493.  aMethionine sulfoxide reductases (Msrs) play essential roles in maintaining mitochondrial function and are recognized as potential therapeutic targets. However, current probes for Msrs fail to target mitochondria and exhibit a relatively slow response and limited sensitivity. Here we develop a novel turn-on fluorescence probe that facilitates imaging of mitochondrial Msrs in living cells. The probe is constructed by conjugating a methyl phenyl sulfoxide, a mimic Msrs substrate, to an electron-withdrawing hydrophobic cation, methylpyridinium. The probe of acceptor–acceptor structure is initially nonemissive. Msrs catalyzed reduction of sulfoxide to sulfide generated a fluorophore of distinct donor–acceptor structure. The probe is demonstrated to exhibit high sensitivity, fast response, and high selectivity toward MsrA in vitro. Furthermore, the probe is successfully introduced to detect and image Msrs in living cells with excellent mitochondrial-targeting capability. Moreover, the probe also reveals decreased Msrs activity in a cellular Parkinson’s disease model. Our probe affords a powerful tool for detecting and visualizing mitochondrial Msrs in living cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParkinson disease 3acatalytic activity 3acations 3adisease models 3aenzymes 3afluorescent dyes 3ahydrophobicity 3aimage analysis 3amethionine 3amitochondria 3atherapeutics1 aHuang, Hui1 aLiu, Xian-Jun1 aTong, Zong-Xuan1 aZhang, Chun-Xia1 aWang, Fenglin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5872-26931 aYu, Ru-Qin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7412-83601 aJiang, Jian-Hui1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1594-40230 tAnalytical chemistry.g2019 Apr. 10, v. 91, no. 9 p.5489-5493dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.9b003833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02342naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100003000154245014400184300001600328520095200344592002801296650001701324650001601341650001401357650000901371650001401380650002101394650001101415650001401426650001101440650001901451653003001470653002101500653001901521653002001540700001801560700001601578700002401594700002301618700003101641773012601672856008901798852000901887655001201896IND60543381020221116175740.0190410e20140405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054338102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2014.03.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNajafpour, Mohammad Mahdi10aNano-sized layered Mn oxides as promising and biomimetic water oxidizing catalysts for water splitting in artificial photosynthetic systems  ap. 124-139.  aOne challenge in artificial photosynthetic systems is the development of artificial model compounds to oxidize water. The water-oxidizing complex of Photosystem II which is responsible for biological water oxidation contains a cluster of four Mn ions bridged by five oxygen atoms. Layered Mn oxides as efficient, stable, low cost, environmentally friendly and easy to use, synthesize, and manufacture compounds could be considered as functional and structural models for the site. Because of the related structure of these Mn oxides and the catalytic centre of the active site of the water oxidizing complex of Photosystem II, the study of layered Mn oxides may also help to understand more about the mechanism of water oxidation by the natural site.

Existing networks can be optimized by lowering primary return temperatures in order to improve the use of geothermal resources. This can be done by installing triple-pipe systems. This paper defines the concept of triple-pipe configurations as it is understood in France. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the relevance of those configurations for optimizing geothermal DH system efficiency. A dynamic thermal-hydraulic model was developed using the programming language Modelica. A generic case study is modeled considering the extension of an existing network. It is shown that triple-pipe configurations offer lower return temperatures and gas consumption, while increasing of the renewable energy share in the network energy mix.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acomputer software 3adynamic models 3aenergy 3aheat 3arenewable energy sources 3atemperature 3aFrance 0aTriple-pipe 0aDistrict heating 0aLow return temperature 0aCascading 0aNetwork extension 0aRenewable energy1 aThomas, Romain1 aDuplessis, Bruno1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7071-92461 aTran, Cong-Toan1 aStabat, Pascal0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2018 Oct. 01, v. 173 p.461-469dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2018.07.0873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01272naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245009000168300001800258520024800276592002800524650001200552650002300564650002300587650001300610650001100623650002400634700002000658700006800678773012000746856008300866852000900949655001200958IND60636308120190502000000.0190405e20190319xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063630812DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.9b005172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBojaryn, Kevin10aIterative Synthesis of Alkenes by Insertion of Lithiated Epoxides into Boronic Esters  ap. 2218-2222.  aThe insertion of lithiated epoxides into boronic esters followed by thermal syn-elimination provides a stereospecific entry to alkenes.

Because single cell is too small to analyze, conventional proteome analytical methods are not applicative to single-cell proteome analysis. Therefore, it is urgent to develop single-cell proteome analytical methods. Although it is a great challenge, many advances have been achieved in recent years. In label based methods, around 50 target proteins from single cells can be simultaneously analyzed with high throughput. In MS (non-label) based methods, over 200 proteins from single somatic cells can be identified by ultra-sensitive nanoLC-MS/MS. It has broken through the bottle-neck of protein number of label based methods, and made whole proteome analysis of single somatic cells promising. Herein, we have reviewed recent published methods of single-cell proteome analysis, and given a guidance of method selection for applications. Finally, we have offered our opinions for developing single-cell proteome analytical methods in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3aattitudes and opinions 3aproteins 3aproteome 3asomatic cells 0aSingle-cell analysis 0aCellular heterogeneity 0aFluorescence analysis 0ananoLC-MS/MS1 aWeng, Lingxiao1 aGao, Mingxia1 aZhang, Xiangmin0 tTrends in analytical chemistry.g2019, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11800x0165-99367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trac.2019.1156663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02655naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245014600170300001600316500001900332520106900351592002801420650002801448650002101476650001601497650001201513650002501525650001501550650001801565650001201583650001001595650001401605650002201619650001901641650002601660650001501686653004001701653002201741653003101763653002301794653001601817700002101833700002001854700002501874700002101899773013601920856008402056852000902140655001202149IND60692725420221121222706.0200503e20150201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069272542DNAL7 a10.1080/09168451.2014.9680912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBualuang, Aporn10aFunctional characterization of a member of alanine or glycine: cation symporter family in halotolerant cyanobacterium Aphanothece halophytica  ap. 230-235.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMembrane proteins of amino acid–polyamine–organocation (APC) superfamily transport amino acids and amines across membranes and play important roles in the regulation of cellular processes. The alanine or glycine: cation symporter (AGCS) family belongs to APC superfamily and is found in prokaryotes, but its substrate specificity remains to be clarified. In this study, we found that a halotolerant cyanobacterium, Aphanothece halophytica has two putative ApagcS genes. The deduced amino acid sequence of one of genes, ApagcS1, exhibited high homology to Pseudomonas AgcS. The ApagcS1 gene was expressed in Escherichia coli JW4166 which is deficient in glycine uptake. Kinetics studies in JW4166 revealed that ApAgcS1 is a sodium-dependent glycine transporter. Competition experiments showed the significant inhibition by glutamine, asparagine, and glycine. The level of mRNA for ApagcS1 was induced by NaCl and nitrogen-deficient stresses. Uptake of glutamine by ApAgcS1 was also observed. Based on these data, the physiological role of ApAgcS1 was discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAphanothece halophytica 3aEscherichia coli 3aPseudomonas 3aalanine 3aamino acid sequences 3aasparagine 3abiotechnology 3acations 3agenes 3aglutamine 3aprokaryotic cells 3asalt tolerance 3asubstrate specificity 3asymporters 0aalanine or glycine:cation symporter 0aamino acid uptake 0ahalotolerant cyanobacteria 0anitrogen deficient 0asalt stress1 aKageyama, Hakuto1 aTanaka, Yoshito1 aIncharoensakdi, Aran1 aTakabe, Teruhiro0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2015 Feb. 1, v. 79, no. 2 p.230-235dTaylor & FranciswJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09168451.2014.9680913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02958naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100007000166245008300236300001600319500001500335520129600350592002801646650001501674650001401689650001001703650001401713650002001727650002401747650003101771650001301802650001301815650002501828650001301853650001101866650002001877653001301897653003201910653001701942653001401959653001501973653001101988653002201999653002002021653000802041653001002049653001202059653001802071653001502089700001402104700002502118700001802143773011702161856008102278852000902359655001202368IND60651193520221119213128.0190711e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065119352DNAL7 a278735562pmid7 a10.1017/S00311820160017002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGRANROTH-WILDING, H.

However, variation in infection among juvenile hosts is poorly understood. Experimental studies have indicated that effects of parasitism can vary with host sex, hatching order and hatch date, yet it remains unclear whether this is linked to differences in parasite burdens. We quantified gastrointestinal nematode burdens of wild juvenile European shags (Phalacrocorax aristotelis) using two in situ measures (endoscopy of live birds and necropsy of birds that died naturally) and one non-invasive proxy measure (fecal egg counts (FECs)). In situ methods revealed that almost all chicks were infected (98%), that infections established at an early age and that older chicks hosted more worms, but FECs underestimated prevalence. We found no strong evidence that burdens differed with host sex, rank or hatch date. Heavier chicks had higher burdens, demonstrating that the relationship between burdens and their costs is not straightforward.

However, the sensitivity of ICP-MS-based immunoassay is only comparable or lower than those of fluorescence methods at the present stage. Therefore, designing elemental tags with a large number of metal atoms is necessary to achieve high-sensitive detection. In this work, we proposed a new strategy to build up elemental tag loading with hundreds of rare earth ions by coupling alkyne-DNA chains with rare earth element (REE)-DOTA complexes a click chemistry reaction. There are about 2 orders of magnitude improvement in sensitivity compared with single metal-ion tags. DNA chains with multialkynyl groups were facilely prepared by PCR synthesis. Moreover, the DNA-based elemental tags own excellent water-solubility and biocompatibility. The tags would be potentially applied to mass cytometry and clinical diagnosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3abiocompatibility 3afluorescence 3aimmunoassays 3aions 3amoieties 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arare earth elements 3awater solubility1 aSun, Gongwei1 aJiang, Wencan1 aXu, Fujian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8797-47881 aZhang, Yuqing1 aXia, Mengchan1 aPan, Xingyu1 aXing, Zhi1 aZhang, Sichun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8927-23761 aZhang, Xinrong0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2019 Apr. 11, v. 91, no. 9 p.5980-5986dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.9b004053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01577naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001100149245012600160300001800286520045000304592002800754650002100782650002100803650002300824650001200847650001300859700001800872700002200890700001700912700001400929700001800943700005400961773012001015856008301135852000901218655001201227IND60636308320221117223241.0190405e20190314xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063630832DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.9b005202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yi10aCopper-Catalyzed Decarboxylative Oxyalkylation of Alkynyl Carboxylic Acids: Synthesis of γ-Diketones and γ-Ketonitriles  ap. 2227-2230.  aA novel copper-catalyzed decarboxylative oxyalkylation of alkynyl carboxylic acids with ketones and alkylnitriles via direct C(sp³)–H bond functionalization to construct new C–C bonds and C–O double bonds was developed.

With the demand for ‘clean label’, there is an increasing need to develop proteins from plant sources as natural food emulsifiers, with comparable properties to traditionally used dairy proteins. A comprehensive and systematic comparison between emulsifying properties of dairy and plant proteins is of interest to the food industry, with the shift towards reducing the usage of animal proteins in food manufacturing.This review presents the comparison between dairy and plant proteins as natural food emulsifiers, underlining the mechanisms elicited from their structures and compositions. It covers the factors influencing the performance of mixed protein systems in emulsion, and the trends for food developers regarding potential applications.The emulsifying properties of food proteins are highly dependent on protein sources, structure, molecular weight, and adsorption behavior. Insights into the relationship between protein structure and emulsifying functionality of dairy and plant proteins under specific conditions, and the suitability of plant proteins as alternative to dairy proteins as natural food emulsifiers are provided.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aanimals 3aemulsions 3afood industry 3afood science 3amolecular weight 3aprotein structure 0aDairy protein 0aPlant protein 0aProtein functionality 0aEmulsifier 0aProtein adsorption1 aWang, Yong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3744-912X1 aSelomulya, Cordelia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5506-03080 tTrends in food science & technology.g2020 Nov., v. 105 p.261-272dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45707x0924-22447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tifs.2020.09.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02883naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002400184245006900208300001600277506007600293520151700369592002801886506003701914650001101951650001101962650001101973650002101984650001102005650001102016650001602027650001202043650001002055653001402065653001902079653001402098653001302112653001402125700001902139700002502158700002302183773012102206856007702327852000902404655001202413IND60625038220221207100214.0181207e20160301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062503822DNAL7 a10.1093/chemse/bjv0872doi7 aPMC50061412pmcid7 a268304992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHallowell, Emily S.10aFlavor Identification and Intensity: Effects of Stimulus Context  ap. 249-259.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTwo experiments presented oral mixtures containing different proportions of the gustatory flavorant sucrose and an olfactory flavorant, either citral (Experiment 1) or lemon (Experiment 2). In 4 different sessions of each experiment, subjects identified each mixture as “mostly sugar” or “mostly citrus/lemon” or rated the perceived intensities of the sweet and citrus components. Different sessions also presented the mixtures in different contexts, with mixtures containing relatively high concentrations of sucrose or citral/lemon presented more often (skew sucrose or skew citral/lemon). As expected, in both experiments, varying stimulus context affected both identification and perceived intensity: Skewing to sucrose versus citral/lemon decreased the probability of identifying the stimuli as “mostly sugar” and reduced the ratings of sweet intensity relative to citrus intensity. Across both contextual conditions of both experiments, flavor identification associated closely with the ratio of the perceived sweet and citrus intensities. The results accord with a model, extrapolated from signal-detection theory, in which sensory events are represented as multisensory–multidimensional distributions in perceptual space. Changing stimulus context can shift the locations of the distributions relative to response criteria, Decision rules guide judgments based on both sensory events and criteria, these rules not necessarily being identical in tasks of identification and intensity rating.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCitrus 3acitral 3aflavor 3aflavor compounds 3alemons 3amodels 3aprobability 3asucrose 3ataste 0agustatory 0aidentification 0aintensity 0amixtures 0aolfactory1 aParikh, Roshan1 aVeldhuizen, Maria G.1 aMarks, Lawrence E.0 tChemical senses.g2016 Mar. 01, v. 41, no. 3 p.249-259dOxford University PresswJournal:J000001303x1464-35537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/chemse/bjv0873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02655naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002200166245007400188300001800262520142900280592002801709650001101737650001701748650001301765650001401778650001401792650001001806650002201816650001401838650001701852650001801869650002001887650001501907651000901922651001801931651001301949653001401962653003501976773012002011856008102131852000902212655001202221IND60651193620221119213107.0190711e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065119362DNAL7 a277290922pmid7 a10.1017/S00311820160017242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMUTAPI, FRANCISCA10aGetting a GRiPP on everyday schistosomiasis: experience from Zimbabwe  ap. 1624-1632.  aSchistosomiasis, commonly known as bilharzia, is a parasitic disease prevalent in Africa, Asia and South America. The majority of the cases occur in Sub-Saharan Africa where schistosomiasis is a major public health problem impacting on child health and development as well as adult health when infections become chronic. Control of schistosomiasis is by treatment of infected people with the antihelminthic drug praziquantel. Current schistosome control programmes advocated by the World Health Assembly in 2001 are aimed at regular school-based integrated deworming strategies in order to reduce development of severe morbidity, promote school health and to improve cognitive potential of children. Several countries in Africa have now embarked on national scale deworming programmes treating millions of children exposed to schistosomiasis in endemic areas without prior diagnosis of infection through mass drug administration programmes. Implementing such control programmes requires a concerted effort between scientists, policy makers, health practitioners and several other stake holders and of course a receptive community. This paper considers the contributions to global schistosome control efforts made by research conducted in Zimbabwe and the historical context and developments leading to the national schistosomiasis control programme in Zimbabwe giving an example of Getting Research into Policy and Practice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3achild health 3achildren 3acognition 3adeworming 3adrugs 3aissues and policy 3amorbidity 3apraziquantel 3apublic health 3aschistosomiasis 3ascientists 3aAsia 3aSouth America 3aZimbabwe 0abilharzia 0amass drug administration (MDA)0 tParasitology.g2017 Oct., v. 144, no. 12 p.1624-1632dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45572x1469-81617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00311820160017243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01860naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245009000162300001600252520096000268592002801228650002701256650001701283650001401300650002301314650001401337651002801351773010101379856008101480852000901561655001201570IND60549292120221122002238.0160907e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054929212DNAL7 a10.1007/s10592-016-0837-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLucek, Kay10aCryptic invasion drives phenotypic changes in central European threespine stickleback  ap. 993-999.  aCryptic invasions are commonly associated with genetic changes of the native species or genetic lineage that the invaders replace. Phenotypic shifts resulting from cryptic invasions are less commonly reported given the relative paucity of historical specimens that document such phenotypic changes. Here, I study such a case in two populations of threespine stickleback from central Europe, comparing contemporary patterns of gene flow with phenotypic changes between historical and contemporary population samples. I find gene flow from an invasive lineage to be associated with significant phenotypic changes, where the degree of phenotypic change corresponds with the level of gene flow that a population receives. These findings underline the utility of combining genetic approaches with phenotypic data to estimate the impact of gene flow in systems where anthropogenic alterations have removed former geographic barriers promoting cryptic invasions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGasterosteus aculeatus 3acase studies 3agene flow 3aindigenous species 3aphenotype 3aCentral European region0 tConservation genetics.g2016 Oct., v. 17, no. 5 p.993-999dSpringer Netherlandsx1566-06217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10592-016-0837-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02985naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245011500171300001600286500001400302520094400316536020501260592002801465596011001493596005501603650002801658650001301686650001801699650001301717650001701730650002501747650001701772650001701789650001201806650001401818650001101832650001201843650001501855650001001870651001401880653002301894653004001917653002501957700002101982700001902003700001702022700002802039700002202067700001802089700002102107700002102128700001702149773013602166856008402302852000902386655001202395IND60692725620221121222651.0200503e20150201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069272562DNAL7 a10.1080/09168451.2014.9723252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNishiyama, Keita10aAdhesion properties of Lactobacillus rhamnosus mucus-binding factor to mucin and extracellular matrix proteins  ap. 271-279.  aNAL-light  aWe previously described potential probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus strains, isolated from fermented mare milk produced in Sumbawa Island, Indonesia, which showed high adhesion to porcine colonic mucin (PCM) and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Recently, mucus-binding factor (MBF) was found in the GG strain of L. rhamnosus as a mucin-binding protein. In this study, we assessed the ability of recombinant MBF protein from the FSMM22 strain, one of the isolates of L. rhamnosus from fermented Sumbawa mare milk, to adhere to PCM and ECM proteins by overlay dot blot and Biacore assays. MBF bound to PCM, laminin, collagen IV, and fibronectin with submicromolar dissociation constants. Adhesion of the FSMM22 mbf mutant strain to PCM and ECM proteins was significantly less than that of the wild-type strain. Collectively, these results suggested that MBF contribute to L. rhamnosus host colonization via mucin and ECM protein binding.  aThis work was supported in part by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) under Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research C (24580397) and Kitasato Research Project for Lactic Acid Bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data  cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) under Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research C (24580397)  cKitasato Research Project for Lactic Acid Bacteria 3aLactobacillus rhamnosus 3aadhesion 3abiotechnology 3acollagen 3adissociation 3aextracellular matrix 3afermentation 3afibronectins 3alaminin 3amare milk 3amucins 3amutants 3aprobiotics 3aswine 3aIndonesia 0abacterial adhesion 0aextracellular matrix (ECM) proteins 0amucus-binding factor1 aNakamata, Koichi1 aUeno, Shintaro1 aTerao, Akari1 aAryantini, Ni Putu Desy1 aSujaya, I.

This study explores household’s perceptions of climate change and its implications on livelihood formation process using empirical data from Uganda. Climatic data, household surveys and key-informant interviews from Wakiso and Gomba districts served as data sources for the study analysis. Majority of the respondents observed climate changes in the last 10–20 years and perceived them to have affected their capital assets in the process of forming livelihoods. As a result, households’ livelihoods have diversified and are pursuing livelihood strategies for sustenance. The study underlines the need to access credit conditioned to climate change resilience, access to improved varieties of crops, availing extension services and targeted resources allocations. Incorporating climate change into the planning process at a local level and associated local institutions in order to improve livelihood formation processes of households is recommended.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapital 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acredit 3aenvironment 3alivelihood 3aUganda1 aMearns, Kevin.

Mass spectrometry (MS) coupled with different chromatographic methods, is suitable for large-scale metabolomics study due to its high sensitivity and selectivity, wide dynamic range, and rich information. However, there are still a series of challenges for really realizing large-scale metabolomics applications. Hence, in this review, we mainly focused on new advances in sample pretreatment methods, nontargeted, targeted and pseudotargeted metabolic data collection techniques, and data correction methods used for MS-based large-scale metabolomics study. Typical applications of MS-based large-scale metabolomics methods in molecular epidemiology, precision medicine, and genome-wide association studies with metabolomics (mGWAS) are also given.  aPublisher supplied data 3achromatography 3adata collection 3agenome-wide association study 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3aprecision medicine 0aLarge-scale metabolomics 0aNontargeted 0aTargeted 0aPseudotargeted1 aZhou, Lina1 aShi, Xianzhe1 aXu, Guowang0 tTrends in analytical chemistry.g2019 Dec., v. 121 p.115665-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11800x0165-99367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trac.2019.1156653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02028naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245007800162500002200240520094900262592002801211650002301239650001101262650002601273653001501299653002501314653001501339653002201354653001701376653001901393700002401412700002001436700002701456773009101483856008301574852000901657655001201666IND60669831020221119090711.0191002s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066983102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.trac.2019.1156642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Fang10aLipidomes in health and disease: Analytical strategies and considerations  aPre-press version  aLipidomics is a rapidly-growing field which focuses on global characterization of lipids at molecular and systems levels. As small changes in the concentrations of lipids may have important physiological consequences, much attention in the field has recently been paid to more accurate quantitation and identification of lipids. Community-wide efforts have been initiated, aiming to develop best practices for lipidomic analyses and reporting of lipidomic data. Nevertheless, current approaches for comprehensive analysis of lipidomes have some inherent challenges and limitations. Additionally, there is, currently, limited knowledge concerning the impacts of various external and internal exposures on lipid levels.

Information on combining ability and gene effects conditioning maize weevil resistance would be required to devise breeding strategies. However, there are disagreements regarding the seed generation to subject to maize weevil resistance evaluation. This study determined the seed generation effect on the quality of genetic information obtained from a maize diallel cross. Eight weevil-resistant and two susceptible maize inbred lines from eastern and southern Africa were crossed in a 10-parent diallel scheme. The resulting F₁ hybrid seed, F₂ full-sib grain from controlled pollination, and F₂ half-sib grain from open pollination were evaluated for maize weevil resistance and responses were determined using the number of F₁ weevil emergence from the seed (FWE), median development period (MDP), Dobie’s index of susceptibility (DIS), and parental weevil mortality (PWM). General combining ability (GCA) and specific combining ability (SCA) effects were significant for the FWE, MDP, and DIS in all seed categories. Results revealed that reciprocal effects were predominant in F₁ hybrid seed, GCA effects were predominant in F₂ full-sib grain, while SCA effects were more important in the F₂ half-sib grain. The F₂ full-sib generation exhibited superiority in providing genetic information required for parental line selection when breeding for weevil resistance, compared to F₁ hybrid and F₂ half-sib grain. Resistant inbred lines MV170 and MV142, produced hybrids that exhibited high levels of maize weevil resistance across all the three seed categories thus, qualifying as suitable materials for breeding weevil resistant maize hybrids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSitophilus zeamais 3aZea mays 3acorn 3agenes 3ahybrids 3ainsect pests 3amortality 3aopen pollination 3astored grain 3aSouthern Africa1 aDerera, John1 aTongoona, Pangirayi1 aGasura, Edmore1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8228-44860 tEuphytica.g2021 June, v. 217, no. 6 p.114-114dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl52912x0014-23367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10681-021-02852-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03037naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001900154245012200173300001600295520165700311592002801968650003101996650002402027650001602051650002002067650001702087650001102104650001202115650001802127650002202145653001802167653002302185653001702208653003202225653003802257653001802295700002502313700002002338700002102358773012602379856008902505852000902594655001202603IND60543381820221116180028.0190410e20140405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054338182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2014.03.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuzminov, F.I.10aEffect of APCD and APCF subunits depletion on phycobilisome fluorescence of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803  ap. 153-160.  aLong-wavelength allophycocyanin (APC) subunits in cyanobacteria (APCD, APCE, and APCF) are required for phycobilisome (PBS) assembly, stability, and energy transfer to photosystems. Here we studied fluorescence properties of PBS in vivo, using Synechocystis PCC 6803 mutant cells deficient in both photosystems and/or long-wavelength APC subunits. At room temperature, an absence of APCD and APCF subunits resulted in ∼2-fold decrease of long-wavelength APC (APC680) fluorescence. In 77K fluorescence spectra, we observed only a slight shift of long-wavelength emission. However, 77K fluorescence of a PSI/PSII/APCF-less mutant was also characterized by increased emission from short-wavelength APC, which suggested the importance of this subunit in energy transfer from APC660 to APC680. Under blue-green actinic light, all mutants showed significant non-photochemical fluorescence quenching of up to 80% of the initial dark fluorescence level. Based on the mutants’ quenching spectra, we determined quenching to originate from the pool of short-wavelength APC, while the spectral data alone was not sufficient to make unambiguous conclusion on the involvement of long-wavelength APC in non-photochemical quenching. Using a model of quenching center formation, we determined interaction rates between PBS and orange carotenoid protein (OCP) in vivo. Absence of APCD or APCF subunits had no effect on the rates of quenching center formation confirming the data obtained for isolated OCP–PBS complexes. Thus, although APCD and APCF subunits were required for energy transfer in PBS in vivo, their absence did not affect rates of OCP–PBS binding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSynechocystis sp.

In particular, the eco-friendly extraction of pectins with citric acid has been adopted as a preliminary step in a simplified biorefinery concept where the pectin-free solid is subsequently subjected to a torrefaction treatment for its upgrading into a commodity solid biofuel. An extensive physicochemical characterization of the raw feedstock and the isolated pectins has also been performed, which may be useful to identify suitable application routes. Results show that the extraction conditions [1.5 pH, 90 °C, 4 h contact time and SBP-to-solvent ratio of 1:30 (g/mL)] selected in this work allow obtaining a relatively high yield (25% wt, db) of high methoxyl pectins (with some impurities), which exhibit the same colorimetric characteristics of commercial citrus pectins and are not conducive to microbial growth. A further purification step of isolated pectins is required to improve the emulsifying properties.  aPublisher supplied data  a6444280-4403ES/1 of September 2, 2016cMinistry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation 3aCitrus 3abiofuels 3abiorefining 3acitric acid 3acolorimetry 3aemulsifying properties 3afeedstocks 3amicrobial growth 3apectins 3asugar beet pulp 3asugar industry 3atorrefaction 3avalue added1 aBrachi, Paola1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2584-13941 aRiianova, Evelina1 aCrescitelli, Alessio1 aMiccio, Michele1 aKostryukova, Natalia0 tWaste and biomass valorization.g2020 June, v. 11, no. 6 p.2721-2733dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:6304x1877-26417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12649-019-00582-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02608naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002200166245009200188300001600280520142700296592002801723650002701751650001201778650002401790650002001814650001301834650000701847650001401854650001601868650002301884651001301907653001601920653002301936653001801959700002601977773011702003856008102120852000902201655001202210IND60651194020221119213303.0190711e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065119402DNAL7 a277621832pmid7 a10.1017/S00311820160018152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYOUNG, REBECCA E.10aSpatial and temporal variation in macroparasite communities of three-spined stickleback  ap. 436-449.  aPatterns in parasite community structure are often observed in natural systems and an important question in parasite ecology is whether such patterns are repeatable across time and space. Field studies commonly look at spatial or temporal repeatability of patterns, but they are rarely investigated in conjunction. We use a large dataset on the macroparasites of the three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus L., collected from 14 locations on North Uist, Scotland over an 8-year period to investigate: (1) repeatability of patterns in parasite communities among populations and whether variation is consistent across years, (2) whether variation between years can be explained by climatic variation and progression of the season and (3) whether variation in habitat characteristics explain population differences. Differences in relative abundance and prevalence across populations were observed in a number of parasites investigated indicating a lack of consistency across years in numerous parasite community measures; however, differences between populations in the prevalence and abundance of some parasites were consistent throughout the study.

The electronic influence on the substrate guarantees the conjugated 1,4-hydroboration versus 1,2-diboration.

With HFD, plasma free fatty acids (FFAs) can activate the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) in target tissues, then initiate negative crosstalk between FFAs and insulin signaling. However, the molecular link between IR and inflammation remains to be identified. We here reported that tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 1 (TRAF1), an adapter in signal transduction, was involved in the onset of IR in hepatocytes. TRAF1 was significantly up-regulated in insulin-resistant liver tissues and palmitate (PA)-treated HepG2 cells. In addition, we showed that depletion of TRAF1 led to inhibition of the activity of NF-κB. Given the fact that the activation of NF-κB played a facilitating role in IR, the phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3β was also analyzed. We found that depletion of TRAF1 markedly reversed PA-induced attenuation of the phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3β in the cells. The accumulation of lipid droplets in hepatocyte and expression of two key gluconeogenic enzymes, PEPCK and G6Pase, were also determined and found to display a similar tendency with the phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3β. Glucose uptake assay indicated that knocking down TRAF1 blocked the effect of PA on the suppression of glucose uptake. These data implicated that TRAF1 knockdown might alleviate PA-induced IR in HepG2 cells through NF-κB pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3adroplets 3afree fatty acids 3aglucose 3ahepatocytes 3ahigh fat diet 3ahuman cell lines 3ainflammation 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3alinkage (genetics) 3alipids 3aliver 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apalmitates 3aphosphorylation 3asignal transduction 3atau-protein kinase 3atissues 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atumor necrosis factors 0aTRAF1 0aNF-κB 0aInflammation 0aInsulin resistance 0aType 2 diabetes1 aTang, Zhuqi1 aZhu, Xiaohui1 aXia, Nana1 aZhao, Yun1 aWang, Suxin1 aCui, Shiwei1 aWang, Cuifang0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2015 Nov. 20, v. 467 p.527-533dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.09.1653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03294naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245019500167300001800362520172200380592002802102650001502130650001702145650001102162650002102173650001802194650001502212650002602227650001902253650002202272650001102294650002302305650001202328650002702340650001702367650001902384650001702403650002402420650001402444650002302458651001602481700002902497700002102526700003002547700001802577773010302595856008102698852000902779655001202788IND60549292620221121220950.0160907e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054929262DNAL7 a10.1007/s10592-016-0844-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDool, Serena E.10aPhylogeographic-based conservation implications for the New Zealand long-tailed bat, (Chalinolobus tuberculatus): identification of a single ESU and a candidate population for genetic rescue  ap. 1067-1079.  aThe New Zealand long-tailed bat (Chalinolobus tuberculatus) is an endemic species threatened with extinction. Since the arrival of humans, massive deforestation has occurred and invasive mammalian predators were introduced. As a result, C. tuberculatus’ distribution shrank dramatically and became fragmented. To aid the management of the remaining populations, two Evolutionary Significant Units (ESUs) were designated: one on each of New Zealand’s main islands. We utilised mitochondrial sequence data (cytb, 703 bp) and 10 nuclear DNA microsatellite loci to reconstruct the demographic history of this species, to characterise the level of genetic diversity in remaining populations, and to assess the current connectivity between them. Our results indicate that the North Island, with the highest genetic diversity, served as a glacial refuge, with a loss of diversity following the path recolonization to the south of the South Island. However, our data are also consistent with continued, or at least very recent, genetic exchange between colonies across the species distribution. The only exception is the Hanging Rock colony on the east coast of the South Island, which appears to be isolated. Thus, there was no support for the previously designated ESUs. Signatures of past population declines were found in three colonies, the most extreme of which was found in Hanging Rock. Consequently, we recommend that it be genetically rescued via translocation from a donor population. In general, future management priorities should treat Chalinolobus tuberculatus as a single unit, focusing on maintaining connectivity between remaining populations, together with continued roost protection and pest control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChiroptera 3abiogeography 3acoasts 3acrystal proteins 3adeforestation 3aextinction 3agenetic recombination 3agenetic rescue 3agenetic variation 3ahumans 3aindigenous species 3aislands 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amitochondria 3anuclear genome 3apest control 3apopulation dynamics 3apredators 3athreatened species 3aNew Zealand1 aO’Donnell, Colin F.

Herein, we present a three-dimensional sensor array based on simultaneous variation of the optical properties (fluorescence, light scattering, and UV–vis absorption) of gold–silver alloy nanocluster (AuAgNCs)–gold nanoparticle (AuNPs) composite for the rapid identification of 13 sulfur-containing species and sulfur-oxidizing bacteria. The sensor array is fabricated based on the strong coordination interactions between sulfur-containing compounds and AuAgNCs on the surface of AuNPs. The sulfur species of interest exhibit different affinities toward AuAgNCs and generate unique optical properties. These response patterns could divide the analytes into three categories including organic sulfide, inorganic sulfide, and thiols. Thirteen types of sulfur species including cystine, methionine, GSSG, S²–, SO₃²–, S₂O₃²–, S₂O₇²–, S₂O₈²–, S₄O₆²–, GSH, N-acetyl-l-cysteine, homocysteine, and cysteine can be well distinguished by the sensor array with principal component analysis at 0.5 μM. Moreover, sulfur-oxidizing bacteria and nonsulfur bacteria can also be well discriminated at a level of OD₆₀₀ = 0.005.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylcysteine 3aalloy nanoparticles 3abacteria 3acell communication 3achemical species 3acysteine 3acystine 3afluorescence 3ahomocysteine 3alight scattering 3amethionine 3ananogold 3aprincipal component analysis 3asulfites 3asulfur 3athiols 3athiosulfates 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aYang, Ting1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5517-56581 aWang, Xiao-Yan1 aWang, Yi-Ting1 aLiu, Meng-Xian1 aChen, Ming Li,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8536-88641 aYu, Yong-Liang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9763-09541 aWang, Jian-hua,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2175-36100 tAnalytical chemistry.g2019 Apr. 09, v. 91, no. 9 p.6012-6018dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.9b004763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03241naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245014600164300001600310520193200326592002802258650002202286650001902308650002502327650001002352650001602362650001102378650002302389650001002412650001502422650001402437650001502451650002202466650003002488700002302518700002302541700001702564700001302581700002402594773009602618856008402714852000902798655001202807IND60113007820221118024624.0141111e20121012xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011300782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2012.03.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Yao10aRapid control of Chinese star anise fruits and teas for neurotoxic anisatin by Direct Analysis in Real Time high resolution mass spectrometry  ap. 179-186.  aAfter ingestion, products containing Chinese star anise (Illicium verum) contaminated or adulterated with Japanese star anise (Illicium anisatum) or other Illicium species, can cause epilepsy, hallucinations, and nausea due to the rare neurotoxic sesquiterpene dilactone anisatin that is present in Japanese star anise. Thus a rapid, simple and unambiguous method for distinguishing between the morphologically similar Chinese star anise and toxic Japanese star anise is important for food safety issues. Direct Analysis in Real Time (DART) ambient ionisation coupled with orbitrap high resolution mass spectrometry allowed the recording of mass spectra of anisatin in solid star anise fruits in seconds without any prior sample pretreatment. Spectra could be obtained in both positive ([M+NH₄]⁺ at m/z 346.1496, C₁₅H₂₄NO₈) and negative mode ([M−H]⁻ at m/z 327.1074, C₁₅H₁₉O₈) and gave the same outcome provided a mass resolution of at least 27,000 is available. The anisatin signal was typically >1000 times larger in Japanese star anise than in Chinese star anise thus allowing an unequivocal qualitative determination. Herbal teas containing star anise fragments too small to be visually recognised, could be analysed by preparing a tea in 6min and subsequently sampling ∼2μL of tea on a glass rod. None of the 8 investigated retail teas contained significant quantities of anisatin. Spiking a complex herbal tea containing Chinese star anise with an equally concentrated tea prepared from Japanese star anise provided a linear calibration curve (R²≥0.995) after normalising on a native constituent of Chinese star anise (standard addition method). This showed that adulteration down to 1% (w/w) is still measurable. Compared with existing PCR, TLC, GC–MS and HPLC–ESI-MS/MS procedures, the proposed DART–HRMS procedure is faster and simpler and moreover measures the actual biotoxin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIllicium anisatum 3aIllicium verum 3aadulterated products 3aanise 3afood safety 3afruits 3agas chromatography 3aglass 3aherbal tea 3aingestion 3aionization 3amass spectrometry 3apolymerase chain reaction1 avan Beek, Teris A.1 aClaassen, Frank W.1 aZuilhof, Han1 aChen, Bo1 aNielen, Michel W.F.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2012 Oct. 12, v. 1259 p.179-186dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2012.03.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02359naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245010800160300001600268520089200284592002801176650001101204650002001215650004201235650000901277650001701286650001001303650002401313650002001337650001801357650002001375653001601395653001401411653001601425653002701441700002001468700001901488700002301507700002201530700002101552700002401573700002401597700001601621700002201637773012001659856007701779852000901856655001201865IND60625038820221119121141.0181207e20160501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062503882DNAL7 a10.1093/chemse/bjw0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScholz, Paul10aTranscriptome Analysis of Murine Olfactory Sensory Neurons during Development Using Single Cell RNA-Seq  ap. 313-323.  aMammalian odor reception is achieved by highly specialized olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) located in the nasal cavity. Despite their importance for the daily survival of most mammals, the gene expression and regulatory profiles of these single neurons are poorly understood. Here, we report the isolation of individual GFP-labeled OSNs from Olfr73-GFP mice at different developmental stages followed by Next Generation Sequencing, thereby analyzing the detailed transcriptome for the first time. We characterized the repertoire of olfactory receptors (ORs) and found that in addition to the highly and predominant detectable Olfr73, 20 additional ORs were stably detectable at lower transcript levels in adult mice. Additionally, OSNs collected from mice of earlier developmental stages did not show any stable OR patterns. However, more than one predominant OR per OSN was detectable.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3agene expression 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3amice 3anasal cavity 3aodors 3aolfactory receptors 3asensory neurons 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 0adevelopment 0aolfaction 0asingle cell 0atranscriptome analysis1 aKalbe, Benjamin1 aJansen, Fabian1 aAltmueller, Janine1 aBecker, Christian1 aMohrhardt, Julia1 aSchreiner, Benjamin1 aGisselmann, Guenter1 aHatt, Hanns1 aOsterloh, Sabrina0 tChemical senses.g2016 May 01, v. 41, no. 4 p.313-323dOxford University PresswJournal:J000001303x1464-35537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/chemse/bjw0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03152naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094024002200134024001900156040001800175100001900193245016700212500002200379506007600401520133100477592002801808506003701836650003801873650003301911650002001944650002201964650002001986650002702006650002602033650001002059650001702069650003102086650004302117650005202160650002002212653001202232653000902244653001402253653002002267700002502287700001902312700002102331700002202352700002102374700001902395773010002414856008702514852000902601655001202610IND60669831420221207071257.0190923e20190913xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066983142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jviromet.2019.1137352doi7 aPMC68531602pmcid7 a315267662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlannery, John10aImproved PCR diagnostics using up-to-date in silico validation: an F-gene RT-qPCR assay for the detection of all four lineages of peste des petits ruminants virus  aPre-press version  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPeste des petits ruminants (PPR) is a globally significant disease of small ruminants caused by the peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) that is considered for eradication by 2030 by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). Critical to the eradication of PPR are accurate diagnostic assays. RT-qPCR assays targeting the nucleocapsid gene of PPRV have been successfully used for the diagnosis of PPR. We describe the development of an RT-qPCR assay targeting an alternative region (the fusion (F) gene) based on the most up-to-date PPRV sequence data. In silico analysis of the F-gene RT-qPCR assay performed using PCRv software indicated 98% sensitivity and 100% specificity against all PPRV sequences published in Genbank. The assay indicated the greatest in silico sensitivity in comparison to other previously published and recommended PPRV RT-qPCR assays. We evaluated the assay using strains representative of all 4 lineages in addition to samples obtained from naturally and experimentally-infected animals. The F-gene RT-qPCR assay showed 100% diagnostic specificity and demonstrated a limit of detection of 10 PPRV genome copies per µl. This RT-qPCR assay can be used in isolation or in conjunction with other assays for confirmation of PPR and should support the global efforts for eradication.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFood and Agriculture Organization 3aSmall ruminant morbillivirus 3aanimal diseases 3acomputer software 3adetection limit 3adiagnostic specificity 3adiagnostic techniques 3agenes 3anucleocapsid 3apeste des petits ruminants 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asmall ruminants 0aRT-qPCR 0aPPRV 0ain silico 0arapid detection1 aRajko-Nenow, Paulina1 aArnold, Hannah1 avan Weezep, Erik1 avan Rijn, Piet A.1 aNgeleja, Chanasa1 aBatten, Carrie0 tJournal of virological methods.g2019 Sept. 13, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12356x0166-09347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2019.1137353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03688naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245009900169300001800268520172800286592002802014650001002042650002502052650001502077650000902092650002002101650001902121650001202140650001502152650001402167650001502181650001202196651002802208651001202236700002402248700002002272700001602292700002702308700002302335700002002358700001702378700002202395700001802417700002002435700002302455700002002478700002002498700002302518700001602541700001902557700002802576700002002604700001602624700001802640700002002658700001802678700001902696700002202715700002102737700002002758700001902778773010302797856008102900852000902981655001202990IND60549292720221121220543.0160907e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054929272DNAL7 a10.1007/s10592-016-0853-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSteyer, Katharina10aLarge-scale genetic census of an elusive carnivore, the European wildcat (Felis s. silvestris)  ap. 1183-1199.  aThe European wildcat, Felis silvestris silvestris, serves as a prominent target species for the reconnection of central European forest habitats. Monitoring of this species, however, appears difficult due to its elusive behaviour and the ease of confusion with domestic cats. Recently, evidence for multiple wildcat occurrences outside its known distribution has accumulated in several areas across Central Europe, questioning the validity of available distribution data for this species. Our aim was to assess the fine-scale distribution and genetic status of the wildcat in its central European distribution range. We compiled and analysed genetic samples from roadkills and hundreds of recent hair-trapping surveys and applied phylogenetic and genetic clustering methods to discriminate wild and domestic cats and identify population subdivision. 2220 individuals were confirmed as either wildcat (n = 1792) or domestic cat (n = 342), and the remaining 86 (3.9 %) were identified as hybrids between the two. Remarkably, genetic distinction of domestic cats, wildcats and their hybrids was only possible when taking into account the presence of two highly distinct genetic lineages of wildcats, with a suture zone in central Germany. 44 % of the individual wildcats where sampled outside the previously published distribution. Our analyses confirm a relatively continuous spatial presence of wildcats across large parts of the study area in contrast to previous analyses indicating a highly fragmented distribution. Our results suggest that wildcat conservation and management should take advantage of the higher than previously assumed dispersal potential of wildcats, which may use wildlife corridors very efficiently.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFelis 3abiological corridors 3acarnivores 3acats 3aforest habitats 3afounder effect 3ahybrids 3amonitoring 3aphylogeny 3aroad kills 3asurveys 3aCentral European region 3aGermany1 aKraus, Robert H.

We studied antennal and behavioral responses of the Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri , vector of the citrus greening disease pathogen. Little or no response to citrus leaf volatiles was detected by electroantennography. Glass cartridges prepared with β-ocimene or citral produced no response initially but became stimulatory after several days. Both compounds degraded completely in air to a number of smaller molecules. Two peaks elicited large antennal responses and were identified as acetic and formic acids. Probing by D. citri of a wax substrate containing odorants was significantly increased by a blend of formic and acetic acids compared with either compound separately or blends containing β-ocimene and/or citral. Response surface modeling based on a 4-component mixture design and a 2-component mixture-amount design predicted an optimal probing response on wax substrate containing a blend of formic and acetic acids. Our study suggests that formic and acetic acids play a role in host selection by D. citri and perhaps by phytophagous insects in general even when parent compounds from which they are derived are not active. These results have implications for the investigation of arthropod olfaction and may lead to elaboration of attract-and-kill formulations to reduce nontarget effects of chemical control in agriculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aDiaphorina citri 3aacetic acids 3aadverse effects 3aair 3aarthropods 3abeta-ocimene 3achemical constituents of plants 3achemical control 3acitral 3aelectroantennography 3aformic acid 3aglass 3agreening disease 3ahost preferences 3ainsect vectors 3aleaves 3amodels 3anontarget organisms 3aodor compounds 3apathogens 3aphytophagous insects 3asmell 0aAsian citrus psyllid 0ainsect feeding behavior 0ainsect–plant interactions1 aRobbins, Paul S.1 aAlessandro, Rocco T.1 aStelinski, Lukasz L.1 aLapointe, Stephen L.0 tChemical senses.g2016 May 01, v. 41, no. 4 p.325-338dOxford University PresswJournal:J000001303x1464-35537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/chemse/bjw0053Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03307naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245013500162300001800297520149600315592002801811650001401839650001201853650002001865650001701885650002401902650001501926650002001941650002601961650002201987650001502009650001902024650001802043650001202061650001902073650000902092650001902101650002502120650002302145700002102168700001902189700002602208700002202234700002102256700002502277700003302302700002102335700002202356700001902378700005402397700002102451700002002472700002002492773010302512856008102615852000902696655001202705IND60549292820221121220655.0160907e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054929282DNAL7 a10.1007/s10592-016-0849-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOno, Junya10aBruguiera hainesii, a critically endangered mangrove species, is a hybrid between B. cylindrica and B. gymnorhiza (Rhizophoraceae)  ap. 1137-1144.  aBruguiera hainesii (Rhizophoraceae) is one of the two Critically Endangered mangrove species listed in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Although the species is vulnerable to extinction, its genetic diversity and the evolutionary relationships with other Bruguiera species are not well understood. Also, intermediate morphological characters imply that the species might be of hybrid origin. To clarify the genetic relationship between B. hainesii and other Bruguiera species, we conducted molecular analyses including all six Bruguiera species using DNA sequences of two nuclear genes (CesA and UNK) and three chloroplast regions (intergenic spacer regions of trnL-trnF, trnS-trnG and atpB-rbcL). For nuclear DNA markers, all nine B. hainesii samples from five populations were heterozygous at both loci, with one allele was shared with B. cylindrica, and the other with B. gymnorhiza. For chloroplast DNA markers, the two haplotypes found in B. hainesii were shared only by B. cylindrica. These results suggested that B. hainesii is a hybrid between B. cylindrica as the maternal parent and B. gymnorhiza as the paternal one. Furthermore, chloroplast DNA haplotypes found in B. hainesii suggest that hybridization has occurred independently in regions where the distribution ranges of the parental species meet. As the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species currently excludes hybrids (except for apomictic plant hybrids), the conservation status of B. hainesii should be reconsidered.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBruguiera 3aalleles 3achloroplast DNA 3achloroplasts 3aconservation status 3aextinction 3agenetic markers 3agenetic relationships 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3aheterozygosity 3ahybridization 3ahybrids 3aintergenic DNA 3aloci 3anuclear genome 3anucleotide sequences 3avulnerable species1 aYong, Jean W.

The current imaging formats rely on gating-based mechanisms for generating correct closed-loop signaling topology, and they can suffer from low signal intensity, restricted applicability, and complicated design. We report herein the development of a mechanistically distinct filter beacon architecture for protein-specific glycoform imaging on the cell surface. The elaborate structuring of molecular beacon segment, nicking restriction site, and docking moiety lays out a general nongated design principle for passing through intended closed-loop signaling topology and sifting out false-positive open-loop leakage topology, furnishing a straightforward imaging format with high signal intensity and broad applicability. Proof-of-concept protocols have been developed for the imaging of MUC1-bound terminal sialic acid and fucose. The versatile adaptability of the protocols also enables dynamic monitoring of protein-specific glycosylation pattern changes in response to the alteration of cellular physiological states. Given the convenience for achieving multiplexed encoding and decoding, through fluorescence signals alone or together with filter beacon sequences, the filter beacon architecture should permit comprehensive imaging of diverse-structured carbohydrates on a given glycoprotein.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical bonding 3afluorescence 3afucose 3aglycoproteins 3aglycosylation 3aimage analysis 3amoieties 3amonitoring 3asialic acid 3atopology1 aLiu, Lu1 aLi, Siqiao1 aWang, Guyu1 aJu, Huangxian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6741-53021 aDing, Lin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5381-34840 tAnalytical chemistry.g2019 Apr. 17, v. 91, no. 9 p.6027-6034dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.9b005513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02945naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245008300209300001800292520143900310592002801749650002001777650000901797650001201806650001701818650001301835650001401848650001601862650002601878650002301904650001301927650001901940650001001959650001201969650001801981650001301999650001102012650001702023650001502040700002302055700002102078700002102099700001702120700006502137700002002202773012602222856008202348852000902430655001202439IND60694253820221122195523.0200511e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069425382DNAL7 a10.1007/s12649-018-00568-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKowaluk, Grzegorz1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1463-054010aFunctional Assessment of Particleboards Made of Apple and Plum Orchard Pruning  ap. 2877-2886.  aThree-layered composite materials consisting in wood-chips bonded by a resin (particleboard) were successfully produced from two by-products: plum and apple tree branches, waste biomass produced after orchard pruning; a third particleboard was made from an industrial softwood blend as a reference. After collecting the branches, the raw materials were characterized in matters of density, bark content and bulk density of particles. Various physical and mechanical properties were assessed in accordance with European Standards for wood-based panels, namely thickness swelling, water absorption, modulus of rupture, modulus of elasticity, internal bonding strength, screw withdrawal resistance, as well as density profile and machining properties during milling and drilling. Modulus of rupture was 14.4 ± 1.2 N mm⁻² for plum-based panels and 12.8 ± 2.3 N mm⁻² for apple-based panels, while modulus of elasticity was 2576 ± 140 N mm⁻² for plum-based panels and 2432 ± 345 N mm⁻², which fulfills the mechanical requirements for panels of furniture production and interior equipment purposes which of this kind of materials is modulus of rupture of 11 N mm⁻² and modulus of elasticity of 1600 N mm⁻². The results showed in general, a good performance of the composite materials elaborated from waste biomass, thus offering a potential revalorization of a rather undervalued by-product.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMalus domestica 3abark 3abiomass 3abulk density 3adrilling 3aequipment 3afruit trees 3amodulus of elasticity 3amodulus of rupture 3aorchards 3aparticleboards 3aplums 3apruning 3araw materials 3asoftwood 3awastes 3awater uptake 3awood chips1 aSzymanowski, Karol1 aKozlowski, Piotr1 aKukula, Wojciech1 aSala, Conrad1 aRobles Boza, Eduardo,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8888-081X1 aCzarniak, Pawel0 tWaste and biomass valorization.g2020 June, v. 11, no. 6 p.2877-2886dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:6304x1877-26417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12649-018-00568-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02070naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245006600166300001600232520103200248592002801280650001601308650001201324650001801336650001601354650002001370650001301390650002601403650001501429700001301444700001801457700001301475773014401488856007901632852000901711655001201720IND60347072020221118081203.0150812e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034707202DNAL7 a10.1111/1541-4337.121442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSadekuzzaman, M.10aCurrent and Recent Advanced Strategies for Combating Biofilms  ap. 491-509.  aBiofilms are matrix‐enclosed microbial aggregates that adhere to a biological or nonbiological surface. Biofilm formation is a significant problem in the medical, food, and marine industries and can lead to substantial economic and health problems. The complex microbial community of a biofilm is highly resistant to antibiotics and sanitizers and confers persistent survival that is a challenge to overcome. There are several conventional approaches to combating biofilms, physical and/or mechanical removal, chemical removal, and the use of antimicrobials, sanitizers, or disinfectants to kill biofilm organisms. However, biofilms are highly resistant to these approaches as opposed to planktonic cells. Thus, novel approaches other than the conventional methods are urgently needed. In this review, we discuss current and new advanced antibiofilm strategies that are superior to the conventional method in terms of addressing the biofilm problem for the improvement of healthcare, food safety, and in industrial processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotics 3abiofilm 3adisinfectants 3afood safety 3ahealth services 3aindustry 3amicrobial communities 3asanitizers1 aYang, S.1 aMizan, M.F.R.1 aHa, S.D.0 tComprehensive reviews in food science and food safety.g2015 July, v. 14, no. 4 p.491-509dInstitute of Food Technologistsx1541-43377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1541-4337.121443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03108naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245015200172300001600324520172400340536013802064592002802202596001602230596002702246650001702273650001302290650001302303651001102316653001602327653002602343653001902369653002702388700001702415700001702432700002002449700002202469773012402491856008602615852000902701655001202710IND60699444120221118235936.0220930e20200503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069944412DNAL7 a10.1080/13416979.2020.17620262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Chih-Hsin10aEffects of typhoon disturbances on seasonal and interannual patterns of litterfall on coniferous and broadleaf plantations in Xitou, central Taiwan  ap. 155-162.  aMany environmental and climatic disturbances can significantly change the magnitude and pattern of litterfall. This study investigated the effects of typhoon disturbances on the seasonal and interannual patterns of litterfall on coniferous and broadleaf plantation stands in Xitou, central Taiwan. Throughout the study period from 2012 to 2018, typhoon disturbances were recorded in 4 of these 7 years, whereas only minor or even no typhoon disturbances occurred in the other 3 years. Our results demonstrated that the pattern of monthly litterfall varied substantially between the coniferous and broadleaf stands. The coniferous stands exhibited a substantial litterfall pulse due to typhoon disturbances. By contrast, typhoon disturbances exerted a minor impact on the broadleaf stands. The litterfall seasonality of the coniferous stands was higher than that of the broadleaf stands, especially in the years with typhoon disturbances. Furthermore, the yearly variation caused by typhoon disturbances was distinct at the coniferous stands; the annual litterfall mass at the coniferous stands in the years with typhoon disturbances was more than twice as high as that in the years without typhoon disturbances, namely 6,000 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ versus 2,500 kg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹. By contrast, the annual litterfall mass at the broadleaf stands did not differ significantly among the study years. Because of high interannual variation, long-term sampling is essential for accurate estimation of annual litterfall at coniferous stands. For broadleaf plantations, interannual litterfall variation seems less critical, and spatial variability should be considered because of higher variability in terms of site conditions.  aThis work was supported by the RFBR and MOST [18-54-52005]; Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan (TW) [107-2923-B-002-002-MY3].  aPublisher supplied data  a18-54-52005  a107-2923-B-002-002-MY3 3aplant litter 3aresearch 3atyphoons 3aTaiwan 0aSeasonality 0ainterannual variation 0aJapanese cedar 0amonoculture plantation1 aLee, Chia-Yi1 aLee, Hong-Ru1 aChen, Chiou-Pin1 aMenyailo, Oleg V.0 tJournal of forest research.g2020 May 03, v. 25, no. 3 p.155-162dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl3870061x1610-74037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13416979.2020.17620263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03118naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010700169300001600276520170600292592002801998650002002026650002302046650002202069650002002091650001902111650001502130650001402145653000702159653000802166653000802174653000802182653001202190653002902202653001302231653002002244653001602264653001602280653002702296653002502323653001502348653001802363653002102381700002302402773010502425856008502530852000902615655001202624IND60600331520221118022944.0180703e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060033152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jeconom.2013.08.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Hyun Hak10aForecasting financial and macroeconomic variables using data reduction methods: New empirical evidence  ap. 352-367.  aIn this paper, we empirically assess the predictive accuracy of a large group of models that are specified using principle components and other shrinkage techniques, including Bayesian model averaging and various bagging, boosting, least angle regression and related methods. Our results suggest that model averaging does not dominate other well designed prediction model specification methods, and that using “hybrid” combination factor/shrinkage methods often yields superior predictions. More specifically, when using recursive estimation windows, which dominate other “windowing” approaches, “hybrid” models are mean square forecast error “best” around 1/3 of the time, when used to predict 11 key macroeconomic indicators at various forecast horizons. Baseline linear (factor) models also “win” around 1/3 of the time, as do model averaging methods. Interestingly, these broad findings change noticeably when considering different sub-samples. For example, when used to predict only recessionary periods, “hybrid” models “win” in 7 of 11 cases, when condensing findings across all “windowing” approaches, estimation methods, and models, while model averaging does not “win” in a single case. However, in expansions, and during the 1990s, model averaging wins almost 1/2 of the time. Overall, combination factor/shrinkage methods “win” approximately 1/2 of the time in 4 of 6 different sample periods. Ancillary findings based on our forecasting experiments underscore the advantages of using recursive estimation strategies, and provide new evidence of the usefulness of yield and yield-spread variables in nonlinear prediction model specification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aeconometric models 3aeconomic analysis 3aeconomic theory 3amacroeconomics 3aprediction 3ashrinkage 0aC1 0aC22 0aC52 0aC58 0aBagging 0aBayesian model averaging 0aBoosting 0aDiffusion index 0aElastic net 0aForecasting 0aLeast angle regression 0aNon-negative garotte 0aPrediction 0aReality check 0aRidge regression1 aSwanson, Norman R.0 tJournal of econometrics.g2014 Jan., v. 178 p.352-367dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11871x0304-40767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2013.08.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03674naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001500166245009100181300001800272500001500290520165000305592002801955650004301983650003202026650002202058650002402080650002102104650001702125650000902142650003002151650003102181650001202212650001102224650002102235650002402256650001802280650002902298650002302327650003302350650003002383650003802413650002702451650002202478650002802500650003102528650005402559650001402613650006402627650003202691650002302723650002602746653001002772700001202782700001302794700001602807700001602823773009502839856008102934852000903015655001203024IND50067877020221122132510.0150207e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006787702DNAL7 a234943902pmid7 a10.1007/s00299-013-1413-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Wenli,10aCloning and characterisation of a phenylalanine ammonia-lyase gene from Rhus chinensis  ap. 1179-1190.  a2019-12-06  aKEY MESSAGE : The gene and cDNA sequence encoding PAL from Chinese medicinal plant Rhus chinensis were cloned and analyzed, furthermore the biochemical properties, kinetic parameters, differential expression and key sites were studied. Rhus chinensis is a well-known Chinese medicinal plant. Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) is the first enzyme of phenylpropanoid pathway. Several recent studies suggested that PAL also play an important role in plant–aphid interaction. In this study, both the cDNA and the genomic sequence encoding PAL from Rhus chinensis (designated as RcPAL) were cloned and analyzed. The 3,833 bp gene contained a 1,342 bp intron and two extrons. The ORF was 2,124 bp and predicted to encode a 707-amino acid polypeptide. The results of real-time PCR showed that RcPAL expressed in all tested tissues and followed the order: stems > young leaves > petioles > roots > seeds > mature leaves. RcPAL was successfully expressed in E. coli with the pET-28a-RcPAL recombinant vector. The recombinant protein exhibited a high level of PAL activity. Biochemical properties and kinetic parameters of recombinant RcPAL were further studied. The results showed that the optimal temperature and pH for RcPAL activity were 45 °C and 9.0, and the Kₘand Kcₐₜvalues were 7.90 mM and 52.31 s⁻¹, respectively. The active sites and substrate selectivity site were also investigated with site-directed mutagenesis methods, suggesting that Phe¹²⁶is responsible for the substrate selectivity. To our knowledge, this was the first full-length PAL gene cloned and characterized from the family Anacardiaceae so far.  aPublisher supplied data 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3acomplementary DNA 3aopen reading frames 3amedicinal plants 3aactive sites 3aRhus 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3agene expression regulation 3aintrons 3aleaves 3aEscherichia coli 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aChromatography, Affinity 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Plantxgenetics 2aModels, Molecular 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutagenesis, Site-Directed 2aPhenylalanine Ammonia-Lyasexchemistryxgenetics. 2aPhylogeny 2aRecombinant Proteinsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aRhusxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aSequence Alignment 2aSubstrate Specificity 0agenes1 aWu, Min1 aWu, Yang1 aRen, ZhuMei1 aZhong, Yang0 tPlant cell reports.g2013 Aug., v. 32, no. 8 p.1179-1190dSpringer-Verlagx0721-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00299-013-1413-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03206naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245014700167300002000314520171900334592002802053650002302081650003702104650001102141650001102152650001702163650002802180650002102208650001102229650001902240650001202259650002202271650001802293650001402311650002302325650001302348650001202361650002102373650003702394650001102431700002102442700002002463700002002483773013002503856008202633852000902715655001202724IND60564274620221117174740.0170307e20150910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056427462DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b011782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalomino, Javier10aStudy of the Structural Changes Undergone by Hybrid Nanostructured Si-CNTs Employed as an Anode Material in a Rechargeable Lithium-Ion Battery  ap. 21125-21134.  aSilicon–carbon nanotube (Si-CNT) hybrid structures have been fabricated in a single step on Cu substrate by hot filament chemical vapor deposition (HFCVD). A mixture of straight chain saturated aliphatic polymer and Si nanoparticles was used as the seeding source. The material was analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), and the Si content in the Si-CNT was estimated to be ∼15% wt % by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Thereafter, the films were used for lithium-ion battery (LIB) anodes, whose cyclic voltammetry studies show redox peaks for Si and C consistent with lithium insertion/extraction, indicating good reversibility over extensive cycling. Electrochemical tests showed that Si-CNT electrodes can deliver an initial high discharge capacity of ∼700 mAh/g and a reversible capacity of ∼500 mAh/g over 520 cycles. After electrochemical cycling, the Si-CNTs were analyzed and compared to pristine material. The cycled films showed an increment of Si-CNT diameter and negligible cracks, formed due to high volumetric expansion of the silicon upon lithiation. Micro-Raman spectroscopy performed before electrochemical cycling established the presence of crystalline Si nanoparticles (<10 nm), and amorphous Si particles still bound to CNT after cycling. These results were confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). After cycling, the films showed good contact with the Cu substrate, and delamination was not observed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The Si-CNT hybrid structure grown in a single step represents a promising anode material for a rechargeable LIB with high energy density and long cycling stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aanodes 3acopper 3adelamination 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3ananoparticles 3ananotubes 3aphysical chemistry 3apolymers 3asilicon 3athermogravimetry 3atransmission electron microscopy 3avapors1 aVarshney, Deepak1 aWeiner, Brad R.1 aMorell, Gerardo0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2015 Sept. 10, v. 119, no. 36 p.21125-21134dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.5b011783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03093naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001300144245013300157300001800290520163200308592002801940650003301968650002702001650001602028650001902044650002102063650002802084650000902112650001602121650001202137650003102149650001002180650001102190650001302201650001602214650001002230650001802240650002002258650002802278650002602306700002202332700001502354700002102369700001602390773010602406856007802512852000902590655001202599IND60347072720221118081204.0150812e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034707272DNAL7 a10.1002/mnfr.2014009182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBai, Jie10aBranched‐chain amino acids modulate the expression of hepatic fatty acid metabolism‐related genes in female broiler chickens  ap. 1171-1181.  aSCOPE: The effects and roles of branched‐chain amino acids (BCAAs) in hepatic fat metabolism are still unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: Here, we used broiler chickens, in which lipogenesis occurs essentially in the liver as in human, to investigate the effects of three levels of BCAAs (control “C,” low “L” and exogenous supplemented diet “L+S”) on growth, carcass traits, immunity, and hepatic fat metabolism. Despite the same productive performance, immunity, and plasma BCAA levels between all groups, low BCAA levels significantly downregulated the hepatic expression of lipogenic genes particularly acetyl‐CoA carboxylase alpha (ACCα) and stearoyl‐coA desaturase 1 (p = 0.0036 and p = 0.0008, respectively) and upregulated the hepatic expression of mitochondrial β‐oxidation‐ (uncoupling protein and NRF‐1, p < 0.05) and dynamic‐related genes (DNM1, p < 0.05). Concomitant with these changes, low BCAA levels increased the phosphorylation of AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK)αᵀʰʳ¹⁷², ACCαSᵉʳ⁷⁹, and forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1Sᵉʳ²⁵⁶) and decreased the phosphorylation of mTORSᵉʳ²⁴⁸¹ and P70 S6 kinase ᵀʰʳ³⁸⁹. The mRNA abundance of the transcription factors SREBP1/2, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha/beta, and FoxO1 were also increased in the liver of L group compared to the control. CONCLUSION: Together our data indicate that low BCAA levels inhibit fatty acid synthesis and enhanced fatty acid β‐oxidation in the liver of female broiler chickens and these effects were probably mediated through AMPK‐mTOR‐FoxO1 pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAMP-activated protein kinase 3aacetyl-CoA carboxylase 3aamino acids 3abeta oxidation 3abroiler chickens 3acarcass characteristics 3adiet 3afatty acids 3afemales 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahumans 3aimmunity 3alipogenesis 3aliver 3amessenger RNA 3aphosphorylation 3astearoyl-CoA desaturase 3atranscription factors1 aGreene, Elizabeth1 aLi, Weifen1 aKidd, Michael T.1 aDridi, Sami0 tMolecular nutrition & food research.g2015 June, v. 59, no. 6 p.1171-1181dWiley-VCHx1613-41257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mnfr.2014009183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02608naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245008200168300001600250520138800266592002801654650002801682650001401710650001101724650002401735650001301759650000701772650002401779650001601803653002201819653001901841653002601860653002001886653001301906700001501919700001601934700001501950700001401965773011201979856008602091852000902177655001202186IND60600223020221119070111.0180703e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060022302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2014.03.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeziani, D.10aHydrogen evolution under visible light over LaCoO3 prepared by chemical route  ap. 244-249.  aThe semiconducting properties of the perovskite LaCoO3, prepared by nitrate route, are investigated for the first time by the photo-electrochemical technique. The oxide shows a direct optical transition at 1.33eV, due to Co³⁺: 3d orbital splitting in octahedral site and possesses a chemical stability over a fair pH range (4–14). The conductivity follows an exponential type law with a hole mobility (8.3×10⁻²cm²V⁻¹s⁻¹), thermally activated. The Mott–Schottky plot in KOH medium is characteristic of p type conduction with a flat band potential of 0 VSCE and a holes density of 1.35×10¹⁷cm⁻³. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy reveals the predominance of the bulk and grains boundaries contributions with a constant phase element and a multi-relaxation type nature. As application, the hydrogen evolution upon visible light is demonstrated on the hetero-junction LaCoO3/SnO2. The best performance occurs at pH∼12.8 with an evolution rate of 0.25cm³min⁻¹ (mg LaCoO3)⁻¹ and a quantum yield of 0.11%. The improved activity is attributed to the wide depletion width of ∼10nm and the potential of the conduction band of LaCoO3 (−1.34VSCE), more negative than that of SnO2, the latter acts as electrons bridge for the interfacial water reduction. The relevance of 3d orbital of the performance of semi conducting photoelectrode is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrons 3agrains 3ahydrogen production 3anitrates 3apH 3apotassium hydroxide 3atin dioxide 0aPerovskite LaCoO3 0aChemical route 0aPhoto-electrochemical 0aHetero-junction 0aHydrogen1 aReziga, A.1 aRekhila, G.1 aBellal, B.1 aTrari, M.0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2014 June, v. 82 p.244-249dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2014.03.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02014naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245006900175300001600244520092700260592002801187650001801215650002401233650001201257650002801269650001301297650002401310653002001334653001601354653003701370653002601407700001501433700001601448773009001464856008901554852000901643655001201652IND60601666920221118012113.0180706e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060166692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2014.06.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChakladar, N.D.10aEffects of inter-tow angle and tow size on carbon fibre friction  ap. 115-124.  aFriction plays an important role in the processing behaviour of fabrics or prepregs into geometries that require significant inter-ply and intra-ply movements. In previous studies, coefficient of friction is generally assumed to be constant. This paper presents a detailed experimental investigation of the frictional behaviour of carbon fibres at meso-scale. The inter-tow angle was found to have a significant effect on the tow friction when the fibres are parallel; whereas the effect of tow size was marginal. A numerical model was developed to investigate inter-filament friction from tow friction using finite element analysis. The filament-to-pulley friction was found to have a significant effect on the overall load–displacement behaviour, unlike the filament-to-filament friction. A range of intra-tow filament-to-filament friction coefficient was also indicated within which the inter-filament slippage began.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon fibers 3acomposite materials 3afabrics 3afinite element analysis 3afriction 3amathematical models 0aA.

The image of the fabric under the single focus image cannot achieve a uniform focus in the whole field of vision, which leads to the blurring of some regions. A new method of multi-focus image fusion based on the Geronimo-Hardin-Massopust (GHM) multiwavelet transform is introduced in this article, which realizes the digital image fusion of a sequence of images taken at different focus settings to achieve a clearer focus fusion of the fiber mesh showing the full field of view within a single image. In this article, a self-built nonwovens micro imaging system is used to collect the image sequence of the fabric at different focus images, and the initial image sequence is processed by critical sampling prefiltering. The high and low frequency components of the image are processed by different fusion rules, and the fusion image of the initial fabric is obtained through the fusion of multiwavelets and inverse transformation. Then, the fusion image of the initial fabric and the subsequent focus image are fused, using the above method, and all the fiber areas after the fusion can be clearly shown to end the operating. Experiments show that the fusion method can solve the difficulty of accurate focusing in a single image with full field of vision.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017RC432017cTalents Action Program of Shanghai University of Engineering Science  a61876106cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a18ZR1416600cShanghai Natural Science Fundation  a2018xk-B-09cPattern Recognition and Intelligent System Discipline Construction  a2017RC432017cSUES(Shanghai University of Engineering Science) Talents action program 3adigital images 3aimage analysis 3anonwoven fabrics 3atextile fibers 0afabrication 0afiber 0ayarn 0afabric formation 0amaterials 0ameasurement 0amulti-focus image fusion 0anonwovens 0astructure-properties 0atesting1 aDeng, Na1 aXin, Binjie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6006-547X1 aXing, Wenyu1 aZhang, Zhengye0 tTextile research journal.g2019 July, v. 89, no. 14 p.2870-2879dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x1746-77487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175188037933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02605naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245011100166520139900277592002801676650001701704650002301721650001201744650002301756650002201779650001101801650001701812650001501829650001101844650003201855700002501887700003301912700002401945700002201969700002001991773012402011856007502135852000902210655001202219IND60794290120221121020724.0220922e20220916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079429012DNAL7 a10.3390/nu141838372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMonroy-Gomez, Jimena 10aSmall and Medium Enterprises’ Perspectives on Food Fortification Amid the Growing Burden of Malnutrition  aThe need for a profound food system transformation has never been greater. The growing burden of malnutrition has become the new normal, with two billion people who are overweight, over 140 million children under five who are stunted and over two billion people affected by hidden hunger. Food fortification has been recognized as a cost-effective strategy to address micronutrient deficiencies. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) play a strategic role in the food supply chain in low- and middle-income countries, accounting for over 80% of food sales. It is therefore critical to create an enabling environment to facilitate SMEs’ involvement in food fortification practices as a potential solution to tackle all forms of malnutrition. This review highlights SMEs’ relevance as agents of change in the food system through food fortification practices and their indirect yet key role in producing nutritious, tasty and affordable foods. It discusses their challenges (e.g., access to long-term finance, sustainable technical assistance, limited capacity), presents solutions and discusses how different actors can help SMEs to overcome these challenges. Furthermore, it presents a relevant public–private partnership case study to demonstrate how SMEs can address the growing burden of malnutrition through food fortification practices, nutrient profiling schemes and demand generation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acost effectiveness 3afinance 3afood fortification 3afood supply chain 3ahunger 3amalnutrition 3aoverweight 3apeople 3apublic-private partnerships1 aFerraboschi, Chiara 1 avan Zutphen, Kesso Gabrielle1 aGavin-Smith, Breda 1 aAmanquah, Daniel 1 aKraemer, Klaus 0 tNutrients.g2022 Sept. 16, v. 14, no. 18dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu141838373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02541naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245011100162520131900273592002801592650002001620650001201640650000901652650003301661650001501694650001101709650000901720650000901729650001101738650002401749650001101773700002201784700002601806700002701832700002301859700002001882700002101902773012401923856007502047852000902122655001202131IND60794290220221121005512.0220922e20220916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079429022DNAL7 a10.3390/nu141838382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarray, Amelia J.10aHealthy and Sustainable Diet Index: Development, Application and Evaluation Using Image-Based Food Records  aThere are limited methods to assess how dietary patterns adhere to a healthy and sustainable diet. The aim of this study was to develop a theoretically derived Healthy and Sustainable Diet Index (HSDI). The HSDI uses 12 components within five categories related to environmental sustainability: animal-based foods, seasonal fruits and vegetables, ultra-processed energy-dense nutrient-poor foods, packaged foods and food waste. A maximum of 90 points indicates the highest adherence. The HSDI was applied to 4-day mobile food records (mFRᵀᴹ) from 247 adults (18–30 years). The mean HSDI score was 42.7 (SD 9.3). Participants who ate meat were less likely to eat vegetables (p < 0.001) and those who ate non-animal protein foods were more likely to eat more fruit (p < 0.001), vegetables (p < 0.05), and milk, yoghurt and cheese (p < 0.05). After adjusting for age, sex and body mass index, multivariable regression found the strongest predictor of the likelihood of being in the lowest total HSDI score tertile were people who only took a bit of notice [OR (95%CI) 5.276 (1.775, 15.681) p < 0.005] or did not pay much/any attention to the health aspects of their diet [OR (95%CI) 8.308 (2.572, 26.836) p < 0.0001]. HSDI provides a new reference standard to assess adherence to a healthy and sustainable diet.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody mass index 3acheeses 3adiet 3aenvironmental sustainability 3afood waste 3afruits 3ameat 3amilk 3apeople 3areference standards 3ayogurt1 aBoushey, Carol J.1 aPollard, Christina M.1 aDhaliwal, Satvinder S.1 aMukhtar, Syed Aqif1 aDelp, Edward J.1 aKerr, Deborah A.0 tNutrients.g2022 Sept. 16, v. 14, no. 18dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu141838383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02979naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001700141245012400158500001400282520173000296592002802026650001302054650001402067650001002081650001402091650001002105650001302115650001002128650004002138651001002178700001402188700001902202700001802221700001502239700001802254700001902272700001302291700001802304700001802322773012102340856007502461852000902536655001202545IND60711609920221121204651.0200928e20200908xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071160992DNAL7 a10.3390/ani100915992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Meilin 10aSelection Signatures Analysis Reveals Genes Associated with High-Altitude Adaptation in Tibetan Goats from Nagqu, Tibet  aNAL-light  aTibetan goat is an ancient breed, which inhabits the adverse conditions of the plateaus in China. To investigate the role of selection in shaping its genomes, we genotyped Tibetan goats (Nagqu Prefecture, above 4500 m) and three lowland populations (Xinjiang goats, Taihang goats and Huanghuai goats). The result of PCA, neighbor-joining (N-J) tree and model-based clustering showed that the genetic structure between the Tibetan goat and the three lowland populations has significant difference. As demonstrated by the di statistic, we found that some genes were related to the high-altitude adaptation of Tibetan goats. Functional analysis revealed that these genes were enriched in the VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) signaling pathway and melanoma, suggesting that nine genes (FGF2, EGFR, AKT1, PTEN, MITF, ENPEP, SIRT6, KDR, and CDC42) might have important roles in the high-altitude adaptation of Nagqu Tibetan goats. We also found that the LEPR gene was under the strongest selection (di value = 16.70), and it could induce upregulation of the hypoxic ventilatory response. In addition, five genes (LEPR, LDB1, EGFR, NOX4 and FGF2) with high di values were analyzed using q-PCR. Among them, we found that LEPR, LDB1 and FGF2 exhibited higher expression in the lungs of the Tibetan goats; LEPR, EGFR and LDB1 exhibited higher expression in the hearts of the Huanghuai goat. Our results suggest that LEPR, LDB1, EGFR and FGF2 genes may be related to the high-altitude adaptation of the goats. These findings improve our understanding of the selection of the high-altitude adaptability of the Nagqu Tibetan goats and provide new theoretical knowledge for the conservation and utilization of germplasm resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3abreathing 3agenes 3agermplasm 3agoats 3amelanoma 3atrees 3avascular endothelial growth factors 3aChina1 aLu, Jian 1 aFei, Xiaojuan 1 aLü, Zengkui,1 aQuan, Kai 1 aLiu, Yongbin 1 aChu, Mingxing 1 aDi, Ran 1 aWei, Caihong 1 aWang, Huihua 0 tAnimals.g2020 Sept. 08, v. 10, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani100915993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02870naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005600152245010200208300001600310520145200326592002801778650001901806650002501825650001401850650001501864650001101879650001701890650001801907650003001925650001701955650001901972650001101991650000902002650001102011650000902022650001402031650001902045651001002064653002602074653002402100653002602124653001002150700002102160773011202181856008602293852000902379655001202388IND60600223220221119070324.0180703e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060022322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2014.03.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Boqiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0992-181312aA revisit of fossil-fuel subsidies in China: Challenges and opportunities for energy price reform  ap. 124-134.  aFossil-fuel subsidies contribute to the extensive growth of energy demand and the related carbon dioxide emissions in China. However, the process of energy price reform is slow, even though China faces increasing problems of energy scarcity and environmental deterioration. This paper focuses on analyzing fossil fuel subsidies in China by estimating subsidies scale and the implications for future reform. We begin by measuring fossil-fuel subsidies and the effects of subsidy removal in a systematic fashion during 2006–2010 using a price-gap approach. Results indicate that the oil price reform in 2009 significantly reduced China’s fossil-fuel subsidies and modified the subsidy structure. Fossil-fuel subsidies scale in China was 881.94 billion CNY in 2010, which was lower than the amount in 2006, equivalent to 2.59% of the GDP. The macro-economic impacts of removing fossil-fuel subsidies are then evaluated by the computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. Results demonstrate that the economic growth and employment will be negatively affected as well as energy demand, carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide emissions. Finally, policy implications are suggested: first, risks of government pricing of energy are far from negligible; second, an acceptable macroeconomic impact is a criterion for energy price reform in China; third, the future energy policy should focus on designing transparent, targeted and efficient energy subsidies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aeconomic development 3aemissions 3aemployment 3aenergy 3aenergy costs 3aenergy policy 3aenvironmental degradation 3afossil fuels 3amacroeconomics 3amodels 3aoils 3aprices 3arisk 3asubsidies 3asulfur dioxide 3aChina 0aFossil-fuel subsidies 0aEnergy price reform 0aMacroeconomic impacts 0aChina1 aOuyang, Xiaoling0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2014 June, v. 82 p.124-134dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2014.03.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01510naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002200142245006400164300001600228500001500244520046700259592002800726650002100754650001300775650002000788650001500808650001700823650001200840651001000852653001500862700002400877700002200901700002100923773011700944856007801061852000901139655001201148IND60131608920221121172532.0151127e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013160892DNAL7 a10.3398/064.073.03142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPitts, Richard M.10aEvidence of Hantavirus Exposure in Rodents From North Texas  ap. 386-391.  a2019-12-04  aBetween 27 June 1997 and 16 May 1999, 423 rodents were collected from North Texas (Collin, Denton, and Grayson counties) by using Sherman live-traps (trapping success rate ∼22%).

Whether hyperuricemia is an independent risk factor for renal progression and whether there are sex differences in the relationships between serum uric acid (UA) and a decline in renal function are unclear. Therefore, in this longitudinal study, we aimed to explore these relationships in a large cohort of around 27,000 Taiwanese participants in the Taiwan Biobank (TWB), and also to identify serum UA cutoff levels in men and women to predict new-onset CKD. A total of 26,942 participants with a median 4 years of complete follow-up data were enrolled from the TWB. We excluded those with CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m²) at baseline (n = 297), and the remaining 26,645 participants (males: 9356; females: 17,289) were analyzed. The participants who developed CKD during follow-up were defined as having incident new-onset CKD, and those with a serum UA level >7 mg/dL in males and >6 mg/dL in females were classified as having hyperuricemia. After multivariable analysis, hyperuricemia (odds ratio [OR], 2.541; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.970–3.276; p < 0.001) was significantly associated with new-onset CKD. Furthermore, in the male participants (n = 9356), hyperuricemia (OR, 1.989; 95% CI, 1.440–2.747; p < 0.001), and quartile 4 of UA (vs. quartile 1; OR, 2.279; 95% CI, 1.464–3.547; p < 0.001) were significantly associated with new-onset CKD, while in the female participants (n = 17,289), hyperuricemia (OR, 3.813; 95% CI, 2.500–5.815; p < 0.001), quartile 3 of UA (vs. quartile 1; OR, 3.741; 95% CI, 1.250–11.915; p = 0.018), and quartile 4 of UA (vs. quartile 1; OR, 12.114; 95% CI, 14.278–34.305; p < 0.001) were significantly associated with new-onset CKD. There were significant interactions between hyperuricemia and sex (p = 0.024), and quartiles of serum UA and sex (p = 0.010) on new-onset CKD. Hyperuricemia was associated with new-onset CKD in the enrolled participants, and the interactions between hyperuricemia and sex were statistically significant. Hyperuricemia was more strongly associated with new-onset CKD in the women than in the men.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3aconfidence interval 3afemales 3aglomerular filtration rate 3ahyperuricemia 3akidney diseases 3alongitudinal studies 3amales 3aodds ratio 3arisk factors 3auric acid 3aTaiwan1 aTsai, Chun-Chi 1 aLiu, Yi-Hsueh 1 aWu, Pei-Yu 1 aHuang, Jiun-Chi 1 aChung, Tung-Ling 1 aSu, Ho-Ming 1 aChen, Szu-Chia 0 tNutrients.g2022 Sept. 16, v. 14, no. 18dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu141838323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02491naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001400142245014500156300002000301520152000321592002801841650001601869650002801885650002501913700002801938700002601966773013401992856007802126852000902204655001202213IND60541601720221121074451.0160822e20150826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054160172DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.5b057612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Li14aThe Origin of the Odd–Even Effect in the Tunneling Rates across EGaIn Junctions with Self-Assembled Monolayers (SAMs) of n-Alkanethiolates  ap. 10659-10667.  aOdd–even effects in molecular junctions with self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of n-alkanethiolates have been rarely observed. It is challenging to pinpoint the origin of odd–even effects and address the following question: are the odd–even effects an interface effect, caused by the intrinsic properties of the SAMs, or a combination of both? This paper describes the odd–even effects in SAM-based tunnel junctions of the form Agᴬ⁻ᵀS-SCₙ//GaOₓ/EGaIn junctions with a large range of molecular lengths (n = 2 to 18) that are characterized by both AC and DC methods along with a detailed statistical analysis of the data. This combination of techniques allowed us to separate interface effects from the contributions of the SAMs and to show that the odd–even effect observed in the value of J obtained by DC-methods are caused by the intrinsic properties of the SAMs. Impedance spectroscopy (an AC technique) allowed us to analyze the SAM resistance (RSAM), SAM capacitance (CSAM), and contact resistance, within the junctions separately. We found clear odd–even effects in the values of both RSAM and CSAM, but the odd–even effect in contact resistance is very weak (and not responsible for the observed odd–even effect in the current densities obtained by J(V) measurements). Therefore, the odd–even effects in Agᴬ⁻ᵀS-SCₙ//GaOₓ/EGaIn junctions are attributed to the properties of the SAMs and SAM–electrode interactions which both determine the shape of the tunneling barrier.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3adielectric spectroscopy 3astatistical analysis1 aSangeeth, C.

Here, a double extraction method was presented to evaluate fabric wrinkling based on the wrinkling-induced residual force–displacement curves. The correlation analysis was used to determine applicable evaluation indices in order to cluster the wrinkle recovery property of fabrics based on a K-means clustering algorithm. Moreover, subjective judgements were conducted and compared with the objective K-means cluster method. The results show that there is good consistency between objective K-means clustering and subjective judgements, indicating that the indices featured from wrinkling-induced residual force–displacement curves can be used to evaluate the wrinkle recovery of fabrics. Therefore, the double extraction method is a starting point for the rapid identification of wrinkle recovery of fabrics by the mechanical performance of textiles.  aPublisher supplied data  a11802104cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a2017YFB0309200cNational Key Research and Development Program  aJUSRP11803cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities  cNatural Science Funds of Jiangsu Province 3aaesthetics 3aalgorithms 3aclothing 3afabrics 3atextile fibers 0afabric wrinkle 0adouble extraction method 0acurve parameters 0acluster analysis1 aGuo, Mingrui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7336-04401 aHu, Xiaorui1 aWang, Lei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7700-45311 aGao, Weidong0 tTextile research journal.g2019 Aug., v. 89, no. 15 p.2973-2982dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x1746-77487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175188053723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02844naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245010200169300001400271520135300285592002801638650001301666650002901679650000901708650002001717650002101737650001901758650001301777650002301790650001901813650002101832650001001853650002001863650001901883650002101902650001201923650001401935653001401949653002101963653001701984653002902001653002102030653002102051700002002072700002102092700002402113773009302137856008702230852000902317655001202326IND60642863120221120230629.0190726e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064286312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cryobiol.2019.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJara, Belén10aPositive effect of butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) on the quality of cryopreserved cat spermatozoa  ap. 76-81.  aThe semen cryopreservation processes are associated with state of oxidative stress induced by high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), causing damage to functional spermatozoa.

Semen samples were frozen in Tris-fructose-citric acid-based extender, supplemented with different concentrations of BHT (0.5 mM, 1.0 mM and 2.0 mM) and a control sample without antioxidant. After thawing, sperm samples were assessed for motility by computer‐assisted sperm analysis and viability, acrosome integrity, superoxide anion production and membrane lipid peroxidation status by flow cytometry. In the study, the parameters of sperm motility and acrosome integrity were significantly higher in 2.0 mM BHT compared to sperm frozen in the extender with other concentrations and control (P < 0.05), in addition, this concentration reduced significantly the superoxide anion production and lipid peroxidation of the sperm. The results demonstrated that the supplementation of BHT to the freezing extender could protect the function and cellular structure of domestic cat sperm from cryoinjuries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrosome 3abutylated hydroxytoluene 3acats 3acell structures 3acryopreservation 3aflow cytometry 3afreezing 3alipid peroxidation 3aneutralization 3aoxidative stress 3asemen 3asemen extenders 3asperm motility 3asuperoxide anion 3athawing 3aviability 0aCat sperm 0aCryopreservation 0aAntioxidants 0aButylated hydroxytoluene 0aOxidative damage 0aSperm parameters1 aMerino, Osvaldo1 aSánchez, Raúl,1 aRisopatrón, Jennie0 tCryobiology.g2019 Aug., v. 89 p.76-81dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45487x0011-22407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cryobiol.2019.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03478naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013000165300001400295520166900309592002801978650002502006650002202031650001402053650001102067650001602078650001602094650001902110650002702129650001202156650001602168650002602184650001802210650001702228650000902245650001702254651001002271653001402281653003202295653003202327653003302359653002602392653002302418700002202441700002402463700002202487700002102509700002202530700002002552700002002572700001902592700001902611700002002630700002002650773010302670856008202773852000902855655001202864IND60533499620221122175320.0190403e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053349962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2014.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKubo, Katashi10aAnalyses and countermeasures for decreasing radioactive cesium in buckwheat in areas affected by the nuclear accident in 2011  ap. 40-46.  aTokyo Electric Power Company's Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant released radioactive cesium (Cs) into the environment after the Great East Japan Earthquake of March 11, 2011. After radioactive Cs fell onto agricultural fields, radioactive nuclide levels in some buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) grain subsequently exceeded new standard limits for radioactive materials, including that for radioactive Cs (100Bqkg−1) established by the Japanese government in 2012. A survey of soils and buckwheat grain from 68 farmers’ fields in 2012 revealed that soil exchangeable potassium (K) concentration was significantly and negatively correlated with radioactive Cs concentration in the grain. The effect of K application on the reduction of radioactive Cs concentration in the grain was confirmed by pot and field experiments conducted respectively in 2012 and 2013. This effect might result from the similarity of ion forms of K and Cs and/or the lower exchangeable Cs concentrations at higher exchangeable K concentrations in soil. Based on these results, farmers were recommended to establish a soil exchangeable K concentration of 250mgkg−1 (300mgkg−1 in K2O) before applying basal fertilizer. After this recommendation, the soil K concentrations of farmers’ fields increased, causing an overall decrease in radioactive Cs concentrations of buckwheat grain produced in 2013. Consequently, no grain sample from this year exceeded the standard limits for radioactive Cs level across the affected area in Japan. These efforts contributed greatly to the rehabilitation and reconstruction of agriculture in the area contaminated with radioactive Cs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagopyrum esculentum 3aagricultural land 3abuckwheat 3acesium 3acorrelation 3aearthquakes 3aelectric power 3aexchangeable potassium 3afarmers 3afertilizers 3afield experimentation 3anuclear power 3apower plants 3asoil 3asoil surveys 3aJapan 0aBuckwheat 0aFagopyrum esculentum Moench 0aGreat East Japan Earthquake 0aNuclear power plant accident 0aPotassium application 0aRadioactive cesium1 aNemoto, Kazutoshi1 aKobayashi, Hiroyuki1 aKuriyama, Yasushi1 aHarada, Hirohide1 aMatsunami, Hisaya1 aEguchi, Tetsuya1 aKihou, Nobuharu1 aŌta, Takeshi,1 aKeitoku, Shoji1 aKimura, Takeshi1 aShinano, Takuro0 tField crops research.g2015 Jan., v. 170 p.40-46dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl10215x0378-42907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2014.10.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04040naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245011200172300001600284520213700300592002802437650001102465650001402476650002002490650001902510650002202529650002602551650001202577650001602589650002602605650001902631650001402650650002302664650002002687650001502707650001802722650001602740650001902756650001102775650001202786650002602798650002002824650001302844650001002857650001802867650001702885651001002902653001802912653002102930653001402951653002202965653001902987653001003006653000803016653000803024653000903032653000703041653000803048653000903056653000703065653000803072700002003080700002203100773010503122856008203227852000903309655001203318IND60533499720221122175348.0190403e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053349972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2014.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarinaccio, Federico10aEnhancing grain yield and quality of winter barley through agronomic strategies to prolong canopy greenness  ap. 109-118.  aAn agronomic improvement in grain yield and quality in winter wheat could be obtained through the application of strategies, such as application of foliar fungicides or fertilizers, that protect health of the last leaves and delay the senescence process during ripening. Only a few studies have reported the effect of these practices on barley, although these treatments could represent a new opportunity to specialize in feed and food barley markets and raise farmer profitability.The aim of this study was to compare the effect of different late-season strategies, N and S foliar fertilizers and fungicides applied at barley anthesis, on crop canopy greenness during the ripening stages and to establish the relationship between these strategies and barley yield and quality. Four field experiments have been conducted in NW Italy during 3 growing seasons, according to a full factorial design with four treatments, three barley cultivars and four replications. The following parameters were recorded: canopy greenness, grain yield, test weight (TW), thousand kernel weight (TKW), grain protein content (GPC), foliar disease incidence and severity and deoxynivalenol (DON) contamination. The collected data clearly underline the importance of prolonging canopy greenness of barley in order to increase grain yield and to improve quality. Of all the compared treatments, the application of a fungicide with an azole mixture at anthesis has shown to play the most important role in delaying the senescence process, and has resulted in a higher gran yield (+25%), TW (+1.3kghl−1) and TKW (+2.8g).The effect of the fungicide treatment on barley grain yield was significant for all the compared cultivars and in almost all the environmental conditions, but led to a greater advantage in the cooler environments with prolonged ripening. The fungicide also led to a clear, significant control of foliar disease and a reduction in DON contamination.The use of N and S foliar fertilizers was able to prolong canopy greenness and enhance barley yield and quality but only in environments characterized by a prolonged grain filling period.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanopy 3acultivars 3adata collection 3adeoxynivalenol 3adisease incidence 3aenvironmental factors 3afarmers 3afertilizers 3afield experimentation 3afilling period 3aflowering 3afoliar application 3afoliar diseases 3afungicides 3agrain protein 3agrain yield 3agrowing season 3aleaves 3amarkets 3apesticide application 3aprotein content 3aripening 3aseeds 3awinter barley 3awinter wheat 3aItaly 0aWinter barley 0aCanopy greenness 0aFungicide 0aFoliar fertilizer 0aDeoxynivalenol 0aAUCGC 0aDON 0aFHB 0aGDDs 0aGS 0aGPC 0aSTNB 0aTW 0aTKW1 aReyneri, Amedeo1 aBlandino, Massimo0 tField crops research.g2015 Jan., v. 170 p.109-118dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl10215x0378-42907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2014.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02867naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245013100170300001600301520178400317592002802101650002302129650001802152650002002170650001502190650001102205650003402216650001002250650002102260651001302281651000902294700002902303773009502332856008102427852000902508655001202517IND60524107920221121053514.0160702e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052410792DNAL7 a10.1007/s00267-016-0709-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeisse, Mikaela J.10aConservation Beyond Park Boundaries: The Impact of Buffer Zones on Deforestation and Mining Concessions in the Peruvian Amazon  ap. 297-311.  aMany researchers have tested whether protected areas save tropical forest, but generally focus on parks and reserves, management units that have internationally recognized standing and clear objectives. Buffer zones have received considerably less attention because of their ambiguous rules and often informal status. Although buffer zones are frequently dismissed as ineffective, they warrant attention given the need for landscape-level approaches to conservation and their prevalence around the world—in Peru, buffer zones cover >10 % of the country. This study examines the effectiveness of buffer zones in the Peruvian Amazon to (a) prevent deforestation and (b) limit the extent of mining concessions. We employ covariate matching to determine the impact of 13 buffer zones on deforestation and mining concessions from 2007 to 2012. Despite variation between sites, these 13 buffer zones have prevented ~320 km² of forest loss within their borders during the study period and ~1739 km² of mining concessions, an outcome associated with the special approval process for granting formal concessions in these areas. However, a closer look at the buffer zone around the Tambopata National Reserve reveals the difficulties of controlling illegal and informal activities. According to interviews with NGO employees, government officials, and community leaders, enforcement of conservation is limited by uncertain institutional responsibilities, inadequate budgets, and corruption, although formal and community-based efforts to block illicit mining are on the rise. Landscape-level conservation not only requires clear legal protocol for addressing large-scale, formal extractive activities, but there must also be strategies and coordination to combat illegal activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconservation areas 3adeforestation 3ahuman resources 3ainterviews 3amining 3anongovernmental organizations 3aparks 3atropical forests 3aAmazonia 3aPeru1 aNaughton-Treves, Lisa C.0 tEnvironmental management.g2016 Aug., v. 58, no. 2 p.297-311dSpringer USx0364-152X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-016-0709-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02679naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245016900166300001600335520129700351592002801648650002501676650001301701650002301714650001101737650001801748650003501766650001101801651001101812653002501823653001301848653002401861653002401885653002701909700001901936700002001955700001501975700002001990700002002010773012402030856008202154852000902236655001202245IND60524108120221123000757.0200513e20160801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052410812DNAL7 a10.1007/s10310-016-0525-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChiu, Chen-Wei10aSeasonal changes of azimuthal, radial, and tree-to-tree variations in sap flux affect stand transpiration estimates in a Cryptomeria japonica forest, central Taiwan  ap. 151-160.  aStand transpiration (E) estimated using the sap flux methods is affected by the azimuthal, radial, and tree-to-tree variations of sap flux. Although several studies have examined the relative importance of the three variations in estimating E, the seasonality of the three variations remains unknown. In the current study, we attempted to clarify whether the relative importance of these three variations could show seasonal changes. Using sap flux data measured in a subtropical cloud forest from August 2010 to July 2011, we calculated the differences resulting from omitting the three variations in estimating E. The effects of the three variations in estimating E showed seasonality. The azimuthal and tree-to-tree variations were more pronounced during winter, whereas the radial variation was more pronounced during summer. However, the effect of tree-to-tree variation was consistently much larger than the other two variations throughout the study period. The tree-to-tree variation is more important in estimating E monthly, seasonally and annually than both the azimuthal and radial variations, although all three variations have shown seasonality. In addition, the sensor allocation for summer would be acceptable for the practical estimation of E if aiming at the long time scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryptomeria japonica 3asap flow 3aseasonal variation 3asummer 3atranspiration 3atropical montane cloud forests 3awinter 3aTaiwan 0aCryptomeria japonica 0aSap flux 0aStand transpiration 0aSeasonal variations 0aSources of uncertainty1 aKume, Tomonori1 aKomatsu, Hikaru1 aTseng, Han1 aWey, Tsong-Huei1 aOtsuki, Kyoichi0 tJournal of forest research.g2016 Aug. 1, v. 21, no. 4 p.151-160dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl3870061x1610-74037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10310-016-0525-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04524naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245015900173300001400332520279400346592002803140650001303168650001303181650001103194650001103205650000903216650001503225650002503240650000903265650001203274650001003286650001603296650001003312650001303322650001503335650003403350650002803384650001403412650001403426650001303440650000903453650001603462650002103478650001903499650001203518650001703530650001003547651001303557653001903570653003703589653001903626653001803645653002903663653002403692773010303716856008203819852000903901655001203910IND60533500120221118230106.0190403e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053350012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2014.10.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRusinamhodzi, Leonard10aTinkering on the periphery: Labour burden not crop productivity increased under no-till planting basins on smallholder farms in Murehwa district, Zimbabwe  ap. 66-75.  aNo-till planting basins are promoted using seed and fertiliser inputs as incentives for their widespread uptake in Zimbabwe. The short term effects of planting basins on crop yields and labour requirements were evaluated in an on-farm experiment over two seasons (2009/2010 and 2010/2011) in Murehwa district, Zimbabwe. The experiment was established on clay (Luvisols) and sandy soils (Lixisols), in two field types; outfields (degraded) and homefields (better managed fields). Fields closest to homesteads (homefields) typically receive most nutrients and preferential management, and are more fertile than outlying fields (outfields), with implications for crop production and nutrient use efficiencies. The fertiliser sub-treatments consisted of (a) no fertiliser (control), (b) 60kg N+3tmanureha−1, (c) 60kgNha−1+10kgPha−1 (SSP) and (d) 60kgNha−1+20kgPha−1 (SSP). In addition, a socio-economic survey was carried out to understand the diversity in resource ownership among farmers and to explore whether there was a relationship with uptake of planting basins. Results showed that field type, nutrient application and season had a significant effect on crop yields (p<0.001); there was no significant effect of tillage practice. The largest maize grain yield of 5.6tha−1 was obtained with a combination of manure (3tha−1) and 60kgNha−1 under conventional tillage; the equivalent treatment under planting basins yielded 4.6tha−1 in the 2009–2010 season. Rainfall was poorly distributed in 2010–2011 season and the same treatment gave the largest grain yield of 1.6tha−1 under conventional tillage and 1.2tha−1 under no-till planting basins. Land preparation under conventional tillage required 6mandaysha−1 while planting basins construction required 76.5mandays’ha−1 for the clay soils and 51.5mandaysha−1 for the sandy soils. Weeding in planting basins required 40% more labour compared with conventional tillage (12mandaysha−1) due to greater weed densities associated with early years of no-tillage. Planting basins did not enhance moisture conservation in a the 2010–2011 season when rainfall was poorly distributed as shown by the smaller yields. The increased labour requirements suggested a major impediment to the uptake of planting basins even for farmers without livestock. Farmers differed greatly in resource ownership; four resource groups were identified based on land size, cattle ownership, labour availability and land utilisation. However, the practice of planting basins did not relate to resource ownership due to the incentives provided by the NGOs. Given that planting basins increased the labour burden but not crop yield, and that incentives cannot go on forever, widespread adoption by smallholder farmers seems unlikely.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLixisols 3aLuvisols 3abasins 3acattle 3aclay 3aclay soils 3aconventional tillage 3acorn 3afarmers 3afarms 3agrain yield 3alabor 3aland use 3ano-tillage 3anongovernmental organizations 3anutrient use efficiency 3anutrients 3aownership 3aplanting 3arain 3asandy soils 3asite preparation 3asocioeconomics 3asurveys 3aweed control 3aweeds 3aZimbabwe 0aFarm diversity 0aMaize production intensification 0aNGO incentives 0aLabour inputs 0aSoil fertility gradients 0aNutrient management0 tField crops research.g2015 Jan., v. 170 p.66-75dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl10215x0378-42907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2014.10.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02928naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245009300167300001400260520165900274592002801933650001401961650000901975650003001984650001602014650001402030650001202044650001102056650001102067650001402078650001702092650000902109650001902118653001902137653001202156653001302168653002102181653002602202700001502228700001502243700001702258773010102275856008502376852000902461655001202470IND60642864220221120221641.0190523e20190518xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064286422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enggeo.2019.04.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Haijian10aAnalytical model for methane migration through fractured unsaturated landfill cover soil  ap. 69-79.  aMigration of gas in the fractured porous media plays an important role in geoenvironmental engineering issues. Compacted clay liners (CCLs) are extensively used as engineering barriers for groundwater and soil pollution induced by landfill contaminant transport. Analytical model and semi-analytical model were developed for methane transport in fractured CCL by using Laplace transformation and Laplace inversion using Stehfest method. Methane diffusion and oxidation in the matrix of CCL and gas advection-diffusion in the fracture were considered. Dimensionless analysis shows that advection plays a more important role than diffusion for methane transport through the fracture. Diffusion and oxidation of methane in the matrix of CCL have relatively less influences on methane transport in the fracture. The steady-state methane surface flux for the case with Dm = 3.14 × 10−9 m2/s is 1.02 and 1.5 times greater than that with Dm = 3.14 × 10−8 m2/s when the fracture width 2b = 5 mm and 2b = 3 mm, respectively. Methane oxidation rate in the matrix of CCL (λ1) plays a more important role on methane transport in fracture than methane oxidation rate in the fracture (λ2). When λ1 and λ2 increase by one order of magnitude, the steady-state surface fluxes decrease by factors of 1.05 and 1.53, respectively. Transport of methane can be greatly restrained by the compost-amended CCL due to the increase of methane oxidation rate. The proposed semi-analytical and analytical model can be used in the design and assessment of cover system for landfill and mining facilities with different soil moisture contents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadvection 3aclay 3aenvironmental engineering 3agroundwater 3alandfills 3amethane 3amining 3amodels 3aoxidation 3aporous media 3asoil 3asoil pollution 0aLandfill cover 0aMethane 0aFracture 0aAnalytical model 0aSemi-analytical model1 aWang, Qiao1 aWu, Jiawei1 aChen, Yunmin0 tEngineering geology.g2019 May 18, v. 255 p.69-79dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12441x0013-79527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2019.04.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02940naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245007400167300001400241520195900255592002802214650001502242650002802257650001402285650002002299650003502319650002402354650001502378650001702393700002502410773008702435856008302522852000902605655001202614IND60096124120221120170013.0141104e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009612412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2013.05.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNetzel, Pawel10aConnected components labeling for giga-cell multi-categorical rasters  ap. 24-30.  aLabeling of connected components in an image or a raster of non-imagery data is a fundamental operation in fields of pattern recognition and machine intelligence. The bulk of effort devoted to designing efficient connected components labeling (CCL) algorithms concentrated on the domain of binary images where labeling is required for a computer to recognize objects. In contrast, in the Geographical Information Science (GIS) a CCL algorithm is mostly applied to multi-categorical rasters in order to either convert a raster to a shapefile, or for statistical characterization of individual clumps. Recently, it has become necessary to label connected components in very large, giga-cell size, multi-categorical rasters but performance of existing CCL algorithms lacks sufficient speed to accomplish such task. In this paper we present a modification to the popular two-scan CCL algorithm that enables labeling of giga-cell size, multi-categorical rasters. Our approach is to apply a divide-and-conquer technique coupled with parallel processing to a standard two-scan algorithm. For specificity, we have developed a variant of a standard CCL algorithm implemented as r.clump in GRASS GIS. We have established optimal values of data blocks (stemming from the divide-and-conquer technique) and optimal number of computational threads (stemming from parallel processing) for a new algorithm called r.clump3p. The performance of the new algorithm was tested on a series of rasters up to 160Mcells in size; for largest size test raster a speed up over the original algorithm is 74 times. Finally, we have applied the new algorithm to the National Land Cover Dataset 2006 raster with 1.6×10¹⁰ cells. Labeling this raster took 39h using two-processors, 16 cores computer and resulted in 221,718,501 clumps. Estimated speed up over the original algorithm is 450 times. The r.clump3p works within the GRASS environment and is available in the public domain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aartificial intelligence 3acomputers 3adata collection 3ageographic information systems 3ainformation science 3aland cover 3aspatial data1 aStepinski, Tomasz F.0 tComputers & geosciences.g2013 Sept., v. 59 p.24-30dElsevier Ltdx0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2013.05.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02789naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245006900168300001400237520172400251592002801975650001502003650001302018650001402031650002302045650001402068650002202082700001802104700001302122700001502135700001302150700001302163700001702176700001302193700001802206773008702224856008302311852000902394655001202403IND60096124320221120165929.0141104e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009612432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2013.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Qunying10aEvaluating open-source cloud computing solutions for geosciences  ap. 41-52.  aMany organizations start to adopt cloud computing for better utilizing computing resources by taking advantage of its scalability, cost reduction, and easy to access characteristics. Many private or community cloud computing platforms are being built using open-source cloud solutions. However, little has been done to systematically compare and evaluate the features and performance of open-source solutions in supporting Geosciences. This paper provides a comprehensive study of three open-source cloud solutions, including OpenNebula, Eucalyptus, and CloudStack. We compared a variety of features, capabilities, technologies and performances including: (1) general features and supported services for cloud resource creation and management, (2) advanced capabilities for networking and security, and (3) the performance of the cloud solutions in provisioning and operating the cloud resources as well as the performance of virtual machines initiated and managed by the cloud solutions in supporting selected geoscience applications. Our study found that: (1) no significant performance differences in central processing unit (CPU), memory and I/O of virtual machines created and managed by different solutions, (2) OpenNebula has the fastest internal network while both Eucalyptus and CloudStack have better virtual machine isolation and security strategies, (3) Cloudstack has the fastest operations in handling virtual machines, images, snapshots, volumes and networking, followed by OpenNebula, and (4) the selected cloud computing solutions are capable for supporting concurrent intensive web applications, computing intensive applications, and small-scale model simulations without intensive data communication.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus 3aInternet 3acomputers 3acost effectiveness 3aequipment 3asimulation models1 aYang, Chaowei1 aLiu, Kai1 aXia, Jizhe1 aXu, Chen1 aLi, Jing1 aGui, Zhipeng1 aSun, Min1 aLi, Zhenglong0 tComputers & geosciences.g2013 Sept., v. 59 p.41-52dElsevier Ltdx0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2013.05.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01928naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245011400167300001400281520089400295592002801189650001401217650001801231650001901249650001501268650001501283700001901298700001701317700001301334700001901347700001501366700001801381773008701399856008301486852000901569655001201578IND60096124420221120170037.0141104e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009612442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2013.05.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Wuming10aGeneration of pixel-level resolution lunar DEM based on Chang'E-1 three-line imagery and laser altimeter data  ap. 53-59.  aAcquiring high resolution topography products of the Moon is an important issue for further lunar exploration. In this paper, we present a data processing flow of 3D reconstruction based on Chang'E-1 (CE-1) three-line imagery (120m) and laser altimeter (LAM) data to acquire pixel-level resolution DEM. First, initial global disparity estimation was generated, and then corresponding points were acquired pixel-by-pixel by Adaptive Support-Weight Approach. A Least Square Image matching method was used to achieve sub-pixel accuracy, ultimately resulting in pixel-level resolution DEM (120m). Global lunar 100m DEM (GLD100 DEM) from LROC WAC stereo imagery is employed for comparison analysis and the mean elevation difference between two DEMs is less than 120m. Experimental results show that the processing flow is effective and reliable for acquiring pixel-level DEM based on CE-1 data.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputers 3adata analysis 3adigital images 3aestimation 3atopography1 aZhang, Xiaobin1 aChen, Yiming1 aYan, Kai1 aYan, Guangjian1 aLiu, Qiang1 aZhou, Guoqing0 tComputers & geosciences.g2013 Sept., v. 59 p.53-59dElsevier Ltdx0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2013.05.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03825naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245016400165300001800329520186700347536035402214592002802568650001102596650001202607650001502619650002002634650002102654650001402675650001502689650002202704650001802726650001502744650001102759650002902770650001302799650001402812650001802826650001402844650002302858650001402881651001102895653003502906653002202941653003602963653002802999653002903027653001903056700002103075773009803096856008003194852000903274655001203283IND60622316820221118004032.0181124e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062231682DNAL7 a10.1177/09596836134836232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVater, Amber E10aTesting the ‘addition and persistence model’ of invertebrate succession in a subalpine glacier-foreland chronosequence: Fåbergstølsbreen, southern Norway  ap. 1151-1162.  aInvertebrate primary succession is investigated across a chronosequence in the subalpine (birch woodland) zone at Fåbergstølsbreen using pitfall traps. Presence and abundance of taxa, functional groups and communities are examined using a geo-ecological approach including mapping, graphical analysis, two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS). Twenty-nine of the 67 recorded taxa, and 14 of the 37 epigeal (surface active) taxa colonize terrain deglacierized for <20 years and catches of most of these pioneer taxa attain an early peak on terrain deglacierized for <40 years. Catches of most later colonizers peak in the mature (‘climax’) stage where 86% of the pioneer taxa and 79% of the epigeal pioneers are also recorded. The number of taxa increases across the chronosequence as new taxa, predominantly predators, appear but relatively few taxa drop out of the succession, and as the dominant species in the traps changes from the harvestman, Mitopus morio, to the wood ant, Formica lugubris. The invertebrate communities are interpreted as loosely organized groupings of individualistic species, the distributions of which are strongly related to terrain age. Changes during succession are interpreted as driven primarily by competition between the carnivorous taxa, though herbivores and omnivores comprise up to 24% and 11% of the taxa, respectively, in both pioneer and mature zones. Hence the ‘addition and persistence model’ of invertebrate succession, previously proposed for the alpine zone, is largely substantiated but partially modified for the subalpine zone, where succession is generally more rapid, overall changes during succession are greater, communities are better organized, food webs appear better developed, and there is an element of replacement change in the later stages.  aFunding This paper constitutes Jotunheimen Research Expeditions Contribution No. 184.

In addition, the utility of the Anthropocene as a stratigraphic unit has also been questioned. In this paper, it is proposed that the discovery of the GSSP may not be a major problem and could only be a matter of time. However, the term Anthropocene itself, defined on the basis of the stratigraphic expression of human activities (e.g. large-scale agriculture and land clearance, accelerated release of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere) may significantly impact the current stratigraphic framework guided by the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS). Indeed, the formal usage of this term can not only lead to stratigraphic and terminological inconsistencies but can also influence the future development of the established chronostratigraphic scheme. These points should be considered by the ICS Anthropocene Working Group before making a final decision. The stratigraphic status of the Anthropocene, however, is a formal issue that should not affect current and future research on human-induced environmental and sedimentary changes, including their stratigraphic imprint. The message is twofold: leave the formal chronostratigraphic aspects to the ICS, and keep producing and organizing knowledge independently of the formal debate. Doing so would require the development of a parallel and likely transitory chronological system without formal stratigraphic value, from which the term Anthropocene would be, at least temporarily, excluded.  aFunding This research was supported by the project ECOPAST, funded by the Ministry of Science and Innovation of Spain (Grant CGL2009-07069/BOS).  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnthropocene epoch 3aanthropogenic activities 3agreenhouse gases 3aland clearing 3astratigraphy 0aAnthropocene 0achronology 0achronostratigraphy 0aHolocene 0ahuman impact 0aindustrialization0 tHolocene.g, v. 23, no. 8 p.1198-1201dSAGE PublicationswJournal:J000001502x1477-09117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836134836283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02685naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245013500169300001400304520140000318592002801718650002501746650001201771650001201783650001901795650001401814650001201828651001401840653003301854653004001887653001501927653000901942653000801951653000901959653000901968653000801977653000901985700001901994700001902013773012502032856008502157852000902242655001202251IND60621811620221118181802.0181121e20190102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062181162DNAL7 a10.1080/10549811.2018.14983592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWibowo, Agung10aComparing management schemes for forest certification and timber-legality verification: Complementary or competitive in indonesia?  ap. 68-84.  aIndonesian small-scale forest holders are facing a dilemma due to the implementation of a mandatory national timber-legality verification scheme and an internationally popular forest certification scheme. The problems arise from limited financial, technical, and administrative information concerning the most preferred scheme and the “imperfection of such a scheme” for long-term business needs. Using the Forest Certification Assessment Guide (FCAG) this paper identifies the characteristics of four third-party forest certification schemes currently working in Indonesia, namely FSC, PEFC, LEI, and SVLK. An online questionnaire was used to survey a wide range of respondents about the future development of contested schemes and those preferred by small-scale forest holders. Our findings show that although FSC scheme obtained the highest score and is considered the best scheme according to the FCAG, small-scale forest holders prefer SVLK scheme, which had the lowest FCAG score because of its mandatory nature and available subsidies. Statements by the four schemes’ proponents, which delegitimize other schemes, reveal they are in competition especially in winning market acceptance and local adaptability. Finally, we suggest proponents enhance aspects where their schemes are lacking and contrive a comparable certification scheme in order to induce willingness to be certified.  aPublisher supplied data 3aforest certification 3aforests 3amarkets 3aquestionnaires 3asubsidies 3asurveys 3aIndonesia 0aForest certification schemes 0atimber-legality verification system 0acomparison 0aFCAG 0aFSC 0aPEFC 0aIFCC 0aLEI 0aSVLK1 aPratiwi, Santi1 aGiessen, Lukas0 tJournal of sustainable forestry.g2019 Jan. 2, v. 38, no. 1 p.68-84dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl48967x1540-756X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10549811.2018.14983593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03102naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245014500169300001400314520194600328592002802274650001302302650001702315650002202332650001402354650001402368650003502382650002302417650001602440650001902456650001702475650002202492700001902514700001702533773008602550856008302636852000902719655001202728IND60096126020221120135202.0141104e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009612602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2013.06.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarami, Mojtaba10aUsing GIS servers and interactive maps in spectral data sharing and administration: Case study of Ahvaz Spectral Geodatabase Platform (ASGP)  ap. 23-33.  aWith emergence of air-borne and space-borne hyperspectral sensors, spectroscopic measurements are gaining more importance in remote sensing. Therefore, the number of available spectral reference data is constantly increasing. This rapid increase often exhibits a poor data management, which leads to ultimate isolation of data on disk storages. Spectral data without precise description of the target, methods, environment, and sampling geometry cannot be used by other researchers. Moreover, existing spectral data (in case it accompanied with good documentation) become virtually invisible or unreachable for researchers. Providing documentation and a data-sharing framework for spectral data, in which researchers are able to search for or share spectral data and documentation, would definitely improve the data lifetime. Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) are main candidates for spectral data management and their efficiency is proven by many studies and applications to date. In this study, a new approach to spectral data administration is presented based on spatial identity of spectral samples. This method benefits from scalability and performance of RDBMS for storage of spectral data, but uses GIS servers to provide users with interactive maps as an interface to the system. The spectral files, photographs and descriptive data are considered as belongings of a geospatial object. A spectral processing unit is responsible for evaluation of metadata quality and performing routine spectral processing tasks for newly-added data. As a result, by using internet browser software the users would be able to visually examine availability of data and/or search for data based on descriptive attributes associated to it. The proposed system is scalable and besides giving the users good sense of what data are available in the database, it facilitates participation of spectral reference data in producing geoinformation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3acase studies 3acomputer software 3acomputers 3adatabases 3ageographic information systems 3amanagement systems 3aphotographs 3aremote sensing 3aspatial data 3aspectral analysis1 aRangzan, Kazem1 aSaberi, Azim0 tComputers & geosciences.g2013 Oct., v. 60 p.23-33dElsevier Ltdx0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2013.06.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02584naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245012500173300001400298520113300312592002801445650001101473650001901484650002501503650002101528650002301549650002201572650001501594650002501609650002001634650002301654650001901677650002201696653003301718653002001751653002901771653002101800653002101821700002101842700002201863700002201885773012501907856008502032852000902117655001202126IND60621811720221118181924.0181121e20190102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062181172DNAL7 a10.1080/10549811.2018.15046852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGranata, Mirko U.10aCarbon dioxide sequestration capability of an unmanaged old-growth broadleaf deciduous forest in a Strict Nature Reserve  ap. 85-96.  aThe seasonal trend of plant carbon dioxide (CO₂) sequestration is related to the photosynthetic activity, which in turn changes in response to environmental conditions. Great interest has turned to the CO₂ sequestration (CS) potential of temperate forests which play an important role in global carbon (C) cycle contributing to the lowering of atmospheric CO₂ concentration. In such context, the CS of an unmanaged old broad-leaf deciduous forest developing inside a Strict Nature Reserve, and its variations during the year were analyzed considering the monthly variations of leaf area index (LAI) and net photosynthetic rates (NP). Overall, the total yearly CS of the forest was 141 Mg CO₂ ha⁻¹ year⁻¹ with the highest CS value monitored in June (405 Mg CO₂ month⁻¹) due to the highest LAI (5.0 ± 0.8 m² m⁻²) and a high NP in all the broadleaf species. The first CS decline was observed in August due to the more stressful climatic conditions that constrained NP rates. Overall, the total CS of the forest reflects the good ecological health of the ecosystem due to its conservative management.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimatic factors 3aconservation areas 3adeciduous forests 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental health 3aleaf area index 3aold-growth forests 3aphotosynthesis 3atemperate forests 0aCarbon dioxide sequestration 0aleaf area index 0anet photosynthetic rates 0adeciduous forest 0aunmanaged forest1 aGratani, Loretta1 aBracco, Francesco1 aCatoni, Rosangela0 tJournal of sustainable forestry.g2019 Jan. 2, v. 38, no. 1 p.85-96dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl48967x1540-756X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10549811.2018.15046853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02637naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245007300169300001600242520067600258536031000934592002801244596007501272596006901347596008601416650001201502650002401514650002301538650001901561650001501580650002001595650001701615650001301632650001801645650000901663650002601672650001301698653001601711653002001727653001301747653001401760653002501774700001201799700001801811700001601829700001701845700001501862773013601877856008502013852000902098655001202107IND60621811820221118181837.0181121e20180703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062181182DNAL7 a10.1080/10590501.2018.14905122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Huawei10aOrganism-derived phthalate derivatives as bioactive natural products  ap. 125-144.  aPhthalates are widely used in polymer materials as a plasticizer.

The results show that δ¹⁸Ocₑₗ of Sphagnum follows the general pattern of the Northern Hemisphere reconstructed paleotemperature record for the last 2000 years at a ratio of ~2‰δ¹⁸Ocₑₗ/°C. The δ¹⁸Ocₑₗ record of ombrotrophic phase of Mer Bleue Bog is also in accordance with major features of the Holocene sunspot number reconstruction. Three distinct time intervals have low δ¹⁸Ocₑₗ values: 200–800 cal. BP (‘Little Ice Age’); 2800–3400 cal. BP synchronous to a cooling period reported elsewhere in North America; and 4200–4600 cal. BP corresponding to a cooling interval in the North Atlantic region. These cooling periods also correlate well with negative excursions in the Holocene sunspot and cosmogenic ¹⁰Be records. A fourth period of low δ¹⁸Ocₑₗ values between ad 1810 and 1820 may be related to the extremely cold summer of 1816 and cooler subsequent years, which occurred in the aftermath of the Tambora volcanic eruption, or possibly cooling associated with the early 19th century Dalton solar minimum. The results also indicate the presence of millennial-scale cycles possibly comparable with the globally recognized Bond cycles that have been correlated to fluctuations in solar irradiance.  aFunding This Research Project is supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Discovery grants to RTP and AP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSphagnum 3acellulose 3acold 3amosses and liverworts 3aoxygen 3apaleoclimatology 3apeat 3asolar radiation 3astable isotopes 3asummer 3avolcanic activity 3aOntario 0aeastern Canada 0acellulose 0aombrotrophic bog 0aoxygen isotopes 0apaleotemperatures 0asolar activity1 aPatterson, R Timothy1 aProkoph, Andreas0 tHolocene.g, v. 23, no. 9 p.1260-1271dSAGE PublicationswJournal:J000001502x1477-09117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836134846173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03682naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004200113040001800155100002400173245010200197300001600299520197900315592002802294650001902322650001002341650002102351650001102372650002002383650002602403650001402429650001202443650004802455650001202503650002802515650001102543650003602554650001102590650005602601650005302657650002302710650000902733650001402742650002202756650002202778700002202800700002402822700002102846700001902867773020202886856005503088852000903143655001203152IND50072949920221118145350.0140212e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007294992DNAL7 a227024372pmid7 a10.1111/j.1476-4431.2012.00744.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRadcliffe, Rolfe M.10aEvaluation of L‐lactate and cardiac troponin I in horses undergoing emergency abdominal surgery  ap. 313-319.  aOBJECTIVE: To evaluate changes in plasma cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and L‐lactate (LLt) as prognostic indicators in horses undergoing emergency abdominal surgery. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: Veterinary teaching hospital. ANIMALS: Thirty‐four horses undergoing emergency abdominal surgery. INTERVENTIONS: Serial blood sampling during various times during hospitalization (hospital admission, and 12, 24, 48, and 72 h postoperatively) evaluating cTnI and LLt concentrations. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: All horses required surgery for correction of a strangulating (n = 29) or nonstrangulating obstruction (n = 5) of the small or large intestine. Twenty‐seven horses survived to discharge; 7 were euthanized either during (n = 1) or after (n = 6) surgery due to disease severity or systemic complications associated with the primary gastrointestinal lesion. Preoperative cTnI concentrations were increased above the normal reference interval in 24% of horses (8/34, median = 0.01 ng/mL, range = 0–12.23 ng/mL), whereas LLt concentrations were increased above the normal reference interval in 88% of horses (30/34, median = 3.37 mmol/L, range = 0.77–13.26 mmol/L). The LLt concentration was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in nonsurviving compared with surviving horses at admission, and at 24 and 72 hours postoperatively. No significant difference in the cTnI concentration was detected between groups at admission. However, the cTnI concentration was significantly higher (P<0.05) in nonsurviving compared with surviving horses at all time points postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of both LLt and cTnI concentrations may provide information for prognostication in surgical colic horses. Marked increases in admission concentrations of LLt (median 7.56 mmol/L) and even moderate postoperative increases in cTnI concentration (median 0.97 ng/mL) may both indicate a poor prognosis in critically ill horses following abdominal surgery.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood sampling 3acolic 3adisease severity 3ahorses 3alarge intestine 3aobservational studies 3aprognosis 3asurgery 2aAbdominal Painxbloodxsurgeryxveterinary. 2aAnimals 2aEmergenciesxveterinary 2aFemale 2aHorse Diseasesxbloodxsurgery. 2aHorses 2aIntestinal Obstructionxbloodxsurgeryxveterinary. 2aIntestinal Volvulusxbloodxsurgeryxveterinary. 2aLactic Acidxblood 2aMale 2aPrognosis 2aTreatment Outcome 2aTroponin Ixblood1 aDivers, Thomas J.1 aFletcher, Daniel J.1 aMohammed, Hussni1 aKraus, Marc S.0 tJournal of veterinary emergency and critical care.g2012 June, v. 22, no. 3 p.313-319dBlackwell Science on behalf of the American College of Veterinary Emergency and Critical Carex1479-32617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1476-4431.2012.00744.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03118naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245010000168300001800268520148800286536013001774592002801904650001401932650001001946650001101956650002001967650001001987650001001997650001202007650001202019650001502031650002202046650002302068650001502091650001102106650002302117650000902140650001302149650001402162650001002176650001102186650002002197651001502217653001802232653001302250653002302263653001702286653002602303653001502329700002102344773009802365856008002463852000902543655001202552IND60622318120221118003903.0181124e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062231812DNAL7 a10.1177/09596836134846752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrowley, Brooke E10aStable carbon isotope values confirm a recent increase in grasslands in northwestern Madagascar  ap. 1066-1073.  aMadagascar is home to some of the world’s most unique plants and animals. Unfortunately, anthropogenic forest loss has had a dramatic impact on both floral and faunal communities. In many regions the scale and timing of this loss remains poorly constrained. Such is the case for northwestern Madagascar. Pollen records for this region suggest that fires and grass abundance increased around 1000 calendar years before present (cal. BP), as well as c. 500 cal. BP, presumably reflecting growing human settlements. However, temporal and spatial resolution for these transitions is limited by a hiatus in the sediment record. We present a suite of carbon isotope data from ¹⁴C-dated vertebrate bones from Anjohibe Cave, northwestern Madagascar. In agreement with palynological records, isotope data indicate that the transition to open savannah may be a recent phenomenon in northwestern Madagascar. We document dramatic changes in the vertebrate community over the past 2000 years. Remains from extinct taxa are all older than 1500 cal. BP, locally extirpated taxa were in the region until c. 300 years ago, and introduced species are essentially modern. Stable carbon data suggest minimal consumption of C₄ resources by extinct, locally extirpated and locally extant endemic taxa. On the contrary, introduced rats and shrews exhibit exceptionally high carbon isotope values; this may reflect a dietary shift to newly introduced grasses or consumption of seeds from C₄ plants.  aFunding This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC4 plants 3abones 3acarbon 3aextinct species 3afauna 3afires 3aforests 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3ahuman settlements 3aintroduced species 3apalynology 3apollen 3aradiocarbon dating 3arats 3asavannas 3asediments 3aseeds 3ashrews 3astable isotopes 3aMadagascar 0aAnjohibe Cave 0aC4 grass 0aintroduced species 0apaleoecology 0astable carbon isotope 0avertebrate1 aSamonds, Karen E0 tHolocene.g, v. 23, no. 7 p.1066-1073dSAGE PublicationswJournal:J000001502x1477-09117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836134846753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02461naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245012000180300001600300520099300316592002801309650001201337650002701349650002301376650001601399650002301415650002301438650001601461650001101477650001501488650001101503650001301514650001301527650001301540650002401553651001301577653001401590653001401604653001401618653003001632653002201662700002401684700002601708700002001734773011901754856008501873852000901958655001201967IND60621812220221118181951.0181121e20181102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062181222DNAL7 a10.1080/10871209.2018.14948662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHariohay, Kwaslema Malle10aAwareness and attitudes of local people toward wildlife conservation in the Rungwa Game Reserve in Central Tanzania  ap. 503-514.  aStudies have demonstrated that wildlife conservation success depends on local people’s attitudes toward wildlife. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 240 respondents living in five villages outside the south-western Rungwa Game Reserve (RGR). Results revealed 89% of the respondents were aware of wildlife conservation, and their awareness varied with age, education, immigration status, and distance to the protected area (PA). Factors influencing the attitude of local people toward wildlife in the area included age, distance to the PA, education level, and sources of income. Depredation and crop damage negatively influenced people’s attitudes toward problem animals. For effective conservation, the attitudes of local people toward wildlife need to be considered. This conservation will be achieved through timely compensation schemes, the involvement of the local people in conservation planning, and the provision of education programs about sustainable conservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3aattitudes and opinions 3aconservation areas 3acrop damage 3aeducation programs 3aeducational status 3aimmigration 3aincome 3ainterviews 3apeople 3aplanning 3avillages 3awildlife 3awildlife management 3aTanzania 0aAttitudes 0aawareness 0aknowledge 0aRungwa Game Reserve (RGR) 0awildlife corridor1 aFyumagwa, Robert D.1 aKideghesho, Jafari R.1 aRøskaft, Eivin0 tHuman dimensions of wildlife.g2018 Nov. 2, v. 23, no. 6 p.503-514dRoutledgewJournal:J000000084x1533-158X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10871209.2018.14948663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02573naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245012400175300001600299520110900315536007501424592002801499596008201527650002701609650001501636650001701651650001201668650000901680650001701689650001201706650001301718650001101731651001401742653001601756653001201772653001501784653001401799653002001813700002101833700002201854700002601876773011901902856008502021852000902106655001202115IND60621812620221118181941.0181121e20181102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062181262DNAL7 a10.1080/10871209.2018.15118762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchroeder, Susan A.10aHow Minnesota wolf hunter and trapper attitudes and risk- and benefit-based beliefs predict wolf management preferences  ap. 552-568.  aIn 2012, Minnesota’s first-ever regulated wolf hunting and trapping season occurred. Research has suggested that beliefs about risks and benefits associated with carnivores affect their acceptance. Using results from a 2013 mail survey of hunters and trappers who participated in the season, we employed mediation analysis to examine how risk- and benefit-based beliefs influenced the relationship between attitudes about wolves and management preferences and behavioral intentions. Analyses differentiated hunters and trappers. Beliefs about risks and benefits partially explained the relationship between attitudes and wolf management preferences among hunters, while risk-based beliefs fully accounted for management preferences in the trapper sample. Beliefs about risks associated with wolves were most strongly related to management preferences among both hunters and trappers. Beliefs about the risks wolves present to desired game species may be symbolic among hunters and trappers, therefore, managers may be challenged to gain support for recovering wolf populations among these stakeholders.  aFunding was provided by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.  aPublisher supplied data  cMinnesota Department of Natural Resourcesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100004959 3aattitudes and opinions 3acarnivores 3agame animals 3ahunters 3arisk 3astakeholders 3asurveys 3atrapping 3awolves 3aMinnesota 0aGray wolves 0ahunters 0amanagement 0apredators 0asalient beliefs1 aFulton, David C.1 aCornicelli, Louis1 aBruskotter, Jeremy T.0 tHuman dimensions of wildlife.g2018 Nov. 2, v. 23, no. 6 p.552-568dRoutledgewJournal:J000000084x1533-158X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10871209.2018.15118763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01607naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245011500173300001600288520074800304592002801052650001401080650002301094650001901117700002501136773008801161856008301249852000901332655001201341IND60096127520221120144357.0141104e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009612752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2013.06.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilvetti, Andrea F.10aQuadratic self-correlation: An improved method for computing local fractal dimension in remote sensing imagery  ap. 142-155.  aWe present a new method for computing the local fractal dimension in remote sensing imagery. It is based on a novel way of estimating the quadratic self correlation (or 2D Hurst coefficient) of the pixel values. The method is thoroughly tested with a set of synthetic images an also with remote sensing imagery to assess the usefulness of the techniques for unsupervised image segmentation. We make a comparison with other estimators of the local fractal dimension. Quadratic self-correlation methods provide more accurate results with synthetic images, and also produce more robust and fit segmentations in remote sensing imagery. Even with very small computation windows, the methods prove to be able to detect borders and details precisely.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputers 3afractal dimensions 3aremote sensing1 aDelrieux, Claudio A.0 tComputers & geosciences.g2013 Oct., v. 60 p.142-155dElsevier Ltdx0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2013.06.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03034naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003400151245012600185300001400311520122200325536015401547592002801701596004801729650002001777650001901797650002201816650002301838650002301861650001401884650001101898650001501909650002501924650002601949650001301975650002301988651001802011651001102029653001902040653002602059653003002085653002102115653001102136700003002147700002302177700002602200700002302226700002602249773013502275856008502410852000902495655001202504IND60621812820221118182003.0181121e20190102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062181282DNAL7 a10.1080/10888705.2018.14569252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiranda-de la Lama, Genaro C.10aConsumer Attitudes Toward Animal Welfare-Friendly Products and Willingness to Pay: Exploration of Mexican Market Segments  ap. 13-25.  aThe study aim was to identify consumer segmentation based on nonhuman animal welfare (AW) attitudes and their relationship with demographic features and willingness to pay (WTP) for welfare-friendly products (WFP) in Mexico. Personal interviews were conducted with 843 Mexican consumers who stated they purchased most of the animal products in their home. Respondents were selected using a quota sampling method with age, gender, education, and origin as quota control variables. The multivariate analysis suggested there were three clusters or consumer profiles labeled “skeptical,” “concerned,” and “ethical,” which helped explain the association between AW attitudes, some demographic variables, and WTP for WFP. This study is one of the first to address consumer profiling in Latin America, and the findings could have implications for the commercialization of WFP. Hence, customers should receive information to consider welfare innovations when deciding to purchase animal products. The growth of the WFP food market establishes an element of a far more multifaceted phenomenon of sustainable consumption and support of a new paradigm called responsible marketing in emerging markets such as Mexico.  aThis work was supported by PRODEP (Programa para el Desarrollo Profesional Docente) Grants 103.5/13/8925 UAM-PTC-417 lead by G.C.

DESIGN: Retrospective case series from 1997 to 2009. SETTING: Small animal veterinary teaching hospital. ANIMALS: One hundred and nineteen dogs with 126 acute presentations of CHF. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Medical records from a veterinary teaching hospital were searched for the occurrence of CHF. The effect of admission time, weekday, month, and season were analyzed separately using chi‐square tests. CHF presentations were largely confined to Monday and Tuesday (57%) and between 9 am and 11:59 am (55%). CHF was more common during September, October, and November (37%). CONCLUSIONS: Information from this study may assist veterinarians in educating clients about the timing of clinical signs, and enable veterinary hospitals to anticipate CHF cases during certain times of the day and year.  aPublisher supplied data 3adogs 3aheart failure 3aretrospective studies 3aveterinarians 3aveterinary clinics 2aAnimals 2aCircadian Rhythm 2aDog Diseasesxdiagnosis 2aDogs 2aFemale 2aHeart Failurexdiagnosisxveterinary. 2aMale 2aRetrospective Studies 2aSeasons 2aTime Factors1 aByron, Julie K.1 aMahoney, Megan M.0 tJournal of veterinary emergency and critical care.g2012 June, v. 22, no. 3 p.341-346dBlackwell Science on behalf of the American College of Veterinary Emergency and Critical Carex1479-32617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1476-4431.2012.00748.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03993naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002500146245012200171300001800293520207600311536018202387592002802569650002202597650001902619650001202638650002802650650001502678650001202693650000902705650001602714650001502730650001302745650000802758650001302766650001002779650001502789650001102804650001402815650001302829650001902842650002102861650001102882650001402893650002002907650001102927650002402938650001502962651001402977653002002991653001203011653001403023653001303037653001803050653001703068700002603085700002303111700002103134773009903155856008003254852000903334655001203343IND60622319920221118004000.0181124e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062231992DNAL7 a10.1177/09596836134939382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalascio, Nicholas L10aBiogeochemical evidence for hydrologic changes during the Holocene in a lake sediment record from southeast Greenland  ap. 1428-1439.  aHolocene paleoclimate records from Greenland help us understand the response of the Greenland Ice Sheet and regional oceanic and atmospheric circulation systems to natural climate variability in order to place recent changes in a longer-term perspective. Here biogeochemical analysis of a lake sediment core from southeast Greenland is used to define changes in moisture balance and runoff during the Holocene in a catchment near the margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet. A 1.6 m sediment core that spans the last 8.8 ka was recovered from Flower Valley Lake on Ammassalik Island. Magnetic susceptibility, diatoms, bulk biogeochemical properties (TOC, C/N, δ¹³Cₒᵣg), and lipid biomarkers (n-alkanes; C₁₆–C₃₁) reveal changes in clastic sedimentation and the relative input of terrestrial- and aquatic-derived organic matter. Hydrogen isotope values (δD) of mid- (n-C₂₅) and long-chain (n-C₂₉, n-C₃₁) n-alkanes allow reconstruction of δD of precipitation and summertime evaporation of lake water. Following a period of early lake ontogeny and landscape stabilization after deglaciation from 8.4 to 7.0 ka, the mid Holocene, 8.4–4.1 ka, is characterized by greater evaporative enrichment of the lake water as indicated by δD records. After 4.1 ka, there is a decrease in evaporative enrichment of the lake water. There is also an abrupt transition to more variable sedimentation marked by sharp increases in magnetic susceptibility, C/N, δ¹³Cₒᵣg, and the concentration of long-chain n-alkanes, showing periodic delivery of terrestrial organic matter and clastic sediment to the lake. Higher insolation during the mid Holocene resulted in a warmer and drier climate with longer ice-free periods in the summer and enhanced evaporation of lake water. The reduction in insolation and colder temperatures during the late Holocene caused a reduction in evaporation of lake water over the last 4.1 ka and was accompanied by periodic increases in surface runoff, which correspond with intervals of cold Greenland Ice Sheet surface temperatures.  aFunding This project was funded by National Science Foundation grant ARC-0909354 and NOAA grant NA10OAR4310228.

Since each eye sends its input mainly to the contralateral hemisphere, birds respond differently to stimuli seen with the left eye than they do to stimuli seen with the right eye. The right hemisphere attends to novel stimuli, which easily distract it from ongoing functions. It assumes control in emergency or stressful conditions. The left hemisphere attends to learnt categories and controls behavior in routine, non-stressful situations. This division of function extends to processing of auditory, olfactory and even magnetic stimuli. Evidence for this comes from a number of avian species, and has been shown in both laboratory and field tests. Knowledge of these specializations is relevant to understanding the behavior of birds in the wild since birds respond in different ways to stimuli on their left and right sides (e.g. preferential response to predators and conspecific on the left side and to prey on the right side) and they choose to view different stimuli with the left or right eye. Individual differences in the strength of visual lateralization are determined by exposure of the embryo to light, versus incubation in the dark, and by the levels of steroid hormones in ovo. The importance of these influences on lateralization is discussed in terms of behavior in the natural habitat. The potential importance of hemispheric dominance in the welfare of birds is also considered.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrain 3aeyes 3ahabitats 3apredators 3asteroid hormones 3awild birds0 tJournal of ornithology.g2012 Aug., v. 153, no.

However, there are public concerns about the use of antibiotics in agriculture and the potential development of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Therefore, the discovery of other environmentally safe natural compounds as alternatives to antibiotics would benefit the aquaculture industries. Four natural compounds, commonly called platanosides, [kaempferol 3-O-α-L-(2",3"-di-E-p-coumaroyl)rhamnoside (1), kaempferol 3-O-α-L-(2"-E-p-coumaroyl-3"-Z-p-coumaroyl)rhamnoside (2), kaempferol 3-O-α-L-(2"-Z-p-coumaroyl-3"-E-p-coumaroyl)rhamnoside (3), and kaempferol 3-O-α-L-(2",3"-di-Z-p-coumaroyl)rhamnoside (4)] isolated from the leaves of the American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis) tree were evaluated using a rapid bioassay for their antibacterial activities against common fish pathogenic bacteria including Flavobacterium columnare, Edwardsiella ictaluri, Aeromonas hydrophila, and Streptococcus iniae. The four isomers and a mixture of all four isomers were strongly antibacterial against isolates of F. columnare and S. iniae. Against F. columnare ALM-00-173, 3 and 4 showed the strongest antibacterial activities, with 24-h 50% inhibition concentration (IC(50)) values of 2.13±0.11 and 2.62±0.23 mg/L, respectively. Against S. iniae LA94-426, 4 had the strongest antibacterial activity, with 24-h IC(50) of 1.87±0.23 mg/L. Neither a mixture of the isomers nor any of the individual isomers were antibacterial against isolates of E. ictaluri and A. hydrophila at the test concentrations used in the study. Several of the isomers appear promising for the potential management of columnaris disease and streptococcosis in fish.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAeromonas hydrophila 3aEdwardsiella ictaluri 3aFlavobacterium columnare 3aPlatanus occidentalis 3aStreptococcus iniae 3aanimal pathogenic bacteria 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotics 3aaquaculture 3aaquaculture industry 3abioassays 3acolumnaris disease 3afish 3aisomers 3akaempferol 3aleaves 3amedicated feeds 3ametabolites 3aresearch and development 3atrees1 aHamann, Mark T.1 aMcChesney, James D.1 aRodenburg, Douglas L.1 aIbrahim, Mohamed A.0 tJournal of aquaculture research & development.g2015 Oct. 15, v. 6, no. 10 p.364-wSource:1x2155-95467nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/622313Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4172/2155-9546.10003643Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Antibacterial%20-%20Schrader%20-%20M622.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03966naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245013200165300001800297520165300315536066501968592002802633650001502661650001002676650002902686650001602715650002202731650002102753650002602774650001502800650001102815650001502826650001102841650001702852650001502869650001302884650000902897650001402906650001102920650002002931650002202951650001502973651001002988653001302998653001303011653002203024653001203046653002003058653001103078700002103089700002203110700002303132700002103155773009903176856008003275852000903355655001203364IND60622320520221118004214.0181124e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062232052DNAL7 a10.1177/09596836134962942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuido, Maria A12aA palynological contribution to the environmental archaeology of a Mediterranean mountain wetland (North West Apennines, Italy)  ap. 1517-1527.  aWithin the framework of a regional research project on wetlands as cultural heritage sites, an attempt was made to examine the natural and anthropogenic causes driving the vegetation dynamics and exploitation of a small mountain wetland. To assess its potential use as an archive of the landscape history, an environmental archaeology approach was used: palaeoenvironmental data from traditional pollen sampling by coring were matched with stratigraphic information from an excavation area of several square metres, and plant micro- and macroremain analyses (e.g. pollen assemblages, micro- and macrocharcoal, morphological and dendrochronological features of waterlogged tree trunks) were compared in order to evaluate them as effects of different environmental factors and to pinpoint these factors. In this paper, the focus is set mainly on the results originating from pollen analyses of a core drilled in the peat-bog, a few metres from the stratigraphic excavation. The start of peat deposition, sometimes coinciding with human activity, was dated around 10,000 cal. BP. The impact on the vegetation surrounding the site is clearly recorded in the pollen assemblages only from the Roman period (2010–1820 cal. BP) even though a long history of human presence is archaeologically documented in the area since the Palaeolithic. Since that time, the abrupt decline of fir favoured the final spread of beech which, in turn, in the Middle Ages (1180–790 cal. BP) leaves space to grassland exploitable for pasture and for agro-silvi-pastoral activities. This site has proven to be of great importance for the Holocene history of the silver fir.  aFunding This study is based on researches financially supported mainly by the project ‘Studio di fattibilità di un progetto per la conoscenza, conservazione e valorizzazione delle zone umide liguri’, sustained by MiBAC (Ministero per i Beni e le Attività Culturali) and developed between 2004 and 2006 by the L.A.S.A.

Virtually all spills to date have been into river systems without large lakes that may buffer downstream impacts. In August 2014, the failure of the Mount Polley copper (Cu)-gold mine TSF in British Columbia, Canada, released ~25 × 10⁶ m³ of water and solids; globally, this is the second largest TSF spill in history. Over 18 × 10⁶ m³ was delivered to Quesnel Lake, which is ~9 km from the TSF and is the third deepest lake in North America, and a crucial habitat for Pacific salmon and trout populations. We determined the sediment-associated Cu concentrations and fluxes in Quesnel River, downstream of the lake, from August 2014 to February 2021 based on the analysis of >400 samples of sediment, mainly collected using a continuous-flow centrifuge. During each winter since the spill, Cu concentrations in the fluvial sediment in the upper reaches of the river (~35 km from the TSF) were elevated relative to regional background concentrations and samples collected before the spill. Maximum Cu concentrations were ~410 mg kg⁻¹ which exceeds Canadian sediment quality guidelines for the protection of aquatic organisms (197 mg kg⁻¹). Monitoring of Quesnel Lake since the spill shows that these annual pulses in the winter are due to resuspension of unconsolidated tailings and sediments at the bottom of Quesnel Lake, during autumnal lake turnover, which become mixed throughout the water column and subsequently flow into Quesnel River. Results show that while large lakes may buffer downstream aquatic systems from contaminated sediment, they may prolong the environmental impact. These findings are crucial in understanding how lake processes may modify the effects of TSF spills on downstream aquatic systems.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOncorhynchus 3acopper 3aenvironment 3aenvironmental impact 3ahabitats 3alakes 3arivers 3asediment contamination 3asediments 3atrout 3awinter 3aBritish Columbia 0aMine tailings 0aMount Polley mine 0aContaminant fluxes 0aDownstream impacts 0aQuesnel River watershed 0aSalmon habitat1 aPetticrew, E.L.1 aAlbers, S.J.1 aFrench, T.D.1 aGranger, B.1 aLaval, B.1 aLindgren, J.1 aSussbauer, R.1 aVagle, S.0 tScience of the total environment.g2023 Jan. 15, v. 856 p.158927-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1589273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03219naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004200113040001800155100002400173245012600197300001600323520188200339592002802221650002002249650001702269650001102286650001702297650001302314650001402327650002002341650001702361650001302378650001802391650002402409650001202433650006902445650001102514700001802525773020202543856005502745852000902800655001202809IND50072950220221118145421.0140212e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007295022DNAL7 a225541852pmid7 a10.1111/j.1476-4431.2012.00750.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNielsen, Lindsey K.10aCompartment syndrome: pathophysiology, clinical presentations, treatment, and prevention in human and veterinary medicine  ap. 291-302.  aOBJECTIVE: To review the human and veterinary literature pertaining to all forms of compartment syndrome (CS). DATA SOURCES: Data sources included scientific reviews and original research publications from the human and veterinary literature. HUMAN DATA SYNTHESIS: While CS affecting the extremities has been recognized in people for decades, other forms of CS in the abdominal and thoracic cavities are recently gaining more attention. The role of CS in critically ill people is a rapidly growing area of interest. More research on prevention and treatment of CS is being conducted in people because some studies have found mortality rates as high as 80% for those suffering from these conditions. VETERINARY DATA SYNTHESIS: While a significant amount of experimental studies of CS have been performed on small animals, there is a marked lack of primary veterinary studies. The majority of the veterinary literature includes case reports and series, and many of these studies were published over a decade ago. However, the increased recognition of CS in people has sparked an interest in veterinary critical care medicine and this has been demonstrated by the recent increased evaluation of compartment pressures in veterinary patients. CONCLUSIONS: CS is a complex clinical condition where increased pressure within a compartment can cause significant adverse effects within the compartment as well as throughout the body. Systemic inflammatory responses and local ischemia‐reperfusion elements can contribute to the detrimental effects seen in CS. This cascade of events results in increased mortality rates and contributes to the development of CS elsewhere. A better understanding of CS will help veterinarians improve patient care and outcome. Future studies on incidence, prevention, and treatment of CSs in the critical care patient are needed in veterinary medicine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3acase studies 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3amedicine 3amortality 3apathophysiology 3apatient care 3apatients 3aveterinarians 3aveterinary medicine 2aAnimals 2aCompartment Syndromesxclassificationxphysiopathologyxtherapy. 2aHumans1 aWhelan, Megan0 tJournal of veterinary emergency and critical care.g2012 June, v. 22, no. 3 p.291-302dBlackwell Science on behalf of the American College of Veterinary Emergency and Critical Carex1479-32617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1476-4431.2012.00750.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03204naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245012900169520182700298592002802125650001302153650001602166650001602182650002602198650001302224650001102237650001302248650002202261650001502283650002402298650001202322650001902334650001502353651001002368653001502378653001802393653002102411653001902432653002002451653001502471700001602486700001602502773011902518856008802637852000902725655001202734IND60794884420221120234402.0221004e20230115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079488442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1589292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Ruiyin10aTracing Fe cycle isotopically in soils based on different land uses: Insight from a typical karst catchment, Southwest China  aIron (Fe) isotopes can effectively unveil the Fe cycle mechanisms under redox and biological conditions during the weathering and pedogenic processes. Fe contents and Fe isotope compositions (defined as δ⁵⁶Fe) in the soil profiles under secondary forest land, abandoned cropland and shrubland were investigated in a typical karst area in Southwest China. The results showed that the Fe content ranged from 23.92 to 38.56 g/kg, 21.92 to 33.02 g/kg and 12.98 to 27.93 g/kg, and the δ⁵⁶Fe levels varied from −0.48 ‰ to 0.21 ‰, −0.24 ‰ to 0.11 ‰ and − 0.11 ‰ to 0.16 ‰ from the secondary forest land, abandoned cropland and shrubland, respectively. The correlation analysis results showed that Fe transportation and isotopic fractionation were regulated by the redox processes through soil pH and soil organic matter (SOM) in the abandoned cropland and shrubland. Heavier Fe isotope may be accumulated in the deeper soil of secondary forest land due to Fe-oxide precipitation. The Fe isotope fractionations were greatly altered by soil organic carbon (SOC) in surface soils due to negative surface charges. Soil pH also plays a key role in enriching lighter Fe in a medium-acidic environment (shrubland) by ligand-controlled dissolution and reductive dissolution. Long-term cultivation in abandoned cropland and grazing in shrubland reshaped the Fe cycle in soil profiles by changing soil pH and SOC contents. However, the similar values of δ⁵⁶Fe in different land use soils indicated that the agricultural activities have no significant impact on the Fe transformation in karst soil ecosystems. The land utilization is reasonable in the Yinjiang County. This study provided effective data and insightful analysis to understand the Fe cycle processes in the karst soils under varied land uses.  aPublisher supplied data 3acropland 3aenvironment 3aforest land 3aisotope fractionation 3aisotopes 3akarsts 3aland use 3asecondary forests 3ashrublands 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil pH 3atransportation 3awatersheds 3aChina 0aIron cycle 0aIron isotopes 0aIsotopic tracing 0aLand-use types 0aLimestone soils 0aKarst area1 aZhang, Qian1 aXu, Zhifang0 tScience of the total environment.g2023 Jan. 15, v. 856 p.158929-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1589293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03566naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009100169300001400260520213200274592002802406650002502434650001102459650001902470650000902489650001802498650002702516650001502543650001702558650002502575650001402600650002902614650002102643650001902664650001102683650001102694650000902705650001902714651001102733653001902744653000902763653001602772653003102788653001102819653003102830773010502861856008502966852000903051655001203060IND60621815120221118182102.0181121e20190102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062181512DNAL7 a10.1080/14693062.2018.14482542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartus, Ellie10aRussian industry responses to climate change: the case of the metals and mining sector  ap. 17-29.  aGlobally, the metals and mining sector is a major contributor to GHG emissions. Climate change also poses significant challenges for the industry in a number of ways, including risks to infrastructure and equipment, transport routes and the cost of energy supplies. The sector is of particular importance to Russia, and yet very little is known about how the sector positions itself in relation to this key issue. This article conducts an in-depth look at the response of the Russian metals and mining sector to climate change. It looks at the key actors, their willingness to engage with the issue of climate change, preferred policy options and the strategies adopted to further their interests. The role of companies, prominent individuals and business associations is considered. The evidence suggests that, although there is widespread acceptance of climate change as a phenomenon, there is significant variation within the sector, with some companies proactive on climate policy, and others more reluctant. Different responses are attributed to reputational factors and the disproportionate influence of international and domestic policy developments on companies. Russian coal companies, directly threatened by any international attempts to reduce coal consumption, display the strongest opposition to efforts aimed at curbing emissions. The Russian government, far from thinking of transitioning to a low carbon future, is vigorously trying to expand the coal industry. Key policy insights Understanding how Russia’s domestic position on climate policy is formed is fundamental for understanding the factors driving its international engagement on climate policy. The Russian government has no plans to phase out coal and is instead actively seeking to expand the coal industry. This highlights the obstacles to Russia’s commitment to climate policy at both the domestic and international levels. The socio-economic consequences of climate policy for the Russian coal industry are a key consideration for the government, with some regions heavily dependent on the industry for employment and electricity generation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3acarbon 3aclimate change 3acoal 3acoal industry 3aelectricity generation 3aemployment 3aenergy costs 3aenvironmental policy 3aequipment 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3ainfrastructure 3ametals 3amining 3arisk 3asocioeconomics 3aRussia 0aClimate change 0acoal 0aenvironment 0ametals and mining industry 0aRussia 0astate–business relations0 tClimate policy.g2019 Jan. 2, v. 19, no. 1 p.17-29dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19684x1752-74577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14693062.2018.14482543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03399naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245013700168520199700305592002802302650001902330650001302349650001502362650001202377650001602389650001202405650001502417650001102432650003302443650002002476650002202496651001002518653002002528653002302548653001902571653003202590700001302622700001302635700001402648700001802662700001702680700001602697773011902713856008802832852000902920655001202929IND60794885120221121025811.0221004e20230110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079488512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1589402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yongge14aThe role of land use change in affecting ecosystem services and the ecological security pattern of the Hexi Regions, Northwest China  aThe land use and land cover change (LUCC) associated with climate change and human activities is supposed to exert a significant effect on ecosystem functions in arid inland regions. However, the role of LUCC in shaping the spatio-temporal patterns of ecosystem services and ecological security remain unclear, especially under different future LUCC scenarios. Here, we evaluated dynamic changes of ecosystem services and ecological security pattern (ESP) in the Hexi Regions based on LUCC and other environment variables by integrating morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA), entropy weight method and circuit theory. Our result showed that the LUCC was generally stable from 1980 to 2050. Compare to 2020, the land conversion under natural growth (NG), ecological protection (EP) and urban development (UD) scenarios in 2050 has changed by 10.30 %, 10.10 %, and 10.31 %, respectively. The forest, medium-cover grassland and water increased in the EP scenario, and construction land and cropland greatly expanded in the other two scenarios. Ecosystem services grew larger in the EP scenario by 2050 in comparison with the NG and UD scenarios. The ESP in the Hexi Regions has obvious spatial differences during 1980–2050. The larger ecological sources and less resistance corridors were mainly distributed in the central and eastern of the Hexi Regions with high ecosystem services. Conversely, fragmented ecological sources and larger resistance corridors were mostly located in the western regions blocked by sandy land, bare land or mountains. Compared to 2020, the area of ecological sources and pinch points under the EP scenario in 2050 increased by 4.10 × 10³ km² and 0.31 × 10³ km², respectively. The number of ecological corridors reduced while the length and resistance increased apart from the EP scenario. Our results highlighted the importance of ecological protection in shaping the LUCC, which further enhances the integrity of ecosystem and ecological security.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3acropland 3aecosystems 3aentropy 3aenvironment 3aforests 3agrasslands 3ahumans 3aland use and land cover maps 3aland use change 3aurban development 3aChina 0aLUCC simulation 0aEcosystem services 0aCircuit theory 0aEcological security pattern1 aLiu, Wei1 aFeng, Qi1 aZhu, Meng1 aYang, Linshan1 aZhang, Jutao1 aYin, Xinwei0 tScience of the total environment.g2023 Jan. 10, v. 855 p.158940-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1589403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04038naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245013800165300001300303520210700316536020902423592002802632596009802660596009802758596010302856650001402959650002002973650001202993650001303005650001303018650001603031650001903047650001003066650002803076650002903104653001403133653002103147653005103168653004403219653001303263700001603276700001303292700001703305700001203322773011603334856008503450852000903535655001203544IND60621815920221118181937.0181121e20190102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062181592DNAL7 a10.1080/15481603.2018.14844092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Lei13aAn improved building detection approach using L-band POLSAR two-dimensional time-frequency decomposition over oriented built-up areas  ap. 1-21.  aThe objective of this study is to efficiently extract detailed information about various man-made targets in oriented built-up areas using polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (POLSAR) images. This paper develops an improved approach for building detection by utilizing Two-Dimensional Time-Frequency (2-D TF) decomposition. This method performs outstandingly in distinguishing between man-made and natural targets based on the isotropic behaviors, frequency-sensitive responses, and scattering mechanisms of objects. The proposed method can preserve the spatial resolution and exploit the advantages of TF decomposition; specifically, the exact outlines of buildings can be effectively located, and more types of features (e.g., flat roofs, roads, and walls that are oblique to the radar illumination) can be distinguished from forests in complex built-up areas by 2-D TF decomposition. The coarser-resolution subaperture images that are produced in the azimuth direction, which correspond to different looking angles, are beneficial for detecting man-made structures with main scattering centers oriented at oblique angles with respect to the radar illumination. In the range direction, the obtained subaperture images, which correspond to various observation frequencies, can be helpful in distinguishing flat roofs and roads from forests. This method was successfully implemented to analyze both NASA/JPL L-band AIRSAR and L-band EMISAR data sets. The building detection results of the proposed method exhibit a significant improvement over those of other methods and reach an overall accuracy over 80%, with approximately 20% higher than the accuracies of K-means clustering and the entropy/alpha-Wishart classifier and approximately 10% higher than the accuracy of the support vector machine method. Moreover, building details can be precisely detected, obliquely oriented buildings can be identified, and the distinction between buildings and forests is significantly improved, as both visually and statistically indicated.

Results showed that the comparison of the giver's and receiver's resources and ages, the receiver's liking for the product received, being a gift from a first‐time giver, the receiver's satisfaction with the experience and the impact of the gift on the giver–receiver relationship were significant predictors of whether a commercial product received as a gift would become a special, common or hated object for the receiver.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aconsumer behavior 3asurveys 3aEcuador0 tInternational journal of consumer studies.g2014 Mar., v. 38, no. 2 p.139-145dBlackwell Sciencex1470-64237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ijcs.12075  aDNAL 7aarticle02767naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001400146245012800160300001800288520118400306536013001490592002801620650001101648650002201659650001001681650001701691650000901708650001501717650001101732650001301743650000901756650001101765650001201776650001901788650001201807651001901819651001001838653001901848653002101867653001401888653001801902653001701920653002301937700001301960700001901973700001601992700001402008700001502022773009902037856008002136852000902216655001202225IND60622322120221121003003.0181124e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062232212DNAL7 a10.1177/09596836135053422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCriado, C10aEvidence of historic infilling of valleys in Lanzarote after the Timanfaya eruption (ad 1730–1736, Canary Islands, Spain)  ap. 1786-1796.  aThe Timanfaya eruption (1730–1736) was the most important volcanic event on the Canary Islands during historical times (after the 15th century ad). It produced lava flows and pyroclastic layers that buried around 23% of Lanzarote’s surface. Throughout the island, artificial cross-sections such as soil quarries and road trenches reveal an ash layer covering palaeosoils (argids) or interbedded with alluvial sediment, infilling the bottoms of U-shaped valleys. Five cross-sections located in different parts of the island (Puerto Calero, Femés, Tiagua, Guatiza and Valle de San José) were subjected to sedimentological analyses of colour, texture, carbonate-content and grain-sizes; sand fractions were also studied and finally, mineralogy using x-ray diffraction, and geochemistry (total oxides and trace elements) were applied. These data, along with radiocarbon ages, archaeological remains (pottery) and historical documents, identify the ash layer as part of the Timanfaya eruption. The alluvial sediments covering this layer could have been produced by runoff from heavy rain events, probably the famous Huracán de 1826, also known as the Tormenta de San Florencio.  aFunding This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArgids 3aX-ray diffraction 3acolor 3ageochemistry 3alava 3amineralogy 3aoxides 3aquarries 3arain 3arunoff 3atexture 3atrace elements 3avalleys 3aCanary Islands 3aSpain 0aCanary Islands 0aHuracán de 1826 0aLanzarote 0alate Holocene 0asoil erosion 0aTimanfaya eruption1 aDorta, P1 aBethencourt, J1 aNavarro, JF1 aRomero, C1 aGarcía, C0 tHolocene.g, v. 23, no. 12 p.1786-1796dSAGE PublicationswJournal:J000001502x1477-09117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836135053423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03159naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245015900172300001400331520151100345536011801856592002801974596008502002650001102087650001502098650001402113650002002127650001802147650001102165650001502176650001502191650001902206650001502225650001502240653001302255653001502268653002802283653002502311653001502336653001802351700002102369700001802390700002202408700002402430773011702454856008502571852000902656655001202665IND60621816220221118182111.0181121e20190102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062181622DNAL7 a10.1080/15481603.2018.14922132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSibanda, Mbulisi10aEstimating LAI and mapping canopy storage capacity for hydrological applications in wattle infested ecosystems using Sentinel-2 MSI derived red edge bands  ap. 68-86.  aThis study assessed the strength of Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument (MSI) derived Red Edge (RE) bands in estimating Leaf Area Index (LAI) and mapping canopy storage capacity (CSC) for hydrological applications in wattle infested ecosystems. To accomplish this objective, this study compared the estimation strength of models derived, using standard bands (all bands excluding the RE band) with those including RE bands, as well as different vegetation indices. Sparse Partial Least Squares (SPLSR) and Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) ensembles were used in this study. Results showed that the RE spectrum covered by the Sentinel-2 MSI satellite reduced the estimation error by a magnitude of 0.125 based on simple ratio (RE SR) vegetation indices from 0.157 m²· m⁻² based on standard bands, and by 0.078 m²· m⁻² based on red edge normalised difference vegetation (NDVI-RE). The optimal models for estimating LAI to map CSC were obtained based on the RE bands centered at 705 nm (Band 5), 740 nm (Band 6), 783 nm (Band 7) as well as 865 nm (Band 8a). A root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 0.507 m²· m⁻² a relative root mean square error of prediction (RRMSEP) of 11.3% and R² of 0.91 for LAI and a RMSEP of 0.246 m²/m² (RRMSEP = 7.9%) and R² of 0.91 for CSC were obtained. Overall, the findings of this study underscore the relevance of the new copernicus satellite product in rapid monitoring of ecosystems that are invaded by alien invasive species.  aThis work was supported by the The South African Research Chairs Initiative (SARChI)/UKZN/Rural Agronomy [86893];  aPublisher supplied data  a86893cThe South African Research Chairs Initiative (SARChI)/UKZN/Rural Agronomy 3acanopy 3aecosystems 3ahydrology 3aleaf area index 3aleast squares 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aprediction 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3avegetation 0aaccuracy 0aecosystems 0acanopy storage capacity 0aregression ensembles 0asoil water 0awater balance1 aMutanga, Onisimo1 aDube, Timothy1 aS Vundla, Thulile1 aL Mafongoya, Paramu0 tGIScience & remote sensing.g2019 Jan. 2, v. 56, no. 1 p.68-86dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19689x1943-72267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15481603.2018.14922133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03250naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245015700164300001600321520186500337592002802202650001502230650001402245650001902259650001102278650002102289650001602310650001902326650002102345650001302366653000902379653001902388653002102407653002002428653001102448653000702459653000802466700002202474700001602496700001602512700001602528700002302544773011902567856008502686852000902771655001202780IND60621816520221118182044.0181121e20190102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062181652DNAL7 a10.1080/15481603.2018.14953952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Tao10aEvaluating the potential of multi-view data extraction from small Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) for object-based classification for Wetland land covers  ap. 130-159.  aUnmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) have the potential to provide multi-view data, but the approaches used to extract the multi-view data from UAS and investigation of their use in image classification are currently unavailable in publications to our best knowledge. This study presents a method that combines collinearity equations and a two-phase optimization procedure to automatically project a point from real world coordinate system of an orthoimage to UAS image coordinate system (row and column numbers) to be used in multi-view data extraction. The results show average errors for the computed UAS column and row numbers were 1.6 and 1.8 pixels respectively evaluated with leave-one-out method. Based on this algorithm, it’s also for the first time that object-based multi-view data were extracted and presented, and the potential of using the multi-view data to aid Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis(GEOBIA) through bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) modelling was evaluated with two representatives of BRDFs, the Rahman-Pinty-Verstraete(RPV) and Ross-Thick-LiSparse (RTLS). Our results indicate the RPV model tends to overestimate the bidirectional reflectance for land cover types with high reflectance, while perform well for those with relatively low reflectance in our study area. To test the impact of using multi-view data on image classification, we extracted parameters from BRDF models and used these parameters as object features for object-based classification. The 10-fold cross validation results show that the 3-parameter RTLS significantly improved overall accuracy compared to the classifications relying only on the orthoimage features, while other BRDF models did not show significant improvements, raising the needs to develop new methods to better utilize the multi-view information in GEOIBA in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aequations 3aimage analysis 3amodels 3aorthophotography 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3avegetation types 3awetlands 0aBRDF 0aclassification 0amulti-angle data 0amulti-view data 0aGEOBIA 0aRF 0aUAS1 aAbd-Elrahman, Amr1 aDewitt, Bon1 aSmith, Scot1 aMorton, Jon1 aWilhelm, Victor L.0 tGIScience & remote sensing.g2019 Jan. 2, v. 56, no. 1 p.130-159dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19689x1943-72267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15481603.2018.14953953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03688naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245016200165300001800327520205500345536021302400592002802613650001502641650001902656650002102675650001102696650001502707650001702722650001602739650002602755650001202781650002402793650001402817650002202831650001502853651001702868653001002885653001002895653001402905653001302919653001702932653001702949700001902966700002102985773009903006856008003105852000903185655001203194IND60622323020221121011436.0181124e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062232302DNAL7 a10.1177/09596836135081572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLyons, Richard10aChronology and controls of donga (gully) formation in the upper Blood River catchment, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa: Evidence for a climatic driver of erosion  ap. 1875-1887.  aDongas (gullies and badland-type terrain) are found extensively across interior South Africa, but the controls on their formation remain contested. Establishing the timing of donga formation is essential for developing a clearer understanding of the relative importance of natural (e.g. climatic) and human (e.g. overgrazing) controls. Here, we present optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages for colluvial sediments exposed in the sidewalls of dongas and for tributary fan sediments deposited downslope of dongas in the upper Blood River catchment, eastern South Africa. The tributary fan ages enable the timing of donga formation to be established, since fan sedimentation is a direct result of upslope donga erosion. The OSL ages indicate that net colluviation and intervening palaeosol formation occurred from prior to 22 ka until ~1.6 ka. From ~0.89 ka to present, there has been a shift to net erosion characterised by widespread donga formation and tributary fan sedimentation. Contemporary donga formation in interior South Africa has most commonly been attributed to changing land-use practices associated with European settlement from the second half of the 18th century onwards, but the OSL chronology indicates that dongas in the study area began forming significantly prior to European settlement. Instead, the initiation and main phase of donga formation encompasses periods of abrupt climatic changes associated with the ‘Mediaeval Climate Anomaly’ (ad ~900–1300) and the ‘Little Ice Age’ (ad ~1300–1800). The magnitude and abruptness of climatic changes during these periods appear to have destabilised hillslopes and initiated the shift from long-term net colluviation to net erosion by donga formation. The OSL-based approach to constraining the timing of donga formation adopted in this study has broader implications for assessment of the drivers of historical and contemporary donga (gully) formation elsewhere in South Africa and other drylands, and may help to inform management strategies for degrading lands.  aFunding This research was conducted while RL was in receipt of a NERC PhD studentship at Aberystwyth University.

The functional role of fires in savannas and forests can be investigated through examining sedimentary charcoal in order to reconstruct long-term fire history. However, the relationship between charcoal and vegetation structure in tropical grassy ecosystems remains to be elucidated. Here, we compared recent charcoal records from lake sediments in three tropical ecosystems (forest, savanna, and forest–savanna mosaic) with land cover inferred from remote-sensing images. Charcoal width-to-length (W/L) ratio is a good proxy for changes in fuel type. At one of the lakes, a significant W/L modification from values >0.5 (mainly wood) to <0.5 (~grass) was recorded simultaneously with changes in land cover. Indeed, a significant deforestation was recorded around this lake in the remote-sensing imagery between 1984 and 1994. The results also indicate that a riparian forest around a lake could act as a physical filter for charcoal accumulation; we used the mean charcoal size as a proxy to evaluate this process. Charcoal Accumulation Rates (CHAR), a burned biomass proxy, were combined with W/L ratio and the mean charcoal size to investigate the land-use history of the landscapes surrounding the study sites. This combined approach allowed us to distinguish between episodic slash-and-burn practices in the forest and managed fields or pastures burning frequently.  aFunding This study was financially supported by the French National Research Agency (ANR, 2008-29489-62704-33) through the ErA Net BiodivERsA CoForChange project to SGF and the CNRS-PICS Inter-Tropical Fires project to CC.

However, the existing data-driven models mostly focus on the selection of input features and the adjustment of model structure, and less on the impact of spatial connectivity on daily streamflow prediction. In this paper, a basin network based on graph-structured data is constructed by considering the spatial connectivity of different stations in the real basin. Furthermore, a novel graph neural network model, variational Bayesian edge-conditioned graph convolution model, which consists of edge-conditioned convolution networks and variational Bayesian inference, is proposed to assess the spatial connectivity effects on daily streamflow forecasting. The proposed graph neural network model is applied to forecast the next-day streamflow of a hydrological station in the Yangtze River Basin, China. Six comparative models and three comparative experimental groups are used to validate model performance. The results show that the proposed model has excellent performance in terms of deterministic prediction accuracy (NSE ≈ 0.980, RMSE≈1362.7 and MAE ≈ 745.8) and probabilistic prediction reliability (ICPC≈0.984 and CRPS≈574.1), which demonstrates that establishing appropriate connectivity and reasonably identifying connection relationships in the basin network can effectively improve the deterministic and probabilistic forecasting performance of the graph convolutional model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3abasins 3aenvironment 3amodel validation 3aneural networks 3aprediction 3astream flow 3awatersheds 3aChina 3aYangtze River 0aGraph neural network 0aStreamflow forecasting 0aUncertainty assessment 0aVariational inference 0aDeep learning 0aSpatial connectivity1 aOuyang, Shuo1 aQin, Hui1 aLichuanjushi,1 aShen, Qin1 aQu, Yuhua1 aZheng, Zhiwei1 aSun, Huaiwei1 aZhou, Jianzhong0 tScience of the total environment.g2023 Jan. 10, v. 855 p.158968-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1589683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02808naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011400169300001600283520101600299536014401315592002801459596015501487650001901642650002701661650001701688650001301705650001201718650001001730650001501740650002001755650001701775650001201792650002201804650002001826650000901846650001201855650001001867651001101877653002901888653001301917653002101930653001101951653001401962653001001976700002301986700001802009700002002027773012502047856008502172852000902257655001202266IND60621817820221118182557.0181121e20171102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062181782DNAL7 a10.1080/1747423X.2017.13982802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrade, Thomas10aCan domestic production of iLUC-free feedstock from arable land supply Sweden’s future demand for biofuels?  ap. 407-441.  aThe increasing biofuel production from agricultural crops has been suggested to cause indirect land use change (iLUC). This increases interest in biofuel feedstocks that qualify as iLUC-free: (1) residues without a market, (2) crops from previously unused arable land, (3) additional crops and (4) biomass from intensified production. In the present study, biofuel potential from such feedstocks was quantified for Sweden and compared against the predicted biofuel demand from agricultural resources in 2030. The results indicate that straw (category 1) could cover up to 37% of future biofuel demand. Grass leys from intensified production (category 4), set-aside and abandoned land (category 2) and excess grass silage (category 1) could cover up to 79%. Intermediate and ecological focus area crops (category 3) could contribute up to 21%. To realize the biofuel targets, a high implementation rate of additional iLUC-free feedstock is needed. Future studies need to investigate impacts of low-iLUC policies.  aThis work was supported by the Swedish Energy Agency and the Swedish Knowledge Centre for Renewable Transportation Fuels [Project 40584-1].  aPublisher supplied data  aProject 40584-1: Biofuels from biomass from agricucSwedish Knowledge Centre for Renewable Transportation Fuelsdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004527 3aabandoned land 3aagricultural resources 3aarable soils 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3acrops 3afeedstocks 3afuel production 3agrass silage 3agrasses 3aissues and policy 3aland use change 3aleys 3amarkets 3astraw 3aSweden 0aIndirect land use change 0aresidues 0aenergy potential 0abiogas 0agrass ley 0astraw1 aBjörnsson, Lovisa1 aLantz, Mikael1 aAhlgren, Serina0 tJournal of land use science.g2017 Nov. 2, v. 12, no. 6 p.407-441dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000108x1747-42487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1747423X.2017.13982803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03221naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245014900165300001400314520170600328536020702034592002802241650002902269650001102298650001302309650002502322650001502347650001302362650001102375650001402386650001702400650001802417650001502435653001202450653002402462653001702486653002202503653002202525653002302547700002202570773009402592856008002686852000902766655001202775IND60622323920221121064215.0181124e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062232392DNAL7 a10.1177/09596836135121682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Brue, Hanne10aImpact of the spatial and thematic resolution of Holocene anthropogenic land-cover scenarios on modeled soil erosion and sediment delivery rates  ap. 67-77.  aRecent reconstructions of global Holocene vegetation may provide a powerful means to quantify long-term cumulative sediment fluxes induced by anthropogenic land-cover changes. However, the former’s low spatial resolutions question their potential for use in geomorphic models, since sediment redistribution processes operate at much smaller scales. Furthermore, current land-cover reconstructions often do not differentiate the typology of human impact, although the susceptibility of different anthropogenic land uses towards erosion varies greatly. Hence, the present study investigates the sensitivity of a spatially distributed erosion and sediment redistribution model to the spatial and thematic resolution of input land-cover information. The geomorphic model was applied to the Scheldt Basin (~19,000 km²) with low-resolution and high-resolution land-cover input, and subsequently compared to a field-based reference sediment budget of the Dijle subcatchment. Results indicate that low-resolution land-cover information, expressed as proportions of different land-cover types within each grid cell, leads to largely overestimated sediment fluxes. In contrast, spatial allocation of individual land-cover types to a 100-m grid yields more accurate results. These variations in model outcomes are related to differences in landscape connectivity between high- and low-resolution land cover. Moreover, geomorphic model results are non-linearly related to the area under cropland. This indicates that there is not only a need for land-cover reconstructions at high spatial resolution but also that differentiation of anthropogenic land-cover types is essential for accurate geomorphic modeling.  aFunding This work was supported by the KU Leuven Center for Archaeological Sciences, and the Interuniversity Attraction Poles program initiated by the Belgian Science Policy Office (grant number P7/09).  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3abasins 3acropland 3ahabitat connectivity 3aland cover 3aland use 3amodels 3asediments 3asoil erosion 3asubwatersheds 3avegetation 0aBelgium 0ageomorphic modeling 0ahuman impact 0aland-cover change 0asediment dynamics 0aspatial resolution1 aVerstraeten, Gert0 tHolocene.g, v. 24, no. 1 p.67-77dSAGE PublicationswJournal:J000001502x1477-09117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836135121683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02848naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245015100171300001600322520129400338536015301632592002801785596002901813650001101842650001801853650002301871650001401894650001501908650001101923650000901934650002201943650001001965651001301975651001201988653001202000653001102012653001702023653001802040653001102058700002002069700004702089700002302136773012502159856008502284852000902369655001202378IND60621818020221118182247.0181121e20171102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062181802DNAL7 a10.1080/1747423X.2017.14046482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMena, Carlos F.10aModeling road building, deforestation and carbon emissions due deforestation in the Ecuadorian Amazon: the potential impact of oil frontier growth  ap. 477-492.  aIn the Ecuadorian Amazon roads play the major role in transforming land cover. Since the beginning of the oil development in this region, oil exploration and road building have been linked. The objectives of this paper are twofold: First, to present a scenario of future deforestation as result of expanding the oil frontier in the Ecuadorian Amazon until the year 2030. Second, to produce an analysis of possible carbon emission scenarios as results of the deforestation produced. This paper tries to shed light into how the development of new oil concessions impact land associated environmental services. The paper uses spatial explicit simulations, that are based on parameters built using past land transitions from areas that experimented oil development, and that explain possible outcomes in the year 2030 using current and predicted road network. Simulations indicate that under current transition probabilities and a conservative scenario road construction, more than 2 million hectares will be affected, which is 35% of the area covered by concessions, which would release 51 to 148 MT of carbon to the atmosphere. This paper illustrates the strong links between road building and deforestation, where even small amount of road construction can have large effects on land cover.  aThese research was funded in part by the Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI).

In this paper, a comprehensive review of the studies on simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removal (SNPR) during 1986–2022 (538 publications) was conducted using bibliometrics, which showed that simultaneous nitrification, denitrification, and phosphorus removal (SNDPR) is the most promising process. To better understand SNDPR, the dissolved oxygen, carbon to nitrogen ratio, carbon source type, sludge retention time, Cu²⁺ and Fe³⁺, pH, salinity, electron acceptor type of denitrifying phosphorus-accumulating organisms (DPAOs), temperature, and other influencing factors were analyzed. Currently, SNDPR has been successfully implemented in activated sludge systems, aerobic granular sludge systems, biofilm systems, and constructed wetlands; sequential batch mode of operation is a common means to achieve this process. SNDPR exhibits a significant potential for phosphorus recovery. Future research needs to focus on: (1) balancing the competitiveness between denitrifying glycogen-accumulating organisms (DGAOs) and DPAOs, and countermeasures to deal with the effects of adverse conditions on SNDPR performance; (2) achieving SNDPR in continuous flow operation; and (3) maximizing the recovery of P during SNDPR to achieve resource sustainability. Overall, this study provides systematic and valuable information for deeper insights into SNDPR, which can help in further research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3abibliometric analysis 3abiofilm 3acarbon 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3adenitrification 3adissolved oxygen 3aenvironment 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3apH 3aphosphorus 3asalinity 3asustainable development 3atemperature 3awastewater 0aSimultaneous nitrification, denitrification and phosphorus removal 0aBibliometric analysis 0aImpacting factors 0aApplication 0aPhosphorus recovery1 aYang, Shanshan,1 aZhong, Le1 aPang, Ji-Wei1 aZhang, Luyan1 aXia, Xue-Fen1 aYang, Fan1 aXie, Guo-Jun1 aLiu, Bing-Feng1 aRen, Nan-Qi1 aDing, Jie0 tScience of the total environment.g2023 Jan. 15, v. 856 p.158977-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1589773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02947naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245013200168300001600300520163400316536009701950592002802047650001302075650002002088650001302108650000802121650001102129650002202140650002102162650000902183650001702192650000902209651001202218653000902230653001302239653001302252653002302265700002002288700002002308773009602328856008002424852000902504655001202513IND60622324320221121045943.0181124e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062232432DNAL7 a10.1177/09596836135157292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpötl, Christoph10aLong-term mass balance of perennial firn and ice in an Alpine cave (Austria): Constraints from radiocarbon-dated wood fragments  ap. 165-175.  aHundsalm ice cave located at 1520 m altitude in a karst region of western Austria contains up to 7-m-thick deposits of snow, firn and congelation ice. Wood fragments exposed in the lower parts of an ice and firn wall were radiocarbon accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) dated. Although the local stratigraphy is complex, the 19 individual dates – the largest currently available radiocarbon dataset for an Alpine ice cave – allow to place constraints on the accumulation and ablation history of the cave ice. Most of the cave was either ice free or contained only a small firn and ice body during the ‘Roman Warm Period’; dates of three wood fragments mark the onset of firn and ice build-up in the 6th and 7th century ad. In the central part of the cave, the oldest samples date back to the 13th century and record ice growth coeval with the onset of the ‘Little Ice Age’. The majority of the ice and firn deposit, albeit compromised by a disturbed stratigraphy, appears to have been formed during the subsequent centuries, supported by wood samples from the 15th to the 17th century. The oldest wood remains found so far inside the ice is from the end of the Bronze Age and implies that local relics of prehistoric ice may be preserved in this cave. The wood record from Hundsalm ice cave shows parallels to the Alpine glacier history of the last three millennia, for example, the lack of preserved wood remains during periods of known glacier minima, and underscores the potential of firn and ice in karst cavities as a long-term palaeoclimate archive, which has been degrading at an alarming rate in recent years.  aFunding Part of the radiocarbon analyses were funded by a grant of the Swarovski Foundation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3adata collection 3aglaciers 3aice 3akarsts 3amass spectrometry 3apaleoclimatology 3asnow 3astratigraphy 3awood 3aAustria 0aAlps 0acave ice 0aHolocene 0aradiocarbon dating1 aReimer, Paula J1 aLuetscher, Marc0 tHolocene.g, v. 24, no. 2 p.165-175dSAGE PublicationswJournal:J000001502x1477-09117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836135157293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02559naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011900169300001600288520115000304592002801454650002701482650001501509650001701524650001201541650001901553650002001572650001301592650001501605650001201620650002201632650001301654650001901667650002401686653001901710653003901729653001301768653003501781653002701816653002001843700001901863773012501882856008502007852000902092655001202101IND60621818420221118182618.0181121e20180704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062181842DNAL7 a10.1080/1747423X.2018.15373132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiamond, S.

For rural smallholders, shifting cultural, social, economic, demographic, environmental, and climatic pressures are all impacting livelihoods simultaneously. We present two case studies in which residents list livelihood priorities such as access to healthcare, markets, education, and agricultural extension support above climate change adaptation management. Impacts of climate change cannot be separated from impacts of capitalist economic systems on those most dependent upon natural resources, since by nature modern capitalism and associated structures of landownership and resource access blocks economic mobility by those too poor to differentiate their economic activities. To meaningfully improve adaptive strategies to increasing climate variability for the world’s poor and subsistence agriculturists, a re-thinking of economic and social support is required; one that goes beyond land use and management objectives and includes creating more permeable economic and social structures across larger political landscapes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural extension 3acapitalism 3acase studies 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3ahealth services 3aland use 3alivelihood 3amarkets 3anatural resources 3apolitics 3asocial support 3asubsistence farming 0aClimate change 0acoupled human-environmental system 0aforestry 0ahuman-environment interactions 0alandscape conservation 0aland use policy1 aAnsharyani, I.0 tJournal of land use science.g2018 July 4, v. 13, no. 4 p.447-453dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000108x1747-42487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1747423X.2018.15373133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02955naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245014100162300001600303520140900319536014601728592002801874650001001902650002101912650001001933650001201943650001201955650001901967650001201986650001201998650002202010650001102032650001102043650001002054650001302064650000902077650001402086651002102100653001802121653001302139653001502152653001002167653000802177653000902185653000902194653001902203700001802222773009602240856008002336852000902416655001202425IND60622324520221121055236.0181124e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062232452DNAL7 a10.1177/09596836135157312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Minkoo10aVegetation history, agricultural intensification, and changes in wood-resource utilization in ancient Southwest Korea (1500 bc–ad 700)  ap. 118-129.  aAn overview is presented of the analysis of wood remains at 11 archaeological sites in the southwestern region of the Korean Peninsula, and the results are used to shed light on the changes in wood-resource selection around the villages over the periods of c. 1500–300 bc and ad 1–700. Pollen research on swamps of the region has previously revealed that oak (Quercus), alder (Alnus), and pine (Pinus) were the major woodland components, and that pine became increasingly prevalent after c. 1500 bc under the influence of agricultural expansion and climatic changes. Agricultural activities are represented by the dominance of grasses (Poaceae) in the pollen records. The wood collection underwent changes over time but not in direct response to the regional vegetation change. Wood was not randomly collected during the Mumun Period (c. 1500–300 bc), with oak being preferentially selected despite the increasing dominance of pine. Chestnut tree (Castanea crenata Siebold & Zucc.) was routinely used during and after the Proto-Three-Kingdoms Period (c. ad 1–300) and was used almost exclusively at some sites. Such abundance suggests that the site occupants managed the neighboring forests and promoted the propagation of chestnut trees. Pinewood rarely appears in the retrieved samples, which suggests that the versatile use of pinewood is a relatively recent tradition in the Holocene history.  aFunding This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by the Korean Government (NRF-2013S1A2A1A01033235).  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlnus 3aCastanea crenata 3aPinus 3aPoaceae 3aQuercus 3aclimate change 3aforests 3agrasses 3aintensive farming 3apollen 3aswamps 3atrees 3avillages 3awood 3awoodlands 3aKorean Peninsula 0aarchaeobotany 0achestnut 0aGeum River 0aKorea 0aoak 0apine 0awood 0aYeongsan River1 aPark, Jungjae0 tHolocene.g, v. 24, no. 1 p.118-129dSAGE PublicationswJournal:J000001502x1477-09117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836135157313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03162naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245010200167300001600269520137900285536012901664592002801793650001901821650001101840650001301851650001201864650002101876650001401897650001001911650001501921650001701936650002101953650001701974650001801991650000902009650001402018650001502032650001202047650001502059650001102074651001402085653001602099653001902115653003002134653002002164653002002184653001802204700002102222700002102243700001902264700002102283700002102304700001902325700001902344773009602363856008002459852000902539655001202548IND60622324620221121055358.0181124e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062232462DNAL7 a10.1177/09596836135157322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGliganic, Luke A10aLate-Holocene climatic variability indicated by three natural archives in arid southern Australia  ap. 104-117.  aThree terrestrial climate proxies are used to investigate the evolution of Holocene palaeoenvironments in southern central Australia, all of which present a coherent record of palaeohydrology. Single-grain optically stimulated luminescence from sediments supplemented by ¹⁴C from charcoal and lacustrine shells was obtained to date shoreline deposits (Lake Callabonna) and the adjacent Mt Chambers Creek alluvial fan. Our findings are complemented by a U/Th-based record of speleothem growth in the Mt Chambers Creek catchment, which we interpret to reflect increased precipitation. Together, these archives shed light on the timing of, and possible sources of water for, Holocene pluvial intervals. We identified several phases of elevated lake levels dated at ~5.8–5.2, 4.5, 3.5–2.7 and 1 kyr, most of which correspond to fluvial activity resulting from increased precipitation in the adjacent ranges. The enhanced hydrology during phases of the late Holocene likely increased the reliability of resources for regional human populations during a time of reduced winter rainfall. When considered within the framework of the current understanding of Holocene palaeoclimate in central Australia, our data suggest that the pattern of landscape response was broadly synchronous with larger scale climatic variability and punctuated by pluvial periods greater than today.  aFunding This research was undertaken as part of an Australian Research Council Discovery project (DP1096911) to GCN and TJC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolocene epoch 3acarbon 3acharcoal 3aclimate 3ahuman population 3ahydrology 3alakes 3alandscapes 3aluminescence 3apaleoclimatology 3apaleoecology 3aradionuclides 3arain 3asediments 3ashorelines 3astreams 3awatersheds 3awinter 3aAustralia 0aarchaeology 0aarid Australia 0aenvironmental variability 0aFlinders Ranges 0aLake Callabonna 0alate Holocene1 aCohen, Timothy J1 aMay, Jan-Hendrik1 aJansen, John D1 aNanson, Gerald C1 aDosseto, Anthony1 aLarsen, Josh R1 aAubert, Maxime0 tHolocene.g, v. 24, no. 1 p.104-117dSAGE PublicationswJournal:J000001502x1477-09117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836135157323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02896naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245009100168300001600259520145800275536012901733592002801862650001301890650001201903650002101915650001501936650001301951650001101964650001401975650000901989650001601998651001302014653001702027653002402044653002202068653002702090653002502117653001802142700001702160700002202177700002102199700002102220773009602241856008002337852000902417655001202426IND60622324920221121121341.0181124e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062232492DNAL7 a10.1177/09596836135161712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKirkbride, Martin10aLate-Holocene and Younger Dryas glaciers in the northern Cairngorm Mountains, Scotland  ap. 141-148.  aWe present 17 cosmogenic ¹⁰Be ages of glacial deposits in Coire an Lochain (Cairngorm Mountains), which demonstrate that glacial and nival deposits cover a longer timescale than previously recognised. Five ages provide the first evidence of a late-Holocene glacier in the British Isles. A previously unidentified moraine ridge was deposited after c. 2.8 kyr and defines a small slab-like glacier with an equilibrium line altitude (ELA) at c. 1047 m. The late-Holocene glacier was characterised by rapid firnification and a dominance of sliding, enabling the glacier to construct moraine ridges in a relatively short period. Isotopic inheritance means that the glacier may have existed as recently as the ‘Little Ice Age’ (LIA) of the 17th or 18th century ad, a view supported by glacier-climate modelling. Nine ¹⁰Be ages confirm a Younger Dryas Stadial (YDS) age for a cirque-floor boulder till, and date the glacier maximum to c. 12.3 kyr when the ELA was at c. 963 m altitude. Both glaciers existed because of enhanced accumulation from wind-blown snow, but the difference in ELA of only c. 84 m belies the YDS–LIA temperature difference of c. 7°C and emphasises the glacioclimatic contrast between the two periods. Three ¹⁰Be ages from till boulders originally deposited in the YDS yield ages <5.5 kyr and indicate snow-avalanche disturbance of older debris since the mid-Holocene, as climate deteriorated towards marginal glaciation.  aFunding The research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sector.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3aclimate 3aglacial deposits 3aglaciation 3aglaciers 3amodels 3amountains 3asnow 3atemperature 3aScotland 0aberyllium 10 0aCairngorm Mountains 0acosmogenic dating 0aglacier reconstruction 0a‘Little Ice Age’ 0aYounger Dryas1 aEverest, Jez1 aBenn, Douglas I.,1 aGheorghiu, Delia1 aDawson, Alastair0 tHolocene.g, v. 24, no. 2 p.141-148dSAGE PublicationswJournal:J000001502x1477-09117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836135161713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03018naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003900151245011900190300001600309520155400325536006101879592002801940596002901968650001201997650001902009650002402028650001402052650002202066650002102088650001102109650001502120650000902135651001002144653002502154653001902179653000902198653002202207653003502229653003902264700002002303700002102323773012202344856008502466852000902551655001202560IND60621819120221118182233.0181121e20180504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062181912DNAL7 a10.1080/17550874.2018.15070532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernández de Castro, Alejandro G.10aChanges in the potential distribution of invasive plant species in continental Spain in response to climate change  ap. 349-361.  aBackground: Climate change may increase the risk of biological invasions. However, current knowledge of this interaction is limited. Aims: We aimed to quantify (1) the effect of climate change on the potential distribution of invasive plant species in Spain, (2) the importance of the area of origin of such species and (3) the vulnerability of different biogeographic provinces to future changes in climatic suitability for invaders. Methods: We applied six methods of species distribution modelling to assess the variation of climatically suitable areas for 40 alien plants. We developed a Potential Area Change Index and used it as the response variable in modelling for three future emissions scenarios and three global circulation models over three time periods. The area of origin and biogeographic province in Spain were also considered. Results: We found a highly specific response for each plant species rather than a clear trend for the entire set of species. Predicted climate suitability increased over higher emission scenarios and longer projected time lags. Neotropical species showed the greatest potential climatic range expansion. We detected a strong interaction between the geographic origin of a species and the biogeographic province. Conclusions: Special attention should be given to the areas where aridification of climate is projected and where introduced neotropical species are likely to expand their range. Future work should develop accurate species-specific approaches that allow the management invasive plant species.  aThis work was supported by the Fundación Biodiversidad.  aPublisher supplied data  cFundación Biodiversidad 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aecological invasion 3aemissions 3aintroduced plants 3ainvasive species 3amodels 3aprovenance 3arisk 3aSpain 0aBiological invasions 0aclimate change 0aGCMs 0aIberian Peninsula 0aspecies distribution modelling 0aPotential Area Change Index (PACI)1 aNavajas, Alicia1 aFagúndez, Jaime0 tPlant ecology & diversity.g2018 May 4, v. 11, no. 3 p.349-361dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000135x1755-16687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17550874.2018.15070533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02397naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002600146245010500172300001600277520102500293536022701318592002801545650002301573650001301596650001501609650001201624650000901636650001701645651001401662653001801676653001301694653002301707653001401730653002301744653002001767700002701787773009601814856008001910852000901990655001201999IND60622325120221121090300.0181124e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062232512DNAL7 a10.1177/09596836135168162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaruso Fermé, Laura,10aHolocene landscape changes and wood use in Patagonia: Plant macroremains from Cerro Casa de Piedra 7  ap. 188-197.  aThis paper studies the different practices employed in the acquisition of woody material used by hunter–gatherer societies from the northwestern region of the Santa Cruz Province, Argentine Patagonia, during the early and middle Holocene. In addressing this theme, we study carbonized and non-carbonized wood recovered from six stratigraphic levels from the Cerro Casa de Piedra 7 site. This research revealed that during the lowest level of occupation, a distinct range of woody species were utilized; these were subsequently absent in the rest of the stratigraphical levels studied. In fact, all the other levels analyzed presented the homogeneous presence of a single plant species: Nothofagus pumilio. This species has the largest representation among both the charcoal and uncharred wood fragments of the six levels studied. The study of the assemblage samples allowed us to identify differences between the various archaeological levels, which could be the product of behavioral and/or environmental differences.  aFunding This research has been funded by a doctoral grant of the Ministerio de Cultura y Educación de España presented to the first author (LCF), which was then carried out within the remits of the HUM2006-01129 Project.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNothofagus pumilio 3acharcoal 3alandscapes 3asociety 3awood 3awoody plants 3aArgentina 0aarchaeobotany 0aHolocene 0ahunter–gatherers 0alandscape 0aNothofagus pumilio 0aSouth Patagonia1 aCivalero, Maria Teresa0 tHolocene.g, v. 24, no. 2 p.188-197dSAGE PublicationswJournal:J000001502x1477-09117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836135168163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03597naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245006100170300001600231520153700247536024401784592002802028650001902056650001602075650002302091650002502114650001902139650001902158650001502177650001002192650001002202650001102212650001002223650001002233650001202243650001502255650001102270650001502281650001802296650000902314650002302323650001402346650001502360650001102375650001002386650001402396650001202410650000902422651001902431651001202450653001202462653001302474653002102487653000902508653001102517653001602528700002002544700001902564700001802583700002102601700002402622700002402646700002002670773009602690856008002786852000902866655001202875IND60622325420221121090316.0181124e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062232542DNAL7 a10.1177/09596836135168192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSteadman, David W.,10aLate-Holocene faunal and landscape change in the Bahamas  ap. 220-230.  aWe report an intertidal, bone-rich peat deposit on the windward (Atlantic Ocean) coast of Abaco, The Bahamas. The age of the Gilpin Point peat (c. 950–900 cal. yr BP) is based on five overlapping radiocarbon dates (one each from single pieces of wood of buttonwood Conocarpus erectus and sabal palm Sabal palmetto, and single bones of the Cuban crocodile Crocodylus rhombifer, Albury’s tortoise Chelonoidis alburyorum, and green turtle Chelonia mydas). The short time interval represented by the charcoal-rich peat suggests rapid sedimentation following initial anthropogenic fires on Abaco. The site’s diverse snail assemblage is dominated by terrestrial and freshwater species. The peat is exposed today only during exceptionally low tides, suggesting a lower sea level at the time of deposition as well as a degrading shoreline during the past millennium. Fossils from Gilpin Point represent a late-Holocene vertebrate community at the time of first human presence; only 10 of the 17 identified species of amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals still live on Abaco. Numerous unhealed bite marks on the inside of the thick carapaces of the green turtle attest to consumption by Cuban crocodiles, which probably scavenged turtles butchered by humans. This concept, along with the dense concentration of bones in the peat, and charring on some bones of the green turtle and Abaco tortoise, suggests a cultural origin of the bone deposit at Gilpin Point, where the only Amerindian artifact recovered thus far is a shell bead.  aFunding Financial support was provided by the US National Science Foundation (grant BCS-1118369 to DWS, and BCS-1118340 to JF).

It has been recently implied that organic aerosols will prevail over inorganic carbon particulates in the future, changing the main mechanisms of damage caused by poor air quality to calcareous heritage in particular. We studied fresh particulate deposits on marble and limestone surfaces exposed to urban air in sheltered and unsheltered configurations. Due to different air pollution sources in different seasons, the amount and composition of surface deposits varied throughout the year. The main and most constant contributor to PM₂.₅ (particles smaller than 2.5 μm) were primary traffic emissions (30 %), followed by secondary formation of acidic inorganic aerosols, such as sulphate in summer and nitrate in winter (33 % altogether), and seasonal biomass-burning emissions (14 %). Although biomass burning is the major source of primary organic aerosols including the light-absorbing fraction that prevailed over black carbon (BC) in colder months (up to 60 % carbonaceous aerosol mass), we show that surface darkening causing the soiling effect is still governed by the minor BC fraction of atmospheric aerosols, which remained below 20 % of the carbonaceous aerosol mass throughout the year. This, however, can change in remote environments affected by biomass-burning emissions, such as winter resorts, or by rigorous BC mitigation measures in the future. In the short run, sheltered positions were less affected by different removal processes, but we show that surface deposits are not simply additive when considering longer periods of time. This must be taken into account when extrapolating surface accumulation to longer time scales.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aair 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3abiomass 3abiomass burning 3acultural heritage 3aenvironment 3ainorganic carbon 3alimestone 3anitrates 3aparticulates 3asulfates 3asummer 3atraffic 3awinter 0aCalcareous heritage 0aParticulate matter deposition 0aSurface darkening 0aAtmospheric aerosol origin 0aElemental analysis 0aReflectance1 aGregorič, Asta1 aIvančič, Matic1 aContini, Daniele1 aSkube, Urša1 aVidović, Kristijan1 aBele, Marjan1 aŠala, Martin1 aKlanjšek Gunde, Marta,1 aRigler, Martin1 aMenart, Eva1 aKroflič, Ana0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Sept. 20,  p.159012-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159012  aDNAL 7aarticle02530naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245010700172300001600279520158200295592002801877650001401905650001401919650001601933650001301949650002001962650001301982650002301995700001802018773008802036856008302124852000902207655001202216IND60096111620221118005620.0141104e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009611162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2012.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRobinson, Bruce A.12aA residence-time-based transport approach for the groundwater pathway in performance assessment models  ap. 155-163.  aThis paper presents the theoretical development and numerical implementation of a new modeling approach for representing the groundwater pathway in risk assessment or performance assessment model of a contaminant transport system. The model developed in the present study, called the Residence Time Distribution (RTD) Mixing Model (RTDMM), allows for an arbitrary distribution of fluid travel times to be represented, to capture the effects on the breakthrough curve of flow processes such as channelized flow and fast pathways and complex three-dimensional dispersion. Mathematical methods for constructing the model for a given RTD are derived directly from the theory of residence time distributions in flowing systems. A simple mixing model is presented, along with the basic equations required to enable an arbitrary RTD to be reproduced using the model. The practical advantages of the RTDMM include easy incorporation into a multi-realization probabilistic simulation; computational burden no more onerous than a one-dimensional model with the same number of grid cells; and straightforward implementation into available flow and transport modeling codes, enabling one to then utilize advanced transport features of that code. For example, in this study we incorporated diffusion into the stagnant fluid in the rock matrix away from the flowing fractures, using a generalized dual porosity model formulation. A suite of example calculations presented herein showed the utility of the RTDMM for the case of a radioactive decay chain, dual porosity transport and sorption.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputers 3aequations 3agroundwater 3aporosity 3arisk assessment 3asorption 3astatistical models1 aChu, Shaoping0 tComputers & geosciences.g2013 Mar., v. 52 p.155-163dElsevier Ltdx0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2012.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03560naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245007000169300001400239520239200253592002802645650001202673650001702685650001902702650001102721650001402732650001102746650001502757650001102772650002402783650001402807650002302821650001502844650001902859650001102878700002702889700002302916700002102939773008602960856008303046852000903129655001203138IND60096111820221118005654.0141104e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009611182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2011.10.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrad Murray, A.10aProgress in coupling models of human and coastal landscape change  ap. 30-38.  aHumans are increasingly altering the Earth's surface, and affecting processes that shape and reshape landscapes. In many cases, humans are reacting to landscape-change processes that represent natural hazards. Thus, the landscape is reacting to humans who are reacting to the landscape. When the timescales for landscape change are comparable to those of human dynamics, human and ‘natural’ components of developed environments are dynamically coupled—necessitating coupling models of human and physical/biological processes to study either environmental change or human responses. Here we focus on a case study coupling models of coastal economics and physical coastline change. In this modeling, coastline change results from patterns of wave-driven sediment transport and sea-level rise, and shoreline stabilization decisions are based on the benefits of wide beaches (capitalized into property values) balanced against the costs of stabilization. This interdisciplinary modeling highlights points that may apply to other coupled human/natural systems. First, climate change, by accelerating the rates of landscape change, tends to strengthen the coupling with human dynamics. In our case study, both increasing sea-level-rise rates and changing storm patterns tend to increase shoreline change rates, which can induce more vigorous shoreline stabilization efforts. However, property values can fall dramatically as erosion rates and stabilization costs rise, which can also lead to the abandonment of expensive stabilization methods as shoreline change rates increase. Second, socio-economic change can also strengthen the human/landscape coupling. Changing costs of shoreline stabilization can alter stabilization decisions, which in turn alters patterns of coastline change. The coupled modeling illuminates the long-range effects of localized shoreline stabilization efforts; communities arrayed along a coastline are unwittingly affecting each other's erosion rates, and therefore each other's economies. Our coupled modeling experiments show that spatial distributions of property values and erosion rates can jointly affect economic outcomes, resource allocation between communities, and patterns of shoreline change. These findings raise questions about coastal management strategies, and efficient and equitable allocation of scarce resources among coastal communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeaches 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3acoasts 3acomputers 3ahumans 3alandscapes 3amodels 3aresource allocation 3asea level 3asediment transport 3ashorelines 3asocioeconomics 3astorms1 aGopalakrishnan, Sathya1 aMcNamara, Dylan E.1 aSmith, Martin D.0 tComputers & geosciences.g2013 Apr., v. 53 p.30-38dElsevier Ltdx0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2011.10.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03614naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245012800170300001800298520169000316536025602006592002802262650002202290650002002312650001902332650001102351650001102362650001502373650002602388650001002414650001502424650001402439650000902453650001702462650002402479650001402503650001102517650002702528650001502555651001802570651001702588651002602605653001202631653002002643653002002663653002502683653001602708700002002724700001902744700002102763700002402784700002802808773009902836856008002935852000903015655001203024IND60622307520221118044708.0181124e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062230752DNAL7 a10.1177/09596836124555382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThienpont, Joshua R10aArctic coastal freshwater ecosystem responses to a major saltwater intrusion: A landscape-scale palaeolimnological analysis  ap. 1451-1460.  aBecause of decreasing sea-ice extent and increasingly frequent Arctic storms, low-lying coastal ecosystems are at heightened risk from marine storm surges. A major Arctic storm event originating in the Beaufort Sea in September 1999 resulted in the flooding of a large area of the outer alluvial plain of the Mackenzie Delta (Northwest Territories, Canada), and has been previously shown to have caused unprecedented impacts on the terrestrial ecosystems on a regional scale. We use diatoms preserved in lake sediment cores to gain a landscape perspective on the impact of the storm on freshwater systems, and to determine if other such events have occurred in the recent past. Our results indicate that five lakes located at the coastal edge of the low-lying Mackenzie Delta show strong, synchronous, and previously unobserved increases in the relative abundance of brackish-water diatom taxa coincident with the timing of the 1999 storm surge. These changes were not observed at a control site located farther inland. The degree to which the storm surge impacted the chemical and biological limnology of the lakes varied, and was not explained by measured physical variables, suggesting the degree of impact is likely related to a combination of factors including distance from the coast, the size:volume ratio of the lake and its catchment, and water residence time. We show that the 1999 storm surge resulted in unmatched broadscale impacts on the freshwater ecosystems of the outer Mackenzie Delta, and that while minimal recovery may be occurring in some of the systems, the lakes studied remain chemically and biologically impacted more than a decade after the inundation event.  aFunding This research was funded by Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada grants to MFJP, JPS and JRT as well as support from the Polar Continental Shelf Program (PCSP) and the Cumulative Impact Monitoring Program (CIMP).  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aalluvial plains 3abrackish water 3acoasts 3afloods 3afreshwater 3afreshwater ecosystems 3alakes 3alandscapes 3alimnology 3arisk 3ariver deltas 3asaltwater intrusion 3asediments 3astorms 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3awatersheds 3aArctic region 3aBeaufort Sea 3aNorthwest Territories 0adiatoms 0aMackenzie Delta 0apalaeolimnology 0asaltwater inundation 0astorm surge1 aJohnson, Daniel1 aNesbitt, Holly1 aKokelj, Steven V1 aPisaric, Michael FJ1 aSmol, J.

We present here a detailed study of the sedimentary archive within a landslide-controlled impounded floodplain (Smrdutá site, Czech Flysch Carpathians) using geochronological (¹⁴C and ¹³⁷Cs), sedimentological and pollen evidence. A sedimentary sequence deposited above the landslide dam points to three highly discontinuous and instantaneous depositional events dated to 4.6 and 2.0 cal. ka BP, whereas the last cycle started approximately in the 17–18th centuries and has continued to recent times. Such sedimentary pulses characterized by the duration of several decades to a few centuries originated as a consequence of the blockage and/or reduction of the valley floor width by successive long-runout landslides from a slope formed by tectonically and lithologically anisotropic flysch bedrock. Stages of mass movement activity revealed by the Smrdutá landslide correlate well with major humid late-Holocene oscillations suggesting its high sensitivity to century-scale climatic deteriorations. The character of lithological units forming individual sedimentary pulses, erosional hiatuses and sedimentary traces caused by the July 1997 extreme flood indicate a decisive role of large flood events during accretion and erosion of the floodplain-impounded section.  aFunding This research was supported by the project of the Czech Science Foundation no.

This is accomplished here using a tracer routing model that accounts for production and decay of radioisotopes in the floodplain. The numerical model focuses on the average (i.e. across many hydrographs or years) budget of sediment and tracers at reach scale. To account for storage and remobilization of bulk sediment and/or tracer material, the model represents the floodplain as a system that can gain or lose mass depending on overbank deposition and net bank erosion rates. Isotopic tracers within the floodplain reservoir can be produced as a function of cosmic ray bombardment or atmospheric fallout, and can decay according to a first-order rate equation. Governing equations are derived using a simplified geometry that treats rivers at reach scale: channel sinuosity and migration rates are user-specified parameters, exchange of sediment and tracers between the river and floodplain is modeled at each cross section, and governing equations are derived in a 1D, width-averaged formulation. When the system reaches mobile equilibrium, the sediment deposited on the floodplain through overbank deposition is balanced by the sediment eroded from the floodplain through channel migration and by sediment contributed from external sources. The model is applied to a generic river system and is shown to converge over time to an equilibrium condition that is consistent with an independent analytical solution.  aPublisher supplied data 3abank erosion 3acliffs 3acomputers 3aequations 3afloodplains 3ahydrograph 3aisotope labeling 3amathematical models 3aradionuclides 3arivers 3asediment deposition 3asediments 3atemporal variation 3aterraces1 aWesley Lauer, J.1 aBelmont, Patrick1 aParker, Gary0 tComputers & geosciences.g2013 Apr., v. 53 p.114-122dElsevier Ltdx0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2011.10.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03174naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002100154245013600175300001600311520217400327592002802501650002402529650001002553650002302563650002202586650001202608650002302620700002602643700001702669773011002686856005502796852000902851655001202860IND50072946820221118145424.0140212e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007294682DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1472-4642.2012.00889.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuurkuukka, Heli10aSpecies turnover in lake littorals: spatial and temporal variation of benthic macroinvertebrate diversity and community composition  ap. 931-941.  aAims Despite wide consensus that ecological patterns and processes should be studied at multiple spatial scales, the temporal component of diversity variation has remained poorly examined. Specifically, rare species may exhibit patterns of diversity variation profoundly different from those of dominant taxa. Location Southern Finland. Methods We used multiplicative partitioning of true diversities (species richness, Shannon diversity) to identify the most important scale(s) of variation of benthic macroinvertebrate communities across several hierarchical scales, from individual samples to multiple littorals, lakes and years. We also assessed the among‐scale variability of benthic macroinvertebrate community composition by using measures of between‐ and within‐group distances at hierarchical scales. Results On average, a single benthic sample contained 23% of the total regional macroinvertebrate species pool. For both species richness and Shannon diversity, beta‐diversity was clearly the major component of regional diversity, with within‐littoral beta‐diversity (β₁) being the largest component of gamma‐diversity. The interannual component of total diversity was small, being almost negligible for Shannon index. Among‐sample (within‐littoral) diversity was related to variation of substratum heterogeneity at the same scale. By contrast, only a small proportion of rare taxa was found in an average benthic sample. Thus, dominant species among lakes and years were about the same, whereas rare species were mostly detected in a few benthic samples in one lake (or year). For rare species, the temporal component of diversity was more important than spatial turnover at most scales. Main conclusions While individual species occurrences and abundances, particularly those of rare taxa, may vary strongly through space and time, patterns of dominance in lake littoral benthic communities are highly predictable. Consequently, many rare species will be missed in temporally restricted samples of lake littorals. In comprehensive biodiversity surveys, interannual sampling of littoral macroinvertebrate communities is therefore needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acommunity structure 3alakes 3amacroinvertebrates 3aspecies diversity 3asurveys 3atemporal variation1 aMeissner, Kristian K.1 aMuotka, Timo0 tDiversity & distributions.g2012 Sept., v. 18, no. 9 p.931-941dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1366-95167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-4642.2012.00889.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02288naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245009600169300001600265520110900281592002801390650001201418650002101430650001401451650001501465650001601480650001201496650001601508650001301524650003101537650001101568650002201579650001801601650002201619651001801641700001901659700002001678773008801698856008301786852000901869655001201878IND60096112720221118005613.0141104e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009611272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2011.09.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampbell, Karen10aTaking it to the streets: The case for modeling in the geosciences undergraduate curriculum  ap. 123-128.  aThe United States faces a crisis in education: a dire shortage of students sufficiently prepared in the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) disciplines to competitively enter the workforce (National Education Technology Plan, 2010).

Many efforts, including the recently released Earth Science and Climate Literacy Principles, seek to promote better Earth science education, as well as to strengthen the Earth science literacy of the entire US population. Yet even those undergraduate students who choose to major in geology or related geoscience disciplines rarely acquire sufficient quantitative skills to be truly competitive graduate students or professionals.

In this paper, concentration of acidity and major ions in the rainfall in UK is analyzed by assuming a bivariate pseudo-Gamma distribution. The model parameters are estimated by using the maximum likelihood method and the goodness of fit is checked. Furthermore, the non-informative Jeffreys prior for the distribution parameters is derived and a hybrid Gibbs sampling strategy is proposed to sample the corresponding posterior for conducting an objective Bayesian analysis. Finally, related quantities such as the deposition flux density are derived where the general pattern of the observed data appears to follow the fitted densities closely.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aacidity 3acomputers 3aenvironmental factors 3aions 3amodels 3arain 3aUnited Kingdom1 aKazianka, Hannes1 aPilz, Jürgen0 tComputers & geosciences.g2013 Apr., v. 54 p.269-278dElsevier Ltdx0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2012.12.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02577naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245012600164300001800290520106900308536010901377592002801486596001301514650002501527650001801552650002701570650002501597650001601622650001901638650001401657650002601671650001001697650001601707650000901723650001401732653002501746653003301771653001901804653001601823700001301839700001601852700001401868773013001882856008602012852000902098655001202107IND60621803520221123034958.0211124e20180101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062180352DNAL7 a10.1080/09540105.2018.15084242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Rui10aMagnesium isoglycyrrhizinate positively affects concanavalin A-induced liver damage by regulating macrophage polarization  ap. 1041-1052.  aThe deficient functional polarization of macrophages is implicated in the disease progression of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). This study aims to evaluate the impact of Magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate (MgIG) on concanavalin A (Con A)-induced hepatitis in a mouse model, thereby clarifying the molecular mechanisms with which it is associated. MgIG was periodically administered to C57BL/6 mice before one intravenous injection of Con A (20 mg/kg). The MgIG treatment demonstrated a protective function in mice for Con A-induced AIH, the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, and the serum levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. In addition, the MgIG pre-treatment had a significant effect on the number of F4/80⁺ cells entering the liver. MgIG efficiently facilitated macrophage polarization toward an M2 phenotype. The results indicate that a relationship may exist between the protective impacts of MgIG with respect to Con A-induced liver injury and the capability of the hepatoprotective agent to regulate macrophage polarization.  aThis study was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 81600509).  aPublisher supplied data  a81600509 3aalanine transaminase 3aanimal models 3aaspartate transaminase 3aautoimmune hepatitis 3ablood serum 3aconcanavalin A 3acytokines 3aintravenous injection 3aliver 3amacrophages 3amice 3aphenotype 0aAutoimmune hepatitis 0amagnesium isoglycyrrhizinate 0aconcanavalin A 0amacrophages1 aLiu, Yun1 aPiao, Meiyu1 aSong, Yan0 tFood and agricultural immunology.g2018 Jan. 1, v. 29, no. 1 p.1041-1052dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl45182x1465-34437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09540105.2018.15084243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02452naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245007400165300001600239520111200255536011101367592002801478650003501506650003701541650000901578650001801587650001101605650001201616650001401628651001001642651001001652651002101662653001001683653001001693653001801703653001301721653001001734653001001744653002101754653001401775653002001789773009601809856008001905852000901985655001201994IND60622309620221118044520.0181124e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062230962DNAL7 a10.1177/09596836124607882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Gyoung-Ah10aArchaeological perspectives on the origins of azuki (Vigna angularis)  ap. 453-459.  aRecent archaeological findings provide a hint on domestication of azuki (Vigna angularis var. angularis) in East Asia. This preliminary study investigates archaeological collections from various regions in Korea, China, and Japan, representing the long-term evolution (5300–1450 BP) of azuki. Changes in seed shapes show that cultural manipulation of azuki began as early as 5300–4800 cal. BP. Azuki beans from Neolithic contexts in Korea and Japan show a possible sign of morphological response to human management, at least 2000 years prior to the appearance of fully domesticated forms. Yabutsuru-azuki (V. angularis var. nipponensis), a conspecific progenitor of domesticated azuki, has been a supplementary diet and seed reserve for lean years in East Asia, and this tradition may have a long root to the mid Holocene. Archaeological evidence indicates the possibility of multiple origins of azuki, supporting recent phylogenetic data. A unique contribution of this research is its interdisciplinary attempt to examine both the biological and cultural processes of this staple legume domestication.  aFunding This research was partially supported by the Academy of Korean Studies Fellowship Program in 2012.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVigna angularis var. angularis 3aVigna angularis var. nipponensis 3adiet 3adomestication 3ahumans 3alegumes 3aphylogeny 3aChina 3aJapan 3aKorean Peninsula 0aazuki 0aChina 0adomestication 0aHolocene 0aJapan 0aKorea 0amultiple origins 0aNeolithic 0aVigna angularis0 tHolocene.g, v. 23, no. 3 p.453-459dSAGE PublicationswJournal:J000001502x1477-09117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836124607883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02798naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245012100168300001800289520099700307536012501304592002801429596002001457650002601477650001801503650001301521650002401534650001101558650001701569650001801586650001701604650001801621650001101639650002301650650000901673650001201682650000901694650001801703650003201721650001601753650002501769653001701794653001801811653002301829653000901852653001201861700001401873700001501887700001301902700001301915700001301928700001701941700001301958773013001971856008602101852000902187655001202196IND60621804020221117165949.0211124e20180101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062180402DNAL7 a10.1080/09540105.2018.15167392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Weiwei10aFerulic acid suppresses obesity and obesity-related metabolic syndromes in high fat diet-induced obese C57BL/6J mice  ap. 1116-1125.  aThis study aimed to determine whether mice fed ferulic acid (FA) would alleviate high-fat diet-induced obesity and obesity-related metabolic syndromes. Mice were divided into the following four groups and fed for 6 wk (n = 8): control diet (NC), high-fat diet (HF; 60% energy from fat), NC and HF supplemented with 0.5% (w/w) FA respectively. Mice fed HF-FA diet consumed same amount of energy, but had lower daily weight gain, white adipose tissue weight, body fat accumulation, blood glucose and had suppressed hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-α) release (P < 0.05), compared with those in HF-fed mice. In conclusion, our findings indicate that dietary FA supplementation suppress body weight gain, body and hepatic fat accumulation, blood glucose elevation and inflammation in high fat diet-induced obese mice, suggesting that FA could be effective in lowering the risk of high fat-diet induced obesity and obesity-related metabolic syndromes.  aThis work was supported by the Non-profit Industry (grain) Scientific Research Special Fund Agreement (No. 201513003-8).  aPublisher supplied data  aNo. 201513003-8 3aanimal disease models 3ablood glucose 3abody fat 3abody weight changes 3aenergy 3aferulic acid 3ahigh fat diet 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3alipids 3ametabolic syndrome 3amice 3aobesity 3arisk 3atissue weight 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3aweight gain 3awhite adipose tissue 0aFerulic acid 0ahigh-fat diet 0ametabolic syndrome 0amice 0aobesity1 aPan, Yiou1 aZhou, Hang1 aWang, Li1 aChen, Xi1 aSong, Ge1 aLiu, Jianxue1 aLi, Aike0 tFood and agricultural immunology.g2018 Jan. 1, v. 29, no. 1 p.1116-1125dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl45182x1465-34437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09540105.2018.15167393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03123naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024003400132024001100166040001800177100002100195245016500216300001800381500001500399506017300414520114000587650001501727650001101742650002201753650002801775650001301803650001601816650001701832650001501849650002301864650001301887650002501900650002501925650001601950650001801966653001701984700002202001700002102023700002102044700002202065700002302087773014802110856011202258856008002370956011302450961000902563852000902572655001202581IND60006223020221214230855.0160404e20151021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000622302DNAL7 a3173732aris7 a10113/622302hdl7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.5b042232doi8 ans9638  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaroli, Amith S.10aMetabolic Profiling and Enzyme Analyses Indicate a Potential Role of Antioxidant Systems in Complementing Glyphosate Resistance in an Amaranthus palmeri Biotype  ap. 9199-9209.  a2019-12-06  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aMetabolomics and biochemical assays were employed to identify physiological perturbations induced by a commercial formulation of glyphosate in susceptible (S) and resistant (R) biotypes of Amaranthus palmeri. At 8 h after treatment (HAT), compared to the respective water-treated control, cellular metabolism of both biotypes were similarly perturbed by glyphosate, resulting in abundance of most metabolites including shikimic acid, amino acids, organic acids and sugars. However, by 80 HAT the metabolite pool of glyphosate-treated R-biotype was similar to that of the control S- and R-biotypes, indicating a potential physiological recovery. Furthermore, the glyphosate-treated R-biotype had lower reactive oxygen species (ROS) damage, higher ROS scavenging activity, and higher levels of potential antioxidant compounds derived from the phenylpropanoid pathway. Thus, metabolomics, in conjunction with biochemical assays, indicate that glyphosate-induced metabolic perturbations are not limited to the shikimate pathway, and the oxidant quenching efficiency could potentially complement the glyphosate resistance in this R-biotype. 3ametabolism 3asugars 3ashikimate pathway 3areactive oxygen species 3abiotypes 3aamino acids 3ametabolomics 3aglyphosate 3aAmaranthus palmeri 3aoxidants 3aherbicide resistance 3aantioxidant activity 3ametabolites 3ashikimic acid 0aantioxidants1 aNandula, Vijay K.1 aDayan, Franck E.1 aDuke, Stephen O.1 aGérard, Patrick,1 aTharayil, Nishanth0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2015 Oct. 21, v. 63, no. 41 p.9199-9209dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x0021-85617nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/622303Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.5b042233Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Metabolic%20-%20Maroli%20-%20M612.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03763naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001300146245013100159300001600290520202400306536042102330592002802751650001502779650002302794650001002817650002002827650001102847650001402858650001602872651001402888653001402902653001102916653002202927653001302949653001602962653003202978653002503010653003703035653001603072700001303088700001903101773009603120856008003216852000903296655001203305IND60622310320221118004154.0181124e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062231032DNAL7 a10.1177/09596836124630942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGale, SJ14aThe eastern Australian magnetic inclination record: Dating the recent past and re-assessing the historical geomagnetic archive  ap. 398-415.  aA new compilation of historical observations and archaeomagnetic measurements of magnetic inclination for the last 1000 years from eastern Australia (the eastern Australian Inclination Record [eAIR2012]) has revealed the existence of a well-defined inclination anomaly in the region. Evidence of this magnetic feature has been preserved in sedimentary records from across eastern Australia, though this has not previously been recognised. Analyses of additional sedimentary sequences have confirmed the incidence and timing of this feature, revealing its presence between the 13th and 18th centuries ad. The inclination of the field during this episode appears to have been steeper than at any time since the start of the Holocene. Lake sediment evidence suggests that the anomaly is a composite feature, displaying a distinct peak at cal. ad 1270–1386 (±2 σ uncertainty), reappearing after cal. ad 1431–1651 (±2 σ uncertainty) and disappearing before cal. ad 1822±46 (±2 σ uncertainty). The disappearance of the anomaly is tightly bracketed in the historical record between ad 1770 and 1777. The rapid shift in inclination during the 18th century ad offers considerable potential as a means of dating a critical period of Australian environmental history, an episode that currently lies beyond the reach of established dating methods. This information also provides a valuable constraint on models of regional geomagnetic field change over centennial and millennial timescales. Our examination of the historical record has revealed that the inclination measurements made by the 18ᵗʰ-century French explorer La Pérouse are consistently erroneous. Since La Pérouse’s data make up 13% of the total body of pre-19th century inclination records, the inclusion of these measurements in global compendia of magnetic observations may seriously skew attempts to model the geomagnetic field. We advocate that La Pérouse’s inclination measurements should therefore be employed only with considerable caution.  aFunding This research was undertaken whilst DEC was in receipt of a Henry Bertie and Florence Mabel Gritton Research Scholarship at The University of Sydney, Australia.

The computational cost of a conventional Kriging analysis of N data points is dominated by the m iterations of the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) optimization, resulting in a computational cost of O(mN³). We propose two fast methods for estimating the hyperparameters in the frequency domain: frequency-domain maximum likelihood estimate (FMLE) and frequency-domain sample variogram (FSV), both of which reduce the cost of the optimization to O(N²+mN) in the case of a regular Fourier transform (FT), and to O(NlnN+mN) in the case of a fast Fourier transform (FFT). In addition to this speed up, problems concerning positive definiteness of the gain matrix – which limit the robustness of the conventional approach – vanish in the proposed methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputers 3acost effectiveness 3akriging1 aDwight, R.P.1 aBijl, H.0 tComputers & geosciences.g2013 Apr., v. 54 p.99-106dElsevier Ltdx0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2013.01.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03009naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100003400146245010800180300001600288520133500304536016701639592002801806650001901834650001901853650001101872650002601883650001101909650002201920650001301942650001301955650001901968650001501987650001902002650001402021650001402035650001502049651001702064653001302081653002102094653002002115653001302135653001502148653001802163700003402181700002702215700003102242700002102273773009602294856008002390852000902470655001202479IND60622310520221118004129.0181124e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062231052DNAL7 a10.1177/09596836124630972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuimarães, José Tasso Felix10aMorphological and vegetation changes on tidal flats of the Amazon Coast during the last 5000 cal. yr BP  ap. 528-543.  aThe analysis of morphology, sedimentary facies, palynology, carbon and nitrogen isotopes, C/N ratio and radiocarbon data from tidal flats sediments influenced by the Amazon River indicates that vegetation development during the last 5000 cal. yr BP was controlled by morphological changes associated with marine and fluvial process. The proximal portion of the tidal flat corresponds to abandoned channels surrounded by terrestrial vegetation since 5280–5160 cal. yr BP. During the last 2840–2750 cal. yr BP, autochthonous organic material became prevalent as well as the increase in contribution of terrestrial organic matter mainly from ‘várzea’ vegetation. Herbaceous plants already colonized the tidal flat before 3170–2970 cal. yr BP, and after 2630–2310 cal. yr BP and 1350–1290 cal. yr BP they were replaced by mangrove vegetation following the development of secondary channels connected to the sea with brackish water influence. Furthermore, the erosion of the herbaceous field to form chenier ridges/tidal mixed flat after 3170–2970 cal. yr BP and before 220–140 cal. yr BP in the distal portion of the tidal flat suggests an overall interpretation of a retrogradation cycle. This process was driven by a relative sea-level rise influenced by the increase of Amazon discharge during the late Holocene.  aFunding This work was funded by CNPq (Project 562398/2008-2).

The proposed algorithm uses the maximal-overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT) to perform manual detection for such weak events. A seismic noise analysis was done to choose the best criteria for showing clear P-wave arrival. This algorithm is also used as an accurate automatic P-wave picking algorithm. The noise level at a seismic station does not affect the proposed picking algorithm because it adapts itself to the noise level in front of each earthquake. Local events recorded by the Egyptian National Seismic Network (ENSN) were used to test this proposed algorithm. The overall average error was found to be 0.02s.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acomputers 3aearthquakes 3awavelet1 aRabie, Mostafa1 aKohda, T.0 tComputers & geosciences.g2013 Apr., v. 54 p.148-159dElsevier Ltdx0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2012.12.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04073naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245010900166300001600275520209000291536038602381592002802767650002202795650001902817650002202836650001302858650001402871650002202885650001202907650001002919650002302929650001902952650001002971650001202981650001502993650001003008650001103018650000903029650001603038651001303054653001203067653001203079653002803091653001003119653002403129653001103153700002203164700001803186700002303204700002203227700002503249700002403274773009603298856008003394852000903474655001203483IND60622310820221118004046.0181124e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062231082DNAL7 a10.1177/09596836124631002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmieder, Jens10aHolocene variability in hydrology, vegetation, fire, and eolian activity in the Nebraska Sand Hills, USA  ap. 515-527.  aThis study combined multiple aquatic and terrestrial proxies, including diatoms, pollen, grain size, and bulk-sediment chemistry to reconstruct the history of three lake sites located in the central Sand Hills of Nebraska, USA. Long-term changes in effective moisture are evident at all sites, with significant changes occurring at ~6000, ~4000, and ~ 2000 cal. yr BP. Both aquatic and terrestrial indicators suggest that effective moisture was low between 10,000 and ~6000 cal. yr BP, and that this time interval was the driest period of the Holocene. The dominance of benthic and tychoplanktic diatom taxa indicates relatively shallow lake-level, high sand influx indicates moderately high eolian activity, and the pollen assemblage suggests xeric grasslands with abundant mud flats. About 6000 cal. yr BP, all three sites experienced an increase in effective moisture. Lake-level rise is indicated by increases in planktic and tychoplanktic diatoms relative to benthic taxa, while greater abundance of grass pollen and charcoal, and decreased eolian flux indicate stabilized dunes with dense vegetation sufficient to fuel local fires. A significant hydrologic shift recorded at all sites occurred at ~4000 cal. yr BP. This event was characterized by substantial lake-level rise, yet decreased grass cover and fire frequency, and increased eolian activity. Water-table rise may have been caused by a combination of factors including: (1) formation of dune-dams that blocked old drainage channels, (2) reduced grass cover and hence reduced evapotranspiration, and (3) changes in the frequency and duration of drought. The most likely cause(s) of the differential response of the terrestrial and aquatic systems at this time is not clear, none-the-less the late Holocene was not nearly as dry as the interval prior to 6000 cal. yr BP. The last ~2000 yr were characterized by several short-term fluctuations in lake level, including an interval of drought between 950 and 750 cal. yr BP, coincident with increased eolian activity during the latter part of the Medieval Climatic Anomaly.  aFunding This work was made possible by the Sand Hills Biocomplexity Project at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (NSF-02-167) and a NSF grant (EAR06-09983) to SCF and ECG.

In addition, these dogs also become hypothyroid during training and exercise. Canine hypothyroidism has been shown to correlate with decreased von Willebrand factor antigen and potentially increased bleeding tendency. Whether increased gastro intestinal bleeding risk is exacerbated due to changes in the hemostatic balance is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the hemostatic balance in sled dogs before and after exercise and in addition evaluate any correlation to thyroid status. Twenty sled dogs have been assessed in untrained and trained condition and immediately after exercise. The first sample was collected in the autumn following a resting period, and subsequently the dogs were exposed to increased intensity of training. After four months the peak of physical condition was reached and a 68 km long sled pulling exercise was performed. Samples were collected before and immediately after the exercise. Evaluated parameters were: plasma thromboelastographic (TEG) R, SP, α and MA, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), prothrombin time (PT), fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor (vWf), D-dimer, platelet number, thyroid hormones, hematocrit and C-reactive protein (CRP). RESULTS: Exercise induced an overall hypercoagulable state characterized by significant decreases of TEG R and SP and an increase of α, increased concentrations of plasma vWf and decreased aPTT. In addition, a proinflammatory status was seen by a significant increase of serum CRP concentrations. Thyroid status was confirmed to be hypothyroid as training and exercise induced significant decrease of thyroxin (T4), free thyroxin (fT4) and thyroxin stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations. Fibrinogen decreased significantly and PT increased. The training-induced changes showed correlation between T4, fT4 and aPTT and correlation between TSH and fibrinogen. Exercise-induced changes showed correlation between T4 and PT. CONCLUSIONS: Exercise was associated with a hypercoagulable state and an increase of vWf concentration in this group of sled dogs. Decreased thyroid hormone concentrations after training and exercise were confirmed, but were associated with increased and not decreased vWf in this group of sled dogs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aC-reactive protein 3aantigens 3aautumn 3ablood platelet count 3adeath 3aexercise 3afibrinogen 3ahematocrit 3ahemorrhage 3ahypothyroidism 3aprothrombin 3arisk 3asled dogs 3athromboplastin 3athyroid hormones 3athyrotropin 3athyroxine1 aLegind, Pernille1 aKjelgaard-Hansen, Mads1 aBochsen, Louise1 aKristensen, Annemarie T0 tActa veterinaria scandinavica.g2014 Dec., v. 56, no. 1 p.930-930dSpringer-Verlagx1751-01477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1751-0147-56-113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02143naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245011000168300001400278520110500292592002801397650001501425650001401440650001601454650001601470650001101486650001701497650001401514650001301528700002501541700002701566700002201593773008601615856008301701852000901784655001201793IND60096117920221118005618.0141104e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009611792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2012.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeidari, Leila10aHistory matching of petroleum reservoir models by the Ensemble Kalman Filter and parameterization methods  ap. 84-95.  aThe Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) has been successfully applied in petroleum engineering during the past few years to constrain reservoir models to production or seismic data. This sequential assimilation method provides a set of updated static variables (porosity, permeability) and dynamic variables (pressure, saturation) at each assimilation time. However, several limitations can be pointed out. In particular, the method does not prevent petrophysical realizations from departing from prior information. In addition, petrophysical properties can reach extreme (non-physical) values. In this work, we propose to combine the EnKF with two parameterization methods designed to preserve second-order statistical properties: pilot points and gradual deformation. The aim is to prevent the departure of the constrained petrophysical property distributions from prior information. Over/under estimations should also be avoided. The two algorithms are applied to a synthetic case. Several parameter configurations are investigated in order to identify solutions improving the performance of the method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acomputers 3adeformation 3aengineering 3amodels 3apermeability 3apetroleum 3aporosity1 aGervais, Véronique,1 aLe Ravalec, Mickaële,1 aWackernagel, Hans0 tComputers & geosciences.g2013 June, v. 55 p.84-95dElsevier Ltdx0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2012.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03246naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245007900170300001600249520213600265592002802401650001702429650002202446650001402468650002002482650001802502650001802520650002002538650001602558650001702574650001102591651001002602700001902612700002702631700002202658773008802680856008302768852000902851655001202860IND60096118220221118005525.0141104e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009611822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2013.02.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHora, John Milan13aAn Excel-based tool for evaluating and visualizing geothermobarometry data  ap. 178-185.  aApplication of geothermobarometry based on equilibrium exchange of chemical components between two mineral phases in natural samples frequently leads to the dilemma of either: (1) relying on relatively few measurements where there is a high likelihood of equilibrium, or (2) using many analysis pairs, where a significant proportion may not be useful and must be filtered out. The second approach leads to the challenges of (1) evaluation of equilibrium for large numbers of analysis pairs, (2) finding patterns in the dataset where multiple populations exist, and (3) visualizing relationships between calculated temperatures and compositional and textural parameters. Given the limitations of currently-used thermobarometry spreadsheets, we redesign them in a way that eliminates tedium by automating data importing, quality control and calculations, while making all results visible in a single view. Rather than using a traditional spreadsheet layout, we array the calculations in a grid. Each color-coded grid node contains the calculated temperature result corresponding to the intersection of two analyses given in the corresponding column and row. We provide Microsoft Excel templates for some commonly-used thermometers, that can be modified for use with any geothermometer or geobarometer involving two phases. Conditional formatting and ability to sort according to any chosen parameter simplifies pattern recognition, while tests for equilibrium can be incorporated into grid calculations. A case study of rhyodacite domes at Parinacota volcano, Chile, indicates a single population of Fe–Ti oxide temperatures, despite Mg–Mn compositional variability. Crystal zoning and differing thermal histories are, however, evident as a bimodal population of plagioclase-amphibole temperatures. Our approach aids in identification of suspect analyses and xenocrysts and visualization of links between temperature and phase composition. This facilitates interpretation of whether heat transfer was accompanied by bulk mass transfer, and to what degree diffusion has homogenized calculated temperature results in hybrid magmas.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acomputer software 3acomputers 3adata collection 3aheat transfer 3amass transfer 3aquality control 3atemperature 3athermometers 3azoning 3aChile1 aKronz, Andreas1 aMöller-McNett, Stefan1 aWörner, Gerhard,0 tComputers & geosciences.g2013 July, v. 56 p.178-185dElsevier Ltdx0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2013.02.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02803naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245011600171300001400287520135800301592002801659650001201687650001201699650001101711650002901722650001401751650004301765650001101808650001101819650002701830650001501857650002101872650002601893650002401919650002701943650001401970650001701984653001102001653002502012653000902037653001402046653001202060653001302072700001502085773011502100856008502215852000902300655001202309IND60621806320221120031816.0181121e20190102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062180632DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2017.13807092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTandon, Shishir10aKinetics of diuron under aerobic condition and residue analysis in sugarcane under subtropical field conditions  ap. 86-93.  aThe phenylureas group includes persistent herbicides which are major pollutants to soil and water. Dissipation kinetics of diuron in different soils under sugarcane field conditions was investigated. Diuron was extracted with acetone and florisil solid phase extraction clean-up and characterized by high-performance liquid chromatography-UV. Diuron persisted for more than 100 days and dissipation followed monophasic first-order kinetics. Persistence was more in sandy loam compared to silty clay loam soil. Half-life of diuron in silty clay loam soil was 22.57 and 32.37 days and in sandy loam was 28.35 and 43.93 days at 2 and 4 kg ha−1applications, respectively. Average recovery in soil, bagasse, leaf-straw and juice ranged from 75.95% to 84.20%, 80.15% to 89.35%, 77.46% to 86.19% and 81.88% to 92.68%, respectively. The quantitation limits for soil, bagasse, leaf-straw and juice were 0.01, 0.03, 0.04 μg g⁻¹ and 0.008 μg mL⁻¹, respectively. Application of diuron inhibited growth of soil microbes initially but they recovered later. At harvest, diuron residues were below maximum residue limits in all samples. The study revealed that under subtropical conditions, diuron is safe for use in weed management and would not pose any residual/environmental problem and that sugarcane crop could be used safe for human/animal consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetone 3abagasse 3adiuron 3aenvironmental technology 3ahalf life 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahumans 3ajuices 3amaximum residue limits 3apollutants 3asandy loam soils 3asilty clay loam soils 3asoil microorganisms 3asolid phase extraction 3asugarcane 3aweed control 0aDiuron 0adissipation kinetics 0asoil 0asugarcane 0aaerobic 0amicrobes1 aPant, Ravi0 tEnvironmental technology.g2019 Jan. 2, v. 40, no. 1 p.86-93dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12281x1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2017.13807093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02661naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001400146245009800160300001600258520106700274536040401341592002801745650000801773650001101781650000901792650001601801650001101817650001101828650001601839650001101855651001001866653001501876653002201891653001801913653001601931653003801947700002001985700001802005700001902023773009602042856008002138852000902218655001202227IND60622312320221118004014.0181124e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062231232DNAL7 a10.1177/09596836124674792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHui, Deng14aThe temporal and spatial distribution of dust storms on the North China Plain, ad 1464–1913  ap. 625-634.  aUsing 1844 different chorographies (regional descriptions) from the Ming Dynasty to the Republic Period and other related historical documents, 1180 records of dust storms on the North China Plain from 1464 to 1913 have been identified. These data are used to describe and analyse the temporal and spatial distribution of dust storms on the North China Plain during these years. Dust storms on the North China Plain occurred mainly in spring. Of all the identified dust storms, 72.85% occurred in the spring, 16.39% in winter, 8.71% in summer, and 2.05% in the fall. These storms occurred in cycles of 16–36 years. There was a negative correlation between the frequency of dust storms and the level of precipitation, and also a negative correlation between the frequency of dust storms and the frequency of spring or winter temperature departures. Spatially dust storms clustered in three fairly discrete northern, central, and southern districts.

However, discrete fracture models made of planar fractures generally fail to reproduce the complexity of natural networks, both in terms of geometry and connectivity. In this study a pseudo-genetic method is developed to generate stochastic fracture models that are consistent with patterns observed on outcrops and fracture growth principles. The main idea is to simulate evolving fracture networks through geometric proxies by iteratively growing 3D fractures. The algorithm defines heuristic rules in order to mimic the mechanics of fracture initiation, propagation, interaction and termination. The growth process enhances the production of linking structure and impacts the connectivity of fracture networks. A sensitivity study is performed on synthetic examples. The method produces unbiased fracture dip and strike statistics and qualitatively reproduces the fracture density map. The fracture length distribution law is underestimated because of the early stop in fracture growth after intersection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acomputers 3amechanics 3amodels 3astochastic processes1 aHenrion, Vincent1 aCaumon, Guillaume1 aRenard, Philippe1 aSausse, Judith0 tComputers & geosciences.g2013 July, v. 56 p.12-22dElsevier Ltdx0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2013.02.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03447naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245012000164300001600284520136500300536033501665592002802000596008002028596010302108596011102211650002102322650001502343650002902358650001102387650001302398650001102411650003102422650001402453650002102467650001702488650000802505650001602513653001602529653002102545653002302566653001502589653001902604700001502623700001702638700001502655700001502670700002002685773011802705856008502823852000902908655001202917IND60621807220221120065444.0181121e20190115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062180722DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2017.13840692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTao, Jun10aCharacterization and phenol adsorption performance of activated carbon prepared from tea residue by NaOH activation  ap. 171-181.  aThe preparation of activated carbon (AC) using tea residue was addressed in this work. The preparation process incorporated two-step pyrolysis and activation using NaOH. The influence of activation temperature between 500°C and 700°C on the properties of the AC sample was investigated. The physicochemical properties of the AC sample were characterized. The results show that the optimum temperature for the activation process is 700°C, which generates the AC sample with higher specific surface area and total pore volume, respectively, of 819 m² g⁻¹ and 0.443 cm³ g⁻¹. The oxygen-containing functional groups evolve on the AC sample during the activation process. The phenol adsorption test was performed to evaluate the adsorption performance of the AC sample. The adsorption data confirm that phenol adsorption on the AC sample obtained at 700°C follows the pseudo-second-order kinetics model. Hereby, the electron donor–acceptor interaction mechanism can describe the adsorption process. The AC sample obtained at 700°C performs superior phenol adsorption performance. The maximum phenol adsorption capacity is 320 mg g⁻¹, which is higher than that of several AC samples reported previously. Thus, the tea residue acts as a good precursor for the AC with promising adsorption capacity by the NaOH chemical activation method.  aThis work was supported by the Science Foundation of the Education Department of Yunnan Province [grant number 2015Y063], the Analysis and Measurement Foundation of Kunming University of Science and Technology [grant number 2016T20110217] and the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant numbers 41762013 and 41302132].  aPublisher supplied data  a2015Y063cScience Foundation of the Education Department of Yunnan Province  a2016T20110217cAnalysis and Measurement Foundation of Kunming University of Science and Technology  a41762013 and 41302132cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3aenvironmental technology 3amodels 3amoieties 3aphenol 3aphysicochemical properties 3apyrolysis 3asodium hydroxide 3asurface area 3atea 3atemperature 0aTea residue 0aactivated carbon 0atwo-step pyrolysis 0aadsorption 0aphenol removal1 aHuo, Peili1 aFu, Zongheng1 aZhang, Jin1 aYang, Zhen1 aZhang, Dengfeng0 tEnvironmental technology.g2019 Jan. 15, v. 40, no. 2 p.171-181dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12281x1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2017.13840693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02132naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245011100168300001600279520089300295536013101188592002801319650001501347650001101362650001301373650001101386650001401397651001101411653001301422653001101435653001801446653001401464653001501478653001301493700002301506700002001529773009601549856008001645852000901725655001201734IND60622313120221118004121.0181124e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062231312DNAL7 a10.1177/09596836124701752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartinez, Sergio,10aMollusks as indicators of historical changes in an estuarine-lagoonal system (Cananéia-Iguape, SE Brazil)  ap. 888-897.  aMollusks recovered from three cores taken from the Cananéia-Iguape estuarine-lagoonal system (São Paulo State, Brazil) were studied. The sampled sediments cover a period beginning approximately two centuries ago and end at the present, including a period when the system suffered significant changes of anthropogenic origin – that is, the construction of an artificial channel connecting the lagoon with a nearby river and with the resulting input of fresh water and contaminants generated from mining activity upstream. The mollusk composition reflects these changes. The more abrupt changes in this composition coincide with the opening of the Valo Grande artificial channel in 1852. Another significant but minor change event was verified for around 1977± one year in areas that were not previously affected, perhaps showing the effect of the closing and reopening of the channel.  aFunding This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.  aPublisher supplied data 3afreshwater 3amining 3amolluscs 3arivers 3asediments 3aBrazil 0aBivalvia 0aBrazil 0acontamination 0aestuaries 0aGastropoda 0amollusks1 aMahiques, Michel M1 aBurone, Leticia0 tHolocene.g, v. 23, no. 6 p.888-897dSAGE PublicationswJournal:J000001502x1477-09117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836124701753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01932naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245010200172300001600274520102300290592002801313650001601341650002401357650001401381700002501395700002101420700002101441773008801462856008301550852000901633655001201642IND60096120020221120160844.0141104e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009612002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2013.03.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJovanović, Zoran,10aSimultaneous segmentation and beam-hardening correction in computed microtomography of rock cores  ap. 142-150.  aWe propose a post-reconstruction correction procedure for the beam-hardening artifact that neither requires knowledge of the X-ray spectrum nor of the attenuation coefficients in multi-mineral geologic samples. The beam-hardening artifact in polychromatic X-ray computer tomography (CT) hampers segmentation of the phase assemblage in geologic samples. We show that in cylindrically shaped samples like rock cores, the X-ray attenuation value for a single phase depends mainly on the distance from the center of the cylinder. This relationship could be easily extracted from the CT data for every phase and used to infer the presence of these phases at all positions in the sample. Our new approach enables simple segmentation of the phases for further analysis. Additionally, we propose a simple mathematical exercise for parallel beam geometry to show how recent experimentally observed deviations from Beer's law could be incorporated to model the beam-hardening artifact and simultaneously be used for its removal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3acomputed tomography 3acomputers1 aK̲h̲ān, Faiṣal,1 aEnzmann, Frieder1 aKersten, Michael0 tComputers & geosciences.g2013 July, v. 56 p.142-150dElsevier Ltdx0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2013.03.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02285naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245009300168300001600261520075000277536014501027592002801172596013401200650001401334650002601348650001301374650002901387650001601416650001801432650001801450650001201468650002101480650001001501653002101511653002601532653001001558653001101568653001101579700001801590700001901608773011801627856008501745852000901830655001201839IND60621807620221120065305.0181121e20190115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062180762DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2017.13845102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Chu-Hsi10aAnaerobic degradation of sulfamethoxazole by mixed cultures from swine and sewage sludge  ap. 210-218.  aThe objective of this study was to evaluate the anaerobic degradation of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and the associated bacterial community changes in swine and sewage sludges. The degradation rate of SMX was higher in swine sludge than in sewage sludge. The addition of lactate, citrate, and sucrose had significant effects on SMX degradation, and sucrose addition yielded a higher SMX degradation rate than the other additives. At concentrations of 0.1–10 g/l sucrose, the SMX degradation rates increased in the sludge. The bacterial genera from swine sludge with sucrose exhibited the highest SMX degrading efficiency. Seventeen bacterial genera were found to be the major bacterial community members involved in SMX degradation in the sludge.  aThis research was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Republic of China, Taiwan [grant number MOST 104-2313-B-031-001-MY3].  aPublisher supplied data  aMOST 104-2313-B-031-001-MY3cMinistry of Science and Technology, Republic of China, Taiwandhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002855 3aadditives 3abacterial communities 3acitrates 3aenvironmental technology 3alactic acid 3amixed culture 3asewage sludge 3asucrose 3asulfamethoxazole 3aswine 0aSulfamethoxazole 0aanaerobic degradation 0aswine 0asewage 0asludge1 aYang, Chu-Wen1 aChang, Bea-Ven0 tEnvironmental technology.g2019 Jan. 15, v. 40, no. 2 p.210-218dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12281x1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2017.13845103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02496naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245014100172300001600313520147900329592002801808650002201836650001401858650002001872650001501892650000901907650001101916650001601927651002201943700002501965773008801990856008302078852000902161655001202170IND60096120620221120160721.0141104e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009612062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2013.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRicard, Ludovic P.10aGeoTemp™ 1.0: A MATLAB-based program for the processing, interpretation and modelling of geological formation temperature measurements  ap. 197-207.  aThe evaluation of potential and resources during geothermal exploration requires accurate and consistent temperature characterization and modelling of the sub-surface. Existing interpretation and modelling approaches of 1D temperature measurements are mainly focusing on vertical heat conduction with only few approaches that deals with advective heat transport. Thermal regimes are strongly correlated to rock and fluid properties. Currently, no consensus exists for the identification of the thermal regime and the analysis of such dataset. We developed a new framework allowing the identification of thermal regimes by rock formations, the analysis and modelling of wireline logging and discrete temperature measurements by taking into account the geological, geophysical and petrophysics data. This framework has been implemented in the GeoTemp software package that allows the complete thermal characterization and modelling at the formation scale and that provides a set of standard tools for the processing wireline and discrete temperature data. GeoTempᵀᴹ operates via a user friendly graphical interface written in Matlab that allows semi-automatic calculation, display and export of the results. Output results can be exported as Microsoft Excel spreadsheets or vector graphics of publication quality. GeoTemp™ is illustrated here with an example geothermal application from Western Australia and can be used for academic, teaching and professional purposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3acomputers 3adata collection 3ageophysics 3aheat 3amodels 3atemperature 3aWestern Australia1 aChanu, Jean-Baptiste0 tComputers & geosciences.g2013 Aug., v. 57 p.197-207dElsevier Ltdx0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2013.04.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03115naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245010200166300001600268520144800284536019901732592002801931650001401959650001201973650001201985650001601997650001402013650000802027650001002035650001102045650001802056650001602074650001402090650002002104650001402124650001602138651001302154651002502167653001002192653001402202653003002216653001302246653003002259653001002289700002202299700003102321700002102352700001502373773009602388856008002484852000902564655001202573IND60622313720221118004025.0181124e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062231372DNAL7 a10.1177/09596836124719832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilkins, Daniel10aHolocene lake-level fluctuations in Lakes Keilambete and Gnotuk, southwestern Victoria, Australia  ap. 784-795.  aReconstructed Holocene lake-level curves from two saline, hydrologically closed maar crater lakes in southwestern Victoria, Australia, show near synchronous lake-level changes throughout the Holocene. We show that lake levels, reconstructed from sediment particle size and ostracod valve chemistry (δ¹⁸O and Sr/Ca) have undergone rapid (<100 yr), large (>10 m) fluctuations throughout the Holocene. Finer sampling resolution shows a more sensitive response to Holocene climate than was previously presented for Lake Keilambete. Both maar crater lakes show a short-lived maximum in Holocene lake levels around 7.2 ka. The period of lake filling leading to peak lake levels matches the phase of most effective precipitation (7.4–7.0 ka) reconstructed from a high-resolution speleothem record from northern Tasmania. Water levels declined in both lakes during the mid Holocene, with a more substantive decline after ~5 ka which coincides with the end of the Southern Hemisphere hypsithermal. Water levels continued to oscillate with a periodicity of around 300–700 years, before reaching a late-Holocene nadir around 1.8 ka (Keilambete) and 1.3 ka (Gnotuk). The trend and periodicity of oscillations in the maar water levels show commonalities to δD in the Dome C ice core, and suggest that temperature may be a significant component in influencing the Precipitation/Evaporation (P/E) ratio in southeastern Australia during the Holocene.  aFunding Daniel Wilkins and Chris Gouramanis were supported by funds from an ARC Discovery grant (DP034493), and Daniel Wilkins was further supported by a CSIRO Land and Water top-up scholarship.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOstracoda 3acalcium 3aclimate 3aevaporation 3ahydrology 3aice 3alakes 3aoxygen 3aparticle size 3aperiodicity 3asediments 3astable isotopes 3astrontium 3atemperature 3aTasmania 3aVictoria (Australia) 0aδ18O 0amaar lake 0aModern Analogue Technique 0aostracod 0aprecipitation/evaporation 0aSr/Ca1 aGouramanis, Chris1 aDe Deckker, P.q(Patrick),1 aFifield, L Keith1 aOlley, Jon0 tHolocene.g, v. 23, no. 6 p.784-795dSAGE PublicationswJournal:J000001502x1477-09117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836124719833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02915naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002700146245012800173300001600301520142400317536022601741592002801967650000901995650001502004650001302019650001002032650001502042650001502057650001402072650000902086651001102095653001802106653001202124653003802136653002502174653001402199653001502213700001602228700001602244700002402260773009602284856008002380852000902460655001202469IND60622313820221118004138.0181124e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062231382DNAL7 a10.1177/09596836124719842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLilleøren, Karianne S10aHolocene development and geomorphic processes at Omnsbreen, southern Norway: Evidence for glacier–permafrost interactions  ap. 796-809.  aOmnsbreen is a small (<0.5 km²) and degrading glacier situated at the regional lower limit of present-day permafrost distribution and glaciation. At present, the existence of Omnsbreen is mainly dependent on wind-borne snow redistributed by the prevailing westerly winter-wind, and lies in an area of marginal permafrost occurrence. During the ‘Little Ice Age’ (LIA) both the glacier and the distribution of permafrost in the area reached their maximum late-Holocene areal extents. The first occurrence of Omnsbreen is recorded in sediment cores retrieved from a proglacial lake and dated at ad 1425, and marks the onset of the local LIA. Reconstruction of the maximum LIA extent by means of geomorphic indicators revealed a size of 7.1 km², a volume of more than 0.25 km³ and a maximum glacier thickness of 110 m. Since the LIA Omnsbreen has been reduced by more than 90% in area. Omnsbreen retreated rapidly from its LIA maximum, which we suggest was determined by the shape of the glacier, filling up the valley, and hence being unable to accumulate wind-borne snow. Prominent glacier marginal landforms are absent along the maximum LIA extent of Omnsbreen. We propose that the lack of glacier marginal landforms in this case is indicative of a cold glacier margin, and that the landscape evolution in maritime and marginal permafrost regions is characterised as being closely connected with glacial activity.  aFunding The fieldwork was carried out as a part of the MSc thesis of KS Lilleøren funded by the Department of Geosciences, University of Oslo, and was made possible through the use of the Alpine Research Centre at Finse.  aPublisher supplied data 3acold 3aglaciation 3aglaciers 3alakes 3alandscapes 3apermafrost 3asediments 3asnow 3aNorway 0ageomorphology 0aglacier 0aglacier–permafrost interactions 0a‘Little Ice Age’ 0aOmnsbreen 0apermafrost1 aHumlum, Ole1 aNesje, Atle1 aEtzelmüller, Bernd0 tHolocene.g, v. 23, no. 6 p.796-809dSAGE PublicationswJournal:J000001502x1477-09117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836124719843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03153naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245011600168300001400284520205200298592002802350650001602378650001102394650002202405650001402427650002002441650001902461650003002480650001102510650001702521650001302538651001202551700001802563700002002581773008602601856008302687852000902770655001202779IND60096121020221120160808.0141104e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009612102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2013.03.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVoorn, Maarten10aMultiscale Hessian fracture filtering for the enhancement and segmentation of narrow fractures in 3D image data  ap. 44-53.  aNarrow fractures—or more generally narrow planar features—can be difficult to extract from 3D image datasets, and available methods are often unsuitable or inapplicable. A proper extraction is however in many cases required for visualisation or future processing steps. We use the example of 3D X-ray micro-Computed Tomography (µCT) data of narrow fractures through core samples from a dolomitic hydrocarbon reservoir (Hauptdolomit below the Vienna Basin, Austria). The extraction and eventual binary segmentation of the fractures in these datasets is required for porosity determination and permeability modelling. In this paper, we present the multiscale Hessian fracture filtering technique for extracting narrow fractures from a 3D image dataset. The second-order information in the Hessian matrix is used to distinguish planar features from the dataset. Different results are obtained for different scales of analysis in the calculation of the Hessian matrix. By combining these various scales of analysis, the final output is multiscale; i.e. narrow fractures of different apertures are detected. The presented technique is implemented and made available as macro code for the multiplatform public domain image processing software ImageJ. Serial processing of blocks of data ensures that full 3D processing of relatively large datasets (example dataset: 1670×1670×1546 voxels) is possible on a desktop computer. Here, several hours of processing time are required, but interaction is only required in the beginning. Various post-processing steps (calibration, connectivity filtering, and binarisation) can be applied, depending on the goals of research. The multiscale Hessian fracture filtering technique provides very good results for extracting the narrow fractures in our example dataset, despite several drawbacks inherent to the use of the Hessian matrix. Although we apply the technique on a specific example, the general implementation makes the filter suitable for different types of 3D datasets and different research goals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3abasins 3acomputer software 3acomputers 3adata collection 3aimage analysis 3amicro-computed tomography 3amodels 3apermeability 3aporosity 3aAustria1 aExner, Ulrike1 aRath, Alexander0 tComputers & geosciences.g2013 Aug., v. 57 p.44-53dElsevier Ltdx0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2013.03.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01634naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245003000168300001400198520082400212592002801036650002201064650001401086650001101100650001901111651001601130700002001146773008601166856008301252852000901335655001201344IND60096121120221120160806.0141104e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009612112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2013.03.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBunting, Peter14aThe KEA image file format  ap. 54-58.  aThere are a large number of image formats already in use within the remote sensing community but currently there is no format that provides the features of: compression, support for large file sizes, ground control points, raster attribute tables and inbuilt image pyramids.

Identifying and characterizing the clods is thus a preliminary step in surface roughness measurement and modelling. The aim of this paper is to propose an algorithm, based on the simulated annealing optimization, to refine the clod delineation estimated on a seedbed surface Digital Elevation Model (DEM). In our case, the DEM image was recorded on a real seedbed immediately after tillage, and we assume an initialization for the clods boundaries. The proposed method is based on a cost function to minimize, introducing four main characteristics of the clod boundary, respectively related to the mean of the DEM gradient norms on the boundary (f₁), the standard deviation of the DEM gradient norms on the boundary (f₂), the standard deviation of the DEM values on the boundary (f₃) and L₂-norm of the DEM values on the boundary (f₄). In our case, the relative weights of previous criteria have been learned using a target reference that is a manual delineation of individual clods completed by a soil scientist on a sub-part of the DEM image. The cost function minimization is then achieved using the simulated annealing technics. The result performance is measured in term of the overlap rate. Further study shows the key feature of the f₄ criterion. Then, the influence of the weighting coefficients was studied using (f₁,f₂,f₄) based new cost function. We finally conclude on the possibility of improving the clod boundaries of a large surface using the cost function parameters learned on a training sub-surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aclods 3acomputers 3adigital elevation models 3aroughness 3aseedbeds 3asurface roughness 3atillage1 aVannier, E.1 aDusséaux, R.1 aLe Hégarat-Mascle, S.1 aTaconet, O.0 tComputers & geosciences.g2013 Aug., v. 57 p.68-76dElsevier Ltdx0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2013.04.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03720naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245010500180300001600285520164600301536025001947592002802197596011902225650002702344650001302371650002302384650002502407650001502432650001602447650002002463650001602483650002402499650001002523650001402533650001002547650001602557650001002573650002402583650001302607650002002620650001502640650001202655650001902667650001902686650002002705653002702725653001102752653001002763653001502773653002202788653001802810700001502828700001402843700002802857773012702885856008503012852000903097655001203106IND60621808620221120091241.0181121e20181002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062180862DNAL7 a10.1080/09670262.2018.14781312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBinte Safie, Siti Radiah10aGrowth bottlenecks of microalga Dunaliella tertiolecta in response to an up-shift in light intensity  ap. 509-519.  aMicroalgae are a potential source of valuable products including drugs, chemicals, food supplements, biofuels, animal feed and fertilizers. In outdoor culture, biomass productivity is dependent on how well the microalgae respond to fluctuations in light during the day. Dunaliella tertiolecta is a halotolerant, photoautotrophic microalga. Our objective is to identify rate-limiting steps in growth as D. tertiolecta acclimates to changing light intensity. We studied the physiological, metabolic and transcriptomic changes of D. tertiolecta in a low dilution rate chemostat culture to determine rate-limiting processes in cell growth in response to changes in light intensity. Upon a 10-fold increase in light intensity from 40 to 400 µmol photons m–² s–¹ (HL), the photosynthetic efficiency and maximum photosynthetic rate (PR) per cell, or per chlorophyll, did not change significantly during lag (2 h) and exponential growth (8 h) phases, which suggests that the photosynthetic system was not the growth rate limiting step in response to higher light intensity. The expression of most genes in 2 h and 8 h samples was similar. Some genes involved in synthesis of cellular structures, protein processing and the cell cycle might be bottlenecks in the HL response, because they were expressed only at 8 h. It might not be practical to increase biomass by genetic modification of D. tertiolecta because of the numerous pathways and genes that are potential bottlenecks. Instead, future research can be directed to improving carbon sequestration by channelling it to storage compounds or excretion as extracellular glycerol.  aThis study was supported by the National Research Foundation (NRF), Prime Minister’s Office, Singapore under the Campus for Research Excellence and Technological Enterprise (CREATE) Programme (Grant No. R-182-000-205-592 and R571-000-014-133).  aPublisher supplied data  aR-182-000-205-592aR571-000-014-133cNational Research Foundation Singaporedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001381 3aDunaliella tertiolecta 3abiofuels 3abiomass production 3acarbon sequestration 3acell cycle 3acell growth 3acell structures 3achlorophyll 3adietary supplements 3adrugs 3aexcretion 3afeeds 3afertilizers 3agenes 3agenetic engineering 3aglycerol 3alight intensity 3amicroalgae 3aphotons 3aphotosynthesis 3asalt tolerance 3atranscriptomics 0aDunaliella tertiolecta 0agrowth 0alight 0ametabolome 0aphoto-acclimation 0atranscriptome1 aNg, Yi Kai1 aYao, Lina1 aLee, Y.

In total, 12 landslide conditioning factors that affect the landslide incidence were used as input to the models in the Ziarat Watershed, Golestan Province, Iran. Landslide inventory was randomly divided into a ratio of 70:30 for training and validating the results of the models. The optimum combination of conditioning factors was identified using the principal components analysis (PCA) method. The results demonstrated that HAND is the defining factor among hydrological and topographical factors in the study area. Additionally, the WofE model had the highest prediction capability (AUPRC = 74.31%).

High-resolution lichenometric dating indicated that 60–65% of the deposits date from the 20th century whereas 5.7% are 300–600 years old. In contrast, low-resolution Schmidt-hammer exposure-age dating (SHD) indicated that 85% of deposits have an age <500 years whereas 13.5% are older deposits with age estimates of 1000–6000 years. Simple indicators of soil development and vegetation succession demonstrated extensive recent disturbance of most surfaces by floods. Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and radiocarbon dating of fine-grained flood layers and buried palaeosols confirmed the existence of flood deposits spanning the whole of the Holocene. Apparent discrepancies between dating techniques are explained by a complex pattern of overwashing and reworking, which is related to height of flood deposits above the active river channel, and downstream patterns of disturbance associated especially with tributary confluences. While, in general, these deposits are of low persistence and most are highly sensitive to disturbance, some elements of the valley-floor landscape have persisted throughout the Holocene. Comparison of this fragmentary geomorphological record of floods with the historical flood record shows that the surviving deposits are sensitive to recent multidecadal-scale glacier and climatic variations.  aFunding The authors wish to thank the BGRG for a small research grant (to LJM) in support of this work.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecological succession 3afloods 3aglaciers 3alandscapes 3aluminescence 3apaleosolic soil types 3aradiocarbon dating 3arivers 3aterraces 3awatersheds 3aNorway 0aflood deposits 0aflood history 0aHolocene 0alandscape sensitivity 0alichenometry 0apersistence 0aresolution 0aSchmidt-hammer exposure-age dating (SHD)1 aMatthews, John A0 tHolocene.g, v. 23, no. 7 p.974-989dSAGE PublicationswJournal:J000001502x1477-09117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836124751443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02505naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003500151245015900186300001800345520097700363592002801340650002201368650001701390650002201407650001101429650002801440650001701468650001201485650001101497650002401508650000701532650000901539650001201548650001201560650001401572651000901586653001501595653002201610653003101632653001701663653001201680653001401692700002301706700002901729700002901758773011801787856008501905852000901990655001201999IND60621809520221120100408.0181121e20181102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062180952DNAL7 a10.1080/10106049.2017.13433932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhazanfari Shabankareh, Maryam10aZonation of coastal sediments based on the effective properties on the accumulation of heavy metals using the IDW and kriging method (case study: SW Iran)  ap. 1257-1267.  aThis study investigated the effects of some physicochemical properties of sediments on the accumulation of heavy metals in portions of the Musa creek coasts (Jafari and Petrochemical creeks). Effective properties such as pH, EC, texture, GS, γd, n, CaCO₃ and OM were determined. All variables showed a normal distribution and general trends of NW–SE and NE–SW. After detrending the variables, ordinary kriging was used for modelling. The C₀/σ₂, C₀/σ₂, and search radius criteria were used to select the best semivariogram. All the variables displayed a spatial structure with different intensities. The IDW method was also used for estimation. The cross-validation showed that the results of both IDW and kriging methods are almost similar. Distribution of the sand particle, GS, n and OM decreases with distance from the waterways, whilst clay–silt deposits. In the center of the studied area, CaCO₃ has the highest value and EC has the lowest value.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium carbonate 3acase studies 3acoastal sediments 3acoasts 3aelectrical conductivity 3aheavy metals 3akriging 3amodels 3anormal distribution 3apH 3asand 3astreams 3atexture 3awaterways 3aIran 0aMusa creek 0acoastal sediments 0aphysicochemical properties 0aheavy metals 0akriging 0avariogram1 aAmanipoor, Hakimeh1 aBattaleb-Looie, Sedigheh1 aDravishi Khatooni, Javad0 tGeocarto international.g2018 Nov. 2, v. 33, no. 11 p.1257-1267dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12366x1752-07627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2017.13433933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02591naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245012800176300001800304520111000322592002801432596009201460596008201552596008901634650003301723650001501756650000901771650001901780650002001799650001301819653001401832653001001846653000801856653001901864653001301883700001801896700002301914700002001937773011801957856008502075852000902160655001202169IND60621809620221120100433.0181121e20181102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062180962DNAL7 a10.1080/10106049.2017.13433942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDzinotizei, Zorodzai10aMapping waterholes and testing for aridity using a remote sensing water index in a southern African semi-arid wildlife area  ap. 1268-1280.  aWaterholes are a key resource that influences wildlife distribution in semi-arid ecosystems. Mapping waterholes can guide intervening decisions for supplementing water resources and managing wildlife distribution patterns. Although remote sensing provides a key to mapping distribution of waterholes, efficiency of existing remotely sensed methods for detecting waterholes have to be evaluated and even new ones developed. In this study, we evaluated performance of the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) and Superfine Water Index (SWI) at selected optimum thresholds. Kappa results indicated that MNDWI detects waterholes better than SWI. We further validated MNDWI detected waterholes by testing response of waterhole area to temporal rainfall variability and waterhole persistence to spatial rainfall variability. Extent of MNDWI-detected waterholes varied in relation to temporal rainfall variability (p < 0.05). Waterhole persistence was not associated with spatial rainfall variability which could be explained by differences in waterhole types or low spatial rainfall variability.  aPublisher supplied data  a91568829cDeutscher Akademischer Austauschdienstdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001655  aProject ANR- 11-CEPL-003aSAVARID.cFrench Agence Nationale pour la Recherche  aDZINOTIZEIMURWIRA2015cUniversity of Zimbabwedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004857 3adry environmental conditions 3aecosystems 3arain 3aremote sensing 3awater resources 3awildlife 0aWaterhole 0aMNDWI 0aSWI 0aremote sensing 0arainfall1 aMurwira, Amon1 aZengeya, Fadzai M.1 aGuerrini, Laure0 tGeocarto international.g2018 Nov. 2, v. 33, no. 11 p.1268-1280dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12366x1752-07627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2017.13433943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03657naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245017100164500001900335520247200354592002802826650001802854650001602872650001502888650001502903650001202918650001102930650001002941650002402951650001202975650001102987650001402998700002303012700002203035773013603057856008103193852000903274655001203283IND60698215720221119040657.0200610s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069821572DNAL7 a10.1017/S00296651200056252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHill, Alyson12aA technology-based nutritional education intervention to increase fruit and vegetables consumption in university students: findings from a randomised controlled study  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe transition to University is recognised as a vulnerable period for many young adults with the establishment of unhealthy eating behaviours. Evidence indicates that diets are low in fruit and vegetables, high in confectionary and fast food therefore, having the potential to develop obesity and long-term health implications. This RCT aimed to investigate the impact of providing 5 portions of fruit and vegetables (F&V) daily on consumption and plasma measurements. In addition to investigate whether intake was enhanced by nutritional education delivered using Facebook (FB) Sixty full-time university students (36 females, 24 males) were randomly assigned to one of 3 groups: F&V received five portions (80g) of fruit and vegetables daily for 4 weeks; F&V + FB received as for F&V group and in addition nutrition messages using FB; Control group maintained their usual diet. Compliance with F&V consumption was determined by analysis of vitamin C and carotenoid levels and in addition recorded intake and returned all uneaten F&V. Level of engagement on FB page was categorized according to interaction: highly active, somewhat active (interacts > once per month) or minimally active (interacts Participants were aged 24.4 (SD 3.7) years and mean BMI of 25.4 (SD 4.7) kg/m². Study groups did not differ by age, however they did differ by gender (24 male and 36 female, P = 0.003), BMI (P = < 0.039) and TEI (P = < 0.041). The number of portions of FV consumed increased in both intervention groups (P = < 0.001) and showed that 65% of participants increased intake of FV in both intervention groups (P = < 0.001) from baseline to end of study of 4.6 (0.6) F&V group, 4.7 (0.4) F&V + FB group. Mean change in serum β carotene was significantly higher for both intervention groups than the control group at the end of the four-week intervention period. However, the provision of F&V with or without FB did not have any enhanced effect on FV consumption and was not sustained at 3 weeks after the end of the intervention. Of those 20 participants in the F&V + FB group, 70% engaged with FB regularly with 35% classified as highly active, 15% moderately active and 50% minimally active. This study showed an increased consumption from 1.6 to 4.6 portions fruit and vegetables daily over the 4week study period and showed an increase in vitamin C and retinol levels. However, providing additional nutrition education via FB was insufficient to increase consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aascorbic acid 3ablood serum 3acompliance 3afast foods 3afemales 3afruits 3amales 3anutrition education 3aobesity 3asweets 3avitamin A1 aḤafīz̲, Amīn,1 aGallagher, Alison0 tProceedings of the Nutrition Society.g2020, v. 79, no.

In this study, a microcosm experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of straw-derived biochar on the structural differentiation of SOM and rhizosphere bacterial communities. ¹³C NMR spectra showed that the relative abundance of carboxyl, alkyl, N-alkyl, O-alkyl and methoxyl groups decreased by 22%, 31%, 27%, 27% and 27%, respectively, and the relatively stable structure of aryl and O-aryl groups increased by 213% and 41%, respectively. In addition, network-based analysis showed that biochar amendment not only improved the network connectivity of the rhizosphere bacteria, but also enhanced the linkage between bacteria and the molecular structure of SOM. The topological properties of the network, including the number of edges, network density, and average clustering coefficient, were increased by 79%, 15% and 22%, respectively. Moreover, modularization analysis and structural equation model indicated that rhizosphere bacterial network was the important bio-factor affecting the content of labile carbon.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaromatic compounds 3abacterial communities 3abiochar 3alabile carbon 3amoieties 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3arhizosphere 3arhizosphere bacteria 3asoil 3astable isotopes 3astructural equation modeling 3atopology 0aSoil organic matter 0aRhizosphere bacteria 0aRyegrass 0aBiochar 0aNetwork analysis1 aZhang, Zhenyi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0173-58561 aXiao, Xian1 aZhang, Na1 aWang, Xiaoyue1 aYang, Zeping1 aXu, Kaiqin1 aLiang, Yuting1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5443-44860 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Nov. 20, v. 692 p.333-343dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.07.2623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03552naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245014500166500001900311520221200330592002802542650001602570650002002586650001302606650001902619650001302638650001202651650001602663650001902679650002002698650000902718650001902727650000902746650001402755651001202769700002202781700001802803700002202821700001902843700001802862773013602880856008103016852000903097655001203106IND60698216820221119040608.0200610s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069821682DNAL7 a10.1017/S002966512000573X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO'Neill, Meabh13aAn investigation into the current practice of preparing, handling and reconstituting powdered infant milk in the domestic setting in Ireland  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIt is recommended that infants are exclusively breastfed for the first six months.

However, the FAO/WHO have identified infants 0–12 months as a vulnerable group, with infants less than two months old and all immunocompromised infants regardless of age, being particularly at risk of infection⁽¹⁾. Guidance set out by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland on the safe preparation of PIF states that it is essential to boil one litre of fresh tap water and let it cool to 70°C, to kill any bacteria in the powder and retain sufficient amounts of nutrients. By preparing, handling and storing PIF in line with the guidance, parents can reduce potential risks of contamination⁽¹–²⁾. The aim of this study was to determine the current practice of reconstituting PIF in the domestic setting in Ireland. A sample of parents with a child aged 0–12 months (n = 228) completed a 30-item questionnaire online. Most respondents were first time parents (55%), female (89%), aged 25–44 years (99%) and educated to tertiary level (79%). The results revealed that 64% (n = 146) of respondents reported to fill the kettle with one litre of fresh tap water, but less than half (45%) follow the guidance, to cool the boiled water to the required 70ᵒC⁽¹–²⁾. The majority 91% (n = 208), stated that they discard any unused feed within two hours. Furthermore, 29% (n = 67) of respondents reported to use an automatic bottle preparation machine, 75% (n = 171) said they are aware of safety aspects/risks associated with preparing PIF and most (97%, n = 221) felt confident in their ability to safely prepare their infant's PIF feed. It is evident that there is a need to highlight to all parents the importance of why and how PIF should be prepared and reconstituted at 70ᵒC in accordance with the guidance⁽¹–²⁾, to minimise potential risks of contamination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCronobacter 3aadverse effects 3abacteria 3abreast feeding 3achildren 3afemales 3afood safety 3ainfant feeding 3ainfant formulas 3amilk 3aquestionnaires 3arisk 3atap water 3aIreland1 aO'Neill, Jennifer1 aShannon, Emma1 aO'Donovan, Sinead1 aDennehy, Niamh1 aRegan, Aileen0 tProceedings of the Nutrition Society.g2020, v. 79, no.

We report the amination of aryl chlorides and bromides with primary aliphatic amines catalyzed by a well-defined, single-component nickel precursor (BINAP)Ni(η²-NC-Ph) (BINAP = 2,2′-bis(biphenylphosphino)-1,1′-binaphthalene) that minimizes the formation of Ni(I) species and (BINAP)₂Ni. The scope of the reaction encompasses electronically varied aryl chlorides and nitrogen-containing heteroaryl chlorides, including pyridine, quinoline, and isoquinoline derivatives. Mechanistic studies support the catalytic cycle involving a Ni(0)/Ni(II) couple for this nickel-catalyzed amination and are inconsistent with a Ni(I) halide intermediate. Monitoring the reaction mixture by ³¹P NMR spectroscopy identified (BINAP)Ni(η²-NC-Ph) as the resting state of the catalyst in the amination of both aryl chlorides and bromides. Kinetic studies showed that the amination of aryl chlorides and bromides is first order in both catalyst and aryl halide and zero order in base and amine. The reaction of a representative aryl chloride is inverse first order in PhCN, but the reaction of a representative aryl bromide is zero order in PhCN. This difference in the order of the reaction in PhCN indicates that the aryl chloride reacts with (BINAP)Ni(0), formed by dissociation PhCN from (BINAP)Ni(η²-NC-Ph), but the aryl bromide directly reacts with (BINAP)Ni(η²-NC-Ph). The overall kinetic behavior is consistent with turnover-limiting oxidative addition of the aryl halide to Ni(0). Several pathways for catalyst decomposition were identified, such as the formation of the catalytically inactive bis(amine)-ligated arylnickel(II) chloride, (BINAP)₂Ni(0), and the Ni(I) species [(BINAP)Ni(μ-Cl)]₂. By using a well-defined nickel complex as catalyst, the formation of (BINAP)₂Ni(0) is avoided and the formation of the Ni(I) species [(BINAP)Ni(μ-Cl)]₂ is minimized.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aamines 3abromides 3acatalysts 3achlorides 3adissociation 3amonitoring 3anickel 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphosphorus 3apyridines 3aquinoline 3astable isotopes1 aGreen, Rebecca A.1 aHartwig, John F.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2014 Jan. 29, v. 136, no. 4 p.1617-1627dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja411911s3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02904naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245006600160300002000226520150300246592002801749650001601777650001101793650002201804650001901826650002301845650001401868650002101882650001701903650001101920650001401931653002001945653002401965653002201989653001802011700001302029700002002042700001802062700005402080700002502134700005802159773014202217856007802359852000902437655001202446IND60662509220221122053814.0190904e20190807xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066250922DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b069342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Yiming10aSynergistic Cobalt Sulfide/Eggshell Membrane Carbon Electrode  ap. 32244-32250.  aThe preparation of green, facile, and cost-effective energy storage materials remains a big challenge. In this paper, a cobalt sulfide/porous carbon (Co₄S₃/PC) composite electrode is facilely prepared using the natural eggshell membrane (ESM) as a basal substrate. Under hydrothermal conditions, Co₄S₃ is grown on the ESM to form Co₄S₃/ESM and carbonized to form Co₄S₃/PC. The as-synthesized Co₄S₃/PC composite is used as an electrode material. The carbide from the ESM shows a porous structure and high specific surface area, which provides large space for Co₄S₃ attaching and ion migrating. Co₄S₃/PC shows much higher specific capacitance values than the sum of Co₄S₃ and PC electrodes, indicating a significant synergistic effect. More importantly, the Co₄S₃ is a typical faradic material, which exchanges Faraday charge with an electrolyte and subsequently transmits an electron to the whole electrode due to the high conductivity of the carbonized ESM. Such a synergistic effect offers the as-synthesized Co₄S₃/PC electrode a significant improvement in performance over both the ESM-derived carbon and the original Co₄S₃. Besides, the Co₄S₃/PC electrode shows a wide potential window, low resistance, and high specific capacitance. After 1000 cycles, the electrode retains a high cycling capacity. This study provides a novel insight for high-performance biomass-derived carbon preparation for pseudocapacitors and other electrochemical devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3acarbon 3acarbon electrodes 3acobalt sulfide 3acost effectiveness 3aegg shell 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3asynergism 0apseudocapacitor 0acomposite electrode 0aeggshell membrane 0aporous carbon1 aYin, Jie1 aZheng, Juanjuan1 aWang, Lingjie1 aWu, Jihuai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9820-13821 aDresselhaus, Mildred1 aZhang, Xingcai1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7114-10950 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Aug. 07, v. 11, no. 35 p.32244-32250dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b069343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04132naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006600139245013300205300001600338500001900354500002000373520268800393592002803081596004703109596004003156650001203196650001403208650001903222650001603241650001103257650001203268650000903280650001403289650002003303650001203323650002303335651001603358700006303374700006203437773011703499856007303616852000903689655001203698IND60721486620221120062435.0201224e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072148662DNAL7 a10.1111/fwb.136202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeijer, Christopher G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8058-140410aDisentangling the multiple effects of stream drying and riparian canopy cover on the trophic ecology of a highly threatened fish  ap. 102-113.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aUnderstanding risks to aquatic systems posed by changing drought regimes is particularly important for the conservation of already threatened taxa. However, little is known about how local environmental conditions, especially those in heavily human‐influenced situations, interact with regional shifts such as droughts to alter realised impacts on aquatic communities, including threatened top predators. Here, we investigated the combined effects of stream drying intensity and riparian canopy cover on the trophic interactions of critically endangered kōwaro, or Canterbury mudfish (Neochanna burrowsius) in an agricultural area of New Zealand. Fish populations and their potential prey, both terrestrial and aquatic, as well as environmental variables, including riparian canopy cover and drying measured with stage loggers, were sampled over eight visits to 24 sites spanning orthogonal drying and canopy gradients. Stable isotope ratios, ¹³C/¹²C and ¹⁵N/¹⁴N, were used to investigate trophic links between mudfish and their terrestrial and aquatic prey across these gradients. When non‐native willows (predominantly Salix fragilis) dominated the riparian canopy, increased tree cover led to elevated drying intensity, probably driven by their relatively high water demands compared to other trees. However, in the absence of willows, canopy cover had no effect on drying intensity. Although this was the only direct link between these two environmental factors, they had opposing effects on kōwaro populations, which will be important for management under drought. Increased drying intensity contributed to elevated abundance of microcrustacea and aquatic Diptera larvae, and an increase in the relative abundance of kōwaro juveniles. However, drying‐affected kōwaro populations also had fewer large reproductive adults and elevated δ¹⁵N values, probably driven by physiological limitations and an increase in kōwaro cannibalism, respectively. By comparison, increased canopy cover enhanced input of terrestrial invertebrates, a food resource for larger kōwaro, leading to elevated kōwaro δ¹³C values, no effects on δ¹⁵N values, and higher relative abundance of large kōwaro in shaded streams compared to unshaded streams. Thus, the riparian canopy cover was able to offset some of the effects of drying. Overall, we found no interactions between drying intensity and canopy cover affecting kōwaro. However, their opposing effect highlights the important role local conditions such as riparian canopies play on aquatic communities and their potential role as a restoration tool to mitigate the effects of large‐scale shifts such as drought.  aPublisher supplied data  cBrian Mason Scientific and Technical Trust  cNew Zealand’s Biological Heritage 3aDiptera 3aNeochanna 3aSalix fragilis 3acannibalism 3acanopy 3adrought 3afish 3alimnology 3astable isotopes 3astreams 3athreatened species 3aNew Zealand1 aWarburton, Helen J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6828-25321 aMcIntosh, Angus R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2696-88130 tFreshwater biology.g2021 Jan., v. 66, no. 1 p.102-113dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl1839x0046-50707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.136203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02443naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002500145245012400170300001800294500001500312520122500327592002801552650002201580650001801602650001401620650001401634650001501648650002201663650003001685650001301715650003001728650001601758650001201774650001501786653003001801700001901831700002201850773010401872856004801976852000902024655001202033IND4468777820221118235612.0120619e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446877782DNAL7 a10.1007/s11738-012-0926-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThiruvengadam, Muthu10aOverexpression of Oncidium MADS box (OMADS1) gene promotes early flowering in transgenic orchid (Oncidium Gower Ramsey)  ap. 1295-1302.  a2019-12-06  aOncidium is a popular ornamental orchid and is produced as a high value cash crop for cut flower sold worldwide. Genetically transformed plants of Oncidium were regenerated after cocultivating protocorm-like bodies (PLBs) with Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain LBA4404 harboring pBI121 with OMADS1. The chopped PLBs pre-cultured for 3 days in darkness produced more kanamycin-resistant PLBs. G10 medium containing 200 mg l−1 kanamycin was effective for the selection of transformed lines at a frequency of 9%. The rooted plantlets were transferred to pots, acclimated for 3 weeks in the culture room and then moved to the greenhouse. OMADS1 transgene was detected in transgenic lines by PCR, Southern blot analysis and RT-PCR were performed, and the results confirmed that OMADS1 was expressed in these 35S::OMADS1 transgenic plants. CaMV35S::OMADS1 transgenic Oncidium orchid plants flowered significantly earlier, produced more flowers and pseudobulbs than non-transgenic plants. The flower organ conversions were not observed in 35S::OMADS1 transgenic flowers of Oncidium. This is the first report on the ectopic expression of MADS box gene in O.

Common onion group), and shallot (Allium cepa L. Aggregatum group) cultivars were inoculated with rust fungus, Puccinia allii, isolated from bunching onion. Bulb onions and shallots are highly resistant to rust, suggesting they would serve as useful resources for breeding rust resistant bunching onions. To identify the A. cepa chromosome(s) related to rust resistance, a complete set of eight A. fistulosum – shallot monosomic alien addition lines (MAALs) were inoculated with P. allii. At the seedling stage, FF+1A showed a high level of resistance in controlled-environment experiments, suggesting that the genes related to rust resistance could be located on shallot chromosome 1A. While MAAL, multi-chromosome addition line, and hypoallotriploid adult plants did not exhibit strong resistance to rust. In contrast to the high resistance of shallot, the addition line FF+1A+5A showed reproducibly high levels of rust resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllium cepa 3aAllium fistulosum 3aPuccinia allii 3abreeding 3abulbs 3achromosome addition 3achromosomes 3acultivars 3adisease resistance 3agenes 3amature plants 3amonosomics 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3arust diseases 3ascreening 3aseedlings 3ashallots 0aAllium fistulosum 0aAllium cepa 0abunching onion 0ashallot 0arust resistance 0amonosomic addition lines1 aYamashita, Ken-ichiro1 aTsukazaki, Hikaru1 aOhara, Takayoshi1 aKojima, Akio1 aYaguchi, Shigenori1 aShimazaki, Satoshi1 aMidorikawa, Naoko1 aSakai, Takako1 aYamauchi, Naoki1 aShigyo, M.q(Masayoshi),0 tGenome.g2015 June 19, v. 58, no. 4 p.135-142dNRC Research Pressx1480-33217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/gen-2015-00263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03072naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245011400171520146600285592002801751650002101779650001101800650001601811650001801827650001301845650002401858650001201882650002501894650002001919650001401939650001301953650001901966650002001985650001302005650002202018650004302040650002002083650001702103653001402120653002002134653002302154653000902177653002202186700002302208700001602231700002102247700002102268700002102289700001902310773009802329856008202427852000902509655001202518IND60672953020221122143412.0211129e20191101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067295302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2019.1169062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakahashi, Nobuhiko10aDreh, a long noncoding RNA repressed by metformin, regulates glucose transport in C2C12 skeletal muscle cells  aThe anti-hyperglycemic action of metformin on skeletal muscles is presently unclear. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are implicated in multiple cellular functions. This study aims to explore the role of lncRNAs in the glucometabolic action of metformin on skeletal muscle cells.Metformin accumulation was assessed using [¹⁴C]-metformin. A lncRNA array was used to investigate metformin-regulated lncRNAs in C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. Knockdown studies were applied to evaluate the function of lncRNA Dreh. A colorimetric assay was used for the measurement of medium glucose concentration; glucose transport was assessed using [³H]-2-deoxyglucose; real-time PCR was used for RNA expression analysis, and western blotting was used to assess protein expression in myotubes. A Dreh overexpression plasmid was transfected into the cells.Metformin accumulated in C2C12 myotubes. Metformin reduced medium glucose concentration and repressed lncRNA Dreh expression in the myotubes. Knockdown of Dreh in the myotubes resulted in reduced glucose concentration in the culture medium, increased glucose transport, and increased levels of GLUT4 protein in the plasma membrane. Overexpression of Dreh attenuated the glucose-lowering effect of metformin in myotubes.The glucoregulatory actions of metformin are mediated in part by a lncRNA, Dreh, in the skeletal muscle cells. Dreh is a novel regulator for glucose transport and could be a therapeutic target for diabetes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3acarbon 3acolorimetry 3aculture media 3adiabetes 3agene overexpression 3aglucose 3aglucose transporters 3aglycemic effect 3ametformin 3amyotubes 3anon-coding RNA 3aplasma membrane 3aplasmids 3aprotein synthesis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3askeletal muscle 3atherapeutics 0aMetformin 0aSkeletal muscle 0aLong noncoding RNA 0aDreh 0aGlucose transport1 aKimura, Atsushi P.1 aOtsuka, Kai1 aOhmura, Kazumasa1 aNaito, Sumiyoshi1 aStoltzman, Mika,1 aIeko, Masahiro0 tLife sciences.g2019 Nov. 01, v. 236 p.116906-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2019.1169063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01202naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002500138245007400163300001800237520029000255592002800545650002300573650002700596650002300623650001300646650002100659700002100680773012900701856007300830852000900903655001200912IND60658492220221122035344.0190817e20091110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065849222DNAL7 a10.1039/b912231a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIshibashi, Yoshitaka10aSolid-phase synthesis of protected α-amino phosphonic acid oligomers  ap. 6985-6987.  aBy establishing both a highly efficient phosphonamidate formation and a RuCp-catalyzed cleavage of an allyl linker, the solid-phase synthesis of Fmoc-(GlyP(OBn))₆-OH/DIEA, a protected form of a new type of unnatural peptide α-amino phosphonic acid oligomer (APO), has been realized.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3achemical communication 3achemical reactions 3apeptides 3aphosphorous acid1 aKitamura, Masato0 tChemical communications.g2009 Nov. 10, , no. 45 p.6985-6987dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b912231a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03833naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245010300170520198300273592002802256650002202284650003302306650002002339650001502359650002002374650001402394650001902408650001302427650002102440650002202461650002102483650002202504650001302526650001302539650001902552650001602571650001302587650001502600650001302615651001002628653001302638653002202651653002102673653002202694653002702716653001902743700009402762700001902856700009302875700001502968700002002983700002403003773011903027856008803146852000903234655001203243IND60655274020221119012435.0191121e20191201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065527402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1337022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Chunyu10aNitrogen purification potential limited by nitrite reduction process in coastal eutrophic wetlands  aCoastal wetlands accumulate enormous quantities of nitrogen due to their position at the interface between land and sea and high trapping capacity. Fortunately, they have high nitrogen (N) purifying (removal) capacity, which means that they likely play an important role in mitigating against coastal eutrophication. However studies that empirically measure the degree to which wetlands purify nitrogen and their removal pathways (e.g. denitrification, anammox, plant uptake, microbial immobilization, etc.) are rare. In this study, the N purification potential (denitrification and anammox) and enzyme activities related to denitrification in different subtropical wetlands types were conducted in nitrogen-enriched wetlands of Daya Bay, Southern China. We found the average N purification rate was 11.4 μmol N·kg−1·h−1, with denitrification accounting for 84.2%–100% of the total N2 production in the wetlands of Daya Bay. The N purification potential in the wet season, subtidal areas and mangrove forests were generally observed to be higher than that in the dry season, high and low tidal areas, barren and estuary habitats, respectively. Correspondingly, these differences were mainly driven by the temperature, Eh and NH4-N, respectively. Additionally, the nitrate reductase (Nar) and nitrite reductase (Nir) activities tended to be similar among different seasons and tidal areas, however, Nir activity in mangrove forest was 1.5-fold and 2-fold of the estuarine and barren areas, respectively. Meanwhile, Nir showed a positive correlation with denitrification rate. These results indicate that NO2-N reduction, the key control mechanism for N purification, should be the rate-limiting step of the denitrification process in Daya Bay wetlands. Notably, mangroves could improve N removal rates by 48.0% compared to other wetlands. Therefore, protecting and restoring mangrove ecosystems could be an effective way to reduce the risk of coastal eutrophication.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium nitrogen 3aanaerobic ammonium oxidation 3adenitrification 3adry season 3aenzyme activity 3aestuaries 3aeutrophication 3ahabitats 3amangrove forests 3anitrate reductase 3anitrite nitrogen 3anitrite reductase 3anitrites 3anitrogen 3arisk reduction 3atemperature 3atrapping 3awet season 3awetlands 3aChina 0aNitrogen 0aEnzyme activities 0aCoastal wetlands 0aMangrove wetlands 0aPurification potential 0aEutrophication1 aLiu, Songlin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6478-4938 https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6478-49381 aJiang, Zhijian1 aWu, Yunchao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9115-2143 https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9115-21431 aCui, Lijun1 aHuang, Xiaoping1 aMacreadie, Peter I.0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Dec. 01, v. 694 p.133702-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1337023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02683naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005600144245012300200300002000323520093400343592002801277650001401305650001301319650001501332650001301347650001201360650001101372650001701383650001801400650001301418650001701431650001101448650001501459653002701474653002301501653002201524653001401546653002401560700001701584700006401601700002001665700002101685700005701706700005601763700006001819700005701879773014201936856007802078852000902156655001202165IND60662509420221122053711.0190904e20190820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066250942DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b070112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNa, Jongbeom1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3890-787710aCoating of Pt-Loaded Mesoporous Silica Layers on Ceramics Scaffolds for Practical Preservation System for Greengrocery  ap. 32084-32089.  aTo enhance the decomposition properties of ethylene, Pt-loaded mesoporous silica (SiO₂) was coated onto the scaffolds of cordierite (Mg₂Al₄Si₅O₁₈) membranes (CM) and glass fibers (GF). The surface areas of the mesostructured SiO₂ layers coated on CM (CM/meso-SiO₂) and GF (GF/meso-SiO₂) were, respectively, 118 and 323 times higher than those of the CM and GF. In addition, Pt nanoparticles were homogeneously loaded in the mesopores, which acted as a catalyst. The prepared CM/Pt@meso-SiO₂ and GF/Pt@meso-SiO₂ showed an efficient and high-performing ethylene decomposition. In particular, the flowers, fruits, and vegetables were well stored with the use of CM/Pt@meso-SiO₂ and GF/Pt@meso-SiO₂, which effectively decomposed ethylene gas they generated. As a result, Pt@meso-SiO₂ with scaffolds (CM and GF) are expected to be effective in commercial application for a practical system of preservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acoatings 3acordierite 3aethylene 3aflowers 3afruits 3aglass fibers 3ananoparticles 3aplatinum 3aporous media 3asilica 3avegetables 0aethylene decomposition 0aPt-loaded catalyst 0amesoporous silica 0ascaffolds 0apreservation system1 aZheng, Dehua1 aKim, David Junghoon,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6325-05071 aJikihara, Yohei1 aNakayama, Tsuruo1 aKo, Youngsang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4817-81851 aYou, Jungmok1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9583-22421 aYamauchi, Yusuke1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7854-927X1 aLin, Jianjian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9424-33230 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Aug. 20, v. 11, no. 35 p.32084-32089dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b070113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03632naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003300151245011400184300001600298520177200314536013902086592002802225596013002253650002302383650002602406650001402432650001802446650002202464650001302486650002302499650001902522650002202541650000702563650001202570650002202582650002002604650001802624653002602642653002202668653002302690653001802713653002902731700003202760700004402792700003102836700003502867773011802902856008503020852000903105655001203114IND60679519820221121155559.0191230e20200210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067951982DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2018.14998132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIzário Filho, Hélcio José10aCarbonaceous decomposition of a recalcitrant effluent treated by the photo-Fenton process: a kinetic approach  ap. 411-419.  aNatural effluents with marked variation in their chemical composition over decomposition time in the matrix from which they are generated have a complex composition and are not totally known in most cases. Landfill leachate can be considered an effluent with complex composition, requiring imminent and more comprehensive studies on organic load degradation. Such complexity of numerous organic compounds (most of them recalcitrant humic and fulvic substances) demands a large number of kinetic equations to satisfactorily describe the temporal evolution of such conversion. Thereby, this work aims to study a kinetic approach grounded on previously consolidated chemical reactions of radical generation through the photo-Fenton mechanism. A molar balance was developed for each species in a batch photo-Fenton process and the resulting ordinary differential equations were numerically solved in MATLABᵀᴹ. The kinetic model satisfactorily described an organic load conversion of the effluent under the various experimental conditions studied herein. Experimental trends could be represented by a free-radical mechanism and a degradation rate equation of first order for organic carbon, hydroxyl radical and H⁺. The model fittings revealed a hydroxyl radical/organic carbon stoichiometric ratio of 2:1. The kinetic study has confirmed the importance of pH levels for the reaction medium, and indicated that degradation rate depends on the medium organic composition, which provided an exponential function of conversion for the degradation rate coefficient. The model simulations corroborated the positive effect of sunlight on the radical generation through decomposition reaction with a rate coefficient in the range 4 × 10⁻³–2 × 10⁻¹ s⁻¹.  aThis work was supported by FAPESP - Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo [Processes 2009/1765-2 and 2011/06710-4].  aPublisher supplied data  a2009/1765-2 and 2011/06710-4cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulodhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001807 3achemical reactions 3adifferential equation 3aeffluents 3afree radicals 3ahydroxyl radicals 3akinetics 3alandfill leachates 3aorganic carbon 3aorganic compounds 3apH 3aprotons 3asimulation models 3asolar radiation 3astoichiometry 0aRecalcitrant effluent 0asanitary landfill 0asolar photo-Fenton 0akinetic model 0acarbonaceous degradation1 aSiqueira, Adriano Francisco1 ade Alcântara, Marco Aurélio Kondracki1 aAguiar, Leandro Gonçalves1 aCavalcanti, Alessandro Sampaio0 tEnvironmental technology.g2020 Feb. 10, v. 41, no. 4 p.411-419dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12281x1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2018.14998133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02610naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002800145245012700173300001300300520158800313592002801901650002501929650001701954650001501971650001201986650001501998650001202013650001402025650001302039650001102052651001302063773010602076856008102182852000902263655001202272IND4471198320221117001758.0180619e200409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447119832DNAL7 a10.1007/s10708-005-8631-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKontogeorgopoulos, Nick10aEcotourism and mass tourism in Southern Thailand: Spatial interdependence, structural connections, and staged authenticity  ap. 1-11.  aThe desire to spend leisure time in ‘natural’ settings represents a key factor behind the recent and rapid growth of ecotourism. A search by ecotourists for remote landscapes and locations has shaped the way in which geographers have defined ecotourism, but few scholars have explored, in detail, the mechanics of the spatial relationship between ecotourism and mass tourism, two forms of travel usually considered mutually exclusive in spatial terms. Using the island of Phuket — southern Thailand’s premier resort destination — as a case study, this paper investigates the spatial overlaps and connections between ecotourism and mass tourism and tests the assumption that ecotourism and mass tourism must exist spatially apart in order for the former to succeed. Despite Phuket’s association with mass tourism, and the small physical distances between built-up mass tourist areas and ‘natural’ ecotourism settings, the ‘communicative staging’ of natural authenticity allows ecotourism companies to convey geographical remoteness to tourists. Although ecotourism in Phuket must struggle constantly to overcome the perceptual impact of spatial proximity to resort locations, the tourist markets and business networks of the existing mass tourism industry remain crucial to the survival of ecotourism in this region. Thus, contrary to conventional notions that ecotourism and mass tourism must exist as separate entities, this paper argues that an interconnected, symbiotic, and spatially-contiguous relationship between the two is necessary in the case of Phuket.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3acase studies 3aecotourism 3aislands 3alandscapes 3amarkets 3amechanics 3atourists 3atravel 3aThailand0 tGeoJournal.g2004 Sept., v. 61, no. 1 p.1-11dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl10001x0343-25217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10708-005-8631-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02954naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002400155245008400179300001600263520128500279592002801564650002301592650002701615650002301642650002001665650001501685650001501700650002201715650001601737650001201753650001901765650001501784650002401799650002201823650001501845650001901860650001101879650001501890650001301905653001401918653004101932653001401973653001901987653000902006653000802015653001002023653002702033700001902060700002102079700002702100700002102127700002602148773009102174856009002265852000902355655001202364IND60625782920221119100513.0210108e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062578292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.12.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmythers, Amanda L.10aCharacterizing the effect of Poast on Chlorella vulgaris, a non-target organism  ap. 704-712.  aHerbicides may cause unexpected damage to non-target organisms as it is challenging to predict undesirable biotic interactions. Poast is a widely used herbicide formulation that contains sethoxydim and targets the acetyl-CoA carboxylase of perennial grasses. In this study, Chlorella vulgaris, a unicellular green microalga, was exposed to a 0.08% working concentration of Poast and the physiological and biochemical changes that took place were monitored using biochemical assays, fluorometry, oximetry, and immunoblotting. Within 15 min, severe photosynthetic damage was observed through a reduction in oxygen production and a reduced rate of electron transfer beyond photosystem II. In addition to direct damage to the photosynthetic machinery, it was shown that cells experienced membrane fragmentation. Within 30 min, over 90% of the exposed cells were nonviable. However, sethoxydim, the active ingredient, did not cause detrimental effects when applied along with mineral spirits, the primary solvent of the formulation. A synergistic or additive effect between sethoxydim and the formulation components cannot be ruled out. This data suggests that Poast has the potential to cause severe harm to unicellular phototrophs in the case of herbicide over application or runoff.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella vulgaris 3aacetyl-CoA carboxylase 3aactive ingredients 3aadditive effect 3aautotrophs 3abiocenosis 3aelectron transfer 3afluorometry 3agrasses 3aimmunoblotting 3amicroalgae 3anontarget organisms 3aoxygen production 3aperennials 3aphotosynthesis 3arunoff 3asethoxydim 3asolvents 0aChlorella 0aChlorophyll a fluorescence transient 0aHerbicide 0aPhotosynthesis 0aPSII 0aOEC 0aChl a 0aacetyl-CoA carboxylase1 aGarmany, Armin1 aPerry, Nicole L.1 aHigginbotham, Ethan L.1 aAdkins, P.

The maximum yield of bound protein was 91% and the catalytic efficiency was 96.9%. When the kinetic results for the immobilized enzyme were compared with those for the soluble enzyme, no decrease in the catalytic efficiency of the former was detected. Both soluble and immobilized enzymes showed similar optimum pH and temperature ranges. The reuse of immobilized CgSAHase caused a loss of synthetic activity due to NAD⁺ release, although the binding to the support was sufficiently strong for up to 5 cycles with 95% conversion efficiency. The immobilized enzyme was incubated every 3 cycles with 100 μM NAD⁺ to recover the loss of activity after 5 cycles. This maintained the activity for another 50 cycles. The purification of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) provided an overall yield of 76% and 98% purity as determined by HPLC and NMR analyses. The results indicate the suitability of immobilized CgSAHase for synthesizing SAH and other important S-nucleosidylhomocysteine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aproteins 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aimmobilized enzymes 3aCorynebacterium glutamicum 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3apH 3atemperature 2aAdenosylhomocysteinasexchemistryxmetabolism. 2aBacterial Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aCorynebacterium glutamicumxchemistryxenzymology. 2aEnzyme Stability 2aEnzymes, Immobilizedxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aKinetics 2aS-Adenosylhomocysteinexmetabolism 0aenzymes1 aSánchez-Ferrer, A.1 aGarcía-Carmona, F.0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2012 Mar., v. 93, no. 6 p.2317-2325dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-011-3769-2  aDNAL 7aarticle01665naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245008500167300001600252520057200268592002800840650002400868650001300892650001500905650002000920650001700940650000700957650001100964653001600975653001500991653002401006653001501030700005601045773010601101856008701207852000901294655001201303IND60635924020221123000542.0200103e20190705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063592402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.03.0972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnsi, V.A.10aStable luminescent markers from sugar for patterning and pH sensing applications  ap. 107-113.  aIn this article, the luminescence feature of sugar derived carbon dots is exploited for the fabrication of luminescent marker and pH sensor.

It was found that for Cr(VI)-contaminated solution ([Cr(VI)]₀ = 1.0 mM, pH = 3.0), addition of 5.0 mM Ox can significantly increase Cr(VI) reduction from 0.36 to 1.0 mM within 90 min electrolysis reaction, accompanying with the increase of current efficiency from 19% to 53%. Increasing initial Ox concentration (0–10 mM) and electric current (10–40 mA) facilitated Cr(VI) reduction, whereas it was inhibited with decreasing solution pH value (2.0–3.5) and elevating Cr(VI) concentration (0.1–2.0 mM), respectively. Results show that reactive electron was the primary reductant for the heterogeneous reduction of Cr(VI) on the cathode. In addition, Ox can also serve as an electron donor for the homogeneous reduction of Cr(VI). During this process, the formation of Cr(VI)-oxalate complex is indispensable for the enhanced Cr(VI) reduction. The coordination of Ox with Cr(VI) did not only make the structure of Cr(VI) more distorted but also improved the reactivity of Cr(VI) in Cr(VI)-oxalate complex toward reduction reaction. In general, this study provides an energy-efficient and environmentally benign strategy for the treatment of Ox and Cr(VI) co-contaminated wastewater.  aThis work is ﬁnancially supported by the National Major Science and Technology Program for Water Pollution Control and Treatment (No. 2017ZX07101-006), National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 51608284 and 21506109), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No. 2017M610413, 2018T110668), Shandong Province Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No. 201702041), the State Key Laboratory of Petroleum Pollution Control (No. PPC2016009), the Stated Key Laboratory of Heavy Oil Processing.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017ZX07101-006cNational Major Science and Technology Program for Water Pollution Control and Treatment  a51608284cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a2017M610413a2018T110668cChina Postdoctoral Science Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002858  a201702041cShandong Province Postdoctoral Science Foundation  aPPC2016009cState Key Laboratory of Petroleum Pollution Control  cStated Key Laboratory of Heavy Oil Processing 3acathodes 3achromium 3aelectric current 3aelectrolysis 3aenergy efficiency 3aoxalic acid 3apH 3areducing agents 3awastewater 0aCr(VI) 0areduction 0acomplex1 aXin, Shuaishuai1 aJiang, Bo0 tEnvironmental technology.g2020 Feb. 10, v. 41, no. 4 p.430-439dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12281x1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2018.14998153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02710naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002600145245008300171300001600254520170300270592002801973653001202001653001302013653001302026653002202039700002002061700002402081700002202105700002102127773015802148856008102306852000902387655001202396IND60127721320221116144218.0151110e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012772132DNAL7 a10.1897/IEAM_2008-006.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuddleston, George M.10aAssessment of the Ecological Effects of Arsenic on a Southern Ohio, USA Stream  ap. 302-319.  aDavis Creek is a southern Ohio, USA stream that receives a permitted discharge from the Belpre Elastomers Plant (BEP). A sediment quality triad investigation of Davis Creek was conducted over a 2-y period that included sediment and surface water chemistry measurements, toxicity tests of whole sediment, interstitial and surface water, and benthic and artificial substrate community assessments. The concentration of arsenic in surface and interstitial water was below United States Environmental Protection Agency ambient water quality criteria and was not toxic in laboratory tests (Ceriodaphnia dubia, Pimephales promelas). Similarly, sediments did not significantly affect survival and growth of Hyalella azteca and Chironomus tentans at most sampling locations despite sediments exceeding arsenic sediment screening values in nearly all samples collected. Differences in benthic community structure, determined by rapid bioassessment and Hester––Dendy sampling methods, were related primarily by variations in sediment moisture, particle size, and ammonia and not to arsenic concentrations. The Invertebrate Community Index (ICI) for Davis Creek was lower than values established for other warm-water ecoregional reference streams in Ohio. However, this ICI comparison may have been invalid because, unlike the reference streams, the Davis Creek watershed is small with intermittent headwater flow that limits macroinvertebrate recruitment and energy input. The sediment quality triad investigation indicated that Davis Creek was not significantly affected by arsenic associated with the BEP discharge despite having measured arsenic concentrations that exceeded sediment screening values.  aPublisher supplied data 0aArsenic 0aSediment 0aToxicity 0aBenthic community1 aDorn, Philip B.1 aGillespie, W.

The catalytic capability of the CoFe2O4/CCNF nanocomposites activated PMS was investigated through degrading dimethyl phthalate (DMP), a classical organic pesticide pollutant, in water media. The influence factors like CCNF content, nanocomposite and PMS dosage, DMP content, and pH value on the degradation speed were systematically investigated and analyzed. Since CoFe2O4 is a spinel structured molecule which is magnetically separable, the reusability of the prepared CoFe2O4/CCNF nanocomposites under multiple cycles was also tested. Besides, the degradation intermediates during the catalytic process were also analyzed and identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) with a possible degradation mechanism. The results indicated that the prepared nanocomposite had promising catalytic capability in degrading DMP, in which the SO4− radicals played the main role as the active oxidation agent. Furthermore, the CoFe2O4/CCNF nanocomposites exhibited very good stability and reusability. The present study provides a clean biochar supported catalyst which could readily enhance the PMS activation efficiency for recycled decontamination of refractory organic pollutants in water media.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochar 3acarbon 3acarbon nanofibers 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acellulose 3acobalt 3adecontamination 3adimethyl phthalate 3aferrimagnetic materials 3afree radicals 3aliquid chromatography 3amagnetism 3amass spectrometry 3ananocomposites 3aoxidation 3apH 3apesticides 3apollutants 0aCellulose carbon nanofiber 0aPeroxymonosulfate activation 0aCobalt ferrite 0aDimethyl phthalate degradation 0aRecyclable catalyst1 aZhong, Qiang1 aGeng, Aobo1 aWang, Linjie1 aSong, Chi1 aHan, Shuguang1 aCui, Juqing1 aXu, Lijie0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Dec. 01, v. 694 p.133705-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1337053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03087naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005600144245015000200300002000350520096700370592002801337650001901365650001601384650001301400650001201413650001401425650002301439650002701462650001901489650001201508650001501520650001901535650001401554650001401568653003001582653002801612653002101640700005601661700005701717700006301774700005201837700005701889700002001946700005401966700005702020700001702077700006002094700001902154700006102173700005802234773014202292856007802434852000902512655001202521IND60662509720221122053751.0190904e20190823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066250972DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b077692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Fenfen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6558-819710aInterplay of Lewis and Brønsted Acid Sites in Zr-Based Metal–Organic Frameworks for Efficient Esterification of Biomass-Derived Levulinic Acid  ap. 32090-32096.  aWe report the performance of UiO-66 and its Brønsted acid functionalized derivative, UiO-66-(COOH)₂, as heterogeneous catalysts for levulinic acid esterification with ethanol. Importantly, compared with UiO-66, UiO-66-(COOH)₂ displayed superior catalytic performance (up to 97.0 ± 1.1% yield of ethyl levulinate) attributed to the synergistic effect between Lewis acidic Zr clusters and Brønsted acidic −COOH groups. Furthermore, UiO-66-(COOH)₂ was stable and reusable without an appreciable loss in catalytic activity for at least five consecutive cycles. This study demonstrates that the interplay of Brønsted and Lewis acid sites in zirconium metal–organic frameworks leads to more efficient catalytic conversion of a biomass feedstock to biofuel, and with further hypothesis driven research, additional materials that show promise as candidates for catalytic conversion of biomass feedstocks to biofuels and valuable chemicals can be developed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBronsted acids 3aLewis acids 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acoordination compounds 3aesterification 3aethanol 3afeedstocks 3alevulinic acid 3asynergism 3azirconium 0ametal−organic framework 0aheterogeneous catalysis 0aethyl levulinate1 aChen, Zhijie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9232-73821 aChen, Haoyuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8634-40281 aGoetjen, Timothy A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8023-91071 aLi, Peng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4273-45771 aWang, Xingjie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5802-99441 aAlayoglu, Selim1 aMa, Kaikai1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0414-43971 aChen, Yongwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5742-03351 aWang, Tiejun1 aIslamoglu, Timur1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3688-91581 aFang, Yanxiong1 aSnurr, Randall Q.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2925-92461 aFarha, Omar K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9904-98450 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Aug. 23, v. 11, no. 35 p.32090-32096dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b077693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03678naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002500188245012600213300001200339506007600351520213300427592002802560506003702588650002502625650001102650650001002661650001102671650002702682650001302709650001002722650001202732650001802744650001202762650004302774650001102817650001702828651001602845700002002861700002102881700002202902700002302924700002502947700001802972773009202990856008103082852000903163655001203172IND60123895820221207083322.0161029e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012389582DNAL7 a10.1186/s13071-015-0812-72doi7 aPMC43936032pmcid7 a258857442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerera, Piyumali K.,10aComparison of the performance of three PCR assays for the detection and differentiation of Theileria orientalis genotypes  ap. 192.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Oriental theileriosis is a tick-borne disease of bovines caused by the members of the Theileria orientalis complex. Recently, we developed a multiplexed tandem (MT) PCR to detect, differentiate and quantitate four genotypes (i.e., buffeli, chitose, ikeda and type 5) of T. orientalis. In this study, we used MT PCR to assess the prevalence and infection intensity of four T. orientalis genotypes in selected cattle herds that experienced oriental theileriosis outbreaks in New Zealand, and compared the sensitivities and specificities of MT PCR, PCR-high resolution melting (PCR-HRM) and a TaqMan® qPCR. METHODS: MT PCR, PCR-HRM analysis for T. orientalis and a TaqMan® qPCR assay for ikeda genotype were employed to test 154 and 88 cattle blood samples from North (where oriental theileriosis outbreaks had occurred; designated as Group 1) and South (where no outbreaks had been reported; Group 2) Islands of New Zealand, respectively. Quantitative data from MT PCR assay were analyzed using generalized linear model and paired-sample t-test. The diagnostic specificity and sensitivity of the assays were estimated using a Bayesian latent class modeling approach. RESULTS: In Group 1, 99.4% (153/154) of cattle were test-positive for T. orientalis in both the MT PCR and PCR-HRM assays. The apparent prevalences of genotype ikeda in Group 1 were 87.6% (134/153) and 87.7% (135/154) using the MT PCR and Ikeda TaqMan® qPCR assays, respectively. Using the MT PCR test, all four genotypes of T. orientalis were detected. The infection intensity estimated for genotype ikeda was significantly higher (P = 0.009) in severely anaemic cattle than in those without anaemia, and this intensity was significantly higher than that of buffeli (P < 0.001) in the former cattle. Bayesian latent class analysis showed that the diagnostic sensitivities (97.1-98.9%) and specificities (96.5-98.9%) of the three PCR assays were very comparable. CONCLUSION: The present findings show the advantages of using the MT PCR assay as a useful tool for in-depth epidemiological and transmission studies of T. orientalis worldwide.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aTheileria orientalis 3aanemia 3ablood 3acattle 3adiagnostic specificity 3agenotype 3aherds 3aislands 3alinear models 3amelting 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3at-test 3atheileriosis 3aNew Zealand1 aGasser, Robin B1 aPulford, David J1 aStevenson, Mark A1 aFirestone, Simon M1 aMcFadden, Andrew M J1 aJabbar, Abdul0 tParasites & vectors.g2015 Dec., v. 8, no. 1 p.192-192dBioMed Centralx1756-33057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-015-0812-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03309naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003100135040001800166100002000184245012900204300001200333506007600345520147200421592002801893506003701921650001601958650002101974650001301995650002502008650002202033650001202055650002202067650001102089650003102100650001502131650002402146650002102170650002002191650001002211650001902221650002102240650001102261650002102272650001802293650001102311650001502322650000902337650001902346650002102365650004802386700002102434700001602455700002202471773016102493856004402654852000902698655001202707IND50058743620221207061609.0201006e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005874362DNAL7 a212695142pmid7 aPMC30395512pmcid7 a10.1186/1479-5868-8-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLubans, David R14aThe relationship between active travel to school and health-related fitness in children and adolescents: a systematic review  ap. 402.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Active travel to school (ATS) has been identified as an important source of physical activity for youth. However, the relationship between ATS and health-related fitness (HRF) among youth remains unclear. METHODS: A systematic search of seven electronic databases (EMBASE, OVID MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, SPORTDiscus and TRIS on line) was conducted in December 2009 and studies published since 1980 were considered for inclusion. RESULTS: Twenty seven articles were identified that explored the relationship between ATS and the following aspects of HRF: weight status/body composition, cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular fitness and flexibility. Forty-eight percent of the studies that examined the relationship between ATS and weight status/body composition reported significant associations, this increased to 55% once poor quality studies were removed. Furthermore, the findings from five studies, including one longitudinal study, indicate that ATS is positively associated with cardiorespiratory fitness in youth. However, the evidence for the relationships between ATS and muscular fitness or flexibility is equivocal and limited by low study numbers. CONCLUSIONS: There is some evidence to suggest that ATS is associated with a healthier body composition and level of cardiorespiratory fitness among youth. Strategies to increase ATS are warranted and should be included in whole-of-school approaches to the promotion of physical activity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadolescents 3abody composition 3achildren 3alongitudinal studies 3aphysical activity 3aschools 3asystematic review 3atravel 2aActivities of Daily Living 2aAdolescent 2aAdolescent Behavior 2aBody Composition 2aBody Mass Index 2aChild 2aChild Behavior 2aChild, Preschool 2aFemale 2aHealth Promotion 2aHealth Status 2aHumans 2aLocomotion 2aMale 2aMotor Activity 2aPhysical Fitness 2aTransportationxstatistics & numerical data1 aBoreham, Colin A1 aKelly, Paul1 aFoster, Charlie E0 tinternational journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity.g2011 Dec., v. 8, no. 1 p.402-402dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:jnl4350546x1479-58687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1479-5868-8-5  aDNAL 7aarticle03278naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100007800155245013500233300001600368520147900384592002801863650001501891650001401906650001901920650001401939650002301953650002501976650001502001650001402016650001702030650001302047650002202060650001302082650000902095650002202104650001202126650001902138650001802157650001102175650001402186650001802200650001102218650001002229650002102239653002202260653001702282653001402299653002402313653002502337700002502362700003602387700002802423700003502451773009102486856009002577852000902667655001202676IND60625783120221119100842.0210108e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062578312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.12.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Freitas, Victor Augusto Araújo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8418-487910aUse of iron ore tailing from tailing dam as catalyst in a fenton-like process for methylene blue oxidation in continuous flow mode  ap. 328-334.  aThe global demand for iron ore with high iron contents to supply the steel industry is associated, in most countries, with the generation of tailings from mineral processing. The chemical compositions of iron ore tailings (basically Fe₂O₃ and SiO₂) make them an excellent candidate as a catalyst for advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), especially the Fenton process and its derivatives. Therefore, this paper aimed to transform iron ore tailings from tailing dams into catalysts able to activate H₂O₂ for the purpose of treating, in a continuous flow, effluents contaminated with organic dyes, employing methylene blue as a model molecule. The mineralogical characteristics of in natura tailings, such as the associations between iron oxides and quartz and the particle sizes of iron oxides, are favourable points for their transformation into catalysts by Fenton-like processes. Different pellet geometries and binding agents were evaluated to optimize the dye removal. Pellet pretreatment in a CH₄ atmosphere at 550 °C for 2 h with 10% bentonite as a binding agent (RCSP sample) resulted in the removal of approximately 80% of dye. Kinetic removal data show the good stability of the catalyst in the flow system. Significant catalytic activity loss was not observed after four runs, and data from TG-MS indicate that there is a synergetic mechanism between the adsorption, radical attack and desorption processes of the substrate on the catalyst surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abentonite 3abinding agents 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical composition 3adesorption 3aeffluents 3aferric oxide 3ageometry 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aindustry 3airon 3amass spectrometry 3amethane 3amethylene blue 3amine tailings 3amodels 3aoxidation 3aparticle size 3aquartz 3asteel 3athermogravimetry 0aIron ore tailings 0aTailing dams 0aCatalyser 0aFenton-like process 0aWastewater treatment1 aBreder, Samuel Moura1 aSilvas, Flávia Paulucci Cianga1 aRadino Rouse, Patrícia1 ade Oliveira, Luiz Carlos Alves0 tChemosphere.g2019 Mar., v. 219 p.328-334dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.12.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02429naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002100176245006400197300001500261520113500276592002801411650001701439650001501456650001601471650001001487650001101497650001101508650002201519650002101541650001101562650001201573650001301585650001701598700001501615700001701630773015101647856006901798856009601867990002301963852000901986655001201995IND60643564820221118030128.0190511e20140805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064356482DNAL7 a10.3791/517812doi7 aPMC46729532pmcid7 a251454172pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomine, Jennifer10aControlled cortical impact model for traumatic brain injury  ap. e51781.  aEvery year over a million Americans suffer a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Combined with the incidence of TBIs worldwide, the physical, emotional, social, and economical effects are staggering. Therefore, further research into the effects of TBI and effective treatments is necessary. The controlled cortical impact (CCI) model induces traumatic brain injuries ranging from mild to severe. This method uses a rigid impactor to deliver mechanical energy to an intact dura exposed following a craniectomy. Impact is made under precise parameters at a set velocity to achieve a pre-determined deformation depth. Although other TBI models, such as weight drop and fluid percussion, exist, CCI is more accurate, easier to control, and most importantly, produces traumatic brain injuries similar to those seen in humans. However, no TBI model is currently able to reproduce pathological changes identical to those seen in human patients. The CCI model allows investigation into the short-term and long-term effects of TBI, such as neuronal death, memory deficits, and cerebral edema, as well as potential therapeutic treatments for TBI.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrain damage 3acell death 3adeformation 3aedema 3aenergy 3ahumans 3along term effects 3amemory disorders 3amodels 3aneurons 3apatients 3atherapeutics1 aGao, Xiang1 aChen, Jinhui0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2014 Aug. 05, , no. 90 p.e51781-e51781dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/517813Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/51781/controlled-cortical-impact-model-for-traumatic-brain-injury  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03142naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006900139245009500208300001600303500002000319520180000339592002802139596003602167596002102203596005902224650001102283650001602294650001602310650002602326650001502352650002302367650002402390650001302414650001602427651001902443700001902462700003102481700001602512773010902528856007402637852000902711655001202720IND60776720620221121022249.0220509e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077672062DNAL7 a10.1111/btp.130872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan den Burg, Matthijs P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8276-071310aHurricane‐associated population decrease in a critically endangered long‐lived reptile  ap. 708-720.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aCatastrophic events, like hurricanes, bring lethal conditions that can have population‐altering effects. The threatened Caribbean dry forest occurs in a region known for its high‐intensity hurricane seasons and high species endemism, highlighting the need to better understand hurricane impacts in combination with habitat fragmentation and loss. However, such studies remain rare and for reptiles are mostly restricted to Anolis. Here, we used single‐season occupancy modeling to infer the impact of the intense 2017 Atlantic hurricane season on the critically endangered Lesser Antillean Iguana, Iguana delicatissima. We surveyed 30 transects across eight habitats on St. Eustatius during 2017–2019, which resulted in 344 individual surveys and 98 iguana observations. Analyses of abundance and site occupancy indicated both measures for 2018 and 2019 were strongly reduced compared to the pre‐hurricane 2017 state. Iguanas at higher elevations were affected more profoundly, likely due to higher wind speeds, tree damage, and extensive defoliation. Overall, our results indicate a decrease in population estimates (23.3%–26.5%) and abundance (22%–23.8%) for 2018 and 2019, and a 75% reduction in opportunistic sightings of tagged iguanas between 2017 and 2018. As only small and isolated I. delicatissima populations remain, our study further demonstrates their vulnerability to stochastic events. Considering the frequency and intensity of hurricanes are projected to increase, our results stress the urgent need for population‐increasing conservation actions in order to secure the long‐term survival of I. delicatissima throughout its range. Given the projected increase and poleward shift of hurricanes, our study provides important insights from a non‐model species.  aPublisher supplied data  cInternational Iguana Foundation  cBEST 2.0 program  a172517158cMohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation fund 3aAnolis 3adefoliation 3adry forests 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahurricanes 3aindigenous species 3apopulation dynamics 3areptiles 3atree damage 3aSint Eustatius1 aMadden, Hannah1 avan Wagensveld, Timothy P.1 aBoman, Erik0 tBiotropica.g2022 May, v. 54, no. 3 p.708-720dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45461x0006-36067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/btp.130873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02132naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011000166300001400276520097300290592002801263650001901291650001901310650001201329650001101341650001101352650000901363650002601372650001801398650002701416650001501443650001901458650001401477650001201491650000901503700002101512773011101533856008101644852000901725655001201734IND60518309620221119215129.0160412e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051830962DNAL7 a10.3103/S01476874160100752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhukova, A.

The total concentration of Cd (4.0 mg/kg), Pb (99.4 mg/kg), F (15.2 mg/kg), and S (479.6 mg/kg) is found to exceed the established maximum permissible concentrations (MPC, APC). The local concentration maximum of the major pollutants is observed at a distance of 0.5 and 1.0 km away from a phosphogypsum stack. Comparing sampling plots equidistant from the pollution source reveals that alluvial soils have accumulated 1.5–2 times more total forms of Cd, Pb, Zn, Cu, S than agrosod podzolic soils.The stability of the microbial community can be characterized as resistant to the existing anthropogenic pollution. No potential attributes of microbial degradation are identified in the areas where the concentrations of soil pollutants exceed the background level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalluvial soils 3abiodegradation 3acadmium 3acement 3acopper 3alead 3amicrobial communities 3aphosphogypsum 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3apollutants 3asoil pollution 3astrontium 3atopsoil 3azinc1 aKhomiakov, D.

S104-S110.  aThe white grouper (Epinephelus aeneus) has high commercial value, yet genomic tools for marker assisted domestication and breeding of the species are lacking. In this research, a total of 610 published sequences of microsatellites in Epinephelus species were found, from which 222 were suitable for primer design. Heterologous markers for E. aeneus were developed from microsatellite sequences of Epinephelus awoara, Epinephelus septemfasciatus, Epinephelus fuscoguttatus, Epinephelus itajara, Epinephelus guttatus, Epinephelus akaara and Epinephelus lanceolatus. The yield of heterologous polymorphic microsatellites by species of origin ranged from 42 to 83%. The lowest yield was found for E. septemfasciatus (P=0.001), which is the most phylogenetically distant from E. aeneus. A total of 140 loci were found polymorphic in the wild-type E. aeneus population (WT) and 137 loci in its captive broodstock. The average number of alleles was 6.5 in the WT population and 3.5 in the captive population (P=3 e−25). A set of eight microsatellites with 6 to 10 alleles per marker in the WT population was developed for parentage analysis of the offspring population. Two males and two females were found to contribute genetic material in various pairing combinations, whereas one pair was shown to be the parents of most of the progeny (69.2%), suggesting the reproduction mode of E. aeneus as polygamous. The parentity test is being used to form a segregating population for linkage mapping of all available genetic markers, thereby creating the first-generation white grouper linkage map.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEpinephelus aeneus 3aEpinephelus akaara 3aEpinephelus awoara 3aEpinephelus fuscoguttatus 3aEpinephelus itajara 3aHyporthodus septemfasciatus 3aalleles 3abreeding stock 3achromosome mapping 3adomestication 3afemales 3agenetic markers 3agenomics 3aloci 3amales 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aparentage 3aparents 3aphylogeny 3apolygamy 3aprogeny 0aEpinephelus aeneus 0aWhite grouper 0aMicrosatellites 0aHeterologous genetic markers 0aDNA barcoding 0aCOI1 aShirak, Andrey1 aGorshkov, Sergeĭ,1 aRon, Micha1 aHulata, Gideon0 tAquaculture.g2014 Jan. 20, v. 420-421 p.S104-S110dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2013.02.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01778naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245008800164300001400252520069800266592002800964650002900992650002501021650002201046650001101068650001501079650002201094650001601116650002901132650001701161650001201178650001001190650001501200773011101215856008101326852000901407655001201416IND60518309820221119215017.0160412e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051830982DNAL7 a10.3103/S014768741601004X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStoma, G.

The properties of the topsoil horizons undergo various transformations and the soil quality drops. The range of changes depends on the period of the settlement and the type of the use of the area. The most favorable conditions for plant development and the best ecological status of soils are seen in the regions with the shortest period of human habitation and low direct anthropogenic impact. Considerable degradation of chemical, biological, and physical soil properties in combination with high anthropogenic impact exerts an unfavorable effect on the status of soils and vegetation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3achemical degradation 3aforest ecosystems 3ahumans 3alandscapes 3aplant development 3aplantations 3asoil physical properties 3asoil quality 3atopsoil 3atrees 3avegetation0 tMoscow University soil science bulletin.g2016 Jan., v. 71, no. 1 p.35-41dAllerton Pressx0147-68747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3103/S014768741601004X3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04013naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100003800158245016500196300001600361520240500377592002802782650002002810650001902830650001102849650001502860650002002875650001402895650001802909650001402927650001802941650002402959650003302983650001203016650001703028650001003045650001103055653001303066653000803079653001103087653001303098700004003111700003003151700002503181700002803206700002803234700003003262773010103292856009303393852000903486655001203495IND60655274820221119012959.0190906e20191015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065527482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2019.07.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Carvalho, Júlia Gleyci Soares10aSuperstimulation prior to the ovum pick-up improves the in vitro embryo production in nulliparous, primiparous and multiparous buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) donors  ap. 164-168.  aThe aim of this study was to evaluate the ovarian follicular population, the oocyte yield and the in vitro embryo production (IVEP) of nulliparous (NU), primiparous (PR) and multiparous (MU) buffalo donors submitted to the superstimulation with FSH prior to the ovum pick-up (OPU). A total of 54 buffalo donors (18 NU, 15 PR and 21MU) received an intravaginal progesterone device (1.0 g) plus estradiol benzoate [2.0 mg, intramuscular (im)] at random stage of the estrous cycle (Day 0) during the breeding season (autumn and winter). Buffaloes from different categories were then randomly allocated to one of two groups (Control or FSH), in a cross-over experimental design. Buffalo donors in the Control group received no further treatment, whereas buffalo donors in the FSH group received a total dosage of 200 mg im of FSH on Days 4 and 5, in four decreasing doses 12 h apart (57, 57, 43 and 43 mg). On Day 7, the progesterone device was removed and the OPU procedure was performed in both groups. The same semen was used across all replicates and donor category. Data were analyzed by the GLIMMIX procedure of SAS 9.4®. There was no interaction between FSH treatment and animal category for all analyzed variables. Furthermore, no differences between animal category (P = 0.73) and FSH treatment (P = 0.53) were observed regarding the total follicles aspirated. However, the FSH treatment increased (P < 0.001) the proportion of large (>10 mm; FSH = 16.2% and Control = 2.0%) and medium-sized follicles (6–10 mm; FSH = 36.3% and Control = 6.1%) available for the OPU procedure. The total of recovered oocytes was greater in NU than in MU, and PR were similar to NU and MU (P = 0.05). No effect of FSH treatment was observed (P = 0.85) for this variable. Buffalo donors treated with FSH had a greater viable oocytes rate (P = 0.03), blastocyst rate (P = 0.03) and embryo yield per OPU-IVEP session (P = 0.07), however, no category effects were observed for these variables. These results provided evidence that superstimulation with FSH increased the proportion of large and medium-sized follicles available for the OPU procedure. Consequently, the FSH treatment enhanced the proportion of viable oocytes for culture and resulted in greater blastocyst rates and embryo yield per OPU-IVEP session in all buffalo donors categories.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBubalus bubalis 3aanimal ovaries 3aautumn 3ablastocyst 3abreeding season 3abuffaloes 3adata analysis 3aestradiol 3aestrous cycle 3aexperimental design 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 3aoocytes 3aprogesterone 3asemen 3awinter 0aFollicle 0aFSH 0aOocyte 0aOPU-IVEP1 ade Carvalho, Nelcio Antonio Tonizza1 aBayeux, Bernardo Marcozzi1 aWatanabe, Yeda Fumie1 aWatanabe, Osnir Yoshime1 aMingoti, Rodolfo Daniel1 aBaruselli, Pietro Sampaio0 tTheriogenology.g2019 Oct. 15, v. 138 p.164-168dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2019.07.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03944naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006600139245008100205300001600286500001900302500002000321520240000341592002802741596007702769650001302846650001702859650001802876650001102894650001502905650001302920650001602933650002102949650001202970650001402982650002302996650001303019650001503032650002403047650001303071650001203084650001403096650001503110700006003125700002503185700002903210773011703239856007303356852000903429655001203438IND60721487620221120062235.0201224e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072148762DNAL7 a10.1111/fwb.136212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSertić Perić, Mirela1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4744-788410aDoes rapid glacial recession affect feeding habits of alpine stream insects?  ap. 114-129.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aGlacial retreat, accompanied by shifts in riparian vegetation and glacier meltwater inputs, alters the energy supply and trophic structure of alpine stream food webs. Our goal in this study was to enhance understanding of dietary niches of macroinvertebrates inhabiting different alpine streams with contrasting glacial and non‐glacial (groundwater, precipitation, snowmelt) water inputs in conjunction with seasonal and habitat‐specific variation in basal resource availability. We measured a range of stream physico‐chemical attributes as well as carbon and nitrogen isotopes (δ¹³C, δ¹⁵N) of macroinvertebrates and primary food sources at seven sites across seasons within a Swiss glaciated catchment (Val Roseg) undergoing rapid glacial retreat (1–2 km between 1997 and 2014). Sampling sites corresponded to streams used in a previous (1997/1998) study within the same alpine catchment. Physico‐chemical attributes showed wide variation in environmental conditions across streams and seasons. Significant correlation among physico‐chemical proxies of glacier meltwater (phosphate‐P, total inorganic carbon, conductivity, turbidity) and macroinvertebrate δ¹³C, δ¹⁵N, and size‐corrected standard ellipse area (a proxy for feeding niche width) values showed that the extent of glacial water input shapes the energy base among alpine streams. Feeding niche differences among common alpine stream insect taxa (Chironomidae, Baetidae, Heptageniidae) were not significant, indicating that these organisms probably are plastic in feeding behaviour, opportunistically relying on food resources available in a particular stream and season. Seasonal trends in macroinvertebrate δ¹³C largely followed patterns in periphyton δ¹³C values, indicating that autochthonous resources were the main consumer energy source within the stream network, as shown previously. The overall range in macroinvertebrate δ¹³C (−33.5 to −18.4‰) and δ¹⁵N (−6.9 to 6.7‰) values also corresponded to values measured in the previous study, suggesting that macroinvertebrates altered diets in line with changes in environmental conditions and food resources during a period of rapid glacial retreat. Our results suggest that environmental changes brought on by rapid glacial retreat have not yet caused a profound change in the trophic structure within these fluvial networks.  aPublisher supplied data  cSwiss Government Excellence Scholarship for Foreign Scholars and Artists 3aBaetidae 3aChironomidae 3aHeptageniidae 3aenergy 3aglaciation 3aglaciers 3agroundwater 3ainorganic carbon 3ainsects 3alimnology 3amacroinvertebrates 3anitrogen 3aperiphyton 3ariparian vegetation 3asnowmelt 3astreams 3aturbidity 3awatersheds1 aNielsen, Jens M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3393-47771 aSchubert, Carsten J.1 aRobinson, Christopher T.0 tFreshwater biology.g2021 Jan., v. 66, no. 1 p.114-129dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl1839x0046-50707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.136213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02041naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005900139245010700198300001600305500002000321520044000341592002800781596007800809596006300887596008400950596006801034650001401102650002501116650001201141650001801153650001201171650001701183650002501200700002801225700003101253700005801284700002601342700005901368773010901427856007401536852000901610655001201619IND60776721020221121014750.0220509e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077672102DNAL7 a10.1111/btp.130952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaisin, Olivier1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4826-131X12aA universal pharmacy: Possible self‐medication using tree balsam by multiple Atlantic Forest mammals  ap. 576-582.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe present camera trap evidence of 10 Atlantic Forest mammals fur‐rubbing, licking, or biting balsam from cabreúvas (Myroxylon peruiferum, Fabaceae), native trees used in traditional medicine for their prophylactic and therapeutic virtues.

Co-administration of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory drugs has shown clinical benefits. Due to its significant reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging ability, great interest has been focused on superoxide dismutase (SOD) for therapeutic use. However, oral SOD is exposed to biochemical degradation along gastrointestinal transit. Furthermore, the antioxidant activity of SOD must be achieved intracellularly, therefore its cell entry requires endocytic mediating mechanisms. In this work, SOD was loaded into nanoarchaeosomes (ARC-SOD), nanovesicles fully made of sn 2,3 ether linked phytanyl saturated archaeolipids to protect and target SOD to inflammatory macrophages upon oral administration. Antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of ARC-SOD, non-digested and digested in simulated gastrointestinal fluids, on macrophages stimulated with H2O2 and lipopolysaccharide were determined and compared with those of free SOD and SOD encapsulated into highly stable liposomes (LIPO-SOD).Compared to SOD and LIPO-SOD, ARC-SOD (170 ± 14 nm, -30 ± 4 mV zeta potential, 122 mg protein/g phospholipids) showed the highest antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity: it reversed the cytotoxic effect of H2O2, decreased intracellular ROS and completely suppressed the production of IL-6 and TNF-α on stimulated J774 A.1 cells. Moreover, while the activity of LIPO-SOD was lost upon preparation, gastrointestinal digestion and storage, ARC-SOD was easy to prepare and retained its antioxidant capacity upon digestion in simulated gastrointestinal fluids and after 5 months of storage. Because of their structural and pharmacodynamic features, ARC-SOD may be suitable for oral targeted delivery of SOD to inflamed mucosa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3alipopolysaccharides 3acolloids 3adigestion 3agastric juice 3aoral administration 3aoxidative stress 3agastrointestinal system 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amacrophages 3apharmacodynamics 3agastrointestinal transit 3amucosa 3apathogenesis 3ainflammatory bowel disease 3aanti-inflammatory agents 3aphospholipids 3acytotoxicity 3asuperoxide dismutase 3astorage time 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3aantioxidant activity 3ainterleukin-6 3azeta potential 0aReactive oxygen species 0aGastrointestinal stability 0aInflammatory bowel diseases 0atherapeutics1 aSimioni, Yamila Roxana1 aJerez, Horacio Emanuel1 aCaimi, Ayelen Tatiana1 ade Farias, Marcelo Alexandre1 aVillares Portugal, Rodrigo1 aRomero, Eder Lilia1 aMorilla, Maria Jose0 tColloids and surfaces.g2019 July 01, v. 179 p.479-487dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2019.03.0613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04156naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245015700166300001600323520282700339592002803166653002903194653001503223653002203238653000903260653001803269700002203287700002103309700002303330700002103353700002003374700002003394700002403414700002503438700002503463700002203488773015803510856008103668852000903749655001203758IND60127722120221116144253.0151110e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012772212DNAL7 a10.1897/IEAM_2008-058.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHall, Timothy J.12aA Long-Term, Multitrophic Level Study to Assess Pulp and Paper Mill Effluent Effects on Aquatic Communities in Four US Receiving Waters: Lessons Learned  ap. 283-290.  aLessons learned from the development, implementation, and initial 8 y of study findings from a long-term study to assess the effects of pulp and paper mill effluents on receiving waters are summarized as a conclusion to a series of articles (this issue) on study findings. The study, based on industry-defined information needs, was developed via a science-based experimental design into a long-term (>10 y) watershed-scale monitoring program that integrated in-stream population/community assessment, laboratory chronic bioassays, and fathead minnow full life-cycle assays as well as water quality and effluent quality monitoring and habitat assessment in addressing the presence of effluent effects. The 4 study streams (Codorus Creek, PA; Leaf River, MS; and the McKenzie and Willamette rivers, OR) represented both bleached and unbleached kraft mill processes and effluent concentrations that ranged from near typical for the United States (0.4%%) to very high (Codorus Creek == 32%%). Following 8 y of monitoring, the weight of evidence suggests an absence of biological differences at stations downstream of the mill discharges for periphyton or macroinvertebrates and, with the exception of 1 of 9 large-bodied fish and 1 of 7 small-bodied fish community structure metrics for 1 river (McKenzie), an absence of differences for fish communities. Laboratory bioassay and fathead minnow full-life cycle tests supported a substantial ““margin of safety”” in that, depending on the effluent, adverse responses did not occur until effluent concentrations were from 2 times to more than 150 times in-stream concentrations. The incorporation of a watershed spatial scale illustrated that each sample site tended to be unique over the 28 to 50 km monitored segments with respect to habitat and that knowledge of these variables permitted accurate evaluations of effluent effects. Similarly, the multiyear study framework provided information regarding the natural seasonal and year-to-year variability in fish communities and consequently a better understanding of how potential effluent effects signals could be expressed within this variability. The study incorporated an adaptive management strategy that provided for study design and monitoring modifications over time as a way of benefiting from practical experience and knowledge gained through time and to optimize the use of study resources. Results from this initial 8 y of monitoring, to our knowledge, represent the longest-known population/community-level assessment of the in-stream effects of pulp and paper mill effluents. Beyond the lessons learned with respect to effluent effects are those related to the design and conduct of long-term watershed-scale studies that may be of use to others in developing watershed assessment or management programs.  aPublisher supplied data 0aPulp/paper mill effluent 0aPeriphyton 0aMacroinvertebrate 0aFish 0aWater quality1 aFisher, Robert P.1 aRodgers, John H.1 aMinshall, G.

In teleosts, the main androgen is 11-Ketotestosterone (11-KT), which is oxidized testosterone (T) at the C11 position. Compared to T, 11-KT is a nonaromatizable steroid, and does not convert to 17β-estradiol. However, circulatory levels of both T and 11-KT undergo seasonal variations along with testicular development. Physiological functions of androgens are mediated via androgen receptor (Ar). So far, nuclear Ar and membrane Ar have been identified in fishes. In the present study, we reviewed androgen biosynthesis in fishes, compared molecular structure of nuclear Ar in models of mammals and fishes, and investigated the mechanisms of action of environmental contaminants that differentially disrupt androgen signaling in fish reproduction. In the latter case, the adverse effects of vinclozolin (VZ) and bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) are compared. Both VZ and DEHP are capable of decreasing sperm quality in males. Vinclozolin causes an increase in 11-KT production associated with increases in kisspeptin (kiss-1) and salmon gonadotropin-releasing hormone (gnrh3) mRNA levels as well as circulatory levels of luteinizing hormone (Lh). In contrast, DEHP inhibits 11-KT production associated with a decrease in circulatory Lh levels. However, DEHP-inhibited 11-KT production is not associated with changes in kiss-1 and gnrh3 mRNA levels. Studies also show that VZ alters ar mRNA levels, while DEHP is without effect. These suggest that VZ and DEHP act differentially to cause androgen-dependent reproductive disorder in male fishes. Molecular analyses of the nuclear AR show that both DNA and ligand binding domains (DBD and LBD, respectively) are highly conserved within models of mammals and fishes. A phylogeny tree of the AR shows distinct clusters between mammals and fishes. In fishes, subtypes of Arα and Arβ are also separated in distinct clusters. Thus, further studies need to generate ar knockout fish model to better elucidate androgen regulation of reproduction in fishes via Ar.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aadverse effects 3aandrogen receptors 3aanimal models 3aanimal reproduction 3abiosynthesis 3achemical structure 3aestradiol 3afish diseases 3agonadotropin-releasing hormone 3ahormone antagonists 3akisspeptin 3aligands 3aluteinizing hormone 3amales 3amammals 3amechanism of action 3amessenger RNA 3aoxidation 3aphthalates 3aphylogeny 3apollution 3areproductive disorders 3asalmon 3aseasonal variation 3asperm quality 3aspermatogenesis 3atesticular development 3atestosterone 3avinclozolin 0aAndrogen receptor 0aBis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate 0aFertility 0aHypothalamus-pituitary-testis axis 0aSperm1 aAlavi, Sayyed Mohammad Hadi0 tTheriogenology.g2019 Nov., v. 139 p.58-71dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2019.07.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02215naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005400144245006700198300002000265520101600285592002801301650001701329650001301346650001201359650002201371653004401393653004501437653003301482653001401515653001901529700001601548700001401564700001501578700001901593773014201612856007801754852000901832655001201841IND60662510220221116203342.0190904e20190807xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066251022DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b081072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Guijie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0740-223510aDifluoroboron-Enabled Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence  ap. 32209-32217.  aA new series of tetracoordinated boron-enabled thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials with a donor–acceptor BF₂-type framework were designed and conveniently synthesized. Difluoroboron plays a critical role and acts as a key to coordinate with the latent acceptor of the 2-(4-phenylpyridin-2-yl)phenol (PPyPOH) moiety to realize TADF. TADF materials are air-stable and have a high photoluminescence quantum yield of up to 99%. NOBF2-Cz- and NOBF2-DPCz-doped blue OLEDs demonstrated EQEs of 11.0% with CIE coordinates of (0.14, 0.16) and 15.8% with (0.14, 0.28) and high brightness of 6761 and 19383 cd/m² could be achieved, respectively. Moreover, the blue OLED doped with NOBF2-DPCz and the green OLED doped with NOBF2-DMAC achieved operational lifetimes at 50% of initial luminance (L₀ = 500 cd/m²), LT₅₀, of 54 and 920 h, respectively. This work indicates that these tetracoordinated difluoroboron molecules can act as efficient and stable TADF materials for OLED applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3afluorescence 3amoieties 3aphenols 3aphotoluminescence 0atetracoordinated difluoroboron compound 0athermally activated delayed fluorescence 0aorganic light-emitting diode 0ablue OLED 0adihedral angle1 aLou, Weiwei1 aWang, Dan1 aDeng, Chao1 aZhang, Qisheng0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Aug. 07, v. 11, no. 35 p.32209-32217dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b081073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03521naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006500150245011500215300001600330520169300346592002802039650001502067650001402082650001002096650001102106650001302117650001902130650001202149650001502161650001702176650002102193650002102214650000902235650001602244650001402260650001702274650001702291650001902308650001202327650001402339650001502353650001802368650001502386651001402401653002802415653002602443653002202469653001402491700001102505700005702516700006002573773021602633856008502849852000902934655001202943IND60749388120221117223431.0211009e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074938812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecohyd.2021.08.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSutapa, Ignasius D.A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4710-491010aImplementation of ecohydrology to support sustainable water resources management in tropical region, Indonesia  ap. 501-515.  aIndonesia is a tropical country with abundant water resources consisting of rivers, lakes, dams, swamps and flood plains. High pressure on these natural resources, mostly related to anthropogenic activities and climate change, tend to increase environmental degradation and water ecosystem deterioration. Various possible efforts need to be considered in order to overcome water related problems in the future. Ecohydrology application will be a useful tool in regulating water circulation, eroded soil transportation, water quality, quantity and availability, and floods and drought risk. Implementation of ecohydrological concept at demonstration site scale in a tributary of the Saguling reservoir catchment, the upper Citarum watershed, Indonesia aims to facilitate different part of stakeholders to have best practices tools and field experiences in dealing with daily water ecosystem and environmental challenges. This study showed a very high erosion at internal demonstration site area, closely related to increase of river water turbidity. Meanwhile, developed modelling system may predict water and sediment yields, soil erosion and deposition sources in good performance, either within the demonstration site or the entire area of upper Citarum watershed. Phytoremediation ponds constructed in the demosite demonstrated their ability to improve water quality through turbidity reduction up to 64%, 76%, 68%, 92%, and 88%, for Lemna, Landoltia, Salvinia, Pistia, and Eichhornia respectively. Understanding and taking into account community characteristics will greatly assist ecohydrology concept implementation around ecohydrology demonstration site in Saguling catchment area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEichhornia 3aLandoltia 3aLemna 3aPistia 3aSalvinia 3aclimate change 3adrought 3aecosystems 3ahydrobiology 3ahydrologic cycle 3aphytoremediation 3arisk 3ariver water 3asediments 3asoil erosion 3astakeholders 3atransportation 3atropics 3aturbidity 3awater flow 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3aIndonesia 0aCommunity participation 0aEcohydrology demosite 0aOnline monitoring 0aModelling1 aApip, 1 aFakhrudin, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0751-99831 aYogaswara, Herry1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1413-04230 tInternational journal of ecohydrology & hydrobiology.g2021 July, v. 21, no. 3 p.501-515dElsevier B.V.aEuropean Regional Centre for Ecohydrology of the Polish Academy of ScienceswJournal:2195x1642-35937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecohyd.2021.08.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02524naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245011800167300001300285520135100298592002801649650001101677650001101688650002201699650001301721650001601734650002101750650001701771650001001788650002201798650001301820700001401833700002001847700001901867700001601886700001801902700001801920773008301938856008402021852000902105655001202114IND60602988020221120190241.0180712e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060298802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2015.06.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Yiseul10aElectrochemically deposited Fe2O3 nanorods on carbon nanofibers for free-standing anodes of lithium-ion batteries  ap. 9-17.  aFe2O3 nanorod/carbon nanofiber (CNF) composites were prepared by the electrochemical deposition of Fe2O3 on a web of CNFs, which was then used as a free-standing anode. The conductive, three-dimensional structure of the CNF web allowed for the electrodeposition of the Fe2O3 nanorods, while its high conductivity made it possible to use the composite as a free-standing electrode in lithium-ion batteries. In addition, it was easy and cheap to fabricate by a simplification of a process of cell preparation. The nanorod-like Fe2O3 structures could only be electrodeposited on the CNFs; flake-like Fe2O3 was formed on flat conductive glass substrates. It can be attributed to the different growth mechanism of Fe2O3 on the CNFs because of the large number of reaction sites on the CNFs, differences in the precursor concentration and diffusivity within the CNF web. The formation of aggregates of the Fe2O3 particles on thicker CNFs also indicated that the CNFs had determined the Fe2O3 growth mechanism. The synthesised Fe2O3/CNF composite electrode exhibited stable rate capacities at different current densities. This suggested that CNF-based composite did not exhibit the intrinsic disadvantages of Fe2O3. Finally, carbon coatings were deposited on the Fe2O3/CNF composites to further improve their electronic conductivity and rate capability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acarbon 3acarbon nanofibers 3acoatings 3adiffusivity 3aelectrochemistry 3aferric oxide 3aglass 3alithium batteries 3ananorods1 aOh, Misol1 aPark, Jung-Soo,1 aBaek, Seong-Ho1 aKim, Minsun1 aKim, Soonhyun1 aKim, Jae Hyun0 tCarbon.g2015 Nov., v. 94 p.9-17dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2015.06.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02704naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245015600166300001600322520126800338592002801606650001001634650001601644650002001660650002301680650001601703650002401719650001801743650002101761650002301782650002101805650003001826650001401856650002901870650001301899653001901912653002301931653002101954653001901975700001301994700001602007773012802023856008602151852000902237655001202246IND60759939420221119125759.0220917e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075993942DNAL7 a10.1080/09712119.2021.19140632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Huan10aExperimental study on the effect of zeolite (clinoptilolite) on the growth performance, nutrient digestibility, and faecal microbiota of finishing pigs  ap. 154-157.  aThe aim of this study was conducted to determine the clinoptilolite in diets as a growth promoter on the growth performance, nutrient digestibility, and faecal microflora in finishing pigs. A total of 180 finishing pigs [(Landrace × Yorkshire) × Duroc; 50.20 ± 1.92 kg] were used in 84 days in experimental feeding trials. There were 12 replication pens in each treatment, with 5 pigs/pen (three barrows and two gilts). Dietary treatment groups were as follows: (1) basal diet (CON), (2) CON + 0.05% clinoptilolite (T1), (3) CON + 0.1% clinoptilolite (T2). On day 84, there was a linear increase in body weight (BW) (P < 0.05) of finishing pigs fed diets supplemented with clinoptilolite. During day 35–84 and overall experimental period, increasing the concentration of clinoptilolite linearly improved the average daily gain (ADG) (P < 0.05) and gain: feed ratio (G/F) (P < 0.05). The clinoptilolite treatments reduced Escherichia. coli (P < 0.05) counts compared with CON treatment. And, no significant effect was found in any treatments on nutrient digestibility (P > 0.05). In conclusion, the dietary supplementation with clinoptilolite has been shown to improve growth performance and gut health in finishing pigs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDuroc 3aEscherichia 3aanimal research 3aaverage daily gain 3abody weight 3adietary supplements 3adigestibility 3adigestive system 3agrowth performance 3agrowth promotion 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alandraces 3anutritional intervention 3azeolites 0aClinoptilolite 0agrowth performance 0aEscherichia coli 0afinishing pigs1 aYin, Jia1 aKim, In-ho,0 tJournal of applied animal research.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 49, no. 1 p.154-157dTaylor & FranciswJournal:11632x0974-18447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09712119.2021.19140633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03067naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245009500164300001600259520134600275592002801621650002101649650002701670650002701697650002601724650002601750650002901776650001201805650001301817650001901830650001501849650001401864650002001878650001701898650001701915650001701932650001601949650001401965650001501979650002801994650001102022650001802033650001402051650001702065650002102082700005402103700001902157700001202176700001602188700001902204700002202223700001502245700002102260773009002281856008502371852000902456655001202465IND60687257420221119172556.0200601e20200815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068725742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2020.03.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Yuhao10aEnhanced antibacterial activity of magnetic biochar conjugated quaternary phosphonium salt  ap. 360-369.  aMicrobial contamination in water remains a global issue in threatening human health. Although current disinfection methods can effectively control microbial contamination, the formation of harmful disinfection byproducts is increasingly questioned. Towards this goal, a facile, green and low-priced bacteriocide - magnetic biochar/quaternary phosphonium salt (MBQ) - was developed using precipitation of iron oxide on biochar followed by ion exchange with quaternary phosphonium salt (QPS). Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus - were used as model pathogens to quantify the antibacterial activity and to elucidate the antibacterial mechanism. MBQ was an effective antimicrobial agent against both pathogenic bacteria. The controllable release of QPS and magnetic recovery of MBQ favored antibacterial reuse. Significant disruption of membrane led to the inactivation of bacteria, resulting from the loss of cell membrane integrity and permeability. The induced oxidative damage inhibited the essential cell metabolism. Penetration of MBQ nanoparticles through the cell wall and membrane into the cytoplasm enhanced the biocide effect. Taken together, MBQ, presenting effective, recyclable and long-acting antibacterial properties, has a promising application in bacterial decontamination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aanti-infective agents 3aantibacterial properties 3abiochar 3abiocides 3acell membranes 3acell walls 3acytoplasm 3adecontamination 3adisinfection 3ahuman health 3aion exchange 3airon oxides 3amagnetism 3ametabolism 3amicrobial contamination 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3apathogens 3apermeability 3avirulent strains1 aWang, Fang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9986-09481 aSheng, Hongjie1 aXu, Min1 aLiang, Ying1 aBian, Yongrong1 aHashsham, Syed A.1 aJiang, Xin1 aTiedje, James M.0 tCarbon.g2020 Aug. 15, v. 163 p.360-369dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2020.03.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02347naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002300152245007100175300001800246500001500264520107200279592002801351650002301379650002501402650002401427650003301451650002301484650001201507650001501519650001801534650003201552650001601584650001001600653002701610653001801637700002301655700002401678700002301702773013601725856005501861852000901916655001201925IND4468493720221118174659.0120517e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446849372DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.2012.02952.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCiccarone, Claudio10aQualitative survey of fungi isolated from wine‐aging environment  ap. 1138-1143.  a2019-12-06  aThe main topic of this paper is the study of the qualitative composition of fungal population in some cellar environments: superficial and inner layer of oak barrels, wall surfaces and aging wine. In addition, the influence of age of barrels and winery climatic conditions on fungal populations was evaluated. Two selected types of cellars were studied (a ground level and climate‐controlled cellar‐industrial winery and an unconditioned underground cellar‐family owned winery); 142 different strains were isolated and then identified through a morphology‐based method. Wood inner layer was characterised by the presence of few oak‐specialised endophytes (Trichoderma viride, Acremonium strictum and Cladosporium cladosporioides), whereas some strains of Aspergillus spp. and Penicillium spp. (principally Aspergillus nidulans, Aspergillus oryzae, Penicillium glabrum and Penicillium aurantiogriseum) connected with humidity and pollution were isolated. Aspergillus spp. and Penicillium spp. were isolated also in wall and barrel surfaces and in aging wine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus oryzae 3aAspergillus nidulans 3aAcremonium strictum 3aCladosporium cladosporioides 3aTrichoderma viride 3asurveys 3awine aging 3awine industry 3aPenicillium aurantiogriseum 3aoak barrels 3afungi 0aAspergillus nidulellus 0aHypocrea rufa1 aPetruzzi, Leonardo1 aBevilacqua, Antonio1 aSinigaglia, Milena0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2012 June, v. 47, no. 6 p.1138-1143dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0950-54237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2621.2012.02952.x  aDNAL 7aarticle01994naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100003000145245009900175300001600274520084400290592002801134650003401162650002301196650002101219650001501240650000901255650002101264700001801285700001901303700001801322700001701340700002301357700002101380773014301401856007901544852000901623655001201632IND60312934120221120041037.0150714e20141114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6031293412DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12594372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVelasco-Velez, Juan-Jesus14aThe structure of interfacial water on gold electrodes studied by x-ray absorption spectroscopy  ap. 831-834.  aThe molecular structure of the electrical double layer determines the chemistry in all electrochemical processes. Using x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), we probed the structure of water near gold electrodes and its bias dependence. Electron yield XAS detected at the gold electrode revealed that the interfacial water molecules have a different structure from those in the bulk. First principles calculations revealed that ~50% of the molecules lie flat on the surface with saturated hydrogen bonds and another substantial fraction with broken hydrogen bonds that do not contribute to the XAS spectrum because their core-excited states are delocalized by coupling with the gold substrate. At negative bias, the population of flat-lying molecules with broken hydrogen bonds increases, producing a spectrum similar to that of bulk water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3achemical structure 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3agold 3ahydrogen bonding1 aWu, Cheng Hao1 aPascal, Tod A.1 aWan, Liwen F.1 aGuo, Jinghua1 aPrendergast, David1 aSalmeron, Miquel0 tScience.g2014 Nov. 14, v. 346, no. 6211 p.831-834dAmerican Association for the Advancement of SciencewJournal:jnl44791x0036-80757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.12594373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02737naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003000140245015200170520141200322592002801734650002101762650001401783650002901797650002201826650001001848650001501858650002201873650000901895650002801904650001401932650002801946650001101974651001301985651001001998700002902008700001802037700002802055700002202083773012702105856007402232852000902306655001202315IND60652871520221121235353.0190713e20190321xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065287152DNAL7 a10.3390/su110617222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerreira, Inês  de Abreu12aA Proposed Index of the Implementation and Maturity of Circular Economy Practices—The Case of the Pulp and Paper Industries of Portugal and Spain  aHigh industrial development, new consumption habits, and population growth have led to a discussion, in the various sectors of society, about resource scarcity, pollutant emissions, and waste generation. As a result, and in opposition to the linear economic model in which products are eliminated after production and consumption, a new business model emerged, called the &ldquo;The Circular Economy&rdquo;. This model is based on reuse, recovery, recycling, and repairing during the design and use cycle of a product. This research intends to make a study of the circular economy in the pulp and paper industries of Portugal and Spain. This sector was chosen because, in addition to representing about 2.5% of Portugal&rsquo;s industrial production, it has made significant efforts to promote environmentally sustainable development. Therefore, this research intends to present the situation of the pulp and paper sector within the circular economy, making an Iberian comparison between the years 2011 and 2015. This comparison is made through the development of a comparative index based on the results of some environmental indicators. According to the research carried out, the pulp and paper sector in Portugal was about 26% higher in the implementation of the circular economy than the same sector in Spain in 2015, with the peculiarity that this difference has been decreasing in the last five years.  aPublisher supplied data 3acircular economy 3aemissions 3aenvironmental indicators 3aindustrialization 3apaper 3apollutants 3apopulation growth 3apulp 3apulp and paper industry 3arecycling 3asustainable development 3awastes 3aPortugal 3aSpain1 ade Castro Fraga, Manuel 1 aGodina, Radu 1 aSouto Barreiros, Marta 1 aCarvalho, Helena 0 tSustainability.g2019 Mar. 21, v. 11, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su110617223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01822naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100003600145245010200181300001600283520079000299592002801089650001101117650001201128650002301140650001201163650003401175700002101209700002201230700002501252773014301277856007901420852000901499655001201508IND60312934220221120031415.0150714e20141114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6031293422DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12596622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartínez-Martínez, Antonio J.10aDirected ortho-meta′- and meta-meta′-dimetalations: A template base approach to deprotonation  ap. 834-837.  aThe regioselectivity of deprotonation reactions between arene substrates and basic metalating agents is usually governed by the electronic and/or coordinative characteristics of a directing group attached to the benzene ring. Generally, the reaction takes place in the ortho position, adjacent to the substituent. Here, we introduce a protocol by which the metalating agent, a disodium-monomagnesium alkyl-amide, forms a template that extends regioselectivity to more distant arene sites. Depending on the nature of the directing group, ortho-meta′ or meta-meta′ dimetalation is observed, in the latter case breaking the dogma of ortho metalation. This concept is elaborated through the characterization of both organometallic intermediates and electrophilically quenched products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamides 3abenzene 3achemical reactions 3aprotons 3astandard operating procedures1 aKennedy, Alan R.1 aMulvey, Robert E.1 aO’Hara, Charles T.0 tScience.g2014 Nov. 14, v. 346, no. 6211 p.834-837dAmerican Association for the Advancement of SciencewJournal:jnl44791x0036-80757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.12596623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03644naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006300145245007000208300001600278500002000294520216900314592002802483596008502511596004102596650001502637650001502652650002702667650002402694650002402718650002502742650002202767650001302789650001802802650001402820650001002834650001102844650002102855650003302876650002102909700006202930773011802992856007903110852000903189655001203198IND60688053320221122192824.0200407e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068805332DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2435.135212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoliveres, Santiago1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9661-719210aDual community assembly processes in dryland biocrust communities  ap. 877-887.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBiocrusts are critical components of drylands where they regulate a wide range of ecosystem functions, however, their response to the world‐wide phenomenon of shrub encroachment and to livestock grazing, the most extensive land use in drylands, is not well studied. Grazing by livestock and increases in shrub cover could influence biocrust communities directly via trampling or shading, or indirectly, by altering biotic interactions amongst biocrust taxa. The extent of these changes in biocrust cover, diversity and composition are poorly known. We used linear models and structural equation modelling to examine the direct effects of grazing and shrubs on biocrust community composition and the indirect effects mediated by changes in species interactions. Biocrust richness and cover increased with increasing shrub cover at the site level. This pattern occurred despite the negative response we found (lower cover and richness) under shrub patches versus open areas, which was consistent irrespective of the grazing level. Functional diversity and evenness were similar between shrubs and open at low grazing intensity, but at high grazing functional diversity was greater in the open. Competition between biocrust species was an important driver of their community assembly irrespective of shrub cover, grazing intensity or patch type. Structural equation models showed that the effects of grazing and shrub cover on functional evenness, functional diversity and richness were controlled by biotic interactions within the shrub microsites. In the open, however, these effects were either direct or mediated by changes in cover. Biocrust cover, species richness and functional diversity increase with shrub cover at the site scale, despite the negative effects at the microsite level. We demonstrate here that drivers of community assembly differ markedly at small spatial scales. Though biocrust communities were directly driven by environmental filtering in the open, biotic interactions played a fundamental role in their assembly when growing beneath shrubs.

FD can be influenced by environmental, genetic, and nutrient factors. It is worth understanding the inheritance patterns and influencers of FD in layers for further improvement of feather quality. In the present study, tail and neck feather coverage of White Leghorn (WL) and Rhode Island Red (RIR) hens were recorded to evaluate FD. The genetic parameters of FD and their impact on the production performance were estimated. The heritability of the tail and neck FD for White Leghorn is 0.22 and 0.09, respectively, and the genetic correlation between them is 0.40. The heritability of neck FD of Rhode Island Red is 0.27. FD had a limited influence on egg production. Collectively, FD is influenced by many factors, including genetic factors, appropriate breeding strategies, and improved feeding environments, which are necessary to reduce FD in laying hens.  aThis research was conducted with the financial support of Beijing Innovation Team of the Modern Agro-industry Technology Research System [Project No. BAIC04-2020].  aPublisher supplied data  a.

Phagocytes are thus prime therapeutic targets to control inflammatory events associated to ROS production. Nowadays, there is a growing interest for the use of polyphenols to modulate the inflammatory response. The aim of this work was to study the antioxidant effect of NDS27, a highly water-soluble form of the polyphenolic molecule curcumin, on in vitro stimulated equine PMNs and human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60). NDS27 was either pre-incubated with cells and eliminated before their activation (intracellular effect) or let in the medium (extracellular effect). Our results indicate that NDS27 significantly and dose-dependently (10⁻⁶M–10⁻⁴M) inhibited the ROS production in both cell types without affecting their viability. NDS27 was able to cross and interact with cell membrane, especially for HL-60 cells, while we observed a better intracellular antioxidant effect with PMNs. The activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO) released by PMNs and HL-60 cells, was decreased by NDS27, but more efficiently for PMNs. These results suggested that the greater efficiency of NDS27 in PMNs is due to an inhibitory effect on cells which are more mature for ROS production, probably by targeting the enzymes implied in respiratory burst like MPO. The modulatory effect of NDS27 on the oxidant activity of cells involved in immune and inflammatory responses opens perspectives for a therapeutic control of pathologies with excessive inflammatory reactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3acell membranes 3acurcumin 3ahorses 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3aleukemia 3amyeloperoxidase 3aneutrophils 3aoxidants 3apolyphenols 3areactive oxygen species 3aviability 2aAnimals 2aAntioxidantsxpharmacology 2aCell Survivalxdrug effectsximmunology. 2aCurcuminxanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology. 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aHL-60 Cells 2aHorses 2aHumans 2aLeukocytes, Mononuclear 2aNeutrophil Activationxdrug effects 2aNeutrophilsxdrug effectsxenzymologyximmunology. 2aPeroxidasexantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aReactive Oxygen Speciesxmetabolism1 aFranck, Thierry1 aMouithys-Mickalad, Ange1 aDeby-Dupont, Ginette1 aNeven, Philippe1 aSerteyn, Didier0 tChemico-biological interactions.g2013 Jan. 25, v. 201, no. 1-3 p.49-57dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0009-27977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbi.2012.12.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02568naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009900166300001600265520129100281592002801572650001301600650002301613650001101636650000901647650001201656650003701668650001501705650002301720650002501743650001601768650002601784651001301810653002701823653002001850653000901870653002101879700002301900700001501923700001801938773007601956856008102032852000902113655001202122IND60519841520221117204821.0160511e20090509xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051984152DNAL7 a10.2478/s11756-009-0099-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNovák, Viliam14aThe impact of heating on the hydraulic properties of soils sampled under different plant cover  ap. 483-486.  aThe impact of heating on the peristence of water repellency, saturated hydraulic conductivity, and water retention characteristics was examined on soils from both forest and meadow sites in southwest Slovakia shortly after a wet spell. The top 5 cm of meadow soils had an initial water drop penetration time WDPT at 20°C of 457 s, whereas WDPT in the pine forest was 315 s for the top 5 cm and 982 s if only the top 1 cm was measured. Heating soils at selected temperatures of 50, 100, 150, 200, 250 and 300°C caused a marked drop in water drop penetration time WDPT from the initial value at 20°C. However, samples collected in different years and following an imposed cycle of wetting and drying showed much different trends, with WDPT sometimes initially increasing with temperature, followed by a drop after 200–300°C. The impact of heating temperature on the saturated hydraulic conductivity of soil was small. It was found for both the drying and wetting branches of soil water retention curves that an increase in soil water repellency resulted in a drop in soil water content at the same matric potential. The persistence of soil water repellency was strongly influenced by both the sampling site and time of sampling, as it was characterized by the results of WDPT tests.  aPublisher supplied data 3abranches 3aconiferous forests 3adrying 3aheat 3ameadows 3asaturated hydraulic conductivity 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3asoil water retention 3atemperature 3awater repellent soils 3aSlovakia 0ahydraulic conductivity 0aretention curve 0asoil 0awater repellency1 aLichner, Ľubomír1 aZhang, Bin1 aKňava, Karol0 tBiologia.g2009 May 9, v. 64, no. 3 p.483-486dVersitax1336-95637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11756-009-0099-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01092naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245003900159300001800198520015100216592002800367650002300395650001100418650001300429650001200442700001800454700002000472700001600492700002100508700002600529773012900555856007300684852000900757655001200766IND60657726120221121065211.0190816e20051017xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065772612DNAL7 a10.1039/b509398h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMynar, Justin L.10aDoubly-dendronized linear polymers  ap. 5169-5171.  aDoubly-dendronized polymers were synthesized by grafting polybenzyl ether dendrons onto a poly(hydroxy) styrene polymer with polyaliphatic esters.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3aesters 3apolymers 3astyrene1 aChoi, Tae-Lim1 aYoshida, Masaru1 aKim, Victor1 aHawker, Craig J.1 aFréchet, Jean M.

The coordination of noble metal precursors with polyether within the inner HPG core and subsequent in situ reduction enables the formation of well-dispersed and stable PS-capped Au nanoparticles. The inner HPG core is produced via ring opening multibranching polymerization (ROMBP) and subsequently converted into atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) macroinitiators for the controlled growth of polystyrene (PS) arms possessing low polydispersity (PDI < 1.31). An initial investigation into the templating parameters of HPG-b-PS was undertaken by producing templates with different arm numbers (98 and 117) and different PS chain lengths (i.e., molecular weight = 3500–13400 g/mol). It was found that the PS chain length and solvent conditions affect the quality of the resulting PS-capped colloidal Au nanoparticles. This work demonstrates, for the first time, a simple, lower-cost approach for templating nonpolar solvent-soluble PS-capped Au nanoparticles on the order of 10–30 nm in diameter.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3agold 3amolecular weight 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3apolymerization 3apolystyrenes 3asolvents1 aLin, Zhiqun0 tLangmuir.g2016 July 19, v. 32, no. 28 p.7180-7188dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.6b018303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02094naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245014300173300001400316520110000330592002801430650002101458650001501479650001901494650002101513650001101534650002301545650001701568700001801585773008401603856008401687852000901771655001201780IND60602988820221122225525.0180712e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060298882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2015.06.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDi Biase, Emanuela10aMolecular simulation of multi-component adsorption processes related to carbon capture in a high surface area, disordered activated carbon  ap. 27-40.  aWe employ a previously developed model of a high surface area activated carbon, based on a random packing of small fragments of a carbon sheet, functionalized with hydroxyl surface groups, to explore adsorption of water and multicomponent mixtures under conditions representing typical carbon capture processes. Adsorption of water is initialized and proceeds through the growth of clusters around the surface groups, in a process predominantly governed by hydrogen bond interactions. In contrast, energetically favorable locations for carbon dioxide molecules are different from that for water, with the main contribution coming from the Lennard-Jones interactions with the extended surfaces of the fragments. This explains why over a broad range of conditions small amounts of water do not have any substantial impact on adsorption of carbon dioxide and other species in activated carbons. From the studies of various carbon capture processes, the model material shows promising properties for pre-combustion capture due to large capacity at high pressures and other favorable characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3ahydrogen bonding 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3asurface area1 aSarkisov, Lev0 tCarbon.g2015 Nov., v. 94 p.27-40dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2015.06.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03319naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003000150245010200180300001600282520162200298592002801920650001701948650001601965650001201981650002401993650002002017650001402037650002602051650001002077650003502087650002202122650001202144650001402156650005002170650004302220650001302263650000902276650002402285650001502309650001202324651001302336653002802349653001202377653001202389653000902401653003302410653001502443700001702458700002902475700002002504700002002524773010302544856008502647852000902732655001202741IND60538052020221121032108.0190415e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053805202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoinf.2014.11.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNarantsetseg, Amartuvshin10aAssessment of biotic and abiotic factors controlling herbaceous biodiversity in Mongolian steppes  ap. 221-229.  aSpatial patterns of herbaceous biodiversity in Mongolia steppe were examined and explained with biotic and abiotic factors including climate, livestock grazing, and fire disturbance. Vegetation data were collected from 63 sites across different steppe types (i.e., semi-desert, typical, and forb steppes) in 2012 and 2013. Three categorical (three steppe types, burned or not, grazed or not) and three continuous variables (precipitation, vegetation productivity, site-camp distance) were developed from national climate and GIS database of Mongolia and two satellite sensor products: Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation and June-to-August accumulated Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVIJJA). The prescribed factors were utilized to examine single- and multiple-factor effects on biodiversity and community structure, by using correlation, stepwise multiple regression analysis, and ordination. Our results indicate the positive effect of precipitation and fire but negative effect of grazing on biodiversity in our study region. Localized herding effect was recognized to areas less than 1.5km away from the herder's camp sites. Fire, precipitation and productivity (NDVIJJA) were identified as important factors affecting biodiversity of remote regions. Based on the results, we infer that pastureland biodiversity of Mongolia is controlled by region-scale variations of climate and vegetation productivity, but locally modified by intensive livestock grazing pressure with different grazing sensitivity for different steppe types.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3acampgrounds 3aclimate 3acommunity structure 3adata collection 3adatabases 3aenvironmental factors 3aforbs 3ageographic information systems 3agrazing intensity 3aherding 3alivestock 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3apastures 3arain 3aregression analysis 3asatellites 3asteppes 3aMongolia 0aHerbaceous biodiversity 0aClimate 0aGrazing 0aFire 0aMultiple regression analysis 0aOrdination1 aKang, Sinkyu1 aLkhamsuren, Bolor-Erdene1 aJang, Keunchang1 aKo, Dongwook W.0 tEcological informatics.g2015 Sept., v. 29 p.221-229dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2190x1574-95417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2014.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02808naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245010700169300001600276520149600292592002801788650001201816650001101828650001301839650001001852650001401862650001401876650001401890650001001904651001101914653001901925653001801944653001801962653001801980653001301998653001902011653002302030653001402053653001202067700002602079700001802105700002002123773010602143856008002249852000902329655001202338IND60622270420221122211107.0181124e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062227042DNAL7 a10.1177/09596836080917982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRossetti, Dilce F.10aPalaeodrainage on Marajó Island, northern Brazil, in relation to Holocene relative sea-level dynamics  ap. 923-934.  aA large area in northeastern Marajó Island, northern Brazil, has been characterized geomorphologically, applying information acquired from Landsat imagery. This study was combined with detailed sedimentologic analysis of continuous cores, which provided a record of depositional settings developed in this area through the Holocene. The results revealed well-preserved, meandering to anastomosed drainage networks of wide palaeochannels that were superimposed by a narrower palaeochannel system. In both cases, the sedimentary record consists of sands, heterolithic deposits and muds, locally rich in plant debris. The strata are organized into fining upward successions that reach approximately 18 m thick in the wide channels and 4 m thick in the narrow channels. Sedimentary features suggestive of a coastal location for the wider palaeochannels and reworking of sediments by tidal currents include the prevalence of well to moderately sorted, rounded to sub-rounded, fine- to medium-grained sands displaying foreset packages separated by mud couplets, suggestive of tidal cycles. The data presented herein point to a rise in relative sea level reaching the Lake Arari area during the early to late/mid Holocene. This event was followed by a relative sea level drop. Tectonics seem to have contributed to an overall lowering in relative sea level in the study area since the mid-Holocene, which does not follow the same pattern recorded in other areas along the northern Brazilian coast.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3acoasts 3adrainage 3alakes 3asea level 3asediments 3atectonics 3atides 3aBrazil 0aRemote sensing 0ageomorphology 0asedimentology 0apalaeochannel 0aHolocene 0aMarajó Island 0arelative sea level 0atectonics 0aBrazil.1 aValeriano, Márcio M.1 aGóes, Ana M.1 aThales, Marcelo0 tHolocene.g2008 Sept., v. 18, no. 6 p.923-934dSAGE PublicationswJournal:J000001502x0959-68367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836080917983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02865naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245015100168520105000319592002801369650001801397650001801415650001601433650002701449650002201476650002001498650004101518650001801559650001201577650001001589650004001599650002001639650002101659650002601680650002801706650001901734650002501753650002101778650001601799653003401815653001701849653002901866653001801895653002201913700001701935700001301952700001801965700001901983700001802002700001602020700001702036700001902053773011202072856008202184852000902266655001202275IND60749389020221117223339.0211017e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074938902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2021.1047032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Ping-chuan10aBurdock fructooligosaccharide as an α-glucosidase inhibitor and its antidiabetic effect on high-fat diet and streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice  aBurdock roots are rich in inulin-type burdock fructooligosaccharide (BFO).

BFO reduced fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels, relieved rapid weight loss, and improved glucose tolerance after six weeks of treatment. In addition, BFO reduced serum triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), and nitric oxide synthetase (NOS) levels, while increasing superoxide dismutase (SOD) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. BFO also reduced islet, liver, and kidney damage. Based on these findings, BFO possesses potent antidiabetic effects on diabetic mice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArctium lappa 3ablood glucose 3ablood serum 3afructooligosaccharides 3aglucose tolerance 3aglycemic effect 3ahigh density lipoprotein cholesterol 3ahigh fat diet 3akidneys 3aliver 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3amalondialdehyde 3amolecular weight 3anitric oxide synthase 3areactive oxygen species 3astreptozotocin 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atriacylglycerols 3aweight loss 0aBurdock fructooligosaccharide 0aAntidiabetic 0aα-Glucosidaseinhibitors 0aHyperglycemia 0aDiabetes mellitus1 aShao, Tai-li1 aHan, Jun1 aLiu, Chun-yan1 aWang, Guo-dong1 aHe, Shu-guang1 aXu, Shi-xia1 aNian, Si-hui1 aChen, Kao-shan0 tJournal of functional foods.g2021 Nov., v. 86 p.104703-dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2021.1047033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03187naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245010800172300001400280520186200294592002802156650001602184650002202200650001202222650001302234650001402247650003302261650002102294650001602315650001902331650001502350651001002365653001602375653001102391653001202402653001402414653002502428653001902453700002102472700002202493700002002515773010002535856008502635852000902720655001202729IND60538052320221121032227.0190415e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053805232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoinf.2014.11.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStafford, Richard12aA biologically relevant rapid quantification of physical and biological stress profiles on rocky shores  ap. 43-48.  aDifferent combinations and intensities of physical (e.g. thermal) and biological (e.g. competition or predation) stress operate on organisms in different locations. Variation in these stresses can occur over small to medium spatial scales (cm to 10s of metres) in heterogeneous environments such as rocky shores, due to differences in sun and wave exposure, shore topography and/or recruitment. In this study we demonstrate how simple measurements can be taken that represent physical and biological stresses (stress profiles) in a given location. Using a bootstrapped principal component analysis, we identified significantly different stress profiles at four sites separated by only 10s to 100s of metres on the Shek O peninsula in Hong Kong. We then measured response to thermal stress, as determined by detachment temperature, in the limpet Cellana grata (which is known to be a sensitive indicator species to thermal stress) from each location. Significant differences in stress profile between locations were also seen in thermal stress tolerance of limpets from those locations. At locations where the major stresses are likely to be more physical or less biological in nature (e.g. southerly facing aspect or lower density of grazers), the mean detachment temperature was higher, whereas detachment temperature was lower at sites with more biological or less physical stress. This method is, therefore, able to determine biologically meaningful differences in stress profiles over small to medium spatial scales, and demonstrates that localised adaptation (i.e. post planktonic settlement) or acclimation of species may occur in response to these different stress profiles. The technique can be adapted to different environments and smaller or larger spatial scales as long as the stress experienced by the study species is relevant to these scales.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacclimation 3aindicator species 3alimpets 3aplankton 3apredation 3aprincipal component analysis 3astress tolerance 3atemperature 3athermal stress 3atopography 3aChina 0aRocky shore 0aLimpet 0aCellana 0aHong Kong 0aEnvironmental stress 0aClimate change1 aNg, Terence P.T.1 aWilliams, Gray A.1 aDavies, Mark S.0 tEcological informatics.g2015 Jan., v. 25 p.43-48dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2190x1574-95417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2014.11.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03690naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245009400170300001600264520153200280536047201812592002802284596013502312596005402447596005702501650003202558650001502590650001002605650001502615650003002630650001402660650004302674650001302717650005202730653001402782653001402796653001502810653002002825653001402845700001702859700001502876700001802891700001902909700001902928700001902947773012402966856008503090852000903175655001203184IND60694447420221121060936.0200513e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069444742DNAL7 a10.1080/00218839.2018.15179992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Byounghee10aDetection of chronic bee paralysis virus using ultra-rapid PCR and nested ultra-rapid PCR  ap. 133-140.  aThe chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV), which causes paralysis in bees, is very difficult to visually differentiate from other pathogens causing symptoms of paralysis. In addition, low numbers of viral gene molecules are difficult to detect. Therefore, this study was conducted to develop an ultra-rapid quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and nested PCR method for specifically detecting CBPV. This method is based on rapid and precise quantification of the RNA virus CBPV, using ultra-rapid reverse transcription PCR and nested PCR to overcome difficulties in detecting low numbers of viral gene molecules. Under optimal conditions, CBPV-specific ultra-rapid PCR confirmed that 1.0 × 10⁸ CBPV-specific genes could be detected in 4 min and 17 s, and 1.0 × 10² CBPV-specific genes could be detected in 11 min and 16 s. The detection of 1.0 × 10² CBPV-specific genes was conducted by nested PCR using the inner primer set CBPV-NF/NR. High-sensitivity detection was demonstrated by confirming that the PCR product for the initial template of 1.0 × 10° CBPV-specific gene was detectable. The CBPV-specific ultra-rapid quantitative PCR and nested PCR methods are applicable for infected honey bee samples to rapidly and accurately detect low numbers of viral gene molecules. This method can be used on-site where the infected sample is collected as well as in the laboratory. This method may also be applied to detect for other honey bee pathogens with a suitable primer for each pathogen.  aThis work was supported by Korea Institute of Planning and Evaluation for Technology in Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (IPET) through Advanced Production Technology Development Program (115102-03).

It is a summary of the outcomes of the extensive discussion which took place during the workshop “Beyond Adsorption-II: new perspectives and challenges for nanoporous carbons,” organized as a satellite event to the International Carbon Conference on July 20th , 2019 in New York. It is not our intention to provide a tutorial on the applications, characterization or performance testing of porous carbons; we would rather like to focus on the controversy of the results and phenomena, on the explanation of findings, and on raising concerns to the growing carbon-researching scientific community about the importance of understanding the features of nanoporous carbons by choosing an appropriate characterization technique that will bring meaningful information. We want to emphasize that nanoporous carbons have unique features ensuring them making a marked advance in science and technology. Even though recent studies have shown their potential in various emerging applications, the origin of such performance is not yet well understood. Thus, scientists are encouraged to focus on a precise characterization of porous carbons using a set of complementary techniques for triggering future technological developments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarbon 3aenergy 3ananopores 3aphotocatalysis 3aNew York 0aNanoporous carbons 0aCharacterization 0aEnergy storage 0aCatalysis 0aSurface chemistry 0aDefects1 aArmstrong, Phillip A.1 aBandosz, Teresa J.1 aBéguin, François,1 aCarvalho, Ana P.1 aCelzard, Alain1 aFrąckowiak, Elżbieta,1 aGilarranz, Miguel A.1 aLászló, Krisztina1 aMatos, Juan1 aPereira, M.

Pursuing the changing monsoon history and its impact in this environment-sensitive area is a key for understanding the climatic changes. Here, we present the initial results from core sediments in Nam Co, central Tibet, to elucidate the Holocene environment changes in this area. The studied lake (Nam Co) is the second largest lake, with an elevation of 4718 m, water area of 2015 km² and catchment area of 10 610 km². By using echo-seismic profiling and hydro-echosounding, we investigated the bathymetric distribution of the whole lake. One 332 cm long PISTON core was successfully taken in the east part of the lake at 60 m water depth. Twelve AMS ¹⁴C dates from top to bottom of this core established a good time sequence. TOC, TN, n-alkanes, grain size, clay minerals, Fe/Mn, Sr/Ba and CaCO₃ content were analysed with sampling intervals from 1 cm to 10 cm. Results showed that since 8400 yr BP, the environment changes in this region indicate three stages. The early stage (8400—6900 yr BP) was characterized by slight shifting from warm to cold with a cold-dry interval at 8100—7800 yr BP. The middle stage was from 6900 to 2900 yr BP, during which climate changed from warm-humid to cold-dry. However, around 2900 yr BP, the climate once was slightly cold but strongly dry. The late stage, from 2900 yr BP to present, was characterized by a general tendency toward cold-dry: the first temperature decline was around 1700—1500 yr BP, following which temperature increased once, before decreasing again around 600—300 yr BP, which might be the result of the `Little Ice Age'.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkanes 3abarium 3acalcium carbonate 3acarbon 3aclay minerals 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acold 3airon 3alakes 3amanganese 3amonsoon season 3aradionuclides 3asediments 3astrontium 3atemperature 3awatersheds 3aChina 0aTibetan Plateau 0aNam Co 0alake sediments 0ageochemistry 0aenvironmental changes 0a8.4 ka 0aChina.1 aYanhong Wu, 1 aJunbo Wang, 1 aXiao, Lin,1 aJianting Ju, 1 aManping Xie, 1 aMinghui Li, 1 aMäusbacher, Roland,1 aSchwalb, Antje1 aDaut, Gerhard0 tHolocene.g2008 Aug., v. 18, no. 5 p.831-839dSAGE PublicationswJournal:J000001502x0959-68367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836080918013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03551naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024001700117040001800134100002400152245012900176300001600305506017300321520202000494650001502514650002302529650002102552650001602573650002602589650001702615700002202632700002002654700002102674773010402695856011402799956025802913961000903171852000903180655001203189IND60539414320221214224708.0160816e20131230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053941432DNAL7 a10113/53941432hdl7 a2889472aris  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhitelock, Derek P.10aMaster trash system PM2.5 emission factors and rates for cotton gins: Method 201A combination PM10 and PM2.5 sizing cyclones  ap. 489-499.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aThis report is part of a project to characterize cotton gin emissions from the standpoint of stack sampling. In 2006, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized and published a more stringent standard for particulate matter with nominal diameter less than or equal to 2.5 μm (PM2.5). This created an urgent need to collect additional cotton gin emissions data to address current regulatory issues, because current EPA AP-42 cotton gin PM2.5 emission factors did not exist. The objective of this study was the development of PM2.5 emission factors for cotton gin master trash systems based on the EPA-approved stack sampling methodology, Method 201A. The project plan included sampling seven cotton gins across the Cotton Belt. Five of the seven gins had master trash systems. In terms of capacity, the five gins were typical of the industry, averaging 37.1 bales/h during testing. Some test runs were excluded from the test averages because they failed to meet EPA Method 201A test criteria. Also, other test runs, included in the analyses, had cotton lint fibers that collected in the ≤ 10 μm and/or ≤ 2.5 μm samples. This larger lint material can impact the reported emissions data, but EPA Method 201A does not suggest methods to account for these anomalies. Average measured master trash system PM2.5 emission factor based on the five tests (13 total test runs) was 0.0042 kg/227-kg bale (0.0093 lb/500-lb bale). The master trash system average emission factors for PM10 and total particulate were 0.036 kg/bale (0.080 lb/bale) and 0.143 kg/bale (0.314 lb/bale), respectively. The master trash system PM2.5 emission rate from test averages ranged from 0.081 to 0.33 kg/h (0.18-0.73 lb/h). System average PM10 emission factors were higher and system average total particulate emission factors were lower than those currently published in EPA AP-42. The ratios of master trash system PM2.5 to total particulate, PM2.5 to PM10, and PM10 to total particulate were 2.9, 11.5, and 25.5%, respectively. 3acotton gin 3acyclone separators 3aemissions factor 3alint cotton 3aparticulate emissions 3aparticulates1 aBuser, Michael D.1 aBoykin, J.

However, the conventional methods used in evaluating ecosystem health of wetlands largely rely on field observational data which often do not provide spatio-temporal perspectives to the assessment. Geospatial assessment of remotely sensed data has enormous potentials for assessing ecosystem health of wetlands at different temporal and spatial scales. This study employed geospatial techniques to assess ecosystem health of Densu Delta, Sakumo II and Muni-Pomadze Ramsar Sites over a 32-year period using structure, function and resilience indicators. Landsat satellite images of 1985, 2002 and 2017 were obtained for this study. Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was used to weight the indicators. The importance of the ecosystem health indicators in decreasing order was as follows: Structure > Resilience > Function. The findings of the study also indicated that ecosystem health of the wetlands progressively deteriorated in 2002 and 2017 compared to the reference year of 1985. In 2002, the Densu Delta experienced the least decline (11.8%) from the 1985 state among the three wetlands and Sakumo II recorded the highest deterioration (38.0%). Unlike 2002, in 2017 the health of the Densu Delta experienced the worse deterioration (46.3%) whereas Sakumo II recorded the least decline (26.2%). Ecosystem health of Muni-Pomadze Ramsar Site deteriorated at a similar magnitude, 27.0% and 29.1% in 2002 and 2017, respectively. The critical underlying factor for the degradation of the wetlands is urbanization largely due to increase in human population which led to the expansion of built-up areas in the wetlands, fragmentation of natural land use and land cover (LULC) classes and reduction of vegetation cover.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3acoastal zone management 3aenvironmental health 3ahuman population 3aland use and land cover maps 3aobservational studies 3aremote sensing 3aurban areas 3aurbanization 3avegetation cover 3awetlands 3aGhana 0aEcosystem health indicators 0aFragmentation 0aBuilt-up 0aNDVI 0aNDWI1 aArmah, Frederick Ato1 aAfrifa, Ernest K.A.1 aAheto, Denis Worlanyo1 aOdoi, Justice Odoiquaye1 aAfitiri, Abdul-Rahaman1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3437-16730 tOcean & coastal management.g2020 Aug. 01, v. 193 p.105226-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11975x0964-56917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2020.1052263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04163naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006800145245002900213300001600242500002000258520244700278592002802725596004502753596004502798596002502843650001302868650001502881650002702896650001002923650001002933650001802943650003202961650001102993650001203004650001503016650002003031650002803051650001503079650001403094650001803108650001403126650001203140650002403152700006403176700006503240700005803305700006403363773011803427856007903545852000903624655001203633IND60688054220221122231931.0200407e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068805422DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2435.135042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarthey, Alexandra J.

The realization that host cells and genes are outnumbered by symbiotic microbial cells and their genes has forced us to rethink our focus on ‘individuals’. It is also becoming increasingly clear that the ecology and biology of animals and plants are intimately connected with their microbial partners. In the context of conserving functioning species, such revelatory insights beg the question—what exactly should we be trying to conserve? Here, we review how an understanding of host–microbe interactions can benefit conservation biology. We propose a way forward for conservation biologists, to gather evidence of the potential effects of changes to plant and animal microbiomes, and to incorporate the holobiont concept into applied conservation practice. In humans, microbes influence physiology, health, behaviour and psychology. In animals and plants, microbes similarly influence critically important components of health, communication and (in animals) behaviour. Together, the animal or plant and all of its associated micro‐organisms are termed the holobiont. At the same time, humans are now the strongest evolutionary force on the planet, causing global change at unprecedented scale. We know that microbial diversity in humans has been compromised in urban societies, with a growing list of consequences for health and function. While we still have limited evidence for similar effects in plants and animals, anthropogenic factors that affect diversity are also likely to affect animal and plant microbiomes, with similar associated effects on host function and health. Microbiome research is still in its relative infancy, particularly in its application to plants and animals, yet the tools are becoming more widely available and affordable. Forward‐looking conservation biologists could harness such tools and apply them to the study of plant and animal microbiomes with the goal of understanding which microbiota might be required to ensure future viability of conserved host populations. For now, the precautionary principle applies. We suggest that, to meaningfully and effectively conserve a species, we must also consider how to conserve the bacteria, viruses, fungi and other symbionts intimately associated with that macro‐organism.

While tree seeds are still constantly dispersed by bats and birds, these often do not reach the soil but got stuck in the dense shrubby vegetation. While manual up-rooting of weedy shrubs or tree replantation is too expensive, we tested if burrowing pigs or trampling cattle can enhance proportions of bare soils for fallow restoration. These hypotheses were tested in on-farm experiments at Igarap&eacute;-A&ccedil;u, northeastern Par&aacute;. Soil-opening effects of ten pigs (40 days + nights) and ten oxen (40 overnight stays), respectively, were tested against manual clearing and control on three plots per treatment, respectively. Ground cover percentages of bare soil, weedy shrubs, grasses, and tree species were visually determined in 40 plots/treatment before and directly after treatments, and half a year later (n = 480 samples). Both animal treatments could not really match manual clearing (62%) but pigs reached above 36% bare ground cover, while cattle just 20%. As pigs are almost omnipresent on Amazonian smallholdings and even give a modest economic refund, the use of pigs is recommended to smallholders who want to break up the lush weed layers for the benefit of forest restoration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChiroptera 3abirds 3acanopy 3afallow 3aforest restoration 3aforest succession 3agrasses 3ahumid tropics 3aon-farm research 3aoxen 3apastures 3aseeds 3ashrubs 3asoil 3aswine 3atrampling damage 3atrees 3avegetation 3aweeds 3aAmazonia 3aLatin America1 aKato, Osvaldo  Ryohei1 aWalentowski, Helge 0 tSustainability.g2019 Mar. 21, v. 11, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su110617293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04384naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245011000185300001600295520200100311592002802312650001302340650002102353650002502374650001402399650001302413650001202426650001902438650001202457650001502469650001402484650001402498650001802512650001802530650002802548650002602576650001302602650001402615650004002629650003902669650002302708650004302731650003702774650001102811650004502822650001302867650002402880650004102904650003002945650003702975650002603012650005103038650003603089650002603125650002603151650002603177700002003203700001903223700001703242700002003259700002303279700002003302700002203322700002003344700002003364773011703384856008103501990002303582852000903605655001203614IND60093653020221120110707.0141103e20130225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009365302DNAL7 a232200042pmid7 a10.1016/j.cbi.2012.11.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPorté, Sergio10aAldo–keto reductases in retinoid metabolism: Search for substrate specificity and inhibitor selectivity  ap. 186-194.  aBiological activity of natural retinoids requires the oxidation of retinol to retinoic acid (RA) and its binding to specific nuclear receptors in target tissues. The first step of this pathway, the reversible oxidoreduction of retinol to retinaldehyde, is essential to control RA levels. The enzymes of retinol oxidation are NAD-dependent dehydrogenases of the cytosolic medium-chain (MDR) and the membrane-bound short-chain (SDR) dehydrogenases/reductases. Retinaldehyde reduction can be performed by SDR and aldo–keto reductases (AKR), while its oxidation to RA is carried out by aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDH). In contrast to SDR, AKR and ALDH are cytosolic. A common property of these enzymes is that they only use free retinoid, but not retinoid bound to cellular retinol binding protein (CRBP). The relative contribution of each enzyme type in retinoid metabolism is discussed in terms of the different subcellular localization, topology of membrane-bound enzymes, kinetic constants, binding affinity of CRBP for retinol and retinaldehyde, and partition of retinoid pools between membranes and cytoplasm. The development of selective inhibitors for AKR enzymes 1B1 and 1B10, of clinical relevance in diabetes and cancer, granted the investigation of some structure–activity relationships. Kinetics with the 4-methyl derivatives of retinaldehyde isomers was performed to identify structural features for substrate specificity. Hydrophilic derivatives were better substrates than the more hydrophobic compounds. We also explored the inhibitory properties of some synthetic retinoids, known for binding to retinoic acid receptors (RAR) and retinoid X receptors (RXR). Consistent with its substrate specificity towards retinaldehyde, AKR1B10 was more effectively inhibited by synthetic retinoids than AKR1B1. A RARβ/γ agonist (UVI2008) inhibited AKR1B10 with the highest potency and selectivity, and docking simulations predicted that its carboxyl group binds to the anion-binding pocket.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagonists 3abinding capacity 3abioactive properties 3acytoplasm 3adiabetes 3aenzymes 3ahydrophobicity 3aisomers 3ametabolism 3aoxidation 3areceptors 3aretinaldehyde 3aretinoic acid 3aretinol-binding protein 3asubstrate specificity 3atopology 3avitamin A 2aAlcohol Oxidoreductasesxmetabolism 2aAldehyde Dehydrogenasexmetabolism 2aAldehyde Reductase 2aCell Membranexenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aCytosolxenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aHydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions 2aKinetics 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aReceptors, Retinoic Acidxmetabolism 2aRetinaldehydexmetabolism 2aRetinoid X Receptorsxmetabolism 2aRetinoidsxmetabolism 2aRetinol-Binding Proteins, Cellularxmetabolism 2aStructure-Activity Relationship 2aSubstrate Specificity 2aTretinoinxmetabolism 2aVitamin Axmetabolism1 aXavier Ruiz, F.1 aGiménez, Joan1 aMolist, Iago1 aAlvarez, Susana1 aDomínguez, Marta,1 aAlvarez, Rosana1 ade Lera, Angel R.1 aParés, Xavier,1 aFarrés, Jaume,0 tChemico-biological interactions.g2013 Feb. 25, v. 202, no. 1-3 p.186-194dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0009-27977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbi.2012.11.0143Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02745naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245015900174300001600333520110000349536003101449592002801480596003001508650002401538650001901562650001301581650002101594650001001615650001501625650002301640650001301663651001001676653002301686653002501709653001701734653001501751653001601766653001501782700001801797700002201815700002201837700002901859700002201888700002201910700002301932700002301955700001901978773012401997856008502121852000902206655001202215IND60694447620221121075454.0200513e20190527xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069444762DNAL7 a10.1080/00218839.2018.15416512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRicchiuti, Luciano12aA study in the Abruzzo region on the presence of Paenibacillus larvae spores in honeys indicated underestimation of American foulbrood prevalence in Italy  ap. 416-419.  aAmerican foulbrood (AFB) of Apis mellifera, caused by the bacterial spore former Paenibacillus larvae, is a notifiable disease in Italy and its spread is prevented by burning hives with clinical symptoms. Official epidemiological data indicate a very low number of annual outbreaks in the country, therefore this investigation was carried out to evaluate whether notification to the veterinary authority is omitted, so that AFB transmission from infected apiaries is not prevented. Presence and number of P. larvae spores were analyzed in 122 honey samples, each from a different apiary, collected in the Abruzzo region in years 2014 and 2015. P. larvae spores were found in 40% of the samples and the spore numbers allowed to infer a prevalence of AFB of at least 22.7% among beekeepers, indicating the necessity to improve the surveillance system. Spore numbers were significantly different for honeys produced in different environmental contexts and with varying management practices, suggesting to elucidate the causal relationship between those factors and the presence of P. larvae spores.  aFondo Sanitario Nazionale.  aPublisher supplied data  cFondo Sanitario Nazionale 3aAmerican foul brood 3aApis mellifera 3aapiaries 3abacterial spores 3ahoney 3amonitoring 3anotifiable disease 3aresearch 3aItaly 0aAmerican foulbrood 0aPaenibacillus larvae 0aspore number 0aprevalence 0aenvironment 0amanagement1 aRossi, Franca1 aDel Matto, Ilaria1 aIannitto, Giorgio1 adel Riccio, Angela Lucia1 aPetrone, Domenico1 aRuberto, Giovanni1 aCersini, Antonella1 aDi Domenico, Marco1 aCammà, Cesare0 tJournal of apicultural research.g2019 May 27, v. 58, no. 3 p.416-419dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12840x2078-69137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00218839.2018.15416513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02796naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024001700117024004000134040001800174100001600192245008700208300001400295506017300309520115000482650001301632650000801645650002301653650001401676650001101690650002401701650001201725650001101737650002001748650003101768650001701799700001601816700002101832773009101853856011401944856008602058956020002144961000902344852000902353655001202362IND60539414620221214224428.0160816e20140507xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053941462DNAL7 a10113/53941462hdl7 a2953112aris7 a10.1016/j.jaerosci.2014.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFunk, P.

Their operating cost is almost entirely the financial and environmental cost of the fan energy required to overcome their pressure drop. A novel cyclone design discovered through modeling was reported to have a lower pressure drop than the standard cyclone. Empirical tests were conducted with 30.5 cm diameter cyclones comparing this novel design to the current standard cyclone design at inlet air velocities from 8 to 18 m s-1 using a heterogeneous test material at inlet concentrations from 3 to 75 g m-3. Cyclone exhaust was passed through filters. Laser diffraction particle size distribution analysis of filter catch was used to estimate PM2.5 emissions. Response surface models were used to compare the emissions and cyclone pressure losses of the two designs. While emissions were essentially identical among the cyclone designs, pressure losses were 30% less for the novel cyclone when compared to a standard cyclone of equal diameter and volumetric flow rate. This represents a substantial potential savings in energy. 3aaerosols 3aair 3acyclone separators 3aemissions 3aenergy 3aenergy conservation 3afilters 3amodels 3aoperating costs 3aparticle size distribution 3aparticulates1 aHolt, G.

They can be obtained by the action of enzymes or whole cells on selected substrates, such as diketones. We have studied the enantiospecificities of several fungal (AKR3C1, AKR5F and AKR5G) and human (AKR1B1 and AKR1B10) aldo–keto reductases in the production of α-hydroxy ketones and diols from vicinal diketones. The reactions have been carried out with pure enzymes and with an NADPH-regenerating system consisting of glucose-6-phosphate and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. To ascertain the regio and stereoselectivity of the reduction reactions catalyzed by the AKRs, we have separated and characterized the reaction products by means of a gas chromatograph equipped with a chiral column and coupled to a mass spectrometer as a detector. According to the regioselectivity and stereoselectivity, the AKRs studied can be divided in two groups: one of them showed preference for the reduction of the proximal keto group, resulting in the S-enantiomer of the corresponding α-hydroxy ketones. The other group favored the reduction of the distal keto group and yielded the corresponding R-enantiomer. Three of the AKRs used (AKR1B1, AKR1B10 and AKR3C1) could produce 2,3-butanediol from acetoin. We have explored the structure/function relationships in the reactivity between several yeast and human AKRs and various diketones and acetoin. In addition, we have demonstrated the utility of these AKRs in the synthesis of selected α-hydroxy ketones and diols.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantidepressants 3aNADP-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 3ahumans 3ayeasts 3achromatography 3aacetoin 3aglucose 6-phosphate 2aAlcohol Oxidoreductasesxmetabolism 2aAldehyde Reductase 2aButylene Glycolsxmetabolism 2aCatalysis 2aFungal Proteinsxmetabolism 2aGlucose-6-Phosphatexmetabolism 2aGlucosephosphate Dehydrogenasexmetabolism 2aGlucosidesxmetabolism 2aHumans 2aKetonesxmetabolism 2aKinetics 2aNADPxmetabolism 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPyrimidinonesxmetabolism 2aStereoisomerism 2aStructure-Activity Relationship 2aYeastsxenzymologyxmetabolism. 0aglucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase1 aPorté, Sergio1 aFernández, M.

Thirty pregnant buffaloes were monitored during the transition period and at the beginning of the lactation. Animals were randomly assigned within the two experimental groups considering the calving number and the estimated calving date: primiparous (n = 15) and multiparous buffaloes (n = 15). The buffaloes were monitored every week during the last 30 days of pregnancy, and the first 63 days postpartum. Buffaloes were kept in the same environment condition, and management practices. Multiparous buffaloes, at the postpartum period, showed higher milk fat, protein, lactose, total dry extract production, non-fat dry extract contents, and higher milk urea nitrogen and casein contents than primiparous buffaloes. Primiparous buffaloes showed higher urine pH and hematocrit concentration than the multiparous group at the prepartum period and higher leukocyte and lymphocytes concentrations at the postpartum. During the transition period, primiparous buffaloes exhibited negative interrelationships between metabolic traits and productive performance related to variations in their metabolic status. These results may indicate that multiparous buffaloes fewer sensitive to variations of metabolic status during the transition period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal research 3acasein 3aearly lactation 3ahematocrit 3alactose 3amilk 3amilk fat 3amilk yield 3apH 3apostpartum period 3apregnancy 3aprepartum period 3aurea nitrogen 3aurine 0aCalving order 0aearly lactation 0adairy buffalo 0ametabolic status 0apregnancy 0atransition period1 aSilva, Ricardo Diniz Guerra e1 aAlba, Henry Daniel Ruiz1 aOliveira, Maurício Xavier da Silva1 aCarvalho, Gleidson Giordano Pinto de1 aAraújo, Maria Leonor Garcia Melo Lopes de1 aPina, Douglas dos Santos1 aFreitas Júnior, José Esler de0 tJournal of applied animal research.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 49, no. 1 p.247-256dTaylor & FranciswJournal:11632x0974-18447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09712119.2021.19401883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02637naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245014800162520101600310592002801326650001701354650002401371650004101395650004001436650001801476650001201494650001501506653003101521653001701552653002501569653003601594653000801630653000701638653000701645653001001652653001001662653000901672653000801681653000901689653000801698653000801706653000701714653000801721700001401729700001401743700001501757700001801772700001801790700001401808700001701822700001701839773011201856856008201968852000902050655001202059IND60749389720221117224914.0211017e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074938972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2021.1047112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Chen14aThe effect of probiotic supplementation on lipid profiles in adults with overweight or obesity: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials  aThis meta-analysis aims to elucidate the role of probiotics in regulating the blood lipid profiles of adults with overweight or obesity.The Pubmed, Cochrane Library, Scopus and Web of Science were used to search for relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published before August 2021.

While the policy is dominated by state institutions and frames management under western science protocols, it offers the opportunity to control unregulated activities, restore marine ecosystems and develop management plans which include traditional knowledge. In this article we review the policy implementation process and highlight current opportunities and threats, which if left unattended could jeopardize the policy. Currently, 91 areas have been requested by indigenous communities and are at various stages of the application and implementation process. Current spatial scale status at different levels of application procedure represent nearly 31.959 km² of marine coastal zones. Key challenges of policy implementation relate to differences in worldviews between Indigenous communities and state institutions. Problems also relate to time frames and financial resources for the implementation of the policy and conflict which arises from concerns from non-indigenous artisanal fishers, who have legal access rights to fisheries, under the narrative that new access rights would limit existing livelihood alternatives and increase fishing pressure with the consequent diminishment of resources. Ensuring a legitimate implementation of the policy is a key starting point to enable further recognition of indigenous communities’ rights for self-determination in Chile.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3acoastal zone management 3acoasts 3afisheries 3aindigenous knowledge 3aindigenous peoples 3aissues and policy 3alivelihood 3amarine ecosystems 3atraditional technology 3aChile 0aIndigenous rights 0aHuman-centered 0aMarine biodiversity 0aMarine conservation 0aRight-based management 0aMCAIP 0aSelf-determination1 aSilva, Juan A.1 aGelcich, Stefan0 tOcean & coastal management.g2020 Aug. 01, v. 193 p.105233-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11975x0964-56917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2020.1052333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02248naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100005900138245012500197300001600322500002000338520103400358592002801392596007401420650001501494650001401509650004101523650002001564650001301584650001601597650001001613650001301623700002201636700001701658773013001675856007201805852000901877655001201886IND60688054520221122231651.0200407e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068805452DNAL7 a10.1002/ffj.35642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTruan, Clément1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8605-554410aUnraveling ingredients in complex mixtures by chromatographic spectrum recognition: Application to perfume deformulation  ap. 309-319.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn the past 40 years, progress in GC‐MS and GC‐FID has lent the modern perfume industry powerful tools for determining raw ingredients in fragrances, which is still often manual and based on molecular markers thus subjective and unreliable due to variability and chromatographic challenges. This article presents an alternative approach by introducing the concept of chromatographic spectrum. This approach was evaluated on a commercial database containing molecular composition of 4106 perfumery ingredients and on real and simulated mixtures. Five hundred and seven out of 565 database ingredients classes were differentiated by their chromatographic spectrum against 164 with distinctive markers. The 5 ingredients of a real Eau de Cologne mixture were identified, and their proportions estimated with less than 12% relative error for 4 of them. The usefulness of chromatographic spectra in a deformulation support algorithm is discussed based on the deformulation of 210 simulated mixtures of 5, 10, and 15 ingredients.  aPublisher supplied data  a2015/0555cAssociation Nationale de la Recherche et de la Technologie 3aalgorithms 3adatabases 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agenetic markers 3aindustry 3aingredients 3aodors 3aperfumes1 aPeres, Christophe1 aEngel, Erwan0 tFlavour and fragrance journal.g2020 May, v. 35, no. 3 p.309-319dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938463x0882-57347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ffj.35643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02442naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245010200166300001600268520109200284592002801376650002201404650001901426650001201445650001401457650001001471650002001481650001101501651001701512653001401529653001801543653000901561653001801570653001201588653002701600653002901627653002101656653001401677700002301691700001901714700002501733700001901758773010601777856008001883852000901963655001201972IND60622271020221122234414.0181124e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062227102DNAL7 a10.1177/09596836080935242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEkdahl, Erik J.10aHolocene multidecadal- to millennial-scale hydrologic variability on the South American Altiplano  ap. 867-876.  aPrecipitation on the South American Altiplano varies at a range of temporal scales. A long-term secular increase in moisture availability from the early/mid Holocene to the present, driven by increasing summer insolation resulting from precessional changes in the Earth's orbit, has been documented in earlier studies. However, higher frequency Holocene variability is not yet understood. Here we present high-resolution diatom assemblage data from two small Altiplano lakes, Lago Lagunillas and Lago Umayo, indicating changes in effective moisture in the southern tropical Andes at decadal, centennial and millennial timescales throughout the mid to late Holocene. A strong millennial-scale component, similar in pacing to periods of increased icerafted debris flux in the North Atlantic, is observed in both lake records, which suggests that regional precipitation and North Atlantic climate variability are coupled at these scales. The interpretation of the higher frequency variability is hampered by the small number of high-resolution continental and marine records for comparison.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aHolocene epoch 3aclimate 3ahydrology 3alakes 3asolar radiation 3asummer 3aAndes region 0aAltiplano 0aSouth America 0aPeru 0aLake Titicaca 0adiatoms 0atropical palaeoclimate 0ahydrological variability 0amillennial scale 0aHolocene.1 aFritz, Sherilyn C.1 aBaker, Paul A.1 aRigsby, Catherine A.1 aColey, Kirstin0 tHolocene.g2008 Sept., v. 18, no. 6 p.867-876dSAGE PublicationswJournal:J000001502x0959-68367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836080935243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02274naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245005900165300001600224520130200240592002801542650001501570650001701585650001301602650001901615650001301634650001101647650001601658650001201674700002001686700001901706700002001725773008601745856008401831852000901915655001201924IND60602989820221122111137.0180712e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060298982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2015.06.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarbos, B.10aNanoscale elasticity of highly anisotropic pyrocarbons  ap. 285-294.  aWe report on the elastic properties of high-textured laminar pyrocarbons (PyCs) as obtained at the nanoscale using atomistic simulations on realistic models of the rough laminar (RL) PyC, the regenerative laminar (ReL) PyC, and the ReL PyC heat treated at temperatures up to 1700°C. The purely longitudinal (C11,C12,C66,E1 and ν12) and transverse (C33 and E3) elastic properties of such materials have values of around 50–75% of those found for graphite. Conversely, cross longitudinal-transverse properties (C13,C44,ν13 and ν31) are much larger in PyCs than in graphite (up to around one order of magnitude for ν31). Our results also show that stiffness decreases with the hydrogen content, that longitudinal properties increase with the extent of graphene domains and decrease with the misorientation of the layers, and that transverse and cross properties significantly increase with the amount of interlayer cross-links present in the materials. Comparison to known experimental data indicates that texture effect at superior scales play an important role in the effective macroscopic elasticity constants. Finally, from a materials perspective and in agreement with the structural evolution, the elastic properties of the ReL PyC evolve with heat treatment towards those of the RL PyC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3acrosslinking 3agraphene 3aheat treatment 3ahydrogen 3amodels 3atemperature 3atexture1 aDa Costa, J.-P.1 aVignoles, G.L.1 aLeyssale, J.-M.0 tCarbon.g2015 Nov., v. 94 p.285-294dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2015.06.0603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01157naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002500138245005500163300001800218520028500236592002800521650000800549650002300557650002300580650001700603650002100620700001500641773012900656856007300785852000900858655001200867IND60657727020221121043612.0190816e20051110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065772702DNAL7 a10.1039/b509522k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRanasinghe, Rohan T.10aFluorescence based strategies for genetic analysis  ap. 5487-5502.  aSynthetic chemistry has been central to the design of modern methods of genetic analysis.

This stable coating with a thickness of few nanometers provides, at the same time, stabilization and functionalization of the particles. The polymeric coating consists of a backbone of polydimethylacrylamide (DMA) functionalized with an alkyne monomer that allows the binding of azido modified molecules by Cu(I)-catalyzed azide/alkyne 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition (CuAAC, click chemistry). The thin polymer layer on the surface stabilizes the colloidal suspension whereas the alkyne functions pending from the backbone are available for the reaction with azido-modified proteins. The reactivity of the coating is demonstrated by immobilizing an azido modified anti-mouse IgG antibody on the particle surface. This approach for the covalent binding of antibody to a gold-NPs is applied to the development of gold labels in biosensing techniques.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkynes 3aantibodies 3aazides 3abiosensors 3acoatings 3acolloids 3acomposite polymers 3acopper 3agold 3aimmunoglobulin G 3ananogold1 aSola, Laura1 aPezzullo, Margherita1 aProsperi, Davide1 aColombo, Miriam1 aRiva, Benedetta1 aAvvakumova, Svetlana1 aMorasso, Carlo1 aPicciolini, Silvia1 aChiari, Marcella0 tLangmuir.g2016 July 26, v. 32, no. 29 p.7435-7441dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.6b011423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03607naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006900147245015100216520158500367592002801952650002201980650000802002650001702010650001502027650001902042650000902061650001602070650002002086650001702106650002202123650002802145650001202173650001902185650002302204650001302227650001302240650001302253650002602266650001102292650001602303650003302319650001702352650001102369650001802380650002102398653002302419653002702442653003402469653001702503653002202520653002102542700001602563700002002579700003002599700002102629700003302650700006202683773012202745856008102867852000902948655001202957IND60672950820221121015527.0200121e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067295082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2019.1087162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCharoux, Clémentine M.G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4321-538110aEffect of non-thermal plasma technology on microbial inactivation and total phenolic content of a model liquid food system and black pepper grains  aThe objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of cold plasma technology on the growth and survival rates of vegetative cells and spores, and total phenolic content of black pepper grains. Plasma treatment was carried out using a non-thermal plasma jet system operating at 20 kHz using atmospheric air at a flow of 11 L/min. A model liquid food system and black pepper grains were both inoculated with Bacillus subtilis vegetative cells and spores. The samples were treated at 15 and 30 kV for treatment times of 3–20 min. The plate count method was used to determine colony-forming units for selected storage times at 4 °C i.e. at 1, 24 and 48 h post treatment. The highest log reduction was observed at 24 h post treatment, i.e. 2.92 log reduction. A 1 log reduction was achieved in the case of black pepper inoculated with spores for all selected storage times. No significant differences in total phenolic content were observed between treated and non-treated black pepper samples (p > 0.05). Optical emission spectroscopy was used to detect reactive species likely to be responsible for cell death. Atomic oxygen, atomic nitrogen, hydroxyl radicals, nitrite oxide and nitrate were detected in light emitted from the plasma. Cell membrane damage caused by non-thermal plasma technology was observed using scanning electron microscopy. This study concludes that cold plasma technology has potential for industry application in food processing to reduce microbial loads in liquid food systems and dried foods with limited impact on food quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aair 3ablack pepper 3acell death 3acell membranes 3acold 3adried foods 3afood processing 3afood quality 3ahydroxyl radicals 3aindustrial applications 3aliquids 3amicrobial load 3amodel food systems 3anitrates 3anitrites 3anitrogen 3anonthermal processing 3aoxygen 3aplate count 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aspectroscopy 3aspores 3asurvival rate 3avegetative cells 0aNon-thermal plasma 0aMicrobial inactivation 0aOptical emission spectroscopy 0aFood quality 0aDried ingredients 0aPhenolic content1 aFree, Louis1 aHinds, Laura M.1 aVijayaraghavan, Rajani K.1 aDaniels, Stephen1 aO'Donnell, C.

However, the usage of biomass is accompanied by possible drawbacks, mainly due to limitation of land and water, and competition with food production. In this paper, the analysis concerns so-called second generation biofuels, like Fischer–Tropsch fuels or Substitute Natural Gas which are produced either from wood or from waste biomass. For these biofuels the most promising conversion case is the one which involves production of syngas from biomass gasification, followed by synthesis of biofuels. The thermodynamic efficiency of biofuels production is analyzed and compared using both the direct exergy analysis and the thermo-ecological cost. This analysis leads to the detection of exergy losses in various elements which forms the starting point to the improvement of conversion efficiency. The efficiency of biomass conversion to biofuels is also evaluated for the whole production chain, including biomass cultivation, transportation and conversion. The global effects of natural resources management are investigated using the thermo-ecological cost. The energy carriers' utilities such as electricity and heat are externally generated either from fossil fuels or from renewable biomass. In the former case the production of biofuels not always can be considered as a renewable energy source whereas in the latter case the production of biofuels leads always to the reduction of depletion of non-renewable resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3aelectricity 3aexergy 3afeedstocks 3afood production 3agasification 3aheat 3anatural gas 3anatural resource management 3anonrenewable resources 3aproduction technology 3asynthesis gas 3atransportation 3awood1 aCzarnowska, Lucyna1 aPtasiński, Krzysztof1 aStanek, Wojciech0 tEnergy.g2013 Dec. 1, v. 62 p.95-104dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2013.06.0723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02730naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245006200174300001600236520144100252592002801693650002801721650001501749650001201764650001201776650001601788650001001804650001201814650002201826650001901848653001501867653002801882653001301910653001401923653001801937653003001955653002601985700002102011700001802032773015102050856008602201852000902287655001202296IND60532298620221120082851.0190214e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053229862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2015.08.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaxter, Carling M.10aAggression, mate guarding and fitness in male fruit flies  ap. 235-241.  aAggression is a central trait affecting fitness, which has been well studied in many animals. As a part of a research programme integrating mechanisms and fitness consequences of aggression, we examined the adaptive functions of antagonistic interactions in fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, a species in which aggression has been studied primarily in the context of territorial behaviour. In our experiments, males at an attractive food patch were more aggressive towards other males when they were in the presence of their recent mates than when they were in the presence of females mated with other males. Furthermore, while recently mated males accompanied by their mates were more aggressive than virgin males, recently mated males and virgin males showed similar levels of aggression in the presence of females mated with other males. When we allowed focal males to mate inside experimental arenas and then added intruder males, the intruder males spent less time on the food patch, remated with the resident females at lower frequencies and fathered a smaller proportion of offspring when the focals males remained in the arenas than when we removed the focal males. Our results reveal a novel adaptive function of aggression in fruit flies: in addition to fighting to defend attractive food sources that attract prospective mates, males rely on aggression to guard their mates, and such mate guarding enhances their fitness.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aaggression 3aanimals 3afemales 3afruit flies 3amales 3aprogeny 3aresearch programs 3aterritoriality 0aaggression 0aDrosophila melanogaster 0afighting 0afruit fly 0amate guarding 0aresource defence polygyny 0aterritorial behaviour1 aBarnett, Rachael1 aDukas, Reuven0 tAnimal behaviour.g2015 Nov., v. 109 p.235-241dElsevier LtdaThe Association for the Study of Animal BehaviourwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2015.08.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03117naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245011000173300002000283520171400303592002802017650001602045650003702061650001702098650001702115650001202132650001502144650001102159650001302170650001502183650002602198650002002224650002002244700002402264700006002288700006302348700001702411700005802428773011602486856008402602852000902686655001202695IND60662507120191226000000.0190904e20190809xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066250712DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b018382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuechner, Christin10aQuantitative Characterization of a Desalination Membrane Model System by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy  ap. 11315-11321.  aAromatic polyamide films form the active layer in reverse osmosis desalination membranes. Despite widespread use of this technology, it suffers from low rejection rates for certain water contaminants and from membrane fouling. Through a better understanding of the fundamental surface chemical processes during reverse osmosis desalination, advances in membrane and material design are expected. The recent invention of a molecular layer-by-layer (mLbL) preparation technique [Johnson, P. M.; Molecular Layer-by-Layer Deposition of Highly Crosslinked Polyamide Films. J. Polym. Sci., Part B: Polym. Phys.2012, 50 (3), 168−173] yields films that are sufficiently smooth to warrant investigation with high-resolution microscopy and spectroscopy methods. We present high-resolution, quantitative X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data on the surface chemistry of ultrathin polyamide films that can serve as a model system for desalination membranes. We show that a quantitative analysis of the XPS spectra gives information about the functional groups of the film as well as other compounds present due to the synthesis under ambient conditions. Unpolymerized functional groups are identified and aid in understanding the degree of cross-linking. Investigation of polymers with synchrotron-based XPS requires taking beam-induced changes into account. We quantify X-ray beam damage and show that beam damage to the polyamide is limited, allowing long-term investigation of thin polyamide films. Characterizing mLbL-grown films via high-resolution XPS is the basis for a better understanding of the chemical interplay of polyamide surface functional groups with the major components of desalination systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acrosslinking 3adesalination 3afouling 3amicroscopy 3amodels 3amoieties 3apolyamides 3aquantitative analysis 3areverse osmosis 3awater pollution1 aGericke, Sabrina M.1 aTrotochaud, Lena1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8816-37811 aKarslıoǧlu, Osman1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4018-45721 aRaso, Joseph1 aBluhm, Hendrik1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9381-31550 tLangmuir.g2019 Aug. 09, v. 35, no. 35 p.11315-11321dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b018383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02328naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245012500171300001600296520134700312592002801659653001601687653003701703653001301740653001301753653001601766653001801782700002201800773011401822856008101936852000902017655001202026IND60516919820221117024839.0160327e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051691982DNAL7 a10.1017/S14319276130014512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeidelbach, Florian10aInherited Fabric in an Omphacite Symplectite: Reconstruction of Plastic Deformation under Ultra-High Pressure Conditions  ap. 942-949.  aWe investigated an eclogitic gneiss from the Western Gneiss Region in Norway, which underwent subduction as part of Baltica lithosphere beneath Laurentia during the Scandian orogeny. Petrologic data indicate that the eclogite was deformed plastically at about 4 GPa and 800°C producing a strong macroscopic foliation and lineation. Whereas garnet remained largely stable during the retrograde uplift, omphacite was transformed statically into a symplectite consisting of lamellar diopside and plagioclase with more equant grains of hornblende and orthopyroxene. Measurements of the crystallographic preferred orientation with electron backscatter diffraction show that diopside and hornblende, as well as orthopyroxene, have a systematic orientation relationship with the macroscopic fabric, as well as the (presumed) orientation of the host omphacite. The orientation relationship between the chain silicates is very sharp with the crystallographic forms {100}, {010}, and ⟨001⟩ being parallel. Their bulk texture shows a maximum of ⟨001⟩ parallel to the lineation and girdles of {010} and {110} perpendicular to the lineation with maxima subparallel to the foliation corresponding to an L-type texture of the original omphacite and indicating constrictional strain with an additional component of pure shear/simple shear component.  aPublisher supplied data 0asymplectite 0aelectron backscatter diffraction 0atopotaxy 0atextures 0adeformation 0ahigh pressure1 aTerry, Michael P.0 tMicroscopy and Microanalysis.g2013 Aug., v. 19, no. 4 p.942-949dCambridge University Pressx1435-81157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S14319276130014513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03253naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245015100172300001600323520139000339592002801729650000801757650001901765650001401784650002301798650001501821650002001836650001601856650001101872650002101883650000901904650001601913650001401929650002001943650001401963650001301977650001501990650001202005650002502017650001102042650001702053650001202070650003102082650002002113653002602133653000902159653001102168653001302179653001202192700001502204700002202219700003102241700002902272700003502301700002702336700006202363773009102425856009002516852000902606655001202615IND60625780920221119095209.0210108e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062578092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.12.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanchis, Rut10aFerric sludge derived from the process of water purification as an efficient catalyst and/or support for the removal of volatile organic compounds  ap. 286-295.  aFerric chloride solutions are used as coagulants or flocculants in water treatment operations for human consumption. This treatment produces large amounts of clay-type solids formed mainly of montmorillonite with iron oxides and humic substances. This ferric sludge can be used as an efficient catalyst for the removal of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by total oxidation. This waste isolated in the purification process has been activated by calcinations in air, characterized by several physicochemical techniques and employed as a catalyst for the removal by total oxidation of representative VOCs: toluene, propane and mixtures of toluene/propane with or without water. This ferric sludge has shown a catalytic activity one order of magnitude higher than that of a commercial iron oxide. This high activity has been related to the composition of the sludge (as it contains active metal oxides such as oxides of iron and manganese) and to the porous structure (leading to a reasonably high surface area). Moreover, it can be also used as a support for platinum, showing comparable (or even higher) catalytic activity than a similar platinum catalyst supported on conventional γ-alumina. This work presents a double environmental perspective since the material employed as a catalyst is a waste sludge and the catalytic reaction studied deals about the elimination of pollutants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aaluminum oxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acoagulants 3aferric chloride 3aflocculants 3ahumans 3ahumic substances 3airon 3airon oxides 3amanganese 3amontmorillonite 3aoxidation 3aplatinum 3apollutants 3apropane 3apurification methods 3asludge 3asurface area 3atoluene 3avolatile organic compounds 3awater treatment 0aPurification of water 0aVOCs 0aSludge 0aPlatinum 0aSupport1 aDejoz, Ana1 aVázquez, Isabel,1 aVilarrasa-García, Enrique1 aJiménez-Jiménez, José1 aRodríguez-Castellón, Enrique1 aLópez Nieto, José M.1 aSolsona, Benjamín1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7235-20380 tChemosphere.g2019 Mar., v. 219 p.286-295dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.12.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02941naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245016400172300001800336520155700354592002801911650001201939650002401951650001001975650001301985650001101998650001302009650001402022650002002036650001202056650001702068650001502085650002302100650001202123650001202135650001902147650001802166651001202184651001002196700002602206700002502232700001902257773010502276856008102381852000902462655001202471IND60123892820221121005820.0150411e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012389282DNAL7 a10.1007/s11947-015-1474-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuiné, Raquel P.

The factors evaluated were the presence or absence of the inner skin, geographical origin, storage conditions (ambient temperature, in a stove at 30 and 50 °C, in a chamber at 30 and 50 °C and 90 % RH, refrigerated and freezing) and type of package (none, low density polyethylene and low density polyethylene). The fruits studied were almonds, hazelnuts and walnuts from different countries. The properties measured were moisture content, water activity, colour coordinates (L*, a* and b*) and texture parameters (hardness and friability). Experimental data were modelled using neural networks. The results showed that the almonds from Spain and Romania had awgreater than 0.6, and therefore, its stability was not guaranteed, contrarily to the other samples that presented values of awlower than 0.6. The colour coordinate lightness varied from 40.60 to 49.30 in the fresh samples but decreased during storage, indicating darkening. In general, an increase in hardness and friability was observed with the different storage conditions. Neuron weight analysis has shown that the origin was a good predictor for moisture content and texture; whereas, the storage condition was a good predictor for awand colour. In conclusion, it was possible to verify that the properties of nuts are very different depending on origin; they are better preserved at lower temperatures and the type of package used did not impact the properties studied.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalmonds 3aambient temperature 3acolor 3afreezing 3afruits 3ahardness 3ahazelnuts 3aneural networks 3aneurons 3apolyethylene 3aprovenance 3astorage conditions 3atexture 3awalnuts 3awater activity 3awater content 3aRomania 3aSpain1 aAlmeida, Cátia F.

As a result the endosomal system plays a central role in maintaining cell homeostasis, and mutations in genes belonging to this network of organelles interconnected by vesicular transport, cause severe pathologies including cancer and neurobiological disorders. It is therefore of prime relevance to understand the mechanisms underlying the biogenesis and organization of the endosomal system. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been pivotal in this task. To specifically label and analyze at the ultrastructural level the endosomal system of this model organism, we present here a detailed protocol for the positively charged nanogold uptake by spheroplasts followed by the visualization of these particles through a silver enhancement reaction. This method is also a valuable tool for the morphological examination of mutants with defects in endosomal trafficking. Moreover, it is not only applicable for ultrastructural examinations but it can also be combined with immunogold labelings for protein localization investigations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3abiogenesis 3aendocytosis 3aendosomes 3aeukaryotic cells 3agenes 3ahomeostasis 3amodels 3amutants 3amutation 3ananogold 3ananosilver 3aneoplasms 3aplasma membrane 3aproteins 3asilver 3ayeasts1 aGriffith, Janice1 aReggiori, Fulvio0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2014 July 14, , no. 89 p.e51752-e51752dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/517523Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/51752/nanogold-labeling-yeast-endosomal-system-for-ultrastructural  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01222naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001900138245012800157300001800285520020300303592002800506650001300534650001200547650001500559650002100574650002700595650002300622650000900645700001700654700001500671773012900686856007200815852000900887655001200896IND60658490220221122055933.0190817e20091114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065849022DNAL7 a10.1039/b911905a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiang, Shi-Kai10aSp–sp³ C–C bond formation via Fe(OTf)₃/TfOH cocatalyzed coupling reaction of terminal alkynes with benzylic alcohols  ap. 6487-6489.  aAn Fe(OTf)₃/TfOH cocatalyzed sp–sp³ C–C bond formation through the coupling of benzylic alcohols with terminal alkynes in the absence of base has been developed.

Such information is critical for reforestation efforts that are now occurring throughout Central America. This paper describes processes of degradation due to land use and provides a conceptual framework for the restoration of dry tropical forest. Most of this forest type was initially harvested for timber and then cleared for cattle in the last century (1930–1970). Only 1.7% remains largely restricted to infertile soils and remote areas on the Pacific coastal side of Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Mexico. These cleared areas are again in a state of transition due to a combination of decreasing land productivity, and land speculation for tourism development. Some farms have been sold to new landowners who are interested in reforesting to increase biodiversity and forest cover. Attempts have therefore been made to reforest by protecting the land from fire and cattle, by supplementing natural regrowth with enrichment planting, or through use of tree plantations. Experimental studies have demonstrated the ability of these lands to grow back to forests because of native species ability to sprout after cutting, and the capacity of remnant trees in field and riparian zones to provide seeds and to moderate edge environment for seed germination and seedling establishment. However, research also shows that on sites with long histories of land clearance, species diversity will remain low with functional groups missing unless some active management occurs. Under-planting with late-successional native tree species can add structure and diversity; enrichment planting with large-fruited shade-intolerant species can initiate new islands of more diverse regeneration beneath their canopies; and plantings of fast-growing, nitrogen-fixing trees that provide light canopy shade can moderate the environment below, promoting regeneration establishment of late-successional species. Plantations are the only option for lands that have lost almost all remnants of native forest, and where soils and vegetation have changed to new states of structure and function. Conversion of pastures to tree plantations that can facilitate natural regeneration beneath them is appropriate when pastures are prone to fire and/or lack immediate seed sources nearby. After the grasses have been shaded out, natural recruitment can slowly occur over a 10–15 years period. Under-planting of shade-tolerant late-successional species can supplement species composition and structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplantations 3anitrogen-fixing trees 3aislands 3aseedlings 3anatural regeneration 3aland use 3alandowners 3apastures 3afarms 3aplanting 3acoasts 3adry forests 3aland degradation 3agrasses 3aseeds 3acattle 3atropical forests 3afires 3asoil 3aregrowth 3aspecies diversity 3alogging 3aseed germination 3acanopy 3atourism 3areforestation 3aland productivity 3ariparian areas 3aindigenous species 3aforest types 3aPanama 3aCosta Rica 3aMexico 3aNicaragua 0arecruitment1 aAshton, Mark S.0 tForest ecology and management.g2011 May 15, v. 261, no. 10 p.1564-1579dElsevier B.V.x0378-11277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2010.08.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02987naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100003500155245013400190300001600324520139200340592002801732650001301760650001901773650001401792650002101806650001801827650001101845650001901856650001301875650001501888650001901903650001201922650001001934650001901944650001101963650002001974650001601994650001502010653001902025653001702044653001702061653003602078653005202114700003702166700001902203700002502222700002002247773009102267856009002358852000902448655001202457IND60625781020221119100636.0210108e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062578102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCerrón-Calle, Gabriel Antonio10aPhotoelectrocatalytic decolorization of azo dyes with nano-composite oxide layers of ZnO nanorods decorated with Ag nanoparticles  ap. 296-304.  aPhotoelectrocatalysis provides an excellent frame for the application of photocatalytic nanostructured materials on easy recoverable supports. This study reports the two-step synthesis of hierarchically nanostructured ZnO/Ag composite photoelectrodes. Wurtzite ZnO was selectively electronucleated as spheroidal seeds on fluor doped tin oxide substrates and nanodecorated with Ag nanoclusters under electrochemical control. Hierarchically organized nanorods were selectively chemically grown on the plane (002) perpendicular to the substrate from ZnO/Ag seeds. Solutions emulating dye effluents with the usual contents of 0.1 M of NaCl and a model azo dye (Methyl Orange) were decolorized using ZnO/Ag nanorods in different treatments. Photocatalysis attained discrete decolorizations of 8% whereas photoelectrocatalysis completely decolorized solutions after 60 min. The influence of the metal/semiconductor interface (ZnO/Ag) as introduced Schottky barrier is studied demonstrating a four-fold enhancement on decolorization kinetics respect bare ZnO nanorods. The influence of the seed growth control on the final photoelectrocatalytic response is reported to control the hierarchical organization of nanorods. This resulted in different decolorization kinetics as result of the differences on the efficient use of the delivered photons conditioned by the photoelectrode structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aazo dyes 3adecolorization 3aeffluents 3aelectrochemistry 3amethyl orange 3amodels 3ananocomposites 3ananorods 3ananosilver 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotons 3aseeds 3asemiconductors 3asilver 3asodium chloride 3atin dioxide 3azinc oxide 0aPhotocatalysis 0aPhotocathode 0aNano-coating 0aElectrochemical water treatment 0aMetallic/semiconductor composite photocatalysts1 aAranda-Aguirre, Alejandro Junior1 aLuyo, Clemente1 aGarcia-Segura, Sergi1 aAlarcón, Hugo,0 tChemosphere.g2019 Mar., v. 219 p.296-304dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.12.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03807naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245014700171520202000318592002802338650001502366650001102381650001302392650002002405650003202425650002602457650002002483650001602503650001602519650001002535650002902545650002902574650001802603650002902621650002402650650001802674650002102692650001102713650002002724650000902744650001102753650001102764651001002775653003302785653001702818653002102835653001502856653003002871653001602901700001802917700001802935700001702953700001902970773011902989856008803108852000903196655001203205IND60655272020221119012019.0191121e20191210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065527202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1336702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Mingyuan10aPresence of spring-thaw N2O emissions are not linked to functional gene abundance in a drip-fertigated cropped soil in arid northwestern China  aSpring-thaw represents a significant source for nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from fertilized croplands in temperate regions. In this study, we present surface N2O fluxes, soil-profile N2O concentrations at 5, 15, 30 and 60 cm depths along with the abundance of nitrifiers and denitrifiers over the winter and spring-thaw periods in an arid, drip- fertigated cotton field, which had received spring application of 240 kg N ha−1 as urea alone (Urea), polymer-coated urea (ESN), and urea plus urease and nitrification inhibitors. Nitrous oxide emissions from December to April were generally unaffected by fertilizer treatments with a cumulative average of 186 g N ha−1, accounting for 39% of the annual N2O emissions. Emission peaks occurred at spring-thaw and coincided with increasing soil-profile N2O concentrations at all depths, suggesting the burst in N2O fluxes was due to new N2O production, rather than a physical release of N2O trapped in the soil profiles over winter. The abundance of nitrifier and denitrifier genes changed over the winter and spring-thaw periods but was not affected by fertilizer treatments from the previous spring, suggesting the abundance of N2O-producing microorganism was more controlled by environmental conditions than N sources applied in the previous spring. The daily N2O flux rate from December to April was positively correlated with soil temperature, water-filled pore space, and denitrifying enzyme activity, but not with the gene copy number of AOA, AOB, narG, nirS, nirK and nosZ, indicating that variation in the abundance of these genes was not contributing to the N2O emissions. These results suggest that N2O emissions in spring-thaw are substantial for drip-fertigated croplands in the arid regions and should be considered in the annual budgets. The environmental factors such as soil temperature and moisture are likely more important than the copy-numbers of N2O-producing functional genes in driving the variability in spring-thaw emissions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarid zones 3acotton 3acropland 3adenitrification 3adenitrifying microorganisms 3aenvironmental factors 3aenzyme activity 3afertigation 3agene dosage 3agenes 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3anitrification inhibitors 3anitrous oxide 3anitrous oxide production 3apolymer-coated urea 3asoil profiles 3asoil temperature 3aspring 3atemperate zones 3aurea 3aurease 3awinter 3aChina 0aDenitrifying enzyme activity 0aDenitrifiers 0aDrip-fertigation 0aNitrifiers 0aProfile N2O concentration 0aSpring-thaw1 aGao, Xiaopeng1 aTenuta, Mario1 aGui, Dongwei1 aZeng, Fanjiang0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Dec. 10, v. 695 p.133670-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1336703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01822naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245013800174300001600312520084200328592002801170650001801198650001501216650001201231650001001243650001601253650001601269700002601285700001501311773009201326856008101418852000901499655001201508IND60518307120221119215051.0161031e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051830712DNAL7 a10.1007/s10164-016-0457-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLehmann, Gerlind U.

The spermatophylax acts as a sperm protection device; during its consumption, the sperm are transferred into the female’s spermatheca. Males of the bushcricket Letana inflata (Brunner von Wattenwyl, 1878) show strongly extended copulation duration. When the pair finally separates, only an ampulla is visible at the females’ genital opening, but no spermatophylax. To better understand copulation dynamics in the absence of a spermatophylax, we studied copula duration and sperm transfer pattern. Our results show that in Letana inflata the missing spermatophylax is replaced by extended copulation, securing the transfer of sperm into the spermatheca.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTettigoniidae 3acopulation 3afemales 3amales 3aspermatheca 3aspermatozoa1 aHeller, Klaus-Gerhard1 aMai, René0 tJournal of ethology.g2016 May, v. 34, no. 2 p.191-194dSpringer Japanx0289-07717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10164-016-0457-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02347naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245006500163300001600228520131100244592002801555650000901583650001401592650001301606650001401619650001401633650001601647650001601663650001401679650001601693650001701709650000901726650001701735700002801752773010301780856008101883852000901964655001201973IND60123893220221121031056.0150411e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012389322DNAL7 a10.1007/s11947-015-1479-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPasrija, D.10aTechniques for Extraction of Green Tea Polyphenols: A Review  ap. 935-950.  aTea is the second most consumed beverage all over the world after water. In recent times, tea has stretched the eyebrows of researchers and catching all the attention towards its health benefits. Tea has been proven beneficial by preventing the risk of some diseases like cancer and cardiovascular problems. Green tea is least processed and gives maximum benefits. The main components of the green tea are polyphenols which include the catechins, epicatechins, epigallocatechins, epicatechingallate, epigallocatechingallate, gallic acid, flavanoids, flavanols, and flavonols. Other than polyphenols, caffeine and theophylline are also present. Among which compounds of catechins family has been widely reported to have most beneficial effects on the health. Currently, the extraction of catechins is catching much higher attention and many techniques have been discovered and modified to extract these compounds. But very limited reviews have been reported discussing the impact of various techniques used for extraction of green tea polyphenols. This review focuses on various techniques employed for the extraction of polyphenols from green tea and other sources (pine bark, grape seed, and pomegranate) with their advantages and limitations. The current trends and future prospects are also highlighted.  aPublisher supplied data 3abark 3abeverages 3acaffeine 3aflavanols 3aflavonols 3agallic acid 3agrape seeds 3agreen tea 3apolyphenols 3apomegranates 3arisk 3atheophylline1 aAnandharamakrishnan, C.0 tFood and bioprocess technology.g2015 May, v. 8, no. 5 p.935-950dSpringer-Verlagx1935-51307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11947-015-1479-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03155naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100009700153245017300250520152400423592002801947650001601975650001301991650001102004650001502015650002002030650001002050650001602060650001502076650001202091650001702103650001202120650002202132650001602154650001002170650001502180650001602195650001102211650000902222650001802231650001302249650001602262653002302278653001702301653001502318653003102333700002002364700002502384773011902409856008802528852000902616655001202625IND60655272120221119012135.0191121e20191201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065527212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1336722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampos, Juan A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4770-0461 https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4770-046110aAntigerminative comparison between naturally occurring naphthoquinones and commercial pesticides. Soil dehydrogenase activity used as bioindicator to test soil toxicity  aAs important secondary plant metabolites, naphthoquinones exhibit a wide range of biological activities, and one of their roles in the competition among plants is a well-known process called allelopathy. Their potential as a sustainable alternatives to herbicides has been investigated. In this study, we aim to take advantage of these naturally occurring substances to control the germination of spontaneous flora. In this work, the sensitivity of the germination of different plant species (horticultural, grasses and spontaneous flora) was tested. The results indicate that most of the plants are sensitive to juglone. The comparison between naphthoquinones and commercial pesticides did not provide enough evidence to use naphthoquinones to control spontaneous flora. Assessing the toxicity of pesticides is crucial because the sustainability of the ecosystem could be endangered by their use. In this study, the toxicity of certain pesticides (metam Na, oxyfluorfen, glyphosate, metribuzin and diuron) was evaluated based on dehydrogenase activity (DHA). DHA has become a good bioindicator for assessing the toxicity of xenobiotics. A toxicity index was proposed to compare the different degrees of toxicity among the tested substances. Finally, a toxicity threshold was constructed using the slopes of the fitted lines of the data, assuming that the maximum toxicity (10) represented the slope of the biocide HgCl2 and that the minimum toxicity (1) was attributed to the DHA obtained from soil without pesticides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallelopathy 3abiocides 3adiuron 3aecosystems 3aenzyme activity 3aflora 3agermination 3aglyphosate 3agrasses 3ahorticulture 3ajuglone 3amercuric chloride 3ametabolites 3ametam 3ametribuzin 3aoxyfluorfen 3asodium 3asoil 3asoil toxicity 3atoxicity 3axenobiotics 0aMicrobial activity 0aSoil quality 0aPesticides 0aOxidative enzymes activity1 aPeco, Jesús D.1 aGarcía-Noguero, Eva0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Dec. 01, v. 694 p.133672-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1336723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03004naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245013200178300002000310520152700330592002801857650001501885650002001900650001601920650001801936650001301954650001101967650002301978650001802001650001302019650001902032650002402051700002102075700002202096700002102118700001802139700002302157700002302180700001502203700002202218700002402240700006102264773011602325856008402441852000902525655001202534IND60662507520191226000000.0190904e20190806xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066250752DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b019162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUttinger, Maximilian J.12aA Comprehensive Brownian Dynamics Approach for the Determination of Non-ideality Parameters from Analytical Ultracentrifugation  ap. 11491-11502.  aBrownian dynamics (BD) has been applied as a comprehensive tool to model sedimentation and diffusion of nanoparticles in analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) experiments. In this article, we extend the BD algorithm by considering space-dependent diffusion and solvent compressibility. With this, the changes in the sedimentation and diffusion coefficient from altered solvent properties at increased pressures are accurately taken into account. Moreover, it is demonstrated how the concept of space-dependent diffusion is employed to describe concentration-dependent sedimentation and diffusion coefficients, in particular, through the Gralen coefficient and the second virial coefficient. The influence of thermodynamic nonideality on diffusional properties can be accurately simulated and agree with well-known evaluation tools. BD simulations for sedimentation equilibrium and sedimentation velocity (SV) AUC experiments including effects of hydrodynamic and thermodynamic nonideality are validated by global evaluation in SEDANAL. The interplay of solvent compressibility and retrieved nonideality parameters can be studied utilizing BD. Finally, the second virial coefficient is determined for lysozyme from SV AUC experiments and BD simulations and compared to membrane osmometry. These results are in line with DLVO theory. In summary, BD simulations are established for the validation of nonideal sedimentation in AUC providing a sound basis for the evaluation of complex interactions even in polydisperse systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acompressibility 3adiffusivity 3ahydrodynamics 3alysozyme 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3ananoparticles 3asolvents 3athermodynamics 3aultracentrifugation1 aWawra, Simon.

This necessitates a clear vision on what circularity for food means, which will provide a much-needed foundation to develop a monitoring tool that reveals insights into the progress being made towards a CE, and to expose the bottlenecks and opportunities. This research study contributes to the development of a shared vision for circularity within the food system, and defines and prioritizes a set of indicator themes to monitor a circular food economy (CFE). A two-round Delphi study was performed, including a brainstorming session with experts and the construction of a consensus ranking of indicator themes, considering the production and processing and the consumption stage. The Delphi results provide a shared vision on a CFE, and a blueprint for researchers and policy-makers on its monitoring, which will stimulate the progression from a linear to a circular system.  aPublisher supplied data 3acircular economy 3aemissions 3aexperts 3afood industry 3afoods 3amonitoring 3aprocessing stages 3awills 0aCircular economy 0aMonitor 0aIndicators 0aFood 0aDelphi study 0aBest–worst scaling1 aVermeyen, Veerle1 aAlaerts, Luc1 aVan Acker, Karel1 aVan Passel, Steven0 tSustainable Production and Consumption.g2022 July, v. 32 p.457-467dElsevier LtdaInstitution of Chemical EngineerswJournal:23261x2352-55097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.spc.2022.05.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03579naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100009500153245010800248520191500356592002802271650001302299650002002312650001902332650001602351650001602367650001302383650004102396650002302437650001002460650001702470650001702487650000902504650001702513653001302530653002302543653001902566653002902585653001702614700001702631700001702648700001502665700001702680700001502697700001702712700001902729700001702748700001702765700001202782700001502794773011902809856008802928852000903016655001203025IND60655272220221119011934.0191121e20191201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065527222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1336742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Baihuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5525-2561 https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5525-256110aExercise training prevented endothelium dysfunction from particulate matter instillation in Wistar rats  aExposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) can result in adverse cardiovascular responses including vascular endothelial dysfunction, whereas exercise training can promote cardiovascular health. However, whether exercise training can mitigate adverse vascular response to PM2.5 has been less studied. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the preventive effect of exercise training on vascular endothelial dysfunction induced by PM2.5 instillation. Six-week old male Wistar rats (n = 32) were divided into four groups (8 rats per group) by exercise status (sedentary vs. exercised) and PM2.5 exposure (instilled vs. non-instilled). Rats received treadmill training with moderate-intensity intervals in week 1 to 6, followed by three repeated PM2.5 instillation on every other day in week 7. Body weight and blood pressure were measured for each rat regularly during exercise training and before sacrifice. At sacrifice, thoracic aortas were isolated for functional response measurement to agonists. Nitric oxide bioavailability and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) function were also assessed. We observed that exercise training significantly reduced the body weight of rats, while PM2.5 instillation had little effect. Neither exercise training nor PM2.5 instillation had significant effects on blood pressure changes. However, exercise training effectively prevented endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation dysfunction and nitric oxide bioavailability reduction from subsequent PM2.5 instillation. In addition, exercise training promoted HDL function which were characterized as increased HDL cholesterol level, cholesterol efflux capacity, and reduced oxidization index; whereas PM2.5 instillation showed limited adverse impact on HDL function. Collectively, our results indicated that exercise training could promote HDL function and protect against endothelium dysfunction from PM2.5 instillation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagonists 3abioavailability 3ablood pressure 3abody weight 3aendothelium 3aexercise 3ahigh density lipoprotein cholesterol 3alaboratory animals 3amales 3anitric oxide 3aparticulates 3arats 3avasodilation 0aExercise 0aParticulate matter 0aVasorelaxation 0aHigh-density lipoprotein 0aInstillation1 aQi, Rongzhen1 aGao, Jianing1 aWang, Tong1 aXu, Hongbing1 aZhao, Qian1 aWu, Rongshan1 aSong, Xiaoming1 aGuo, Jianjun1 aZheng, Lemin1 aLi, Ran1 aHuang, Wei0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Dec. 01, v. 694 p.133674-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1336743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02880naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245014900170520117200319592002801491650001301519650002601532650002401558650001001582650001201592650002301604650001601627650002601643650001501669650001301684651001001697651002101707653000601728653000801734653000701742653000801749653000701757653000701764653000701771653000701778653000601785653000801791653000701799653000801806653001901814653001901833653001601852653001901868700002001887700002501907700001601932700003201948700002701980700001602007700001502023773011902038856008802157852000902245655001202254IND60655272320221119012211.0191121e20191201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065527232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1336752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIqbal, Awais10aPattern of microbial community composition and functional gene repertoire associated with methane emission from Zoige wetlands, China—A review  aThe Hindu-Kush Himalaya region extends over 4 million km2 across the eight countries. Knowingly, the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) is considered the principal altitudinal permafrost constituent on earth and is deemed as the third ‘pole’. Among which, the Zoige wetlands are located in the northeastern boundary of QTP, wrapping a total area of 6180 km2 with an average altitude of 3500 m. This entire region is the hotspot for methane emission since the last decade. Given the importance of methane emission, many studies have focused on the effect of environmental fluctuations on the overall methane profile and, more recently on the methanogenic community structure. The current review summarizes recent advancements of the methanogenic community and methane profile and outlines a framework for better understanding of the microbial ecology of the Zoige wetlands, China. Moreover, as microorganisms are indispensable to biogeochemical cycles, especially for methane, they are believed to be the best indicators to identify the condition of wetlands. Hence, we suggest that, underpinning the microbial profile could help understand the status of a wetland.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acommunity structure 3agenes 3amethane 3amethane production 3amethanogens 3amicrobial communities 3apermafrost 3awetlands 3aChina 3aHimalayan region 0am 0akm2 0am2 0aavg 0aPg 0amm 0amM 0aTg 0ag 0aμg 0ahr 0a°C 0aGlobal warming 0aGreenhouse gas 0aCarbon sink 0aClimate change1 aShang, Zhanhuan1 aRehman, Mian Laiq Ur1 aJu, Meiting1 aRehman, Muhammad Maqsood Ur1 aRafiq, Muhammad Khalid1 aAyub, Nasir1 aBai, Yanfu0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Dec. 01, v. 694 p.133675-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1336753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02355naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001700188245010000205300001600305520107000321592002801391653005201419653002801471653001401499653005001513653002101563653002901584700002401613700001801637700001701655700001901672700002101691700002401712700001701736773011401753856008101867852000901948655001201957IND60516920420221121085527.0160327e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051692042DNAL7 a10.1017/S14319276130015302doi7 aPMC41286212pmcid7 a237020072pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Yinghua10aEndoscopic Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging for In Vivo Intraoperative Diagnosis of Oral Carcinoma  ap. 791-798.  aA clinically compatible fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) system was developed. The system was applied to intraoperative in vivo imaging of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The endoscopic FLIM prototype integrates a gated (down to 0.2 ns) intensifier imaging system and a fiber-bundle endoscope (0.5-mm-diameter, 10,000 fibers with a gradient index lens objective 0.5 NA, 4-mm field of view), which provides intraoperative access to the surgical field. Tissue autofluorescence was induced by a pulsed laser (337 nm, 700 ps pulse width) and collected in the 460 ± 25 nm spectral band. FLIM experiments were conducted at 26 anatomic sites in ten patients during head and neck cancer surgery. HNSCC exhibited a weaker florescence intensity (~50% less) when compared with healthy tissue and a shorter average lifetime (τHNSCC = 1.21 ± 0.04 ns) than the surrounding normal tissue (τN = 1.49 ± 0.06 ns). This work demonstrates the potential of FLIM for label-free head and neck tumor demarcation during intraoperative surgical procedures.  aPublisher supplied data 0afluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) 0atissue autofluorescence 0aendoscopy 0ahead and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) 0acancer diagnosis 0aintraoperative diagnosis1 aPhipps, Jennifer E.1 aMeier, Jeremy1 aHatami, Nisa1 aPoirier, Brian1 aElson, Daniel S.1 aFarwell, D.

Genetic diversity among 58 isolates of A. panax from different araliaceous hosts in Korea was determined by amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis. Selected isolates from genetic groups (determined by AFLP analysis) were examined based on the results of phylogenetic analyses of eight genes (Alt a1, BT1, BT2, EF-1α, gpd, H3, ITS, and RPB2), morphological characteristics, and pathogenicity tests. Isolates were divided into two distinct genetic groups (A and B) by AFLP analysis and based on the results of sequence analyses of the BT1, BT2, gpd, and RPB2 genes. Isolates from ginseng plants (Panax ginseng and P. quinquefolius) fell into group B, whereas isolates from the other araliaceous plants clustered in group A. Morphologically, although some overlap was observed among isolates in the two groups, isolates in group B had longer and narrower conidia, distinct sporulation patterns at 15 °C, and did not secrete pigment into PDA media. Pathogenicity tests revealed that isolates in groups A and B only induced severe disease symptoms on leaves of their hosts, such as isolates in group A on Aralia elata, Aralia continentalis, and in group B on Panax ginseng. The results indicate that the two genetic groups of Alternaria from araliaceous plants should be considered as two different species, and we propose that group A is a candidate of new Alternaria species distinguished from A. panax. © 2012 German Mycological Society and Springer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlternaria panax 3aAralia elata 3aPanax ginseng 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3ablight 3aconidia 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ahosts 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aleaves 3apathogenicity 3aphylogeny 3asequence analysis 3asporulation 3aKorean Peninsula1 aPaul, Narayan Chandra1 aPark, Myung Soo1 aYu, Seung Hun0 tMycological progress.g2013 May, v. 12, no. 2 p.383-396dSpringer-Verlagx1617-416X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11557-012-0844-8  aDNAL 7aarticle03115naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100003100143245013300174300001600307520182200323592002802145650000802173650002202181650001802203650002502221650002902246650003202275650001702307650001602324650000902340650001802349650001402367650001102381650001202392653000902404653003102413653001002444653001402454653000802468700001802476773008902494856007702583852000902660655001202669IND60518128520221117112115.0160406e20150916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051812852DNAL7 a10.1139/gen-2015-00812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález, Graciela Esther10aGenomic affinities revealed by GISH suggests intergenomic restructuring between parental genomes of the paleopolyploid genus Zea  ap. 433-439.  aThe present work compares the molecular affinities, revealed by GISH, with the analysis of meiotic pairing in intra- and interspecific hybrids between species of Zea obtained in previous works. The joint analysis of these data provided evidence about the evolutionary relationships among the species from the paleopolyploid genus Zea (maize and teosintes). GISH and meiotic pairing of intraspecific hybrids revealed high genomic affinity between maize (Zea mays subsp. mays) and both Zea mays subsp. parviglumis and Zea mays subsp. mexicana. On the other hand, when Zea mays subsp. huehuetenanguensis DNA was probed on maize chromosomes, a lower affinity was detected, and the pattern of hybridization suggested intergenomical restructuring between the parental genomes of maize. When DNA from Zea luxurians was used as probe, homogeneous hybridization signals were observed through all maize chromosomes. Lower genomic affinity was observed when DNA from Zea diploperennis was probed on maize chromosomes, especially at knob regions. Maize chromosomes hybridized with Zea perennis DNA showed hybridization signals on four chromosome pairs: two chromosome pairs presented hybridization signal in only one chromosomal arm, whereas four chromosome pairs did not show any hybridization. These results are in agreement with previous GISH studies, which have identified the genomic source of the chromosomes involved in the meiotic configurations of Z. perennis × maize hybrids. These findings allow postulating that maize has a parental genome not shared with Z. perennis, and the existence of intergenomic restructuring between the parental genomes of maize. Moreover, the absence of hybridization signals in all maize knobs indicate that these heterochromatic regions were lost during the Z. perennis genome evolution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aZea diploperennis 3aZea luxurians 3aZea mays subsp. mays 3aZea mays subsp. mexicana 3aZea mays subsp. parviglumis 3aZea perennis 3achromosomes 3acorn 3adata analysis 3aevolution 3agenome 3ahybrids 0aGISH 0aintergenomic restructuring 0amaize 0ateosintes 0aZea1 aPoggio, Lidia0 tGenome.g2015 Sept. 16, v. 58, no. 10 p.433-439dNRC Research Pressx1480-33217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/gen-2015-00813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02750naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002800152245010600180300001200286520148900298592002801787650001501815650001401830650002501844650001301869650001601882650001801898650000901916650001901925650001701944650001801961650000901979650001301988650001702001650001502018650001102033650001302044650001602057700001502073700001802088773010202106856008702208852000902295655001202304IND60635922020221120120317.0200103e20190705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063592202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.03.0832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWiercigroch-Walkosz, K.10aGrowth of silica shell on hydrophobic upconverting nanocrystals – Mechanism and control of porosity  ap. 1-9.  aThe method based on the oil/water biphasic system appears as the most effective for the growth of mesoporosus silica shell on hydrophobic nanocrystals. In this paper the influence of various synthesis parameters, such as catalyst, solvent, temperature or hydrophobic chain length of surfactant, on porosity and thickness of silica layer grown on up-converting nanocrystals (UCNPs) was systematically investigated. The key factor determining morphology of silica shell and allowing to control its porosity is a kind of solvent used for TEOS dilution. For solvents of low polarity index silica shell has dendrimeric structure with pore size of 4–5.5 nm, while for solvents with high polarity index the silica shell is non-porous. The pore size can be also controlled in the range from 2 to 5.5 nm through selection the catalysts type. The morphology of the silica shell is also influenced by alkyl chain length of the cationic surfactant as well as temperature. Based on these new experimental results the mechanism of formation of mesoporous silica shell on inorganic nanopaticles was proposed and discussed. It was also proved, that the organic dyes, like Rhodamine B can be effectively incorporated inside the pores of mesoporous UCNPs@SiO₂ nanoparticles. This signify that such hybrid functional materials, which in addition exhibit stability of water dispersions and possibility of biofunctionalization, offer great potential for development of biomarkers or drug carriers.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3acatalysts 3acationic surfactants 3acolloids 3adispersions 3adrug carriers 3adyes 3ahydrophobicity 3ananocrystals 3ananoparticles 3aoils 3aporosity 3aporous media 3arhodamines 3asilica 3asolvents 3atemperature1 aCichos, J.1 aKarbowiak, M.0 tColloids and surfaces.g2019 July 05, v. 572 p.1-9dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.03.0833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03116naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245010800172300001600280520171300296592002802009650001902037650001602056650002302072650001602095650002202111650002602133650001202159650002002171650001002191650001202201650001602213650001502229650001102244650001102255650001502266650001102281650001702292650002102309650001002330650002802340650001602368700001902384700002102403700001902424773007402443856008402517852000902601655001202610IND60096579220221117225039.0141104e20131215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009657922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2013.09.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhoshroo, Alireza12aA non-parametric Data Envelopment Analysis approach for improving energy efficiency of grape production  ap. 189-194.  aGrape is one of the world's largest fruit crops with approximately 67.5 million tonnes produced each year and energy is an important element in modern grape productions as it heavily depends on fossil and other energy resources. Efficient use of these energies is a necessary step toward reducing environmental hazards, preventing destruction of natural resources and ensuring agricultural sustainability. Hence, identifying excessive use of energy as well as reducing energy resources is the main focus of this paper to optimize energy consumption in grape production. In this study we use a two-stage methodology to find the association of energy efficiency and performance explained by farmers' specific characteristics. In the first stage a non-parametric Data Envelopment Analysis is used to model efficiencies as an explicit function of human labor, machinery, chemicals, FYM (farmyard manure), diesel fuel, electricity and water for irrigation energies. In the second step, farm specific variables such as farmers' age, gender, level of education and agricultural experience are used in a Tobit regression framework to explain how these factors influence efficiency of grape farming. The result of the first stage shows substantial inefficiency between the grape producers in the studied area while the second stage shows that the main difference between efficient and inefficient farmers was in the use of chemicals, diesel fuel and water for irrigation. The use of chemicals such as insecticides, herbicides and fungicides were considerably less than inefficient ones. The results revealed that the more educated farmers are more energy efficient in comparison with their less educated counterparts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal manures 3adiesel fuel 3aeducational status 3aelectricity 3aenergy efficiency 3aenvironmental hazards 3afarmers 3afarming systems 3afarms 3afossils 3afruit crops 3afungicides 3agender 3agrapes 3aherbicides 3ahumans 3ainsecticides 3airrigation water 3alabor 3asustainable agriculture 3aviticulture1 aMulwa, Richard1 aEmrouznejad, Ali1 aArabi, Behrouz0 tEnergy.g2013 Dec. 15, v. 63 p.189-194dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2013.09.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02413naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245011600171300001700287520130700304592002801611653003301639653003701672653002101709653001201730653002601742653002301768700002301791700001801814700001801832700002001850773011501870856008101985852000902066655001202075IND60516920620221121054404.0160327e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051692062DNAL7 a10.1017/S14319276130015542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPinard, Philippe T.10aCharacterization of Dual-Phase Steel Microstructure by Combined Submicrometer EBSD and EPMA Carbon Measurements  ap. 996-1006.  aElectron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) measurements are combined to characterize an industrial produced dual-phase steel containing some bainite fraction. High-resolution carbon mappings acquired on a field emission electron microprobe are utilized to validate and improve the identification of the constituents (ferrite, martensite, and bainite) performed by EBSD using the image quality and kernel average misorientation. The combination eliminates the ambiguity between the identification of bainite and transformation-induced dislocation zones, encountered if only the kernel average misorientation is considered. The detection of carbon in high misorientation regions confirms the presence of bainite. These results are corroborated by secondary electron images after nital etching. Limitations of this combined method due to differences between the spatial resolution of EBSD and EPMA are assessed. Moreover, a quantification procedure adapted to carbon analysis is presented and used to measure the carbon concentration in martensite and bainite on a submicrometer scale. From measurements on reference materials, this method gives an accuracy of 0.02 wt% C and a precision better than 0.05 wt% C despite unavoidable effects of hydrocarbon contamination.  aPublisher supplied data 0aelectron probe microanalysis 0aelectron backscatter diffraction 0adual-phase steel 0abainite 0acarbon quantification 0aspatial resolution1 aSchwedt, Alexander1 aRamazani, Ali1 aPrahl, Ulrich1 aRichter, Silvia0 tMicroscopy and Microanalysis.g2013 Aug., v. 19, no. 4 p.996-1006dCambridge University Pressx1435-81157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S14319276130015543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03356naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012600165300001600291500001500307520165300322592002801975650001502003650001302018650002502031650002702056650001402083650002102097650001802118650002302136650001602159650001702175650002602192650002202218650002102240650002702261650001602288650001102304650001602315650001802331650001202349650002602361650002102387650001002408650001602418650000902434650002302443653001502466700001602481700001602497700001502513700001602528700001702544773010302561856008102664852000902745655001202754IND60123893720221121031053.0150411e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012389372DNAL7 a10.1007/s11947-014-1462-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Mengyin10aEffects of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) Treatment on Postharvest Physiology, Quality and Storage Behavior of Longan Fruit  ap. 971-982.  a2019-12-04  aThe effects of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) on postharvest physiology, quality, and storage behavior of harvested longan fruit were investigated. Fruit of “Fuyan” longan were dipped in 0.8 mM ATP solution or distilled water (control) for 20 min. The fruit were dried prior to packaging and then stored at 28 °C and 90 % relative humidity. The results showed that as compared with control fruit, application of ATP could significantly reduce fruit respiration rate; delay an increase of cell membrane permeability in pericarp; maintain higher contents of chlorophyll, carotenoid, anthocyanin, and flavonoid; and subsequently retard the change of apparent color on longans. In addition, lower polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity and higher total phenolics content were also found in ATP-treated fruit, which contributed to lower browning index in longan pericarp. The application of ATP could effectively inhibit the decreases in contents of total soluble solids (TSS), total soluble sugars, and vitamin C with a limited increase of titratable acidity (TA) content in pulp, which maintain better quality and flavor in longan pulp. Furthermore, ATP treatment could keep a higher rate of commercially acceptable fruit, effectively prevent weight loss from longans, and retard the developments of aril breakdown and fruit disease in longan fruit. It could be concluded that 0.8 mM ATP treatment for 20 min could greatly delay longan fruit senescence, maintain higher fruit quality, and exhibit better storage behavior which might suggest a promising method for keeping quality and extending the shelf life of harvested “Fuyan” longan fruit.  aPublisher supplied data 3ashelf life 3apericarp 3atotal soluble solids 3apostharvest physiology 3apackaging 3arespiratory rate 3afruit quality 3atitratable acidity 3acarotenoids 3aanthocyanins 3apostharvest treatment 3arelative humidity 3acatechol oxidase 3aadenosine triphosphate 3adried fruit 3aflavor 3aweight loss 3aascorbic acid 3alongans 3amembrane permeability 3acell respiration 3acolor 3achlorophyll 3apulp 3aphenolic compounds 0asenescence1 aLin, Hetong1 aZhang, Shen1 aLin, Yifen1 aChen, Yihui1 aLin, Yixiong0 tFood and bioprocess technology.g2015 May, v. 8, no. 5 p.971-982dSpringer-Verlagx1935-51307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11947-014-1462-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03136naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092024002100129040001800150072000900168100002200177245012100199300001800320500001500338520129800353592002801651650001901679650001301698650002801711650001701739650002401756650001201780650002501792650002201817650000901839650001201848650002901860650002301889650001701912650001501929650002001944650000901964650001401973650002501987653001302012700002002025700002902045700002102074700002102095700001802116700002102134773010002155852000902255856011202264856008702376930003302463945002502496961001302521655001202534IND4461682520221118170317.0110907e20110906xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446168252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jprot.2011.05.0172doi7 a10113/502562hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX3801 aSkultety, Ludovit10aProteomic comparison of virulent phase I and avirulent phase II of Coxiella burnetii, the causative agent of Q fever  ap. 1974-1984.  a2019-12-06  aCoxiella burnetii, a category B biological warfare agent, causes multiple outbreaks of the zoonotic disease Q fever world-wide, each year. The virulent phase I and avirulent phase II variants of the Nine Mile RSA 493 and 439 strains of C. burnetii were propagated in embryonated hen eggs and then purified by centrifugation through Renografin gradients. Total protein fractions were isolated from each phase and subjected to analysis by one-dimensional electrophoresis plus tandem mass spectrometry. A total of 235 and 215 non-redundant proteins were unambiguously identified from the phase I and II cells, respectively. Many of these proteins had not been previously reported in proteomic studies of C. burnetii. The newly identified proteins should provide additional insight into the pathogenesis of Q fever. Several of the identified proteins are involved in the biosynthesis and metabolism of components of the extracellular matrix. Forty-four of the proteins have been annotated as having distinct roles in the pathogenesis or survival of C. burnetii within the harsh phagolysosomal environment. We propose that nine enzymes specifically involved with lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis and metabolism, and that are distinctively present in phase I cells, are virulence-associated proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3acentrifugation 3aproteome 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3abiosynthesis 3alipopolysaccharides 3aenzymes 3amicrobial physiology 3aCoxiella burnetii 3aeggs 3aQ fever 3atandem mass spectrometry 3abacterial proteins 3apathogenesis 3aproteomics 3aelectrophoresis 3ahens 3avirulence 3aextracellular matrix 0aproteins1 aHajduch, Martin1 aFlores-Ramirez, Gabriela1 aMiernyk, Ján A.1 aČiampor, Fedor,1 aToman, Rudolf1 aSekeyova, Zuzana0 tJournal of proteomics.g2011 Sept. 6, v. 74, no. 10 p.1974-1984dElsevier B.V.x1874-39197nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/502563Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2011.05.0173Available from publisher's Web site  a20110922b20111007c00000000  aINDdRHFe2011/09/22  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03815naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147024002100166040001800187072000900205072000900214100002100223245014300244300002000387500002400407500001500431506007600446520163600522506003702158650002402195650002802219650001102247650002002258650001502278650002102293650001902314650001402333650001002347650001702357650001102374650002602385653002302411653001802434653002502452653001502477653002502492653003102517700001902548700002202567700002202589700001802611700002402629700003402653773017802687852000902865856008302874856011202957930003303069945002503102946001303127961001303140655001203153IND4414165920221207103406.0081226e20081223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441416592DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08094081052doi7 aPMC26032542pmcid7 a190752482pmid7 a10113/226722hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF6001 aHeld, Michael A.10aSmall-interfering RNAs from natural antisense transcripts derived from a cellulose synthase gene modulate cell wall biosynthesis in barley  ap. 20534-20539.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSmall-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) from natural cis-antisense pairs derived from the 3'-coding region of the barley (Hordeum vulgare) CesA6 cellulose synthase gene substantially increase in abundance during leaf elongation. Strand-specific RT-PCR confirmed the presence of an antisense transcript of HvCesA6 that extends greater-than-or-equal1230 bp from the 3' end of the CesA-coding sequence. The increases in abundance of the CesA6 antisense transcript and the 21-nt and 24-nt siRNAs derived from the transcript are coincident with the down-regulation of primary wall CesAs, several Csl genes, and GT8 glycosyl transferase genes, and are correlated with the reduction in rates of cellulose and (1 [rightward arrow] 3),(1 [rightward arrow] 4)-β-D-glucan synthesis. Virus induced gene silencing using unique target sequences derived from HvCesA genes attenuated expression not only of the HvCesA6 gene, but also of numerous nontarget Csls and the distantly related GT8 genes and reduced the incorporation of D-¹⁴C-Glc into cellulose and into mixed-linkage (1 [rightward arrow] 3),(1 [rightward arrow] 4)-β-D-glucans of the developing leaves. Unique target sequences for CslF and CslH conversely silenced the same genes and lowered rates of cellulose and (1 [rightward arrow] 3),(1 [rightward arrow] 4)-β-D-glucan synthesis. Our results indicate that the expression of individual members of the CesA/Csl superfamily and glycosyl transferases share common regulatory control points, and siRNAs from natural cis-antisense pairs derived from the CesA/Csl superfamily could function in this global regulation of cell-wall synthesis.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ahexosyltransferases 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3abarley 3aHordeum vulgare 3acell walls 3aleaf development 3agene silencing 3acellulose 3agenes 3abeta-glucans 3aleaves 3asmall interfering RNA 0acellulose synthase 0aantisense RNA 0aantisense transcript 0aCesA6 gene 0agene down-regulation 0agene expression regulation1 aPenning, Bryan1 aBrandt, Amanda S.1 aKessans, Sarah A.1 aYong, Weidong1 aScofield, Steven R.1 aCarpita, N.

Modifications included routines for simulating individual leaf appearance rates and leaf expansion as a function of leaf physiological age and plant assimilate status. Coupled sub-models for leaf-level photosynthesis, transpiration, and stomatal conductance were used to replace the older radiation use efficiency approach. A radiation transfer routine that estimated diffuse and direct-beam photosynthetically active radiation for sunlit and shaded leaves was also added. During each time increment, net photosynthetic rate was estimated for sunlit and shaded leaf area. Photosynthate was partitioned among leaves in the canopy according to leaf age, potential expansion, and plant assimilate status. Assimilate allocation to branches, roots, and tubers proceeded according to partitioning coefficients defined in the original model, SIMPOTATO. Remaining photosynthate was stored in the canopy and, when accumulated over a threshold amount, reduced leaf-level photosynthetic rate via feedback inhibition. Whole plant gas exchange and harvest data from SPAR (soil-plant-atmosphere research) chamber experiments conducted at USDA-ARS, Beltsville, MD were used to evaluate SPUDSIM predictions over a broad range of temperatures from 12.6 to 32.3°C (24-h average basis). An additional independent SPAR chamber dataset was used to parameterize SPUDSIM crop coefficients. Root mean square error (RMSE) was less than 0.29molCO₂ m⁻² season⁻¹ for seasonal daily net assimilation rates and indices of agreement (IA) were 0.80 and higher except at the 32.3°C study (0.62). Comparison of canopy photosynthetic rates at four different days indicated the model slightly under-predicted leaf area early in the season and over-predicted later in the season. IA and RMSE for leaf-level photosynthetic rates were above 0.88 and less than 1.6μmolCO₂ m⁻² s⁻¹ respectively for all studies except the 32.3°C (0.61 and 3.8μmolCO₂ m⁻² s⁻¹). Dry matter predictions fell within two standard deviations of measured values for most plant organs at harvest. Overall, these results indicated that SPUDSIM accurately captured potato growth and development responses over a wide-range of temperatures and will be suitable for a variety of applications involving complex soil-plant-atmosphere relationships. 3agas exchange 3aSolanum tuberosum 3atubers 3apotatoes 3aroots 3astomatal conductance 3avegetable crops 3amechanistic models 3aphotosynthesis 3aleaves 3aplant growth 3asimulation models 3asoil-plant-atmosphere interactions 3aphotosynthates 3aleaf area 3aradiation use efficiency 3abranches 3adry matter partitioning 3aaccuracy 3aprediction 3acanopy 3agrowth models 0atranspiration 0adry matter accumulation 0aSPUDSIM1 aTimlin, Dennis J.1 aYang, Y.1 aReddy, V.R.0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2010 Mar. 15, v.  150, no.  3 p.432-442dElsevier Science Ltd.x0168-19237nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/409523Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2010.01.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20100428b20100501c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/03/30  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02794naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024004200113040001800155100001900173245011100192300001600303500002400319506017300343520118300516650002701699650002301726650002901749650001101778650002001789650002001809650002201829650001301851651001501864700002101879700002101900700002301921700002201944773008701966852000902053856009202062856011202154956008502266961000902351655001202360IND4463042020221117225708.0120417e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446304202DNAL7 a10113/551512hdl7 a10.1111/j.1744-7917.2006.00117.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChu, Chang-Chi10aPink bollworm moth (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) catches in the Imperial Valley, California from 1989 to 2003  ap. 469-475.  aIncludes references  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aWe examined the patterns of male pink bollworm (PBW), Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders), moth catches in gossyplure-baited traps over a 15-year period from 1989 to 2003 in the Imperial Valley, California, USA. Monitoring was conducted during periods when different pink bollworm areawide control strategies were being used. Numbers of male pink bollworm moths caught in gossyplure-baited traps progressively decreased each year from 1990 to 1994 during short-season cotton production. High numbers of male moths caught in traps from 1995 to 1997 may have been related to moth migrations from the large cotton acreages grown in the Mexicali Valley bordering the Imperial Valley. Transgenic Bollgard (Bt) cotton was planted in 3% of the cotton area in 1996 and thereafter in 80%–94% of the cotton area from 1997 to 2003. Pink bollworm moth trap catches were significantly lower from 1998 to 2003 than catches in 1995 to 1997, except for 1999. The trapping results suggested that Bt cotton had significant input on reduction of pink bollworm populations, confirming results of other investigators and providing additional documentation on the benefits of the Bt cotton culture. 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aPectinophora gossypiella 3acotton 3acrop production 3apheromone traps 3atransgenic plants 3atrapping 3aCalifornia1 aNatwick, Eric T.1 aLopez, Raul Leon1 aDessert, Jolene R.1 aHenneberry, T.

To comprehensively gauge the economic health of farm operator households' off-farm income is interpreted as an output along with corn, soybeans, livestock and other crops. To accomplish this task two related methodologies were used. First, using 2000 data, a multi-activity cost function was set up to analyse labour allocation decisions within the farm operator household and also to estimate returns to scale and scope. Second, using 1996-2000 data, an input distance function approach was followed to estimate returns to scale, cost economies and technical efficiency - and the relative performance of farm operator households with and without off-farm wages and salaries compared. The cost function and input distance function results both suggest that off-farm outputs and inputs can be modelled in a multi-activity framework and involve significant economies of scope. 3aoff-farm employment 3acorn 3asoybeans 3afarm operators 3afarm income 3ahousehold income 3afarm families 3amethodology 3acost analysis 3aeconometric models 3aUnited States1 aBanker, David0 tApplied economics.g2005 Apr., v.  37, no.  6 p.633-649wJournal:11657x0003-68467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00036840420003235823Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/386413Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100223b20100305c00000000  aINDdYLPe2010/02/23  aNon-US  aUSDA/ERS 7aarticle02815naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131100001700140245009900157300001600256500002500272500001500297520153500312650002201847650001601869650001501885650002201900650001601922650001301938650001901951650001401970653001401984653002401998653001502022700001802037700001502055700001902070773010202089852000902191856011202200930003302312946001102345961001302356655001202369IND8606737720221117030200.0860930e198605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND860673772DNAL7 a10113/240182hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8311 aReeder, R.T.10aInhibition of photosynthetic electron transport by metabolites produced by Phialophora gregata  ap. 371-379.  aIncludes references.  a2019-12-05  aIn soybeans, adzuki beans, and mung beans the disease brown stem rot, which is caused by Phialophora gregata is characterized by vascular browning of the stem and, in some cases, by chlorosis and necrosis of the leaves. We investigated the effect of compounds produced by P. gregata on light-driven electron transport in thylakoid membranes. The compounds investigated were contained in three different extracts isolated from the fungal culture: crude extract, gregatin A and the mother liquor  from the crystallization of gregatin A. Electron transport rates were measured potentiometrically using a Clark-type oxygen electrode and spectrophotometrically by monitoring light-induced absorbance changes due to cytochrome f. The data show that at least one metabolite produced by P. gregata can completely inhibit photosynthetic electron transport. The most potent inhibitor was the mother liquor which inhibited the reaction from H2O to methylviologen by 50% at a concentration of 20 .mu.g  ml-1. Comparison of the efficacy of the different extracts indicates that gregatin A is a less effective inhibitor. The effect of the extracts on electron transport reactions that include limited segments of the photosynthetic apparatus indicates that there are at least two sites of inhibition, the Photosystem II complex and the cytochrome b/f complex. The results raise the possibility that the leaf symptoms observed in the brown rot may be due to inhibition of photosynthetic electron transport by a metabolite produced by P. gregata. 3aCadophora gregata 3aGlycine max 3athylakoids 3aelectron transfer 3ametabolites 3aSpinacia 3aphotosynthesis 3ainfection 0amembranes 0aPhialophora gregata 0ainhibition1 aWhitmarsh, J.1 aGray, L.E.1 aPeterson, R.E.0 tPhysiological and molecular plant pathology.g1986 May, v.  28, no.  3 p.371-379x0048-40597nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/240183Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090220b20090301c00000000  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03273naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003600133024002100169040001800190072000900208100001100217245011200228300001600340500002400356506007600380520102400456506003701480650001801517650001201535650000901547650002201556650002301578650002001601650004301621650002601664650001901690650002101709650002101730650002301751650003301774650002001807650003701827650001701864650001801881650002601899650002701925650003201952650002501984653003002009653003302039700001602072700001202088700001402100700001102114700001802125700001602143700001902159700001302178773006902191852000902260856008602269856011202355930003302467945002502500946001302525961001302538655001202551IND4373524920221207132248.0050823e200401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437352492DNAL7 a150204332pmid7 aPMC14707062pmcid7 a10.1534/genetics.166.1.4192doi7 a10113/159142hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF2001 aMa, H.10aHigh-density linkage mapping revealed suppression of recombination at the sex determination locus in papaya  ap. 419-436.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA high-density genetic map of papaya (Carica papaya L.) was constructed using 54 F2 plants derived from cultivars Kapoho and SunUp with 1501 markers, including 1498 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers, the papaya ringspot virus coat protein marker, morphological sex type, and fruit flesh color. These markers were mapped into 12 linkage groups at a LOD score of 5.0 and recombination frequency of 0.25. The 12 major linkage groups covered a total length of 3294.2 cM, with an average distance of 2.2 cM between adjacent markers. This map revealed severe suppression of recombination around the sex determination locus with a total of 225 markers cosegregating with sex types. The cytosine bases were highly methylated in this region on the basis of the distribution of methylation-sensitive and -insensitive markers. This high-density genetic map is essential for cloning of specific genes of interest such as the sex determination gene and for the integration of genetic and physical maps of papaya.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCarica papaya 3apapayas 3aloci 3asex determination 3achromosome mapping 3agenetic markers 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3agenetic recombination 3alinkage groups 2aBase Composition 2aCaricaxgenetics 2aChromosome Mapping 2aChromosomes, Plantxgenetics 2aDNA Methylation 2aDNA, Plantxchemistryxgenetics. 2aGenes, Plant 2aGenome, Plant 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aRecombination, Genetic 2aSex Determination Processes 2aSuppression, Genetic 0arecombination suppression 0ahigh-density linkage mapping1 aMoore, P.H.1 aLiu, Z.1 aKim, M.S.1 aYu, Q.1 aFitch, M.M.M.1 aSekioka, T.1 aPaterson, A.H.1 aMing, R.0 tGenetics.g2004 Jan., v.  166, no.  1 p.419-436x0016-67317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1534/genetics.166.1.4193Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/159143Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080612b20080704c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/06/06  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02997naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024001700117024003600134024002500170024004100195024002300236040001800259100001700277245007800294520166100372650001402033650002402047650001302071650002902084650003002113650001402143650002102157650001702178700002102195700006002216700002102276773007102297856011402368856008702482961000902569852000902578655001202587IND60782230320221214224114.0220706s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078223032DNAL7 a10113/78223032hdl7 a3868372aris7 a10.1186/s12864-022-08676-52doi7 a4382282aris_accn_no7 a2090-43440-008-000D2aris_project_no7 a3868372seq_no_115  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAoun, Meriem10aGenetic architecture of end-use quality traits in soft white winter wheat  aGenetic improvement of end-use quality is an important objective in wheat breeding programs to meet the requirements of grain markets, millers, and bakers. However, end-use quality phenotyping is expensive and laborious thus, testing is usually delayed until advanced generations. With the decreasing cost of genotyping technologies, molecular markers can help selection for end-use quality in earlier generations. However, to date, marker-assisted selection (MAS) for end-use quality traits has been limited to few major genes. To widen the use of MAS to different end-use quality traits, we investigated the phenotypic and genotypic structure of 14 end-use quality traits in 672 advanced soft white winter wheat breeding lines and cultivars adapted to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. This collection had continuous distributions for the 14 end-use quality traits. The breeding lines and cultivars were genotyped using genotyping-by-sequencing and 40,518 SNP markers were used for association mapping (GWAS). The GWAS identified 178 marker-trait associations (MTAs) distributed across all wheat chromosomes. A total of 40 MTAs were positioned within genomic regions of previously discovered end-use quality genes/QTL. Among the identified MTAs, 58 had larger effects and thus should be prioritized in breeding for end-use quality in soft white wheat. We also identified 17 loci associated with two or more traits, which offers an opportunity for simultaneous breeding for multiple end-use quality traits. MTAs from this study can expand the range of traits/molecular markers used for end-use quality breeding in soft white winter wheat. 3acultivars 3agenetic improvement 3agenomics 3agenotyping by sequencing 3amarker-assisted selection 3aphenotype 3asoft white wheat 3awinter wheat1 aCarter, Arron H.1 aMorris, Craig F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0311-24491 aKiszonas, Alecia0 tBMC genomics.g, v. 23 p.440-wJournal:jnl3943740x1471-21647nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/78223033Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12864-022-08676-53Available from publisher's Web site  bUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02744naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131100001500140245004400155300001600199500002400215500001500239520131600254650001501570650001201585650001201597650002001609650002401629650001101653650001401664650001601678650002101694650002201715650001701737650001501754651001801769653001701787653003601804653002401840653002401864653002301888700001601911773009601927852000902023856011202032930003302144945002502177946001102202961001302213655001202226IND4414456720221117202123.0090105s2003    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND441445672DNAL7 a10113/226772hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8401 aGoff, J.P.10aMilk fever control in the United States  ap. 145-147.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aStrategies for the prevention of milk fever in the United States have made several 180 degree changes over the last several decades. During the 1950's and 1960's evidence suggested that low calcium diets could be utilized to stimulate the parathyroid prior to calving to initiate calcium homeostasis prior to the onset of lactation. High calcium diets were avoided and the strategy worked--for a while, until more concentrated farming practices changed the cation composition of the forages. Although Norwegian scientists presented evidence of a role for cations and anions in milk fever during the late 1960's, recent studies have more precisely defined the physiological link between high diet potassium and tissue sensitivity to parathyroid hormone as a leading cause of milk fever. Manipulation of dietary cation-anion balance has been growing rapidly as a means of controlling not only milk fever but sub-clinical hypocalcemia as well. A recent United States survey found that 45% of dairy operations feed dry cows a "low potassium diet" to reduce milk fever. In addition some use anionic salts. About 27% of dairy farms feed dry cows a diet with added anions to induce a compensated metabolic acidosis which has proved effective in reducing subclinical hypocalcemia. These diets are often high in calcium. 3adairy cows 3acalcium 3acations 3adisease control 3aparathyroid hormone 3aanions 3apotassium 3ahomeostasis 3adietary minerals 3aacid-base balance 3adiet therapy 3amilk fever 3aUnited States 0ahypocalcemia 0adietary cation-anion difference 0ametabolic alkalosis 0acalcium homeostasis 0ametabolic diseases1 aHorst, R.L.0 tActa veterinaria Scandinavica.

Southern highbush blueberry (SHB) is a blueberry cultivar group adapted to warmer climates and has been developed by multiple interspecific hybridizations between elite Northern highbush blueberry (NHB) (Vaccinium corymbosum L.) and low-chill Vaccinium species native to the southern United States. In this study, we employed a collection of diverse SHB accessions and performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for five phenology-related traits using four GWAS models. Phenology-related traits showed higher heritability and larger correlation coefficients between year replications, which resulted in the detection of robust phenotype-genotype association peaks. Notably, a single association peak for the chilling requirement was detected on Chromosome 4 based on multiple GWAS models. Comparison of genotypes at the GWAS peaks between NHB and SHB revealed the putative introgression of low-chill and late-flowering alleles into the highbush genetic pool. Our results provide basic insights into the diversity of phenological traits in blueberry and the genetic establishment of current highbush cultivar groups. 3aVaccinium corymbosum 3ablueberries 3acultivars 3agenetic variation 3agenome-wide association study 3aheritability 3aindigenous species 3aintrogression 3alate flowering 3aphenology1 aNishiyama, Soichiro1 aFujikawa, Mao1 aYamane, Hisayo1 aShirasawa, Kenta1 aBabiker, Ebrahiem1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6464-25291 aTao, Ryutaro0 tFrontiers in plant science.g2022 Jan. 21, v. 12 p.1-18wJournal:2199x1664-462X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2021.7936793Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/7709688  aUSDAbUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03150naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002100127040001800148072000900166072000900175100001500184245014200199300001600341500002400357500001500381520150100396650001401897650002301911650001901934650001801953650001701971650001201988650001502000650002002015650002002035650001002055650002702065650001102092650001202103650001102115653002002126653001702146700001702163700001602180700001802196773009402214852000902308856011202317856008502429930003302514945002502547946001102572961001302583655001202596IND4426971420221120051037.0091009s2008    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND442697142DNAL7 a10.3923/ijps.2008.743.7482doi7 a10113/409602hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ103 0aQ5031 aZhuang, H.10aEffect of Dry-Air Chilling on Warner-Bratzler Shear Force and Water-Holding Capacity of Broiler Breast Meat Deboned Four Hours Postmortem  ap. 743-748.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aAdvantages of air chilling (AC) methods over immersion chilling (IC) methods in quality retention and improvement of deboned chicken breast meat depend on experimental conditions, such as deboning time. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of a dry-AC method on shear force and water-holding capacity (WHC) of broiler breast meat deboned 4h postmortem compared to hot-boned (no chill) or immersion-chilled meat. Ready-to-cook broiler carcasses were hot-boned, chilled by ice water immersion (0.3 °C, 50 min) or chilled by cross-flow cold, dry air (0.7 °C, 150 min). Pectoralis (p.) major and p. minor were removed from the bone at 4 h postmortem. Shear force was measured using a Warner-Bratzler (WB) method and WHC was estimated using cooking yield, drip loss, amount of bound water (filter paper method) and water uptake (swell/centrifugation method). Regardless of muscle type, the WB shear force value of AC samples was significantly lower than that of hot-boned samples; however, there was no difference in the shear force between AC and IC. Regardless of measurement methods, there were no differences (P > 0.05) in WHC between the three treatments. These results demonstrate that when compared to no chill, AC followed by 4 h postmortem deboning can lead to a difference in WB shear values while WHC properties can be retained. For broiler breast meat deboned 4 h postmortem, AC does not result in any significant differences in shear force and WHC when compared to IC. 3adrip loss 3apostmortem changes 3ashear strength 3abreast muscle 3achicken meat 3acooling 3aabsorption 3awater treatment 3ameat tenderness 3awater 3awater holding capacity 3ayields 3acooking 3aboning 0ameat processing 0ameat quality1 aSavage, E.M.1 aSmith, D.P.1 aBerrang, M.E.0 tInternational journal of poultry science.g2008, v.  7, no.  8 p.743-748x1682-83567nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/409603Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3923/ijps.2008.743.7483Available from publisher's Web site  a20100428b20100501c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/04/07  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02173naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092024002100131040001800152072000900170072000900179100002000188245003600208300001600244500002400260500001500284520089000299650001101189650001901200650002301219650002001242650002201262650001901284650001501303653002601318700002201344773008101366852000901447856011201456856008901568930003301657945002501690946001101715961001301726655001201739IND4461753320221118170236.0110914e199112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446175332DNAL7 a10.1016/S0167-5877(05)80004-22doi7 a10113/502442hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF000 0aX6201 aJackson, Ray D.10aInterpreting vegetation indices  ap. 185-200.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aRemotely sensed spectral vegetation indices are widely used and have benefited numerous disciplines interested in the assessment of biomass, water use, plant stress, plant health and crop production. The successful use of these indices requires knowledge of the units of the input variables used to form the indices, and an understanding of the manner in which the external environment and the architectural aspects of a vegetation canopy influence and alter the computed index values. Although vegetation indices were developed to extract the plant signal only, the soil background, moisture condition, solar zenith angle, view angle, as well as the atmosphere, alter the index values in complex ways. The nature of these problems are explored both in an empirical and in a theoretical sense, and suggestions are offered for the effective use and interpretation of vegetation indices. 3acanopy 3aimage analysis 3aplant architecture 3aedaphic factors 3aspectral analysis 3aremote sensing 3avegetation 0aenvironmental factors1 aHuete, Alfredo R.0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g1991 Dec., v.  11, no.  3-4 p.185-2007nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/502443Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0167-5877(05)80004-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20110920b20111007c00000000  aINDdNZMe2011/09/20  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02996naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002100130040001800151072000900169072000900178100001400187245005300201300001400254500008400268500002400352520170100376650002002077650002202097650002402119650001302143650001302156650001702169653002302186773008602209852000902295856011202304856008802416930003302504945002502537946001102562961001302573655001202586IND4366476820221119081335.0050107e20041209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436647682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2004.09.0042doi7 a10113/103942hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL823 0aX3801 aFayer, R.10aCryptosporidium: a water-borne zoonotic parasite  ap. 37-56.  aIn the special issue : Waterborne Zoonotic Parasites / edited by A.A.

Because Cryptosporidium from most of these animals have been identified by oocyst morphology alone with little or no host specificity and/or molecular data to support identification it is not known how many of the reported isolates are actually C. parvum or other species. Cryptosporidiosis is a cause of morbidity and mortality in animals and humans, resulting primarily in diarrhea, and resulting in the most severe infections in immune-compromised individuals. Of 15 named species of Cryptosporidium infectious for nonhuman vertebrate hosts C. baileyi, C. canis, C. felis, C. hominis, C. meleagridis, C. muris, and C. parvum have been reported to also infect humans. Humans are the primary hosts for C. hominis, and except for C. parvum, which is widespread amongst nonhuman hosts and is the most frequently reported zoonotic species, the remaining species have been reported primarily in immunocompromised humans. The oocyst stage can remain infective under cool, moist conditions for many months, especially where water temperatures in rivers, lakes, and ponds remain low but above freezing. Surveys of surface water, groundwater, estuaries, and seawater have dispelled the assumption that Cryptosporidium oocysts are present infrequently and in geographically isolated locations. Numerous reports of outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis related to drinking water in North America, the UK, and Japan, where detection methods are in place, indicate that water is a major vehicle for transmission of cryptosporidiosis. 3aCryptosporidium 3acryptosporidiosis 3awaterborne diseases 3azoonoses 3ataxonomy 3aepidemiology 0aliterature reviews0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2004 Dec. 9, v.  126, no.  1-2 p.37-56x0304-40177nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/103943Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2004.09.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20080225b20080301c00000000  aINDdNZMe2005/01/25  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02229naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002100130040001800151072000900169072000900178100001600187245004100203300001400244500008400258500002400342500001500366520080100381650001201182650001301194650002501207650001801232650002401250650001701274650002201291650001401313653001701327653002301344653001501367773008601382852000901468856011201477856008801589930003301677945002501710946001101735961001301746655001201759IND4366477020221119081305.0050107e20041209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436647702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2004.09.0052doi7 a10113/103952hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL823 0aX3801 aDubey, J.P.10aToxoplasmosis--a waterborne zoonosis  ap. 57-72.  aIn the special issue : Waterborne Zoonotic Parasites / edited by A.A.

Circumstantial evidence suggests that oocyst-induced infections in humans are clinically more severe than tissue cyst-acquired infections. Until recently, water-borne transmission of T. gondii was considered uncommon but a large human outbreak linked to contamination of a municipal water reservoir in Canada by wild felids and the widespread infection by marine mammals in the USA provide reasons to question this view. The present paper reviews information on the biology of oocyst-induced infections of T. gondii in humans and animals and examines possible importance of transmission by water. 3aoocysts 3azoonoses 3adisease transmission 3atoxoplasmosis 3awaterborne diseases 3apathogenesis 3aToxoplasma gondii 3ainfection 0aepidemiology 0aliterature reviews 0aToxoplasma0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2004 Dec. 9, v.  126, no.  1-2 p.57-72x0304-40177nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/103953Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2004.09.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080225b20080301c00000000  aINDdNZMe2005/01/25  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03462naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140072000900149100001600158245008600174300001600260500002400276520224000300650001502540650003202555650002202587650001002609650001802619650001402637650001402651650002902665650000902694700001902703700001602722773008502738852000902823856011202832930003302944945002502977946001303002961001303015655001203028IND4449463420221120221115.0110223e200303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444946342DNAL7 a10113/481522hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL600 0aQ5021 aMills, S.E.10aβ-Adrenergic receptor subtypes that mediate ractopamine stimulation of lipolysis  ap. 662-668.  aIncludes references  aRactopamine HCl is an β-adrenergic receptor (ssAR) ligand that was recently approved for use in swine to enhance carcass leanness. The RR stereoisomer of ractopamine is the most active of the four stereoisomers exhibiting the highest affinity and signaling response. The RR isomer exhibits selective activation of the porcine β2AR, which might limit the lipolytic response to ractopamine because the β1AR is the predominant subtype in swine adipocytes and may mediate most of the lipolytic response. Therefore, we determined the βAR subtypes that mediate the lipolytic response to ractopamine in swine adipocytes. In order to confirm the predominant role of the β1AR in porcine adipocytes, isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis was inhibited by increasing doses of subtype-selective antagonists. Inhibition curves were biphasic using β1AR antagonists (CGP 20712A and bisoprolol) and curve analysis indicated that both β1AR and β2AR contributed to lipolysis with 50 to 60% of the response coming from the β1AR. Inhibition with the β2AR antagonist clenbuterol revealed only one class of βAR that closely approximated the kinetics of the β1AR. When the RR isomer of ractopamine was the lipolytic agent, similar results to isoproterenol were observed, except that the estimated contribution of the β1AR was 38%. That β2AR antagonists did not detect a contribution of the β2AR to lipolysis may indicate that the β1AR masked the response to the β2AR. Dose titration with the RR isomer in the presence of a saturating concentration of β1AR or β2AR antagonists indicated that each subtype was present in sufficient quantities to stimulate lipolysis near maximally. Data indicate that both the β1AR and β2AR are functionally linked to lipolysis in swine adipocytes and that ractopamine activates each subtype. The RR isomer of ractopamine stimulated adenosine 3',5'-cyclic phosphate accumulation with equal efficacy to isoproterenol through the cloned porcine β2AR, but was only 35% as efficacious through the cloned porcine β1AR. These data confirm the β2AR selectivity of the RR stereoisomer, but suggest the partial agonism through the β1AR is sufficient to activate lipolysis through both subtypes in swine adipocytes. 3aadipocytes 3abeta-adrenergic antagonists 3ahormone receptors 3aswine 3aanimal growth 3alean meat 3alipolysis 3abeta-adrenergic agonists 3apork1 aSpurlock, M.E.1 aSmith, D.J.0 tJournal of animal science.g2003 Mar., v.  81, no.  3 p.662-668x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/481523Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20121011b20121102c00000000  aINDdPNNe2011/03/04  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03376naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092024002100123040001800144072000900162100002200171245014400193300001800337500002400355500001500379520157800394650002801972650001202000650001802012650001102030650002502041650001402066650001002080650001002090650002502100650001602125653003702141653001302178653003102191653002802222653003002250653001402280700002202294700002002316700001702336700002502353700002002378773012802398852000902526856008102535856011202616930003302728945002502761946001102786961001302797655001202810IND4419423720221120072206.0090423e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441942372DNAL7 a10.1099/ijs.0.64098-02doi7 a10113/284892hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX3501 aDuncan, Sylvia H.10aProposal of Roseburia faecis sp. nov., Roseburia hominis sp. nov. and Roseburia inulinivorans sp. nov., based on isolates from human faeces  ap. 2437-2441.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aSeven recently cultured bacterial isolates, although similar in their 16S rRNA gene sequences to Roseburia intestinalis L1-82T (DSM 14610T), were not sufficiently related for inclusion within existing species, forming three separate clusters in a 16S rRNA gene phylogenetic tree. The isolates, which were obtained from human stools, were Gram-variable or Gram-negative, strictly anaerobic, slightly curved rods; cells from all strains measured approximately 0.5x1.5-5.0 micrometer and were motile. Two strains belonging to one cluster (A2-181 and A2-183T) were the only strains that were able to grow on glycerol and that failed to grow on any of the complex substrates tested (inulin, xylan and amylopectin). Strains belonging to a second cluster (represented by M6/1 and M72/1T) differed from the other isolates in their ability to grow on sorbitol. Isolates belonging to a third cluster (L1-83 and A2-194T) were the only strains that failed to grow on xylose and that gave good growth on inulin (strains M6/1 and M72/1T gave weak growth). All strains were net acetate utilizers. The DNA G+C contents of representative Roseburia strains A2-183T, A2-194T, M72/1T and R. intestinalis L1-82T were 47.4, 41.4, 42.0 and 42.6 mol%, respectively. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, three novel Roseburia species are proposed, with the names Roseburia hominis sp. nov. (type strain A2-183T=DSM 16839T=NCIMB 14029T), Roseburia inulinivorans sp. nov. (type strain A2-194T=DSM 16841T=NCIMB 14030T) and Roseburia faecis sp. nov.

American soybean cultivars (old), modern N. American soybean (elite), and Asian cultivated soybean landraces that were the immediate results of domestication from the wild soybean. Proteins were well separated by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) and stained protein cut from a 2D-PAGE indicated that KTI exists as multiple isoforms (spots) in soybean. Protein spots of KTI were identified and characterized using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). Although overall distribution patterns of the KTI protein spots appeared similar, the number and intensity of the protein spots between wild and cultivated genotypes varied. Three KTI peptides were identified in three of the wild genotypes, PI 393551, PI 407027 and PI 407282, in which KTI3 peptide showed highest intensity. The remaining wild genotype, PI 366120, showed four protein spots. In contrast, the ancestors, modern and Asian landrace genotypes showed only two protein spots corresponding to KTI. On the basis of DNA blot analysis, there is one copy of the KTI3 gene in all 16 genotypes. Polymorphism was detected in one of the wild genotypes (PI 366120) both in proteomic and genomic analyses. Our data suggest that the major variation of protein profiles were between wild and cultivated soybean genotypes rather than among genotypes in the same group. Genetic variation of KTI1, KTI2 and KTI3-related genes were detected within and between groups. 3aGlycine soja 3aGlycine max 3asoybeans 3agenetic variation 3aplant proteins 3aKunitz-type proteinase inhibitor 3aproteome 3agenome 3aplant genetics 3atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis1 aXu, C.1 aBae, H.1 aBailey, B.A.0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2007 June 4, v.  164, no.  6 p.756-763x0176-16177nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/350613Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2006.05.0143Available from publisher's Web site.  a20091022b20091106c00000000  aINDdRSCe2007/06/05  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03269naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002100130040001800151072000900169072000900178100002100187245011500208300001400323500002400337500001500361520162000376650001301996650001902009650001902028650001302047650001502060650001202075650002002087650002602107650001602133650003502149653003102184700001502215700001402230700001902244700001602263700001802279700001302297700001402310700001302324773008702337852000902424856011202433856008802545930003302633945002502666946001102691961001302702655001202715IND4368092820221119081408.0050401e20050310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436809282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2004.11.0042doi7 a10113/103972hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL823 0aL8101 aMatsubayashi, M.10aCross-reactivities with Cryptosporidium spp. by chicken monoclonal antibodies that recognize avian Eimeria spp  ap. 47-57.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aIn a previous study, we have developed several chicken monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against Eimeria acervulina (EA) in order to identify potential ligand molecules of Eimeria. One of these mAbs, 6D-12-G10, was found to recognize a conoid antigen of EA sporozoites and significantly inhibited the sporozoite invasions of host T lymphocytes in vitro. Furthermore, some of these chicken mAbs showed cross-reactivities with several different avian Eimeria spp. and the mAb 6D-12-G10 also demonstrated cross-reactivities with the tachyzoites of Neospora caninum and Toxoplasma gondii. Cryptosporidium spp. are coccidian parasites closely related to Eimeria spp., and especially C. parvum is an important cause of diarrhea in human and mammals. In the present study, to assess that the epitopes recognized by these chicken mAbs could exist on Cryptosporidium parasites, we examined the cross-reactivity of these mAbs with Cryptosporidium spp. using an indirect immunofluorescent assay (IFA) and Western blotting analyses. In IFA by chicken mAbs, the mAb 6D-12-G10 only showed a immunofluorescence staining at the apical end of sporozoites of C. parvum and C. muris, and merozoites of C. parvum. Western blotting analyses revealed that the mAb 6D-12-G10 reacted with the 48-kDa molecular weight band of C. parvum and C. muris oocyst antigens, 5D-11 reacted the 155 kDa of C. muris. Furthermore, these epitopes appeared to be periodate insensitive. These results indicate that the target antigen recognized by these chicken mAbs might have a shared epitope, which is present on the apical complex of apicomplexan parasites. 3achickens 3across reaction 3aimmunoblotting 3aepitopes 3amerozoites 3aEimeria 3aCryptosporidium 3amonoclonal antibodies 3asporozoites 3afluorescent antibody technique 0aantigen-antibody reactions1 aKimata, I.1 aIseki, M.1 aLillehoj, H.S.1 aMatsuda, H.1 aNakanishi, T.1 aTani, H.1 aSasai, K.1 aBaba, E.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2005 Mar. 10, v.  128, no.  1-2 p.47-57x0304-40177nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/103973Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2004.11.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20080225b20080301c00000000  aINDdNZMe2005/05/04  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03300naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147024002100166040001800187100002000205245007200225300002000297500002400317500001500341506007600356520124800432506003701680650001001717650001501727650001401742650001901756650002301775650002901798650001301827650001601840650001601856650001701872650003301889650002201922650001401944650002101958650002001979650002501999650001202024650001402036650003202050650001802082653001302100700001502113700001702128700002202145700001702167773017802184852000902362856008302371856011202454930003302566945002502599946001302624961001302637655001202650IND4444274120221207125412.0101029e20101026xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444427412DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10119571072doi7 aPMC29730052pmcid7 a209378532pmid7 a10113/494842hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Shengming10aR gene-controlled host specificity in the legume-rhizobia symbiosis  ap. 18735-18740.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLeguminous plants can enter into root nodule symbioses with nitrogen-fixing soil bacteria known as rhizobia. An intriguing but still poorly understood property of the symbiosis is its host specificity, which is controlled at multiple levels involving both rhizobial and host genes. It is widely believed that the host specificity is determined by specific recognition of bacterially derived Nod factors by the cognate host receptor(s). Here we describe the positional cloning of two soybean genes Rj2 and Rfg1 that restrict nodulation with specific strains of Bradyrhizobium japonicum and Sinorhizobium fredii, respectively. We show that Rj2 and Rfg1 are allelic genes encoding a member of the Toll-interleukin receptor/nucleotide-binding site/leucine-rich repeat (TIR-NBS-LRR) class of plant resistance (R) proteins. The involvement of host R genes in the control of genotype-specific infection and nodulation reveals a common recognition mechanism underlying symbiotic and pathogenic host-bacteria interactions and suggests the existence of their cognate avirulence genes derived from rhizobia. This study suggests that establishment of a root nodule symbiosis requires the evasion of plant immune responses triggered by rhizobial effectors.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3agenes 3anodulation 3areceptors 3aplant proteins 3agenetic resistance 3aBradyrhizobium japonicum 3agenotype 3aGlycine max 3ahost plants 3aroot nodules 3abacterial diseases of plants 3amolecular cloning 3aRhizobium 3ahost specificity 3aimmune response 3aSinorhizobium fredii 3aleucine 3asymbiosis 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3abinding sites 0aFabaceae1 aTang, Fang1 aGao, Muqiang1 aKrishnan, Hari B.1 aZhu, Hongyan0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Oct. 26, v.  107, no.  43 p.18735-18740dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10119571073Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/494843Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20110727b20110805c00000000  aINDdYLPe2011/07/26  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03155naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002100127040001800148072000900166072000900175072000900184072000900193100002100202245011100223300001600334500002400350520152400374650001701898650001901915650002301934650003001957650002701987650002102014650001902035650002202054650003202076650002602108650002702134653002302161653002202184700002702206700002402233773009202257852000902349856011202358856008502470930003302555945002502588946001102613961001302624655001202637IND4431013820221118170241.0100108e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443101382DNAL7 a10.1007/s10526-009-9240-y2doi7 a10113/502502hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aL300 0aL001 0aX3301 aJackson, Mark A.10aEcological considerations in producing and formulating fungal entomopathogens for use in insect biocontrol  ap. 129-145.  aIncludes references  aInsect pests persist in a wide-variety of agricultural, arboreal and urban environments. Effective control with fungal entomopathogens using inundation biocontrol requires an understanding of the ecology of the target insect, fungal pathogen, and the insect-pathogen interaction. Historically, the development of production and formulation processes for biocontrol fungi has primarily focused on reducing costs by maximizing the yield of infective propagules, increasing storage stability, and improving product form for ease of application. These goals are critical for commercialization but are often in conflict with environmental and ecological considerations. Critical parameters for selecting a fungal pathogen for use in inundation biocontrol include the cost-effective production of a stable, infective propagule that is suited for use in the environment where the insect must be controlled. Production processes can be manipulated nutritionally and environmentally to produce efficacious propagules or to direct fungal differentiation to propagule forms that may be better suited for use in specific environments. Formulation development must also consider ecological and environmental factors to maximize biocontrol efficacy. A basic understanding of the surface chemistries of the fungal propagule and insect, the interactions between a fungal propagule and the insect cuticle that lead to infection, and the impact of the environment on this interaction can aid in the development of effective formulations. 3ainsect pests 3ainsect control 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3aentomopathogenic fungi 3amycoinsecticides 3ainsect ecology 3amicrobial ecology 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3aenvironmental factors 3apesticide formulations 0aecological factors 0afungal propagules1 aDunlap, Christopher A.1 aJaronski, Stefan T.0 tBioControl.g2010 Feb., v.  55, no.  1 p.129-145dSpringer Netherlandsx1386-61417nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/502503Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10526-009-9240-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110922b20111007c00000000  aINDdNZMe2011/09/22  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03202naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002100134040001800155072000900173072000900182072000900191100001500200245014800215300001600363500007500379500002400454500001500478520128700493650001601780650002601796650002301822650001901845650001501864650001501879650001501894650002001909650001601929650001601945650001701961650001201978650001401990650001402004650001302018650002302031650001902054650001402073650001402087650002102101653002302122653001702145653002002162773009902182852000902281856011202290856009202402930003302494945002502527946001102552961001302563655001202576IND4382485120221120162933.0060801e20060309xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438248512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2005.08.0052doi7 a10113/350672hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL840 0aL500 0aL6001 aGoff, J.P.10aMacromineral physiology and application to the feeding of the dairy cow for prevention of milk fever and other periparturient mineral disorders  ap. 237-257.  aIn the special issue: Feed and animal health / edited by K.

The animal is tremendously challenged to maintain calcium homeostasis. Those that fail can develop milk fever, a clinical disorder that is life threatening to the cow and predisposes the cow to a variety of other disorders. Less dramatic sub-clinical hypocalcemia can also reduce productivity of cattle by reducing feed intake in early lactation. The cause and prevention of milk fever will be discussed, focusing on the role of diet cation–anion difference and use of low calcium diets. The periparturient period also typically causes minor perturbations in blood potassium and phosphorus concentrations. Occasionally these disturbances are severe enough to be the cause of recumbency and the “downer cow” syndrome. Pathogenesis of these syndromes will be discussed. Low blood magnesium concentrations are observed when animals are fed inadequate amounts of magnesium or some factor is present in the diet, which prevents adequate absorption of magnesium. Severe hypomagnesemia can cause tetany and the downer cow syndrome, but more commonly moderate hypomagnesemia impairs the ability of the cow to maintain calcium homeostasis and hypocalcemia occurs secondary to the hypomagnesemia. 3acow feeding 3adiet-related diseases 3adisease prevention 3ahypomagnesemia 3aphosphorus 3amilk fever 3adairy cows 3ablood chemistry 3aparturition 3ahomeostasis 3apathogenesis 3acalcium 3apregnancy 3apotassium 3aetiology 3anutritional status 3adowner animals 3alactation 3amagnesium 3adietary minerals 0aliterature reviews 0ahypocalcemia 0atransition cows0 tAnimal feed science and technology.g2006 Mar. 9, v.  126, no.  3-4 p.237-257x0377-84017nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/350673Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2005.08.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20091022b20091106c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/10/25  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04263naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024004100132024002100173040001800194072000900212100001600221245014000237300001800377500002400395500001500419506007600434520186900510506003702379650001302416650002002429650001102449650001402460650002702474650002302501650001602524650001002540650001702550650001002567650002102577650001202598650003602610650002502646650004202671650007402713650002402787650002202811650001402833650001102847650002602858650001502884650002402899650002402923651001202947651001202959653001402971700001602985700001803001700001503019700001803034700001703052700001203069700001603081773010003097852000903197856009103206856011203297930003303409945002503442946001303467961001303480655001203493IND4363680920221207050641.0040803e200302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436368092DNAL7 a125710332pmid7 aPMC1435882pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.69.2.1089-1092.20032doi7 a10113/199062hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW0001 aScott, T.M.10aGeographical variation in ribotype profiles of Escherichia coli isolates from humans, swine, poultry, beef, and dairy cattle in Florida  ap. 1089-1092.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWaters impacted by fecal pollution can exact high risks to human health and can result in financial losses due to closures of water systems used for recreation and for harvesting seafood. Identifying the sources of fecal pollution in water is paramount in assessing the potential human health risks involved as well as in assessing necessary remedial action. Recently, various researchers have used the ribotyping method to identify sources of bacterial indicators (Escherichia coli and enterococci) in environmental waters. While these studies have identified genotypic differences between human- and animal-derived indicators that are capable of differentiating organisms isolated from humans and various animal hosts, most have focused on organisms collected from a confined geographic area and have not addressed the question of whether these ribotype profiles are watershed specific or if they can be applied universally to organisms from other geographic locations. In this study, E. coli isolates were obtained from humans, beef cattle, dairy cattle, swine, and poultry from locations in northern, central, and southern Florida and were subjected to ribotyping analysis. The intent was to determine (i) if ribotype profiles are capable of discriminating the source of E. coli at the host species level and (ii) if the resulting fingerprints are uniform over an extended geographic area or if they can be applied only to a specific watershed. Our research indicated that, using a single restriction enzyme (HindIII), the ribotyping procedure is not capable of differentiating E. coli isolates from the different animal species sampled in this study. Results indicate, however, that this procedure can still be used effectively to differentiate E. coli as being either human or animal derived when applied to organisms isolated from a large geographic region.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achickens 3awater pollution 3ahumans 3aribotypes 3ageographical variation 3astrain differences 3abeef cattle 3afeces 3adairy cattle 3aswine 3aEscherichia coli 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Domesticxmicrobiology 2aCattlexmicrobiology 2aDeoxyribonuclease HindIIIxmetabolism 2aEscherichia colixclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aFecesxmicrobiology 2aGenetic Variation 2aGeography 2aHumans 2aPoultryxmicrobiology 2aRibotyping 2aSpecies Specificity 2aSwinexmicrobiology 3aFlorida 0aFlorida 0aisolation1 aParveen, S.1 aPortier, K.M.1 aRose, J.B.1 aTamplin, M.L.1 aFarrah, S.R.1 aKoo, A.1 aLukasik, J.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2003 Feb., v.  69, no.  2 p.1089-1092x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.69.2.1089-1092.20033Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/199063Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20081005b20081101c00000000  aINDdRHFe2004/08/13  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02996naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024001700117024003900134024002500173024004100198024002300239040001800262100001300280245011000293520164100403650001802044650001402062650001802076650002002094650001102114650001402125650001202139700002202151700002902173700001702202700006102219700002502280773004702305856011402352856009002466961000902556852000902565655001202574IND60781959220221214224729.0220705s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078195922DNAL7 a10113/78195922hdl7 a3889652aris7 a10.1080/21505594.2022.20826452doi7 a4411242aris_accn_no7 a6040-32000-083-000D2aris_project_no7 a3889652seq_no_115  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Huia10aCoinfection in the host can result in functional complementation between live vaccines and virulent virus  aOne of the greatest achievements of the last century is the development of vaccines against viral diseases. Vaccines are essential for battling infectious diseases and many different formulations are available, including live attenuated vectored vaccines. However, the use of live attenuated vaccines has the potential for adverse effects, including reversion of pathogenicity, recombination, and functional complementation in the host. Marek's disease is a serious disease in poultry controlled by live attenuated vaccines that has resulted in increased virulence over the decades. Recombination between circulating field viruses or vaccines is a proposed mechanism for the increase in virulence, but thus far there is little evidence to show this to occur in nature. Here, we describe a unique mechanism contributing to increased virulence, the result of complementation of vaccines with non-transmissible virulent virus to yield transmissible virulent virus. Using the natural virus-host model of Marek's disease in chickens, our results show dual infection of cells in chickens with vaccine and virulent virus providing the opportunity for recombination or complementation to transpire. Our results show no evidence of recombination between vaccine and virulent virus, but functional complementation occurred in two independent experiments providing proof for complementation during natural infection in vaccinated individuals. These results suggest complementation as a potential mechanism for vaccine-mediated viral evolution and the potential for complementation should be taken into consideration when developing novel vaccines. 3aMarek disease 3aevolution 3alive vaccines 3amixed infection 3amodels 3avirulence 3aviruses1 aKriter, Andrea L.1 aPonnuraj, Nagendraprabhu1 aTien, Yvette1 aKim, Taejoong Nmn1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5699-998X1 aJarosinski, Keith W.0 tVirulence.wJournal:28635x2150-55947nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/78195923Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21505594.2022.20826453Available from publisher's Web site  bUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03172naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002500111024002100136040001800157072000900175072000900184100001800193245011400211300001800325500002400343500002300367500001500390520127200405650001801677650001801695650001601713650001401729650001401743650002601757650002501783650001001808650004101818650004801859650002801907650001401935650002701949650001501976650006901991653002802060653001402088700001802102700001702120700001702137700001202154700001902166773009502185852000902280856007502289856011202364930003302476945002502509946001102534961001302545655001202558IND4369161520221116164639.0050421e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436916152DNAL7 a157142372pmid7 a10.1139/w04-0912doi7 a10113/386362hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL832 0aL0011 aRegassa, L.B.10aDifferentiation of group VIII Spiroplasma strains with sequences of the 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer region  ap. 1061-1067.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-05  aSpiroplasma species (Mollicutes: Spiroplasmataceae) are associated with a wide variety of insects, and serology has classified this genus into 34 groups, 3 with subgroups. The 16S rRNA gene has been used for phylogenetic analysis of spiroplasmas, but this approach is uninformative for group VIII because the serologically distinct subgroups generally have similarity coefficients >0.990. Therefore, we investigated the utility of the 16S–23S rRNA spacer region as a means to differentiate closely related subgroups or strains. We generated intergenic sequences and detailed serological profiles for 8 group VIII Spiroplasma strains. Sequence analyses using Maximum Parsimony, Neighbor Joining, and Maximum Likelihood placed the strains into 2 clades. One clade consisted of strains BARC 2649 and GSU5367. The other clade was divided into clusters containing representatives of the 3 designated group VIII subgroups (EA-1, DF-1, and TAAS-1) and 3 previously unclassified strains. The stability of the positions of the strains in various analytical models and the ability to provide robust support for groupings tentatively supported by serology indicates that the 16S-23S intergenic rDNA sequence will prove useful in intragroup analysis of group VIII spiroplasmas. 3aribosomal RNA 3aribosomal DNA 3aSpiroplasma 3aphylogeny 3aTabanidae 3amolecular systematics 3anucleotide sequences 3agenes 2aDNA, Bacterialxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDNA, Ribosomal Spacerxchemistryxgenetics. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSerotyping 2aSpiroplasmaxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 0amolecular sequence data 0aisolation1 aStewart, K.M.1 aMurphy, A.C.1 aFrench, F.E.1 aLin, T.1 aWhitcomb, R.F.0 tCanadian journal of microbiology.g2004 Dec., v.  50, no.  12 p.1061-1067x0008-41667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/w04-0913Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/386363Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100222b20100305c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/05/06  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04222naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111024002100153040001800174072000900192072000900201072000900210072000900219100001700228245008800245300001600333500002400349520200000373650002202373650001602395650002402411650001402435650001602449650001402465650001302479650001902492650001502511650003602526650002502562650001202587650001702599650002502616650001202641650001302653650002602666650001102692650002602703650002402729650002602753650000902779650003702788650002802825650003102853650003802884650002402922650001702946650004402963651001403007653001303021653001403034700002303048773011003071852000903181856009203190856011203282930003303394945002503427946001103452961001303463655001203476IND4404547120221117160642.0080418e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440454712DNAL7 a182483862pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2656.2008.01355.x2doi7 a10113/323602hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aL600 0aL001 0aL3001 aLee, Jana C.10aFloral resources impact longevity and oviposition rate of a parasitoid in the field  ap. 565-572.  aIncludes references  a1. The use of floral resource subsidies to improve herbivore suppression by parasitoids requires certain trophic interactions and physiological changes to occur. While the longevity and fecundity of parasitoids are positively affected by nectar subsidies in laboratory studies, the impacts of floral subsidies on the fecundity and longevity of freely foraging parasitoids have not been studied. 2. We studied the longevity and per capita fecundity of naturally occurring Diadegma insulare foraging in cabbage plots with and without borders of flowering buckwheat, Fagopyrum esculentum, as well as relationships between longevity, fecundity, sugar feeding and parasitism rates on larvae of the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella. 3. Relative longevity was estimated by counting broken setae on the fringe of the forewing. Floral borders increased the longevity of males and females in adjacent cabbage plots. 4. The egg maturation rate of D. insulare was estimated by comparing egg loads of females collected early in the day with egg loads of females held without hosts in field cages throughout the day. Females in buckwheat cages matured 2·7 eggs per hour while females in control cages resorbed 0·27 eggs over the same time period. 5. The fecundity of females collected in the afternoon was estimated by comparing their actual egg load to the estimated egg load in the absence of oviposition for females in a given plot. Females foraging in buckwheat plots had marginally fewer eggs remaining in their ovaries, and laid marginally more eggs than females in control plots. Females from both treatments carried 30-60 eggs by the afternoon and therefore were time-limited rather than egg-limited. 6. Plots where a greater proportion of females had fed on sugar had longer-lived females. This suggests that feeding enhanced longevity of D. insulare. However, plots with longer-lived and more fecund females did not exhibit higher parasitism rates, although the power of these tests were low. 3aDiadegma insulare 3aparasitoids 3aPlutella xylostella 3alongevity 3aoviposition 3afecundity 3aforaging 3anectar feeding 3aparasitism 3aBrassica oleracea var. capitata 3aFagopyrum esculentum 3aflowers 3aedge effects 2aAgriculturexmethods 2aAnimals 2aBrassica 2aFagopyrumxmetabolism 2aFemale 2aFertilityxphysiology 2aLarvaxparasitology 2aLongevityxphysiology 2aMale 2aMothsxparasitologyxphysiology. 2aOvipositionxphysiology 2aOvumxgrowth & development 2aPest Control, Biologicalxmethods 2aRegression Analysis 2aTime Factors 2aWaspsxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 3aMinnesota 0aegg load 0awing wear1 aHeimpel, George E.0 tJournal of animal ecology.g2008 May, v.  77, no.  3 p.565-572dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0021-87907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2008.01355.x3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/323603Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090818b20091002c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/08/18  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle01872naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140072000900149100001600158245005000174300001600224500002400240500001500264520058400279650003000863650001200893650001800905650001400923650001100937650001500948650002200963650001900985650001801004651001801022651001101040653001701051653001901068700001501087700001401102773005701116852000901173856011201182930003301294945002501327946001301352961001301365655001201378IND4369145720221116164731.0050421e200501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436914572DNAL7 a10113/386372hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF700 0aF400 0aF2001 aRipkova, S.10aCrepidotus crocophyllus includes C. nephrodes  ap. 397-403.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aMany species of the agaric genus Crepidotus are distinguished based on single, potentially variable morphological characters.

Black beans were milled into flour using a commercial knife or compression/decompression mill (C/D mill). The C/D mill-derived pastas had medium protein (Combo-MP) and low protein (Cyclone-LP) concentrations. Three black bean flour pastas (Knife, Combo-MP, and Cyclone-MP) were compared to two controls: whole black beans and white bread. Treatments contained 50g available carbohydrate. Plasma glucose, serum insulin, and appetite measures were collected at fasting and 30, 60, 90, 150, and 180 minutes postprandial. Gastrointestinal symptoms were evaluated 10-12 hours postprandial. ANOVA (one-way, repeated measures) was used to evaluate satiety, gastrointestinal symptoms, sensory variables, glucose and insulin differences from baseline, and incremental area under the curve (iAUC) by time and/or treatment. Three-hour glucose and insulin iAUCs were lower with whole black beans than white bread. Black bean pasta meals increased satiety, reduced appetite, and produced numerically lower glucose and insulin responses than white bread. However, no differences were observed between pasta types, indicating a similar metabolic response regardless of milling technique. Our results provide evidence for dietary guidance to reduce postprandial glucose and related health risks through pulse food products. 3aappetite 3abean flour 3abiochemical pathways 3ablack beans 3ablood glucose 3ablood serum 3across-over studies 3adietary recommendations 3agastrointestinal system 3aglucose 3ahyperinsulinemia 3ainsulin 3apasta 3asatiety 3awhite bread1 aThompson, Sharon V.1 aHeer, Michelle M.1 aDavitt, Elizabeth E.1 aHooper, Sharon D.1 aCichy, Karen A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4311-07741 aKnoblauch, Simon T.0 tFoods.g, v. 11, no. 11 p.1652-wJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/78195953Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods111116523Available from publisher's Web site  bUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02817naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092024002100119040001800140072000900158100002200167245007800189300001800267500002400285500001500309520113900324650001701463650001701480650002401497650001401521650001601535650002001551650001101571650001901582650001601601650001301617650001701630650001301647650001701660650002301677650002501700650002601725653001301751700002101764700002501785700001901810773015201829852000901981856011201990856007702102930003302179945002502212946001302237961001302250655001202263IND4404012920221123035543.0080404e20080605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440401292DNAL7 a10.1002/app.275252doi7 a10113/323622hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ3001 aPatil, Damodar R.10aApplication of hydrophilic starch-based coatings on polyethylene surfaces  ap. 2749-2755.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aCoatings were applied to polyethylene (PE) film surfaces by spraying formulations prepared from a jet cooked dispersion of waxy cornstarch, a water-born epoxy resin, a wax emulsion, and a fluorinated surfactant. The air-dried coatings were comprised of discontinuous areas of polymer that adhered tightly to the PE surface. Although the starch component separated rapidly from the coating when the film was placed in water at room temperature, heating the coated film for 24 h at 80°C increased the adhesion of starch and produced a surface coating that remained uniformly wet when the film was placed in water. Most of the starch, however, could be still be removed by gently rubbing the wet surface. If melamine-formaldehyde resin was added to the formulation as a crosslinking agent for starch, and the coated film was then heated for 24 h at 80°C, most of the starch remained bonded to the wet coating, even after the surface was gently rubbed. Identification of successful spray application techniques and formulations will allow the development of commercial production methods for starch-coated PE films and similar products. 3awax coatings 3acrosslinking 3apackaging materials 3awaxy corn 3acorn starch 3apolysaccharides 3aresins 3afood packaging 3asurfactants 3aepoxides 3apolyethylene 3amelamine 3aformaldehyde 3acomposite polymers 3ahydrophilic polymers 3afood contact surfaces 0acoatings1 aFanta, George F.1 aFelker, Frederick C.1 aSalch, John H.0 tJournal of applied polymer science.g2008 June 05, v.  108, no.  5 p.2749-2755dWiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Companyx0021-89957nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/323623Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/app.275253Available from publisher's Web site  a20090818b20091002c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/08/18  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03301naa a2200877 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111024002100153040001800174072000900192072000900201100001300210245020600223300001600429500002400445500001500469520057900484650001701063650001101080650002001091650001901111650001901130650002001149650001501169650000801184650001701192650002401209650002001233650002601253650001801279650001901297650002001316650001601336650002601352650002601378650001901404650001301423650001201436650002501448650002601473650002501499650001901524650000801543650001901551650001701570650003001587650004301617650002101660650002001681650001001701650003001711650005001741650002101791650004201812650001701854650001801871653001101889653002801900653001501928700001901943700001301962700001401975700001401989773011302003852000902116856009202125856011202217930003302329945002502362946001102387961001302398655001202411IND4405405820221121073753.0080509e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440540582DNAL7 a182669022pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-3040.2008.01793.x2doi7 a10113/159112hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ115 0aF2001 aMaul, P.10aTranscriptome profiling of grapefruit flavedo following exposure to low temperature and conditioning treatments uncovers principal molecular components involved in chilling tolerance and susceptibility  ap. 752-768.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aA pre-storage conditioning (CD) treatment of 16 °C for 7 d enhanced chilling tolerance of grapefruit and reduced the development of chilling injuries during storage at 5 °C.

A more accurate and reproducible method, particularly suitable for determining TI activity of heat-processed samples, has been used in this study. Toasted soy flour has much greater TI activity when assayed by the modified procedure because it is now possible to measure the activity of insoluble TI. The destruction of TI activity in defatted soy flakes by line steam at 100°C was determined by the modified procedure. Samples containing graded levels of TI activity were fed to rats. As TI activity decreased, wt. gain, protein efficiency ratio, and N digestibility rapidly increased and pancreatic hypertrophy decreased. The adverse effects of raw meal as measured by these 4 biological parameters disappeared at different levels of TI activity in the diet. No pancreatic hypertrophy occurred in rats fed soy flour in which only 55-69% of TI activity had been destroyed. Max. body wt., protein efficiency values, and N digestibility were obtained with rats fed soy samples in which 79-87% of the inhibitors were inactivated. Additional heat treatment did not further improve nutritive value. Data do not support claims that residual TI in properly processed soy flour has antinutritional properties. 3apancreas 3aprotein value 3atrypsin inhibitors 3adigestion 3atissue weight 3atoasting 3aantinutritional factors 3apancreatic diseases 3adefatted foods 3asoy flour 3abioassays 3arats 3alipid content 3afood intake 3aweight gain 3anitrogen 3aash content 3aanimal models 3aprotein content 3ahypertrophy 0anitrogen digestibility 0apancreas weight 0asoybean products 0aprotein efficiency ratio1 aMcGhee, J.E.0 tCereal chemistry.g1975 , v.  52, no.  1 p.85-92x0009-03527nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/299773Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090609b20090703c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/06/09  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02934naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111040001800132072000900150072000900159072000900168100002000177245011200197300001800309500002400327520119300351650001801544650001601562650001501578650002201593650001901615650002901634650001401663650001701677650001801694650004101712650002801753650002401781650005601805650003101861650002001892650001101912650005801923650001801981650001701999650002302016700002102039773010302060852000902163856011202172930003302284945002502317946001302342961001302355655001202368IND4426383420221120204801.0090922e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442638342DNAL7 a197779062pmid7 a10113/350522hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ103 0aQ203 0aX1001 aThomas, Colleen10aThermal Inactivation of H5N2 High-Pathogenicity Avian Influenza Virus in Dried Egg White with 7.5% Moisture  ap. 1997-2000.  aIncludes references  aHigh-pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) cause severe systemic disease with high mortality in chickens. Isolation of HPAIV from the internal contents of chicken eggs has been reported, and this is cause for concern because HPAIV can be spread by movement of poultry products during marketing and trade activity. This study presents thermal inactivation data for the HPAIV strain A/chicken/PA/1370/83 (H5N2) (PA/83) in dried egg white with a moisture content (7.5%) similar to that found in commercially available spray-dried egg white products. The 95% upper confidence limits for D-values calculated from linear regression of the survival curves at 54.4, 60.0, 65.5, and 71.1°C were 475.4, 192.2, 141.0, and 50.1 min, respectively. The line equation y [0.05494 x °C] + 5.5693 (root mean square error = 0.0711) was obtained by linear regression of experimental D-values versus temperature. Conservative predictions based on the thermal inactivation data suggest that standard industry pasteurization protocols would be very effective for HPAIV inactivation in dried egg white. For example, these calculations predict that a 7-log reduction would take only 2.6 days at 54.4°C. 3awater content 3aegg albumen 3adried eggs 3aInfluenza A virus 3apasteurization 3ainactivation temperature 3avirulence 3aspray drying 3alinear models 3aviral diseases of animals and humans 2aConsumer Product Safety 2aEgg Whitexvirology 2aFood Contaminationxanalysisxprevention & control. 2aFood Preservationxmethods 2aHot Temperature 2aHumans 2aInfluenza A Virus, H5N2 Subtypexgrowth & development 2aLinear Models 2aTime Factors 2aVirus Inactivation1 aSwayne, David E.0 tJournal of food protection.g2009 Sept., v.  72, no.  9 p.1997-2000wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/350523Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100728b20100807c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/09/30  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04554naa a2200925 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111024002100150040001800171072001700189072001700206100001600223245014100239300001800380500002400398500001500422520161400437650002302051650001302074650001802087650002202105650001402127650003102141650001602172650001402188650002502202650001402227650002402241650002402265650002502289650000902314650001402323650001402337650001502351650001802366650001602384650003402400650001202434650003202446650002302478650005302501650001102554650002402565650004702589650004602636650006802682650002802750650002602778650001402804650004802818650003102866650002102897650003502918650001002953650002402963653002802987653003103015653002503046653002803071653001003099700001403109700001503123700001303138700001703151700001603168700001403184700002203198773010203220852000903322856008903331856011203420930003303532945002503565946001303590961001303603655001203616IND4365729020210821000000.0041122e200304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436572902DNAL7 a126064232pmid7 a10.1095/biolreprod.102.0089122doi7 a10113/103892hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In the present study, the cDNA of a chemokine, interferon (IFN)-γ-inducible protein 10 kDa (IP-10), was identified from a cDNA subtraction study between uterine endometrial tissues from Day 17 pregnant and Day 15 cyclic ewes. The effect of IFN-taú on IP-10 expression and the involvement of IP-10 in the recruitment of immune cells were then investigated. Northern blot analysis revealed that large amounts of IP-10 mRNA were present during conceptus attachment to maternal endometrium and early placentation. IP-10 mRNA was localized to monocytes distributed in the subepithelial stroma of pregnant but not cyclic uteri. This finding was supported by the discovery of IP-10 mRNA expression in monocytes but not in lymphocytes, uterine epithelial cells, or stromal cells. Moreover, the expression of IP-10 mRNA by the monocytes was stimulated by IFN-α, IFN-γ, and IFN-tau in a dose-dependent manner, but the expression of IP-10 mRNA by the endometrial explants was most stimulated by IFN-tau. In a chemotaxis assay, migration of peripheral blood mononuclear cells was stimulated by the addition of IFN- stimulated-endometrial culture medium, and the effect was significantly reduced by neutralization with an anti-IP-10 antibody. These results suggest that endometrial IP-10 regulated by conceptus IFN-tau regulates recruitment and/or distribution of immune cells seen in the early pregnant uterus. 3atemporal variation 3aimmunity 3amessenger RNA 3acomplementary DNA 3amonocytes 3agene expression regulation 3aendometrium 3acytokines 3aamino acid sequences 3apregnancy 3atissue distribution 3aembryo implantation 3anucleotide sequences 3aewes 3aconceptus 3areceptors 3achemotaxis 3aestrous cycle 3ainterferons 2aAmino Acid Sequencexgenetics 2aAnimals 2aCell Movementxdrug effects 2aCloning, Molecular 2aEndometriumxcytologyxdrug effectsximmunology. 2aFemale 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aInterferon Type Ixgeneticsxpharmacology. 2aInterferon-gammaxgeneticsxpharmacology. 2aInterleukin-18xgeneticsxmetabolismxpharmacologyxphysiology. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMonocytesxphysiology 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy Proteinsxgeneticsxpharmacology. 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aReceptors, CXCR3 2aReceptors, Chemokinexgenetics 2aSheep 2aTissue Distribution 0amolecular sequence data 0amononuclear cell migration 0achemokine receptor 3 0aimmune cell recruitment 0asheep1 aSakai, A.1 aNojima, H.1 aSuda, Y.1 aYokomizo, Y.1 aImakawa, K.1 aSakai, S.1 aChristenson, R.K.0 tBiology of Reproduction.g2003 Apr., v.  68, no.  4 p.1413-1421wJournal:jnl1102x0523-67547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1095/biolreprod.102.0089123Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/103893Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080225b20080301c00000000  aINDdSESe2005/06/21  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03663naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140072000900149072000900158100003000167245009600197300001600293500002400309500001500333520191000348650002602258650002102284650002302305650001702328650001702345650001702362650002502379650001902404650001802423650001502441650001902456650001802475650002202493650002602515650002302541650001802564650002102582650001202603650001902615650001002634651001702644653002302661653001402684700002502698700002002723773008902743852000902832856011202841930003302953945002502986946001303011961001303024655001203037IND4425044720221120204710.0090825s2009    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND442504472DNAL7 a10113/350552hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aB200 0aL100 0aX1001 aChianese, Dawn Sedorovich10aWhole-Farm Greenhouse Gas Emissions: A Review with Application to a Pennsylvania Dairy Farm  ap. 431-442.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aGreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to the atmosphere and their potential impact on global climate have become important concerns world-wide. Livestock production systems, such as dairy farms, provide both sinks and sources for GHGs. Typical emissions have been quantified in Europe and synthesized to estimate farm-level GHG emissions. However, fewer data are available in the United States, and little has been done to estimate emissions for our farms. Through an extensive literature review, average GHG flows were quantified for each major farm source and sink including the soil, growing crops, animals, and manure storage. These typical gas exchanges were then combined to estimate farm-level net emissions for a representative, 100-cow dairy farm in Pennsylvania. Emissions from animal facilities primarily consisted of animal respiration (532 Mg CO 2 yr -1 ) and enteric fermentation (16.9 Mg CH 4 yr -1 ) with a total annual emission of 971 Mg CO 2 equivalent (CO 2 e) where each unit of CH 4 is equivalent to 25 units of CO 2 in global warming potential. Manure storage emissions included CO 2 , CH 4 , and N 2 O for a total annual emission of 216 Mg CO 2 e with each unit of N 2 O equivalent to 298 units of CO 2 . Cropland provided a net flux or sink of -784 to -168 Mg CO 2 e yr -1 depending upon the amount of manure carbon sequestered in the soil. The estimated whole-farm net annual GHG emission ranged from 2.5 to 5.8 Mg CO 2 e per 500 kg livestock unit or 0.50 to 1.2 kg CO 2 e kg -1 of milk produced. This review and farm analysis has helped direct modeling efforts by determining the important processes that drive emissions of CO 2 , CH 4 , and N 2 O in dairy production along with expected ranges for these emissions. Such data expand the knowledge base of researchers, farm planners, and policymakers as they work to develop and maintain sustainable farming systems in the United States. 3ainput output analysis 3agreenhouse gases 3aagricultural soils 3agas exchange 3adairy manure 3adairy cattle 3acarbon sequestration 3aglobal warming 3agas emissions 3aestimation 3acarbon dioxide 3adairy farming 3asimulation models 3aquantitative analysis 3arumen fermentation 3anitrous oxide 3acell respiration 3amethane 3amanure storage 3acrops 3aPennsylvania 0aliterature reviews 0alivestock1 aRotz, Clarence Alan.1 aRichard, Tom L.0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g2009, v.  25, no.  3 p.431-442x0883-85427nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/350553Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20091022b20091106c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/09/29  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02857naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140072000900149100001800158245012600176300001600302500001100318500001500329520129500344650002501639650001401664650001901678650001601697650002301713650002301736650002301759650001701782650002801799650002401827650002001851650001801871650001101889650001001900650002401910650001801934653002301952700001901975700001501994700001702009773007202026852000902098856011202107930003302219945002502252946001302277961001302290655001202303IND8109736520221119055953.0811009e198107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND810973652DNAL7 a10113/254052hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ204 0aQ114 0aQ5041 aBothast, R.J.10aEffects of moisture and temperature on microbiological and sensory properties of wheat flour and corn meal during storage  ap. 309-311.  a4 ref.  a2019-12-05  aWheat flour and corn meal were stored at moistures ranging from 11-18% and temperatures of 25.degree. and 34.degree. C for 18 mo. Samples were assayed at 0, 0.5, 1.5, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 18 mo. Microbial quality was monitored during storage by determining CO2 in the headspace of each storage container and the total aerobic bacteria and mold counts. A sensory evaluation was made on each product. In general, bacteria did not grow under the relatively dry conditions used in this study, and their numbers diminished with time. Mold counts increased in products stored at 15 and 18% moisture, reaching maximum numbers by 3-6 mo. and then decreased during the remaining storage. Aspergillus glaucus and A. candidus were the predominant molds observed. Generally, increases in CO2 in the headspace paralleled increases in mold counts and could be used to detect early microbial activity. High CO2, high mold counts, and low flavor and odor scores were associated with storage of both products at 15-18% moisture and at 25.degree. and 34.degree. C. This study indicates that product quality cannot be maintained beyond 6 mo. at 15% moisture and 25.degree. C or beyond 15 days at 18% and 25.degree. C. Quality deteriorates more rapidly at 34.degree. C than at 25.degree. C at these moisture levels. 3aAspergillus candidus 3acorn meal 3acarbon dioxide 3awheat flour 3aheadspace analysis 3afood contamination 3amicrobial activity 3afood storage 3amicrobial contamination 3astorage temperature 3astorage quality 3awater content 3aflavor 3aodors 3aAspergillus glaucus 3amolds (fungi) 0astorage conditions1 aAnderson, R.A.1 aWarner, K.1 aKwolek, W.F.0 tCereal chemistry.g1981 , v.  58, no.  4 p.309-311x0009-03527nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/254053Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090305b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/03/05  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04347naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092024002100119040001800140072000900158072000900167100002900176245008800205300001400293500002400307500001500331520297800346650002403324650002003348650002403368650001503392651002303407653001803430700001603448700001603464700002003480700002003500700001803520773007003538856011203608856007703720930003303797945002503830946001303855961001203868852000903880655001203889IND4434482720221118185647.0100326e200502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443448272DNAL7 a10.1175/WAF-834.12doi7 a10113/401082hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aB200 0aX1001 aChung, S.

The summer season predictions produce a cold bias in maximum daily temperature and a warm bias in minimum temperature that together lead to a good prediction of daily mean temperature but a smaller-than-observed diurnal temperature cycle. In winter, the predicted near-surface temperatures are lower both day and night, yielding good agreement with the observed amplitude of the diurnal temperature cycle but relatively large cold bias in daily mean temperature. The predicted temperatures in the boundary layer are also systematically lower than the observed temperatures in the two seasons. The cold bias is consistent with the wetter-than-observed lower atmosphere in the model prediction, which in turn can be attributed to an inadequate specification of soil moisture. In both seasons, the model produced substantially more precipitation in all categories, especially in the heavy precipitation category, and the overprediction is primarily associated with more widespread area coverage in the model prediction. The chances of producing a false precipitation forecast are substantially higher than missing an observed precipitation event. Small systematic errors are found in the predictions of low-level winds, but above the boundary layer, the predicted winds are predominantly from the west, while the observed winds are from the west-northwest. The model is able to capture the general development and evolution of the lake–land breezes in areas surrounding Lake Michigan during summer, although errors exist in the strengths of the breezes and the timing of their transition. Predicted early morning inversions are slightly stronger than observed in winter and weaker than observed in summer. The weak summer morning inversion results in a rapid inversion breakup followed by an earlier growth of a mixed layer after sunrise. Despite the head start, the predicted mixed-layer heights in late afternoon are lower than those observed, suggesting that either the predicted surface sensible heat flux may be too low or the boundary layer flux divergence may be too high. Decreasing horizontal grid spacing from 12 to 4 km results in little improvement in the predictions of near-surface and boundary layer properties except for precipitation, for which the model bias is significantly reduced by the increase in horizontal resolution. The cold and wet biases and errors in inversion strengths and mixed-layer development call for extra caution when using products from mesoscale forecasts in applications such as air pollution and fire weather prediction. 3amathematical models 3aair temperature 3aweather forecasting 3aprediction 3aGreat Lakes region 0aprecipitation1 aIn, Hee-Jin1 aBian, Xindi1 aCharney, Joseph1 aHeilman, Warren1 aPotter, Brian0 tWeather and forecasting.g2005 Feb., v.  20, no.  1 p.63-817nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/401083Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1175/WAF-834.13Available from publisher's Web site  a20100402b20100501c00000000  aINDdGAYe2010/04/02  aOther US  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle02500naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140072000900149100001700158245007000175300001600245500001200261520112300273650003001396650001001426650001401436650002601450650002101476650001901497650001101516650001901527650001801546650002501564650002601589650000801615650002501623650002701648650001101675650001001686653002601696773006901722852000901791856011201800930003301912945002501945946001101970961001301981655001201994IND8007235120221119060011.0800609s1980    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND800723512DNAL7 a10113/254062hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aS200 0aK0011 aDelfel, N.E.10aAlkaloid distribution and catabolism in Cephalotaxus harringtonia  ap. 403-408.  a25 ref.  aIn a young plant of C. harringtonia grown in a controlled environment, the concentration of free alkaloids (homoerythrina alkaloids and cephalotaxine) did not increase with age, whereas the concentration of cephalotaxine esters (harringtonine, deoxyharringtonine, isoharringtonine and homoharringtonine) increased roughly 5-fold.

In 4 of 5 field-grown trees environmental factors caused complete ester hydrolysis and, in addition, the oxidation of cephalotaxine to 11-hydroxycephalotaxine and drupacine and of homoerythrina alkaloids to their epoxy derivatives.<new para>ADDITIONAL ABSTRACT:<new para>Data are presented from analyses of the branches and leaves of laboratory and field-grown trees subject to different stresses and conditions. Results indicate that the anti-tumour alkaloids of the species are under dynamic metabolic control and do not exist as inert storage products. 3aCephalotaxus harringtonia 3atrees 3aalkaloids 3aantineoplastic agents 3amedicinal plants 3aplant extracts 3aesters 3atissue culture 3aplant tissues 3abiochemical pathways 3asecondary metabolites 3aage 3achemical composition 3achemical concentration 3aleaves 3astems 0aalkaloid distribution0 tPhytochemistry.g1980, v.  19, no.  3 p.403-408x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/254063Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090304b00000000c00000000  aINDdLYNe2009/03/04  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02359naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092024002100124040001800145072000900163072000900172100001700181245019700198300001400395500002400409520074300433650002601176650001801202650001701220650002301237650001401260650003001274650002401304651003101328653001101359653001701370653002301387700002001410700002201430700001701452700001501469700001901484773007501503852000901578856011201587856008201699930003301781945001301814946001301827961001301840655001201853IND2058103720221120070709.0970630e199701  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205810372DNAL7 a10.1006/bcon.1996.04912doi7 a10113/409412hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF900 0aM0011 aCenter, T.D.10aEstablishment of Hydrellia pakistanae (Diptera: Ephydridae) for the biological control of the submersed aquatic plant Hydrilla verticillata (Hydrocharitaceae) in the southeastern United States  ap. 65-73.  aIncludes references  aThe Indian leaf-mining fly Hydrellia pakistanae Deonier was released in the United States during October 1987 as a potential agent for the biological control of the submersed aquatic plant, Hydrilla verticillata (L.f.)

Oligodeoxynucleotides containing CpG motifs (CpG ODN) mimic microbial DNA and are immunostimulatory to most vertebrate species. In the present study, we used the production of nitric oxide (NO) as an indicator to evaluate the involvement of the signaling cascades of phospholipases and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) in the activation of chicken HD11 macrophage cells by CpG ODN. Using selective inhibitors, we have identified the involvement of phosphatidylinositol (PI)-phospholipase C (PI-PLC), but not phosphatidylcholine (PC)-phospholipase C (PC-PLC) and PC-phospholipase D (PC-PLD), in CpG ODN-induced NO production in HD11 cells. Preincubation with PI-PLC selective inhibitors (U-73122) completely abrogated CpG ODN-induced NO production in HD11 cells, whereas PC-PLC inhibitor (D609) and PC-PLD inhibitor (n-butanol) had no inhibitory effects. Additionally, inhibition of PI3K and protein kinase C (PKC) with selective inhibitors and chelation of intracellular [Ca2+] also significantly attenuated NO production in CpG ODN-activated HD11 cells. Our results demonstrate that PI-PLC, PI3 K, PKC, and intracellular [Ca2+] are important components of the CpG ODN-induced signaling pathway that leads to the production of NO in avian macrophage cells. 3aoligonucleotides 3aphospholipase C 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3aenzyme activation 3acalcium 3asignal transduction 3amacrophages 3achickens 3aimmune response 3anitric oxide 3aprotein kinase C 2aAnimals 2aCalciumxmetabolism 2aCell Line 2aChickensximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aEnzyme Activationxdrug effects 2aLipopolysaccharidesxpharmacology 2aMacrophage Activationxdrug effectsximmunology. 2aMacrophagesxdrug effectsximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aNitric Oxidexbiosynthesis 2aOligodeoxyribonucleotidesxpharmacology 2aPhosphatidylinositol 3-Kinasesxmetabolism 2aType C Phospholipasesxmetabolism1 aGenovese, Kenneth J.1 aNisbet, David J.1 aKogut, Michael H.0 tDevelopmental and comparative immunology.g2008, v.  32, no.  10 p.1111-11187nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/323553Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dci.2008.02.0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20090819b20091106c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/08/19  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle01990naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002100125040001800146072000900164100002100173245010600194300001600300500002400316500001500340520065400355650001801009650002201027650002901049650002101078650002001099650002401119650001801143653001701161653001201178700001801190773009901208852000901307856008301316856011201399930003301511946001101544961001301555655001201568IND4457876920221118033754.0110512s2003    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND445787692DNAL7 a10.1111/1467-9353.001452doi7 a10113/494652hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aE7001 aBernstein, Jason10aCalculating Trade Damages in the Context of the World Trade Organization's Dispute Settlement Process  ap. 385-398.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSince its inception in 1995, the World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute settlement system has received over 250 notifications of trade disputes. While most have been settled, in a few cases the WTO arbitrators had to approve damage awards. This paper will use one of these cases (Hormones) to explain the methodology arbitrators use to calculate damages and how this methodology differs from an efficiency-based measure of welfare that economists would instinctively provide. Yet, there are rational reasons for this difference and the arbitrator's methodology does a better job of providing incentives for countries not to violate trade agreements. 3atariffication 3awelfare economics 3aWorld Trade Organization 3atrade agreements 3aeconomic theory 3ainternational trade 3atrade balance 0atrade policy 0atariffs1 aSkully, David0 tReview of agricultural economics.g2003 Fall/Winter, v.  25, no.  2 p.385-398x1467-93537nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1467-9353.001453Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/494653Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20110722b20110805c00000000  aNon-US  aUSDA/ERS 7aarticle01936naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131100001900140245005800159300001300217500001200230520079400242650001801036650001401054650002201068650002601090650002301116650001101139650001701150650001301167650001101180651001301191700001901204700001701223773006901240852000901309856011201318930003301430945002501463946001301488961001301501655001201514IND8009965220221119103648.0800818e198006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND800996522DNAL7 a10113/253982hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ1041 aNavickis, L.L.10aExperiments with wild rice subject of Illinois report  ap. 9-13.  a10 ref.  aExperimental runs are described in which wild rice (Zizania aquatica L.) is processed in a continuous manner, primarily to condition it for dehulling but with some attendant drying. Processing for as little as 5 min under high humidity, high-temp. conditions, followed by drying in a forced-air oven at 47° C, resulted in 80-85% whole kernel yield, which is comparable to commercial batch processing. No added steam was needed at ≥40% kernel moisture content. Amylograph evaluation showed that the degree of gelatinization was more complete with prolonged steaming. Steaming also made for easier hull removal than direct drying. Cooking tests showed no white centres and water absorption of 14.6-19.6 g/20 g.

A. flavus was the predominant mould late in storage of seed treated with isobutyric or propionic and acetic acids. 3awater content 3afeeds 3adent corn 3awater activity 3afood preservation 3aammonia 3aisobutyric acid 3aacetic acid 3afood storage 3astorage equipment 3abarrels 3astorage temperature 3amicrobial contamination 3amolds (fungi) 3amicrobial load 3aplate count 3abacteria 3ayeasts 3aActinomyces1 aAdams, G.H.1 aHatfield, E.E.1 aLancaster, E.B.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1975 Mar., v.  58, no.  3 p.386-391x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/299753Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090610b20090703c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/06/09  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02760naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002100127040001800148072000900166072000900175100003400184245008500218300001800303500002400321500001500345520101700360650002101377650001801398650001301416650001601429650001501445650001001460650001801470650002001488650002401508650002101532650002601553650003601579650001101615650001001626650002301636650001101659650001501670653002501685700002301710700002201733700002201755773011501777852000901892856008501901856011201986930003302098945002502131946001302156961001302169655001202182IND4429525620221121031330.0091204e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442952562DNAL7 a10.1080/001036209031737562doi7 a10113/366802hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aX1001 aJaradat, A.

We analyzed 45-yrs of monthly and annual rainfall-runoff characteristics of a small (7.8 ha) zero-order typical Southern Piedmont watershed in southeastern United States. Agricultural land use varied as follows: 1. Row cropping (5-yrs); 2. Kudzu (Pueraria lobata; 5-yrs); 3. Grazed kudzu and rescuegrass (Bromus catharticus; 7-yrs); and 4. Grazed bermudagrass and winter annuals (Cynodon dactylon; 28-yrs). Land use and rainfall variability influenced runoff characteristics. Row cropping produced the largest runoff amount, percentage of the rainfall partitioned into runoff, and peak flow rates. Kudzu reduced spring runoff and almost eliminated summer runoff, as did a mixture of kudzu and rescuegrass (KR) compared to row cropping. Peak flow rates were also reduced during the kudzu and KR. Peak flow rates increased under bermudagrass but were lower than during row cropping. A simple process-based 'tanh' model modified to take the previous month's rainfall into account produced monthly rainfall and runoff correlations with coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.74. The model was tested on independent data collected during drought. Mean monthly runoff was 1.65 times the observed runoff. Sustained hydrologic monitoring is essential to understanding long-term rainfall-runoff relationships in agricultural watersheds. 3aland use change 3aVigna unguiculata 3aZea mays 3along term experiments 3aPueraria montana var. lobata 3aCynodon dactylon 3aGossypium hirsutum 3apastures 3aagricultural runoff 3afield crops 3agrazing 3aBromus catharticus 3apasture plants 3awatershed hydrology 3aAvena sativa 3acrop rotation 3ahydrologic models 3aagricultural watersheds 3aGeorgia 0aagricultural land 0arow cropping1 aFisher, D.S.1 aSteiner, J.L.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2006 Jan. 10, v.  316, no.  1-4 p.1-12x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/132013Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2005.04.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20080416b20080502c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/04/25  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03257naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092024002100117040001800138072000900156072000900165100001800174245014100192300001600333520164500349592002801994650002002022650001802042650001702060650002302077650003002100650001302130650002302143650001702166650001602183650001402199650002202213650002602235651001802261700001802279700001702297700001402314700001402328773014002342852000902482856011202491856007502603930003302678945002502711961001502736655001202751IND4461695420221118170254.0110908e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446169542DNAL7 a10.1603/AN101452doi7 a10113/502362hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF900 0aF8211 aRoehrdanz, R.10aPhylogeny and Genetic Diversity of Flea Beetles (Aphthona sp.) Introduced to North America as Biological Control Agents for Leafy Spurge  ap. 966-975.  aA molecular phylogeny is presented for the five main species of Aphthona flea beetles that were introduced to North America in conjunction with the leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula L.) biological control program. The mitochondrial genome was examined using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of a 9,000-bp segment and nucleotide sequencing of a 575-bp piece of cox1-cox2. A neighbor—joining tree of the RFLP data, along with neighbor-joining and maximum parsimony trees of the sequence alignments, all had the same major branching pattern. Each of the recognized species was a well defined clade. Three within species subbranches had very limited mitochondrial DNA diversity. One was a Wolbachia-infected lineage of A. nigriscutis most likely generated by a Wolbachia sweep where the spreading Wolbachia infection brought along the infected mitochondrial haplotype. Two of three subclades of A. lacertosa also had very little genetic diversity. One of these subclades also displayed a divergence from the other two that was analogous to the divergence observed between some of the other species pairs, suggesting it may be a cryptic species. Its distribution was restricted to Canada. The other genetically depauperate A. lacertosa line was the only lineage recovered in the United States. The geographically restricted nature of some of the genetic lines could be exploited to possibly improve biological control in some habitats through redistribution to other locations. It is not obvious that either Wolbachia infection or a narrow genetic base has had any detrimental effect on biological control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuphorbia esula 3anoxious weeds 3aweed control 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3aAphthona 3aintroduced species 3ainsect pests 3aplant pests 3aphylogeny 3agenetic variation 3amolecular systematics 3aNorth America1 aBourchier, R.1 aCortilet, A.1 aOlson, D.1 aSears, S.0 tAnnals of the Entomological Society of America.g2011 Sept., v. 104, no. 5 p.966-975dEntomological Society of Americax0013-87467nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/502363Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/AN101453Available from publisher's Web site  a20110921b20111007c00000000  aINDdRSCe2011/09/21  aUSDA/APHIS 7aarticle02724naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092024006100112040001800173072001700191100001900208245012700227300001600354500002400370520102000394650005701414650002301471650001701494650002601511650003201537650003001569650002201599650002501621650002101646650001801667650001601685650002001701650001501721653002801736653003001764700001801794700001201812700002001824773008401844852000901928856011101937856007402048930003302122945002502155946001302180961001302193655001202206IND4366653920221118142049.0050114s2004    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND436665392DNAL7 a10113/97272hdl7 a10.1672/1536-2442(2004)004%5B0001:DOTPEO%5D2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

AcRFP recombinants produced incomplete polyhedra with low infectivity for Trichoplusia ni larvae, whereas AcuW21-23GFP produced normal polyhedra with high infectivity. Electron microscopy of AcRFP CL14 showed the incorporation of very few viral particles into polyhedrin matrix protein material. The LC50 for AcuW21-23GFP was 0.10 occlusion bodies/mm2, whereas the LC50 values for several AcRFP recombinants ranged from 20 to 329 occlusion bodies/mm2.

Potential exists for nutrient removal directly from lagoons if vegetation can be grown on floating mats in the lagoon and periodically harvested and removed. Vegetative cover of lagoons may also help reduce odor problems. A study was conducted to determine the feasibility of using floating mats of vegetation on swine lagoon wastewater. Wastewater from the University of Georgia swine wastewater lagoons was pumped to replicated tanks (1285 L) in which floating mats of vegetation were grown. The floating platforms were made of PVC pipe with attached wire screen and fibrous material into which the vegetation was sprigged. Three different wetland species were tested: cattail (Typha latifolia L.), soft rush (Juncus effuses), and maidencane (Panicum hematomon Schult 'Halifax'). Full-strength wastewater, 1/2-strength wastewater, and an inorganic nutrient solution (1/4-strength Hoaglund solution) as a control were tested. The test was conducted as a modified batch process as opposed to a continuous flow through process. The modification was that every two weeks half of the volume of each tank was replaced with the appropriate solution of full-strength wastewater, 1/2-strength wastewater, or 1/4-strength Hoaglund solution so that nutrient concentrations would not be depleted. There were four replicate tanks of each nutrient solution for each wetland species, for a total of 36 tanks. Vegetation from the floating mats was harvested periodically by removing all vegetation above 5 cm of the base of the floating mat. Measurements were made at each cutting of the total biomass per tank, leaf area, and nutrient content (N, P, K) of the vegetative tissue. Growth responses were quite different among the three species. The cattail had tremendous growth during the spring and summer months. The growth rate of the rush was slow for the first year. It then died during summer of 2002 at both the 1/2-strength and full-strength wastewater, indicating that this species is not suitable for growth on floating mats in swine lagoon wastewater. Total nutrient removal by both the cattail and maidencane was primarily a function of total biomass produced. Over the length of the study, on full-strength wastewater, the cattail produced 16,511 g m(-2) biomass and removed 534, 79, and 563 g m(-2) of N, P, and K, respectively, while the maidencane produced 9751 g m(-2) of biomass and removed 323, 48, and 223 g m(-2) of N, P, and K, respectively. Results from this study indicate that potential exists for using floating platforms to grow cattail, maidencane, or possibly other yet to be identified plant species in wastewater lagoons for nutrient removal. 3awaste lagoons 3apig manure 3abiological treatment 3aaquatic plants 3anutrient uptake 3awastewater 3aTypha latifolia 3aJuncus effusus 3aPanicum hemitomon 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 0afloating vegetative mats1 aGascho, G.J.1 aNewton, G.L.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g2004 , v.  47, no.  6 p.1963-1972x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/97303Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080208b20080301c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/03/02  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03366naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092024001900124024002000143040001800163072000900181100001700190245006300207300001600270500002400286500001500310520151600325650002401841650002101865650001801886650001301904650002401917650002101941650001801962650002401980650001102004650002402015650001702039650001402056650001302070650001202083650001102095650002702106650001102133650002802144650000902172650002402181650005102205653002002256653002402276653001902300653001702319700001702336700001802353773006102371852000902432856011102441856008202552930003302634945002502667946001102692961001302703655001202716IND4397890420221120062609.0071116e200210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439789042DNAL7 a10.1054/tube.2002.03412doi7 a126232702pmid7 a10113/70212hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8321 aPalmer, M.V.10aAerosol delivery of virulent Mycobacterium bovis to cattle  ap. 275-282.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSetting: Although animal models of aerosol inoculation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and M. bovis have been reported using laboratory animals, a model of aerosol delivery of M. bovis to cattle has not been reported previously. Objective: Develop and characterize a model of aerosol delivery of M. bovis to cattle, and compare the distribution of lesions in cattle infected with either of two different strains of M. bovis, one isolated from cattle (HC2005T), and the other isolated from white-tailed deer (1315). Design: Cattle (n=20, female and castrated males) aged 4 months, were infected with 1x10³ (n=5) or 1x10⁵ (n=5) colony-forming units (CFU) of M. bovis 1315 or 1x10³ (n=5) or 1x10⁵ (n=5) CFU of M. bovis HC2005T. Calves were infected using a commercially available aerosol delivery system. One hundred fifty-five days after infection, calves were euthanized, examined and tissues collected for microscopic analysis and bacteriologic culture. Results: Nineteen of 20 calves developed tuberculosis. Typical tuberculous lesions were most pronounced in the lungs and tracheobronchial and mediastinal lymph nodes. Conclusion: The system described provides a reliable method of aerosol delivery of M. bovis to cattle. Lesion distribution suggests that the aerosolized inoculum was delivered deep into pulmonary alveoli and thus represents true aerosol exposure. Disease was more severe in groups receiving the highest dose of either inoculum strain; however, differences between strains were not seen. 3ainoculation methods 3alesions (animal) 3adose response 3aaerosols 3atissue distribution 3adisease severity 3aanimal models 3abovine tuberculosis 3acalves 3aMycobacterium bovis 3ahost strains 3ainfection 2aAerosols 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aFemale 2aGranulomaxmicrobiology 2aMale 2aMycobacterium bovis 2aTuberculosis, Bovinexpathologyxtransmission. 0acattle diseases 0aaerosol inoculation 0acattle strains 0adeer strains1 aWaters, W.R.1 aWhipple, D.L.0 tTuberculosis.g2002 Oct., v.  82, no.  6 p.275-2827nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/70213Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1054/tube.2002.03413Available from publisher's Web site  a20071128b20071210c00000000  aINDdNZMe2007/11/21  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04623naa a2201009 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003600133024002100169040001800190072000900208072000900217100002700226245009900253300001800352500002400370500001500394506007600409520154700485506003702032650001202069650001602081650002302097650002102120650001902141650003402160650002302194650001102217650001502228650001602243650000902259650001802268650002502286650002502311650002802336650001702364650001502381650002302396650002202419650001702441650001602458650001002474650003102484650000902515650002202524650005502546650002302601650004902624650002102673650001902694650002802713650001702741650001702758650001102775650002202786650001802808650001102826650000902837650001602846650002502862650002302887650001802910650003202928650004902960651001803009653001103027653001803038653001603056653000903072700002603081700002503107700002203132700002303154700002503177773010803202852000903310856011203319856008603431930003303517945002503550946001303575961001303588655001203601IND4413092320221207120645.0081128e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441309232DNAL7 a190274042pmid7 aPMC26595952pmcid7 a10.1016/j.jada.2008.09.0042doi7 a10113/226592hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT000 0aX3801 aTalegawkar, Sameera A.10aSerum Carotenoid and Tocopherol Concentrations Vary by Dietary Pattern among African Americans  ap. 2013-2020.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground: Intakes and biochemical concentrations of carotenoids and tocopherols have been associated with chronic diseases. Objective: To describe dietary patterns in Jackson Heart Study participants and to determine if biochemical measurements of antioxidants differ across these. Design: Cross-sectional analysis of data for 373 African-American men and women (age 35 to 80 years), participating in the Diet and Physical Activity Substudy of the Jackson Heart Study. Methods: Dietary intake was assessed with a region specific food frequency questionnaire. Patterns were defined by cluster analysis of food groups, as percent of energy intake. Results: Four dietary patterns were identified: fast food, Southern, prudent, and juice. Individuals in the fast-food pattern (n=153) had significantly lower serum concentrations of lutein plus zeaxanthin and β-cryptoxanthin; those in the Southern cluster (n=99) had significantly lower serum α-carotene; and those in the prudent (n=63) and juice (n=58) clusters had significantly higher serum α-carotene and β-cryptoxanthin (P<0.05) relative to those in at least one other cluster (all P<0.05). The juice cluster also had higher serum α-tocopherol concentrations relative to the fast-food cluster. Conclusions: Diets high in fast foods, snacks, soft drinks, and meat were associated with relatively low concentrations of carotenoids and α-tocopherol. This pattern contained the largest number of participants, and could contribute to the extensive health disparities seen in this region.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aelderly 3afood groups 3amiddle-aged adults 3aalpha-tocopherol 3aalpha-carotene 3afood frequency questionnaires 3abeta-cryptoxanthin 3asnacks 3azeaxanthin 3ablood serum 3ameat 3ahealth status 3anutrition assessment 3avitamin deficiencies 3across-sectional studies 3aantioxidants 3afast foods 3anutritional status 3aAfrican Americans 3afood choices 3asoft drinks 2aAdult 2aBlack or African American. 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aAntioxidantsxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aBiomarkersxblood. 2aCarotenoidsxadministration & dosagexblood. 2aCluster Analysis 2aCohort Studies 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDietxtrends 2aDiet Surveys 2aFemale 2aFeeding Behavior. 2aHealth Status 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aNutrition Assessment 2aNutritional Status 2aPublic Health 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aTocopherolsxadministration & dosagexblood. 3aUnited States 0aBlacks 0aeating habits 0acarotenoids 0adiet1 aJohnson, Elizabeth J.1 aCarithers, Teresa C.1 aTaylor, Herman A.1 aBogle, Margaret L.1 aTucker, Katherine L.0 tJournal of the American Dietetic Association.g2008 Dec., v.  108, no.  12 p.2013-2020x0002-82237nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/226593Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jada.2008.09.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20090128b20090206c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/01/20  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03222naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111024002100143040001800164072000900182072000900191072000900200100002300209245013500232300001800367500002400385520174800409650002302157650001202180650001902192650002302211650002202234650002502256650002302281650001802304650002602322700002102348773011002369852000902479856011202488856008202600930003302682945002502715946001102740961001302751655001202764IND4430791920221119041855.0100101e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443079192DNAL7 a198771462pmid7 a10.1002/jssc.2009003872doi7 a10113/439822hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aH000 0aX500 0aQ2051 aLehotay, Steven J.10aBlind analysis of fortified pesticide residues in carrot extracts using GC-MS to evaluate qualitative and quantitative performance  ap. 3706-3719.  aIncludes references  aUnlike quantitative analysis, which must commonly undergo an extensive method validation process in labs to assure quality of results, the quality of the qualitative results in the analysis of pesticide residues in food is generally ignored in practice. Instead, chemists tend to rely on advanced MS techniques and general subjective guidelines or fixed acceptability criteria when making analyte identifications. All analytes and matrices have unique characteristics that make this current approach less effective than desirable in many real-world situations. Just as performed in quantitative method validation studies, collection of distinguishing factors of selectivity versus concentration, such as analyte retention time variabilities, ion ratios, matrix background evaluations, choice of ions, and the number of ions to use, provides specific information about the particular application to assess its quality. Empirical analysis of many blind samples to check the rates of false positives and negatives should be performed, at least to better evaluate LOD and reduce the chances of a serious qualitative problem. Familiarization training and review of results by the analyst(s) increase performance, and in any case, the traditional use of two independent analyses should still be relied upon to make chemical confirmations. In this study, an experimental approach to evaluate GC-MS using SIM with a quadrupole instrument and an MS/MS (ion trap) was conducted to assess the qualitative factors of both methods for 16 pesticides fortified (or not) in carrot extracts. Rates of false positives and negatives were compared using different identification criteria, and no single set of conditions was found to be superior for all analytes. 3apesticide residues 3acarrots 3aplant extracts 3agas chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3aqualitative analysis 3afood contamination 3afood analysis 3aquantitative analysis1 aGates, Robert A.0 tJournal of separation science.g2009 Nov., v.  32, no.  21 p.3706-3719dWiley-VCH Verlagx1615-93067nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/439823Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2009003873Available from publisher's Web site  a20101019b20101108c00000000  aINDdYLPe2010/10/18  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle01884naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140072000900149100002200158245005100180500002400231520054100255650001600796650002700812650003200839650002800871650001900899650002600918650002900944650002500973650002500998650001201023650000901035651001801044653001401062653001601076653002801092773009701120852000901217856011201226930003301338945002501371946000901396961000901405655001201414IND4427586420221120214824.0091020e20090811xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442758642DNAL7 a10113/350422hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX320 0aX350 0aD5001 aDonovan, David M.10aNucleic acid encoding endolysin fusion protein  aIncludes references  aThe invention concerns a recombinant nucleic acid molecule encoding an antimicrobial fusion peptidoglycan endopeptidase.

A study of digestive proteinases in L. serricorne was performed to identify potential targets for proteinaceous biopesticides, such as proteinase inhibitors. Optimal casein hydrolysis by luminal proteinases of L. serricorne was in pH 8.5-9.0 buffers, although the pH of luminal contents was slightly acidic. Results from substrate and inhibitor analyses indicated that the primary digestive proteinases were serine proteinases. The most effective inhibitors of caseinolytic hydrolysis were from soybean (both Bowman Birk and Kunitz), with some inhibition by chymostatin, N-TOSYL-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, and leupeptin. Casein zymogram analysis identified at least eight proteolytic activities. Activity blot analyses indicated one major proteinase activity that hydrolysed the trypsin substrate N-α-benzoyl-L-arginine ρ-nitroanilide, and three major proteinase activities that hydrolysed the chymotrypsin substrate N-succinyl ala-ala-pro-phe ρ-nitroanilide. The absence of cysteine, aspartic, and metallo proteinases in L. serricorne digestion was evidenced by the lack of activation by thiol reagents, alkaline pH optima, and the results from class-specific proteinase inhibitors. The data suggest that protein digestion in L. serricorne is primarily dependent on trypsin- and chymotrypsin-like proteinases. 3aLasioderma serricorne 3adigestion 3aserine proteinases 3aenzyme activity 3ahydrolysis 3aproteolysis 3apH 3aproteinase inhibitors 2aAnimals 2aColeopteraxenzymology. 2aCaseinsxmetabolism 2aDigestive Systemxenzymology 2aEndopeptidasesxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aHydrolysis 2aSubstrate Specificity 0ainhibition 0asubstrates1 aHartzer, K.1 aZuercher, M.0 tBulletin of entomological research.g2002 Aug., v.  92, no.  4 p.331-336x0007-48537nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/131963Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1079/BER20021793Available from publisher's Web site  a20080416b20080502c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03133naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092040001800112072000900130072000900139100001400148245011700162300001800279500002400297520166700321650004101988650001802029650002802047650003002075650001902105650001802124650001402142650001102156650001302167650001902180650002402199650001602223650001502239650002102254651001302275700002202288700001502310700001602325773008202341852000902423856011102432930003302543945002502576946001302601961001302614655001202627IND4365689720221118142351.0041119e200409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436568972DNAL7 a10113/97192hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aX1001 aChu, T.W.10aEvaluation of the SWAT model's sediment and nutrient components in the Piedmont physiographic region of Maryland  ap. 1523-1538.  aIncludes references  aMathematical watershed-scale models are among the best tools available for analyzing water resources (quantity and quality) issues in spatially diverse watersheds since continuous water quality monitoring is expensive and spatially impractical in mixed land use watersheds. However, models without appropriate validation may lead to misconceptions and erroneous predictions. This study used six years of hydrologic and water quality data to calibrate and validate the capability of SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model in assessing nonpoint source pollution for a 346 ha watershed in the Piedmont physiographic region. The evaluation of the hydrology component of SWAT completed in a previous study pointed out that SWAT has no mechanism to account for subsurface flow contributions from outside the watershed. For this evaluation, all nutrient loadings leaving the watershed were adjusted to subtract the chemical transport via subsurface flow contributions from outside the watershed. Evaluation results indicated a strong agreement between yearly measured and simulated data for sediment, nitrate, and soluble phosphorus loadings. However, simulations of monthly sediment and nutrient loadings were poor. Overall, it was concluded that SWAT is a reasonable watershed-scale model for long-term simulation of different management scenarios. However, its use on storm-by-storm or even on monthly basis may not be appropriate for watersheds with similar physiography and size. Additionally, ignoring the subsurface contribution of water and chemicals from outside the watershed into the watershed aquifer could cause significant errors in model prediction. 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3awater quality 3aagricultural watersheds 3anonpoint source pollution 3asediment yield 3awater erosion 3anutrients 3arunoff 3apiedmont 3apiedmont soils 3awatershed hydrology 3astream flow 3aphosphorus 3anitrate nitrogen 3aMaryland1 aShirmohammadi, A.1 aMontas, H.1 aSadeghi, A.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g2004 , v.  47, no.  5 p.1523-1538x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/97193Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080208b20080301c00000000  aINDdRHFe2004/12/17  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02347naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113100001700131245005800148300001600206500002400222520100900246650000901255650001301264650001901277650002301296650002601319650002301345650002501368653001501393653001501408653001501423653001201438653003301450653003201483653003701515653002101552700001601573773010701589852000901696856011201705930003301817945001301850946001301863961001301876655001201889IND2203815020221120155111.0000413s1999    iau|||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND220381502DNAL7 a10113/167162hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiebig, M.A.10aEvaluation of point-scale assessments of soil quality  ap. 510-518.  aIncludes references  a
This study was conducted to evaluate four approaches to point-scale assessment of soil qualify: farmers' perceptions and field-descriptive, field-analytical, and laboratory-analytical assessments. Twenty-four conventional and organic farmers were paired within ecoregions, and perceptions of soil qualify indicators on their 'good' and 'problem' soils were surveyed. Using results from laboratory-analytical assessments as a standard, farmers' perceptions were accurate or near-accurate in over 75% of the cases for the majority of indicators evaluated in the study. Field-descriptive assessments of topsoil depth and soil texture were accurate or near-accurate in at least 92% of the cases. Results from field-analytical assessments of electrical conductivity soil pH, and soil nitrate were accurate in at least 46% of the cases. From an assessment-efficiency standpoint, seeking out farmers' perceptions of soil qualify indicators seems to be an appropriate first iteration to point-scale evaluations. 3asoil 3aaccuracy 3apublic opinion 3aanalytical methods 3alaboratory techniques 3afarmers' attitudes 3aqualitative analysis 0aevaluation 0aassessment 0aindicators 0aquality 0afield descriptive assessment 0afield analytical assessment 0alaboratory analytical assessment 0afarmers' opinion1 aDoran, J.W.0 tJournal of soil and water conservation.g1999, v.  54, no.  2 p.510-518wJournal:1947x0022-45617nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/167163Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080710b20080801c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02972naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113100001700131245006300148300001400211500002400225500001500249520183500264650002202099650001902121650002302140651001302163653002902176653001802205653001702223700001602240700001802256773011902274852000902393856011202402930003302514945001302547946001302560961001302573655001202586IND2206230720221120145349.0000804s1999    wiu|||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND220623072DNAL7 a10113/167172hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiebig, M.A.10a"Work-a-Day" compensation in farmer participatory research  ap. 37-40.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aConstraints to farmer participation in agricultural research require public institutions to compensate farmers for their involvement in research projects. Because of potential funding limitations in public institutions, it is important to identify approaches to compensate farmers who do not exclusively rely upon monetary remuneration. A novel barter compensation approach, called work-a-day compensation, is proposed. This approach involves compensating farmers for their time and involvement in research studies by having the principal investigator work for participating farmers. Twenty-four farmers throughout eastern Nebraska were offered work-a-day compensation for their involvement in a soil quality assessment study. Farmers' opinions of work-a-day compensation were surveyed as part of the study. One-third of the farmers participating in the study chose to utilize the work-a-day compensation offer. Comments were positive, and the majority (54%) felt that work-a-day compensation would be either very or somewhat important in their decision to participate in future studies. Experiences from work-a-day compensation were beneficial to both participating farmers and the principal investigator. Farmers benefited by receiving help doing chores or learning more about the principal investigator's technical expertise. The principal investigator benefited by acquiring more understanding and appreciation for the challenges that farmers face daily. Potential benefits from work-a-day compensation to public institutions include an improved image among farmers and greater farmer participation in research studies. Drawbacks of this compensation approach, however, such as liability issues, the high degree of mechanization of many farms, and researcher time may relegate it to being applicable only in unique situations. 3aresearch projects 3apublic opinion 3afarmers' attitudes 3aNebraska 0afarming systems research 0aparticipation 0acompensation1 aDoran, J.W.1 aFrancis, C.A.0 tJournal of natural resources and life sciences education.g1999, v.  28 p.37-40wJournal:jnl47890x1059-90537nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/167173Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080710b20080801c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03629naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131100002000140245010300160300001300263500002400276500001500300520198600315650001302301650001002314650001302324650001902337650002302356650002102379650001602400650001602416650001302432650001502445650002102460650001502481650002302496650002402519650002602543651002002569653002202589653002102611653002602632653002702658700001702685700001502702700001602717700001502733773009802748852000902846856011202855930003302967945002503000946001303025961001303038655001203051IND4432871820221116164418.0100219e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443287182DNAL7 a10113/386182hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8211 aKlungness, L.M.10aSusceptibility of ripe avocado to invasive alien fruit flies (Tephritidae) on the island of Hawaii  ap. 1-13.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aThe Avocado Growers Association on the island of Hawaii requested that the USDA-APHIS reconsider the possibility of approving the export of untreated avocado to the continental USA. In response, as part of the Hawaii Area Wide Pest Management Program, the Agricultural Research Service undertook a survey to supplement the original survey conducted by Liquido et al. (1995). This consisted of deploying traps baited with male lures for the three invasive species (Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel), B. cucurbitae (Coquillett), and Ceratitis capitata Wiedemann)) and protein bait traps for general detection of females within orchards. The survey was concentrated in the Kona District, and the orchards were mapped using a geographic information systems approach. In addition, between 9 August 2006 until 22 May 2007, 519 avocado fruits were collected from the ground and held individually to determine the presence of fruit fly larvae. Because male lure trap captures varied with locality and season and attracted flies from large distances, they are probably of limited value in predicting numbers of fruit flies within small avocado orchards. On the other hand protein bait traps, because they captured females and attracted flies from short distances, were a better indication of female flies found within orchards. C. capitata was the most prevalent species year round (0.456 ± 0.130 female flies/trap/day). B. dorsalis was captured considerably less frequently (0.096 ± 0.068 female flies/trap/day). B. cucurbitae was the least prevalent species in avocado orchards, averaging 0.034 ± 0.006 female flies/trap/day. Adult fly emergence from the ground fruit sample was 1.25 x 10(–05) ± 8.89 x 10(–6) B. dorsalis flies/g of fruit and no C. capitata emerged from any fruit sample. That is a fruit infestation rate of 0.385% and a rate of 0.771% larvae per fruit. All of the fruits sampled had some damage that would have excluded them from shipment by previous export criteria. 3aorchards 3abaits 3atrapping 3ainsect surveys 3aintroduced species 3aPersea americana 3afruit flies 3acrop damage 3aavocados 3aprevalence 3ainvasive species 3aquarantine 3aCeratitis capitata 3aBactrocera dorsalis 3aZeugodacus cucurbitae 3aHawaii (island) 0afruit infestation 0aquarantine pests 0aBactrocera cucurbitae 0afruits (plant anatomy)1 aVargas, R.I.1 aJang, E.B.1 aMau, R.F.L.1 aKinney, K.0 tProceedings of the Hawaiian Entomological Society.g2009 Dec., v.  41 p.1-13x0073-134X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/386183Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100222b20100305c00000000  aINDdNZMe2010/02/22  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03811naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024001700117024003800134024002500172024004000197024002300237040001800260100002200278245010900300500001900409506002800428506005700456520204800513596008302561506003702644650002102681650001202702650002002714650001402734650001502748650001302763650001602776650002302792650002202815650001902837650001402856650002102870650002002891650000802911700007102919700002002990700002203010700001903032773007803051856008803129903002203217961000903239852000903248655001203257IND60701988020221214230225.0200717e20200604xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070198802DNAL7 a10113/70198802hdl7 a3756422aris7 a10.1371/journal.pone.02337832doi7 a4344392aris_accn_no7 a5090-21000-069-00D2aris_project_no7 a3756422seq_no_115  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdelrazek, Sahar10aCrop management system and carrot genotype affect endophyte composition and Alternaria dauci suppression  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Access  aPublic Library of Science (PLoS) License Information  aManaging pests in carrot production is challenging. Endophytic microbes have been demonstrated to improve the health and productivity of many crops, but factors affecting endophyte dynamics in carrot is still not well understood. The goal of this study was to determine how crop management system and carrot genotype interact to affect the composition and potential of endophytes to mitigate disease caused by Alternaria dauci, an important carrot pathogen. Twenty-eight unique isolates were collected from the taproots of nine diverse geno types of carrot grown in a long-term trial comparing organic and conventional management. Antagonistic activity was quantified using an in vitro assay, and potential for individual isolates to mitigate disease was evaluated in greenhouse trials using two carrot cultivars. Results confirm that carrot aproots are colonized by an abundant and diverse assortment of bacteria and fungi representing at least distinct 13 genera. Soils in the organic system had greater total organic matter, microbial biomass and activity than the conventional system and endophyte composition in taproots grown in this system were more abundant and diverse, and had greater antagonistic activity. Carrotge no type also affect edendophy tea bundance as well as potential for individual isolates to affect seed germination seedling growth and tolerance oA. dauci.The benefits of endophytes on carrot growth were greatest when plants were subject to A. dauci stress, high lighting the importance of environmental conditions in the functional role of endophytes. Results of this study provide evidence that endophytes can play an important role in improving carrot performance and mediating resistance to A. dauci, and it may someday be possible to select for these beneficial plant-microbial relationships in carrot breeding programs. Implementing soil-building practices commonly used in organic farming systems has potential to promote these beneficial relationships and improve the health and productivity of carrot crops.  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAlternaria dauci 3acarrots 3acrop management 3acultivars 3aendophytes 3agenotype 3agreenhouses 3amanagement systems 3amicrobial biomass 3aorganic matter 3apathogens 3aseed germination 3aseedling growth 3atea1 aSimon, P.

Survey collections of S. turcica isolates from 1974 to 1994 provided a unique opportunity to examine temporal diversity in the eastern United States. Two hundred forty-two isolates of S. turcica from maize were studied with random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers, mating type, and virulence on maize differential inbred lines with known Ht resistance genes to examine changes over time. One hundred forty-nine RAPD haplotypes were identified. Nearly 20% of haplotypes recurred in more than one year. Race 0 isolates declined in frequency from 83% in 1974 to near 50% in the 1990s, most likely in response to the widespread deployment of Ht1 in commercial maize hybrids. Races 23 and 23N were present in the collection at low levels throughout the study period and were also found among isolates from Virginia in 1957. The frequency of MAT1-2 isolates increased sharply after 1979 and was associated with the emergence of race 1 during the same period. RAPD markers were used to investigate the genetic diversity among a subset of isolates collected in the United States from 1976 to 1982, the period in which this dramatic shift in race frequency occurred. Multilocus haplotypes were not exclusively associated with known races of S. turcica. Based on shared haplotypes and cluster analysis, race 1 isolates share greater similarity with race 0 than with 23 or 23N isolates, indicating race 1 probably evolved from multiple lineages of race 0. Sorghum spp.-infecting isolates share greater similarity with one another than with maize-infecting isolates and represent a distinct subgroup. 3aSetosphaeria turcica 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3atemporal variation 3agenetic variation 3alinkage disequilibrium 3afungal diseases of plants 3aleaf blight 3aZea mays 3acorn 3aUnited States1 aCarson, M.L.0 tPhytopathology.g2007 Nov., v.  97, no.  11 p.1501-1511x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-97-11-15013Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/158943Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080611b20080704c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/06/11  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02089naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092024002100117040001800138100001600156245010500172300001600277500002500293500002400318520083900342650002001181650002601201650001901227650001301246650001801259650001601277650001901293650002501312651001901337773008001356852000901436856011201445856007501557930003301632946001301665961001301678655001201691IND9205219920221119192901.0920819e199112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920521992DNAL7 a10.2307/34954072doi7 a10113/181462hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoach, S.H.10aNatural plant materials as overwintering sites for arthropods in the coastal plain of South Carolina  ap. 543-554.  aIncludes references.  aSummary in Spanish.  aField-plot studies were conducted in South Carolina from 1987 to 1990 to determine if several native materials i.e., Bermuda grass (Cynodon dactylon) hay, wheat straw, pine needles, wood litter, corn [maize] stalks and husks, and broomsedge (Andropogon virginicus) grass clumps were suitable as overwintering sites for arthropods. Significant differences were found between numbers of some insects in the materials, with coccinellids primarily overwintering in broomsedge clumps, while staphylinids preferred C. dactylon hay and wheat straw. Overall, a limited number of important predatory insects and spiders [Araneae], and phytophagous insects were found in the different materials. There were significant differences in the number of insects depending upon where the materials were placed in relation to open field or field edges. 3aarthropod pests 3abeneficial arthropods 3acoastal plains 3ahabitats 3aoverwintering 3aplant pests 3aplant residues 3apredatory arthropods 3aSouth Carolina0 tFlorida entomologist.g1991 Dec., v.  74, no.  4 p.543-554x0015-40407nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/181463Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/34954073Available from publisher's Web site  a20080820b20080905c00000000  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04813naa a2200925 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111024002000146040001800166072000900184072000900193072000900202072000900211072000900220100001700229245007500246300001600321500002400337500001500361520226900376650002102645650003302666650001702699650001202716650001102728650002102739650001502760650001902775650002402794650001902818650002302837650001702860650001402877650001302891650001502904650002302919650001102942650001902953650000902972650001702981650002302998650003103021650001903052650001403071650002303085650003103108650003403139650000903173650002203182650002203204651001103226651001903237651001803256651001503274651001803289653001803307653002203325653002503347653001003372700001703382700001503399700001803414700001303432700001803445700002003463700001603483700001903499773007003518852000903588856008503597856011103682930003303793945002503826946001103851961001303862655001203875IND4399836720221118055057.0080111e200410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439983672DNAL7 a153384142pmid7 a10.1007/s00442-004-1682-42doi7 a10113/89402hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aB200 0aF600 0aJ100 0aF300 0aJ2001 aHuxman, T.E.10aPrecipitation pulses and carbon fluxes in semiarid and arid ecosystems  ap. 254-268.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn the arid and semiarid regions of North America, discrete precipitation pulses are important triggers for biological activity. The timing and magnitude of these pulses may differentially affect the activity of plants and microbes, combining to influence the C balance of desert ecosystems. Here, we evaluate how a pulse of water influences physiological activity in plants, soils and ecosystems, and how characteristics, such as precipitation pulse size and frequency are important controllers of biological and physical processes in arid land ecosystems. We show that pulse size regulates C balance by determining the temporal duration of activity for different components of the biota. Microbial respiration responds to very small events, but the relationship between pulse size and duration of activity likely saturates at moderate event sizes. Photosynthetic activity of vascular plants generally increases following relatively larger pulses or a series of small pulses. In this case, the duration of physiological activity is an increasing function of pulse size up to events that are infrequent in these hydroclimatological regions. This differential responsiveness of photosynthesis and respiration results in arid ecosystems acting as immediate C sources to the atmosphere following rainfall, with subsequent periods of C accumulation should pulse size be sufficient to initiate vascular plant activity. Using the average pulse size distributions in the North American deserts, a simple modeling exercise shows that net ecosystem exchange of CO2 is sensitive to changes in the event size distribution representative of wet and dry years. An important regulator of the pulse response is initial soil and canopy conditions and the physical structuring of bare soil and beneath canopy patches on the landscape. Initial condition influences responses to pulses of varying magnitude, while bare soil/beneath canopy patches interact to introduce nonlinearity in the relationship between pulse size and soil water response. Building on this conceptual framework and developing a greater understanding of the complexities of these eco-hydrologic systems may enhance our ability to describe the ecology of desert ecosystems and their sensitivity to global change. 3agreenhouse gases 3adry environmental conditions 3agas exchange 3adeserts 3acarbon 3asoil respiration 3aarid zones 3acarbon dioxide 3asoil microorganisms 3aphotosynthesis 3atemporal variation 3aplant growth 3aleaf area 3aduration 3asoil water 3amicrobial activity 3acanopy 3asemiarid zones 3arain 3adesert soils 2aCarbonxphysiology 2aCarbon Dioxidexphysiology 2aDesert Climate 2aEcosystem 2aModels, Biological 2aPhotosynthesisxphysiology 2aPlant Physiological Phenomena 2aRain 2aSoil Microbiology 2aWaterxphysiology 3aMexico 3aSonoran Desert 3aMojave Desert 3aCalifornia 0aNorth America 0aprecipitation 0aChihuahuan Desert 0avegetation structure 0awater1 aSnyder, K.A.1 aTissue, D.1 aLeffler, A.J.1 aOgle, K.1 aPockman, W.T.1 aSandquist, D.R.1 aPotts, D.L.1 aSchwinning, S.0 tOecologia.g2004 Oct., v.  141, no.  2 p.254-268x1432-19397nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-004-1682-43Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/89403Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080116b20080202c00000000  aINDdLYNe2008/01/16  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03697naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024004100132024002100173040001800194072000900212100001800221245011500239300001800354500002400372506007600396520157400472506003702046650002202083650001802105650001602123650002902139650001702168650002202185650002202207650001802229650003202247650002602279650001502305650002302320650005302343650001802396650003102414650001402445650003202459650001202491650000902503650002202512650008202534651001402616700001702630700001602647773010002663852000902763856009102772856011202863930003302975945002503008946001303033961001303046655001203059IND4363026120221207051430.0040624e200402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436302612DNAL7 a147665882pmid7 aPMC3488762pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.70.2.1051-1058.20042doi7 a10113/198952hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ1001 aDavelos, A.L.10aSpatial variation in frequency and intensity of antibiotic interactions among Streptomycetes from prairie soil  ap. 1051-1058.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAntibiotic interactions are believed to be significant to microbial fitness in soil, yet little is known of the frequency, intensity, and diversity of antibiotic inhibition and resistance among indigenous microbes. To begin to address these issues, we studied the abilities of streptomycete isolates from prairie soil to inhibit growth and display resistance to antibiotics produced by a test collection of 10 streptomycete isolates. Wide variations in antibiotic inhibition and resistance for prairie isolates among three locations and four soil depths within a 1-m2 plot were revealed. Fewer than 10% of 153 prairie isolates inhibited all 10 test isolates, while more than 40% of the isolates did not inhibit any of the test isolates. No field isolate was resistant to all of the test isolates, nor was any isolate susceptible to all of the test isolates. No correlation between inhibition and resistance phenotypes was found, suggesting that inhibition and resistance are under independent selection. The significant spatial variation in the frequency and intensity of antibiotic inhibition implies that the fitness benefits of antibiotic production are not the same among locations in soil. In contrast, the consistency of resistance over space indicates that its significance to fitness across locations is stable or the costs of maintaining resistance in the absence of selection are small or nonexistent. The spatial clustering of antibiotic inhibitory activity suggests a variable matrix of selection pressures and microbial responses across the soil landscape.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aStreptomycetaceae 3asoil bacteria 3aantibiotics 3aantibacterial properties 3asoil ecology 3acommunity ecology 3aspatial variation 3aprairie soils 3abiological activity in soil 3aantibiotic resistance 3asoil depth 3apopulation density 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aCulture Media 2aDrug Resistance, Bacterial 2aEcosystem 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aPoaceae 2aSoil 2aSoil Microbiology 2aStreptomycesxclassificationxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 3aMinnesota1 aKinkel, L.L.1 aSamac, D.A.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2004 Feb., v.  70, no.  2 p.1051-1058x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.70.2.1051-1058.20043Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/198953Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20081005b20081101c00000000  aINDdRHFe2004/07/19  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02511naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092024002100128040001800149072000900167072000900176100002400185245009000209300001600299500002400315520113200339650002701471650002401498650001301522650003101535650002601566650000901592650001801601650001001619650001601629700001901645700002201664773008801686852000901774856008601783856011201869939003301981945002502014946001302039961001302052655001202065IND4449387820221121154056.0110215e200310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444938782DNAL7 a10.7589/0090-3558-39.4.8172doi7 a10113/481442hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL832 0aL8101 aPalmer, Mitchell V.10aAerosol exposure of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) to Mycobacterium bovis  ap. 817-823.  aIncludes references  aTuberculosis due to Mycobacterium bovis affects both captive and free-ranging Cervidae in the United States. Various animal models have been developed to study tuberculosis of both humans and animals. Generally, tuberculosis is transmitted by aerosol and oral routes. Models of aerosol exposure of large animals to M. bovis are uncommon. In order to develop a reliable method of aerosol exposure of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) to M. bovis, 12 healthy white-tailed deer, aged 8-10 mo, were infected by aerosol exposure to 2 x 10(5) to 1 x 10(6) colony forming units (CFU) (high close, n = 4) of M. bovis or 6 x 10(2) to 1.6 x 10(3) CFU (low dose, n = 8) of M. bovis. Tuberculous lesions were more widely disseminated in (leer receiving the high dose, while lesions in deer receiving the low dose were more focused on the lungs and associated lymph nodes (tracheobronchial and mediastinal). Aerosol delivery of M. bovis to white-tailed deer results in a reliable manner of experimental infection that may be useful for studies of disease pathogenesis, immune response, mycobacterial shedding, and vaccine efficacy. 3aOdocoileus virginianus 3aMycobacterium bovis 3aaerosols 3aanimal pathogenic bacteria 3aanimal disease models 3adeer 3adose response 3alungs 3alymph nodes1 aWaters, W.

Seventy-two 1-d-old birds were randomly assigned to the HB-BT, IR-BT, or control group. Birds were pair housed by treatment, and beak images and production indices were obtained posttreatment at fixed intervals for 10 wk. Immediately after treatment, HB-BT beaks were shorter than control or IR-BT beaks (P < 0.01), whereas control and IR-BT beaks remained comparable in length until the onset of tissue degeneration and erosion of the IR-BT beaks at 1 to 2 wk posttreatment. At wk 2 posttreatment, beaks were longest in control birds, intermediate in IR-BT birds, and shortest in HB-BT birds (P < 0.01). Thereafter, an increase in beak length in all treatments was observed over time (P < 0.01), but HB-BT beaks had the greatest regrowth. The beak length of birds in the HB-BT group was similar to that of birds in the IR-BT group from wk 3 to 8, and then grew longer at wk 9 and 10 posttreatment (P < 0.01). The effects of treatments on BW emerged at d 5 posttreatment. The BW of birds in the HB-BT group was suppressed up to and including wk 9 posttreatment compared with that of control birds (P < 0.05) and was significantly lower than that of birds in the IR-BT group between 2 and 4 wk posttreatment (P < 0.05). Birds in the IR-BT group did not differ from control birds after wk 3 posttreatment (P < 0.05). By the final week of the study, differences in BW across treatments were no longer apparent (P > 0.05). For the most part, feed intake was higher in control birds, intermediate in birds in the IR-BT group, and lowest in birds in the HB-BT group until wk 9 posttreatment (P < 0.05). Similarly, feed waste was generally higher in control birds and least in birds in the HB-BT group (P < 0.05). The IR-BT treatment appeared to be more effective at inhibiting beak regrowth, with a less pronounced effect on feed intake than the HB-BT treatment in laying hen pullets. 3ainfrared radiation 3apullets 3alaying hens 3abeak 3abeak trimming 3acutting 3aanimal welfare 3agrowth and development 3abody weight 3atissue degeneration 3achicks 3afeed intake 3afeeds 3awastes 3ahen feeding 0aone-half hot blade beak trimming 0ainfrared beak treatment1 aCheng, H.W.0 tPoultry science.g2010 Dec., v.  89, no.  12 p.2559-2564dPoultry Science Associationx0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.2010-008903Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/502183Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20110920b20111007c00000000  aINDd3CTe2011/01/07  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03888naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111040001800132072000900150072000900159072000900168100001700177245014500194300001800339500002400357500001500381520158700396650001501983650001601998650001802014650001102032650001602043650001902059650001002078650002502088650002302113650002102136650001802157650001602175650000902191650002102200650002602221650001202247650005602259650001202315650003502327650005702362650005002419650001102469650002502480650007702505650000902582650001402591650000902605650002502614650003002639653001602669653001102685653002002696653002502716653002302741700001302764700001802777700001602795700001802811773008402829852000902913856011202922930003303034945001303067946001303080961001303093655001203106IND2331582620221120124023.0030325e200110  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233158262DNAL7 a115840962pmid7 a10113/284662hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT200 0aT300 0aX3801 aPoulos, S.P.10aPre- and postnatal dietary conjugated linoleic acid alters adipose development, body weight gain and body composition in Sprague-Dawley rats  ap. 2722-2731.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aSprague-Dawley rats were fed either a control diet (7 g/100 g soybean oil) or a conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) diet (6.5 g/100 g soybean oil and 0.5 g/100 g CLA) beginning on d 7 of gestation to determine whether pre- and postnatal CLA affects short- and long-term growth and adiposity. At weaning (d 21), progeny were assigned control or CLA diet and fed until 11 wk of age. At birth, litter size and weight were not different between treatments. There were age- and sex-dependent changes in inguinal adipose fatty acid composition at birth and weaning, whereas there were no differences in lipid accretion or adipocyte proliferation. At weaning, CLA did not alter inguinal adipocyte proliferation but increased (P < 0.01) CCAAT/enhancer binding alpha protein expression in inguinal adipose tissue from females, whereas there was no difference in expression in males. Significant differences in size distribution of inguinal adipocytes at weaning and retroperitoneal adipocytes at 11 wk of age were observed. In general, CLA increased the proportion of smaller cells and decreased the proportion of larger cells. The main long-term effect of the dams' diet was the significantly heavier gastrocnemius and soleus muscles, and significantly longer tail lengths, an indication of skeletal growth, of male pups whose dams were fed CLA. Postweaning diet reduced fat pad weights in female but not male pups fed CLA. This response was due to differences in cell size rather than number. Response to CLA treatment may depend on the sex and age of the animal as well as duration of feeding. 3aadipocytes 3aweight gain 3alinoleic acid 3aRattus 3acell growth 3aadipose tissue 3amales 3aprenatal development 3agender differences 3abody composition 3aanimal models 3afeed intake 3arats 3afeed supplements 3apostnatal development 3afemales 2aAdipose Tissuexdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aAnimals 2aBody Compositionxdrug effects 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aEmbryonic and Fetal Developmentxdrug effects 2aFemale 2aGrowthxdrug effects 2aLinoleic Acidxadministration & dosagexbloodxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aMale 2aPregnancy 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aWeight Gainxdrug effects 0afatty acids 0agrowth 0aage differences 0arats, sprague-dawley 0alaboratory mammals1 aSisk, M.1 aHausman, D.B.1 aAzain, M.J.1 aHausman, G.J.0 tJournal of nutrition.g2001 Oct., v.  131, no.  10 p.2722-2731x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/284663Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090430b20090508c00000000  aINDdRSC  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02176naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092024002100131040001800152100001700170245015500187300001400342500002400356520079400380650002601174650002001200650001801220650001501238650001901253650002701272653001501299653001301314653001901327700001801346700001701364773009301381852000901474856011201483856008901595930003301684945001301717946001101730961001301741655001201754IND2164362520221119200736.0980929e199801  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216436252DNAL7 a10.1016/S0022-474X(97)00023-42doi7 a10113/131882hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMullen, M.A.10aInfluence of trap design and location on the capture of Plodia interpunctella (Indian meal moth) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) in a release-recapture study  ap. 33-36.  aIncludes references  aFive commercial pheromone trap designs were tested simultaneously in a warehouse to determine the most effective design for capturing Plodia interpunctella (Hubner) (the Indian meal moth). About 72% of the males released were recaptured. The most effective trap was the wing trap (Pherocon 1c), which significantly exceeded the expected value. The remaining trap designs in order of effectiveness were the diamond trap (Pherocon II), Multipher, Delta and Unitrap. Of these four traps, only the diamond trap equalled or slightly surpassed the expected catch number. The location of the traps affected the catch, with traps located near the walls of the warehouse capturing the most insects. Unbaited traps caught few insects, and the necessity of using unbaited traps in tests is discussed. 3aPlodia interpunctella 3apheromone traps 3astorage pests 3amonitoring 3ainsect control 3amark-recapture studies 0awarehouses 0aefficacy 0atrap placement1 aWileyto, E.P.1 aArthur, F.H.0 tJournal of stored products research.g1998 Jan., v.  34, no.  1 p.33-36x0022-474X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/131883Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0022-474X(97)00023-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20080416b20080502c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03845naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111040001800132072000900150072000900159072000900168100001600177245010000193300001400293500002400307500001500331520191400346650002002260650001902280650002102299650003202320650001602352650002202368650002302390650002102413650001602434650001002450650002302460650002502483650002102508650002102529650002402550650002002574650001002594650001602604650001402620650002202634650001102656650001102667650002602678650001602704650002002720650002102740650001002761653001002771653002202781653002502803700001502828700002002843773007902863852000902942856011202951930003303063945001303096946001303109961001303122655001203135IND2333704920221120134106.0030721e200101  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233370492DNAL7 a112089382pmid7 a10113/284672hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aT200 0aT0001 aButte, N.F.10aEnergy requirements of lactating women derived from doubly labeled water and milk energy output  ap. 53-58.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aInstead of using an incremental approach to assess the energy requirements of lactation, a more comprehensive approach may be taken by measuring total energy expenditure (TEE), milk energy output and energy mobilization from tissue stores. The latter approach avoids assumptions regarding energetic efficiency and changes in physical activity and adiposity. The purpose of this study was threefold: to assess the energy requirements of lactation; to compare these estimates with energy requirements in the nonpregnant, nonlactating state and to test for energetic adaptations in basal metabolic rate (BMR) and physical activity during the energy-demanding process of lactation. Milk production and composition, body weight and composition, TEE, BMR and physical activity levels were measured in 24 well-nourished women during exclusive breastfeeding at 3 mo postpartum and after the cessation of breastfeeding at 18 or 24 mo postpartum. TEE was measured by the doubly labeled water method, milk production by 3-d test-weighing, milk energy by bomb calorimetry on a 24-h milk sample, body composition by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and BMR by room respiration calorimetry. TEE, BMR and physical activity level (physical activity level = TEE/BMR) did not differ between the lactating and nonlactating state (TEE 10.0 +/- 1.5 versus 10.6 +/- 2.1 MJ/d). Mean milk energy output was equivalent to 2.02 +/- 0.33 MJ/d. Total energy requirements were greater during lactation than afterward (12.0 +/- 1.4 versus 10.6 +/- 2.1 MJ/d, P: = 0.002). Energy mobilization from tissue stores (-0.65 +/- 0.97 MJ/d) resulted in net energy requirements during lactation of 11.4 +/- 1.8 MJ/d. Because adaptations in basal metabolism and physical activity were not evident in these well-nourished women, energy requirements during lactation were met primarily from the diet and only partially by mobilization of tissue stores. 3alactating women 3aenergy content 3aisotope labeling 3aanthropometric measurements 3abody weight 3aphysical activity 3aenergy expenditure 3abody composition 3abreast milk 3awater 3amaternal nutrition 3anutrition assessment 3afood composition 3abasal metabolism 3aenergy requirements 3astable isotopes 2aAdult 2aCalorimetry 2aDeuterium 2aEnergy Metabolism 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aLactationxphysiology 2aMilk, Human 2aOxygen Isotopes 2aReference Values 2aWater 0awomen 0aenergy metabolism 0anutrition physiology1 aWong, W.W.1 aHopkinson, J.M.0 tJournal of nutrition.g2001 Jan., v.  131, no.  1 p.53-58x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/284673Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090428b20090508c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02591naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140072000900149100002200158245009900180300001600279500002400295500001500319520125300334650002001587650001201607650001701619650001401636650001401650650001001664650001501674650001401689653002001703700002601723700002401749700002401773700001901797773009801816852000901914856011201923930003302035945002502068946001302093961001502106655001202121IND4459693820111104121711.0110708s2010    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND445969382DNAL7 a10113/502212hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aL300 0aL0011 aBlanco, Carlos A.10aMating Behavior of Wild Helicoverpa zea (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) Males with Laboratory Females  ap. 191-198.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aStudies conducted with the offspring of field-captured moths offer reliable indicators of natural behavior and response to tests. Utilizing techniques that can maximize mating frequency to obtain the greatest genetic representation of field-collected males is critical for developing representative data from laboratory studies. We studied techniques to maximize the potential genetic diversity of offspring from pheromone trap-captured Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) males (wild) enclosed with laboratory females for one to five days, compared with the enclosure of laboratory females and males. Females mated with wild males obtained their highest number of copulations, produced the largest proportion of fertile eggs, and lived longer when males were removed from their enclosure after two days. Higher female mortality was also observed after this time, further decreasing the potential genetic diversity of the offspring. Experiments conducted with two moth crowding ratios (30 and 60) for same-sex groupings indicated that copulations carried important negative longevity consequences for both sexes. Studies conducted with the offspring of 2-day moth enclosures may offer the greatest genetic diversity while reducing mortality of parental moths. 3aHelicoverpa zea 3afemales 3ainsect pests 3alongevity 3afecundity 3amales 3acopulation 3amortality 0amating behavior1 aSumerford, Douglas V.1 aLópez, Juan D.

It’s assumed that, without the program, production and conservation practices on CRP lands would be the same as those used on surrounding lands. When range and forest lands are (are not) included as land-use options, 54 (71) percent of the CRP land would be in crop production—which is consistent with past analyses. Soil erosion would be 222 to 248 million tons per year—about 11 percent—higher than the current level. Benefits are estimated by applying environmental benefit models, estimated in previous analyses, to the CRP’s estimated effect on erosion and wildlife habitat. Nationally, the CRP is estimated to provide $1.3 billion in annual benefits, which represents 75 to 80 percent of the program’s cost. In seven of the 10 USDA Farm Production Regions, the CRP’s environmental benefits exceed costs. Thus, real-locating acreage to these regions could increase net program benefits. However, because many benefits could not be estimated, one cannot conclude that regional and national benefits do not exceed costs. 3aConservation Reserve Program 3aecosystem services 3asoil conservation 3asoil erosion 3amathematical models 3awildlife management 3awater quality 3aUnited States0 tAgricultural and resource economics review.g2007 Oct., v.  36, no.  2 p.267-280wJournal:22623x1068-28057nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/366643Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20091215b20100101c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/12/15  aOther US  aUSDA/ERS 7aarticle03077naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131100001800140245010900158300001800267500002400285500001500309520179100324650001302115650001902128650002202147650003002169650003102199650002702230650002202257653004302279700001802322700001802340700002002358773007202378852000902450856011202459930003302571945002502604946001302629961001302642655001202655IND4460416620221118170051.0110727e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446041662DNAL7 a10113/502222hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8311 aTallada, J.G.10aDetection of Fungus-Infected Corn Kernels Using Near-Infrared Reflectance Spectroscopy and Color Imaging  ap. 1151-1158.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aContamination of grain products by fungus can lead to economic losses and is deleterious to human and livestock health. Detection and quantification of fungus-infected corn kernels would be advantageous for producers and breeders in evaluating quality and in selecting hybrids with resistance to infection. This study evaluated the performance of single-kernel near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) and color imaging to discriminate corn kernels infected by eight fungus species at different levels of infection. Discrimination was done according to the level of infection and the mold species. NIR spectra (904 to 1685 nm) and color images were used to develop linear and nonlinear prediction models using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural networks. NIRS was able to accurately detect 98% of the uninfected control kernels, compared to about 89% for the color imaging. Results for detecting all levels of infection using NIR were 89% and 79% for the uninfected control and infected kernels, respectively; color imaging was able to discriminate 75% of both the control and infected kernels. In general, there was better discrimination for control kernels than for infected kernels, and certain mold species had better classification accuracy than others when using NIR. The vision system was not able to classify mold species well. The use of principal component analysis on image data did not improve the classification results, while LDA performed almost as well as MLP models. LDA and mean centering NIR spectra gave better classification models. Compared to the results of NIR spectrometry, the classification accuracy of the color imaging system was less attractive, although the instrument has a lower cost and a higher throughput. 3aZea mays 3aimage analysis 3adisease detection 3afungal diseases of plants 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aspectral analysis 0anear-infrared reflectance spectroscopy1 aWicklow, D.T.1 aPearson, T.C.1 aArmstrong, P.R.0 tTransactions of the ASABE.g2011 , v.  54, no.  3 p.1151-11587nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/502223Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20111219b20120106c00000000  aINDdRSCe2011/09/21  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02708naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002100130040001800151072000900169100001600178245007400194300001600268500002400284520117700308650001701485650001101502650002001513650001501533650001001548650002201558650002301580650001301603650002601616650003001642650002501672650002801697650002701725651002601752700001501778700001601793700001401809773008801823852000901911856011201920856008802032930003302120945002502153946001102178961001302189655001202202IND4365161920221119075514.0041022e20041005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436516192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2004.07.0102doi7 a10113/103752hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8231 aTrout, J.M.10aPrevalence of Giardia duodenalis genotypes in pre-weaned dairy calves  ap. 179-186.  aIncludes references  aTo determine the prevalence of Giardia genotypes in pre-weaned dairy calves, fecal samples were collected from a minimum of 18, 1-7-week-old dairy calves per farm on two farms each in the states of Vermont, New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, and Florida. Samples cleaned of fecal debris and concentrated using CsCl density gradient centrifugation were stained and examined by immunofluorescence microscopy and also subjected to PCR and gene sequence analysis. Prevalence by PCR ranged from 9% on a farm in Pennsylvania to 93% on a farm in Vermont, with an average prevalence for 407 calves on 14 farms of 40%. Gene sequence analysis of the TPI, beta-giardin and 16S rRNA genes revealed 85% of the positive samples to be Assemblage E, while 15% were Assemblage A, although the percentages of these genotypes varied greatly from farm to farm. Some farms had no Assemblage A Giardia. Thus, while a majority of the calves were infected with a genotype that is not known to be infectious for humans, calves on 7 of 14 farms did harbor Assemblage A Giardia. Calves should be considered as a potential source of human infectious cysts in the environment. 3adairy cattle 3acalves 3aGiardia lamblia 3agiardiasis 3afeces 3adisease detection 3adisease prevalence 3agenotype 3amolecular systematics 3apolymerase chain reaction 3anucleotide sequences 3apathogen identification 3ageographical variation 3aEastern United States1 aSantin, M.1 aGreiner, E.1 aFayer, R.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2004 Oct. 5, v.  124, no.  3-4 p.179-186x0304-40177nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/103753Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2004.07.0103Available from publisher's Web site  a20080225b20080301c00000000  aINDdNZMe2004/12/20  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle01883naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140072000900149100002300158245007600181300001600257500002400273520063200297650001900929650001800948650002100966650002400987650001401011650001501025650001801040651001801058653002501076700001601101700002201117700002101139773007201160852000901232856011201241930003301353945002501386946001301411961001301424655001201437IND4429766820221119215806.0091210e20090608xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442976682DNAL7 a10113/366672hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL100 0aX200 0aX6001 aGillespie, Jeffrey10aComputerized Technology Adoption Among Farms in the U.S. Dairy Industry  ap. 201-209.  aIncludes references  aThis article examines the rate of adoption of four computerized technologies in U.S. dairy production: an on-farm computer to manage dairy records, accessing the internet for dairy information, computerized milking systems and computerized feed delivery systems.

CBB pathogens were distributed among four terminal clades, however, the majority of African and Neotropical isolates cluster in a well-supported monophyletic group, informally designated AFNEO_1. Although the relationship between African and Neotropical AFNEO_1 is unresolved, the majority of alleles detected were exclusive to either the African or the Neotropical populations. These fixed genetic differences suggest that their disjunction predates the world trade in coffee. Neotropical AFNEO_1 have a broad host range and CBB pathogens are intermixed phylogenetically with isolates from diverse indigenous insects. Several Neotropical AFNEO_1 isolates were isolated from coffee plants as epiphytes or endophytes, thus plants themselves may potentially serve as reservoirs of pathogens against their insect pests. Topological incongruence between the EFutr and Bloc phylogenies of Neotropical AFNEO_1 may signify that individuals within this population are recombining. 3aBeauveria bassiana 3aentomopathogenic fungi 3aHypothenemus hampei 3astrains 3aphylogeny 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3ageographical variation 3abiogeography 3aCoffea 3acoffee (beverage) 3aepiphytes 3aendophytes 3aintergenic DNA 2aAnimals 2aCell Nucleus 2aCoffeexparasitology 2aDNA, Fungalxanalysis 2aGenetic Markers 2aHypocrealesxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aMycological Typing Techniques 2aPest Control, Biologicalxmethods 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Diseasesxparasitology 2aTropical Climate 2aWeevilsxmicrobiologyxparasitologyxphysiology. 3aAfrica 3aSouth America 3aCentral America 3aMexico 0aAfrica 0aCentral America 0aSouth America 0aBeauveria bassiana sensu lato 0aAfrican region 0aNeotropical region1 aPosada, F.1 aBuckley, E.P.1 aInfante, F.1 aCastillo, A.1 aVega, F.E.0 tJournal of invertebrate pathology.g2006 Sept., v.  93, no.  1 p.11-21x0022-20117nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/60473Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2006.04.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20100825b20100903c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/09/20  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03321naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024004100132024002100173040001800194100002100212245011600233300001800349500002400367506007600391520128700467506003701754650002501791650002001816650001301836650002201849650002001871650001801891650002501909650002501934650002401959650003401983650001302017650003302030650002902063650006202092650003102154650002602185653002302211653002802234700001502262700002702277700001502304700001702319773010002336852000902436856009102445856011202536930003302648945001302681946001302694961001202707655001202719IND2328306220221207051406.0020731e200206  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232830622DNAL7 a120397222pmid7 aPMC1239102pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.68.6.2699-2703.20022doi7 a10113/198842hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJensen, K.A.

The hitherto uncharacterized quinone reductase that drives this cycle is a potential target for inhibitors of wood decay. We have identified the major quinone reductase expressed by G. trabeum under conditions that elicit high levels of quinone redox cycling. The enzyme comprises two identical 22-kDa subunits, each with one molecule of flavin mononucleotide. It is specific for NADH as the reductant and uses the quinones produced by G. trabeum (2,5-dimethoxy-1,4-benzoquinone and 4,5-dimethoxy-1,2-benzoquinone) as electron acceptors. The affinity of the reductase for these quinones is so high that precise kinetic parameters were not obtainable, but it is clear that k(cat)/K(m) for the quinones is greater than 10(8) M(-1) s(-1). The reductase is encoded by a gene with substantial similarity to NAD(P)H:quinone reductase genes from other fungi. The G. trabeum quinone reductase may function in quinone detoxification, a role often proposed for these enzymes, but we hypothesize that the fungus has recruited it to drive extracellular oxyradical production.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGloeophyllum trabeum 3aenzyme activity 3aquinones 3acomplementary DNA 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aKinetics 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aPolyporaceaexenzymology 2aQuinone Reductasesxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aSequence Analysis, Protein 2aSubcellular Fractions 0aquinone reductases 0amolecular sequence data1 aRyan, Z.C.1 aVanden Wymelenberg, A.1 aCullen, D.1 aHammel, K.E.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2002 June, v.  68, no.  6 p.2699-2703x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.68.6.2699-2703.20023Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/198843Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20081005b20081101c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US  aUSDA/FS 7aarticle03024naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092024002000117040001800137072000900155072000900164072000900173100001700182245011300199300001600312500002400328500002300352500001500375520129500390650001501685650001701700650001701717650001501734650002301749650002101772650001601793650002701809650001701836650001701853650002101870653001401891653001101905653001901916700002101935700001501956700001901971773009701990852000902087856007502096856011102171856009502282930003302377945002502410946001102435961001202446655001202458IND4393468720221121062847.0070726e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439346872DNAL7 a10.1139/X06-2942doi7 a10113/16712hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aK250 0aK810 0aF4001 aMcEwan, R.W.13aAn experimental evaluation of fire history reconstruction using dendrochronology in white oak (Quercus alba)  ap. 806-816.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aDendrochronological analysis of fire scars on tree cross sections has been critically important for understanding historical fire regimes and has influenced forest management practices. Despite its value as a tool for understanding historical ecosystems, tree-ring-based fire history reconstruction has rarely been experimentally evaluated. To examine the efficacy of dendrochronological analysis for detecting fire occurrence in oak forests, we analyzed tree cross sections from sites in which prescribed fires had been recently conducted. The first fire in each treatment unit created a scar in at least one sample, but the overall percentage of samples containing scars in fire years was low (12%). We found that scars were created by 10 of the 15 prescribed fires, and the five undetected fires all occurred in sites where fire had occurred the previous year. Notably, several samples contained scars from known fire-free periods. In summary, our data suggest that tree-ring analysis is a generally effective tool for reconstructing historical fire regimes, although the following points of uncertainty were highlighted: (i) consecutive annual burns may not create fire scars and (ii) wounds that are morphologically indistinguishable from fire scars may originate from nonfire sources. 3atopography 3agrowth rings 3aforest trees 3afire scars 3aprescribed burning 3adendrochronology 3afire regime 3aforest fire management 3aQuercus alba 3aforest fires 3aplant morphology 0awildfires 0aaspect 0afire frequency1 aHutchinson, T.F.1 aFord, R.D.1 aMcCarthy, B.C.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2007 Apr., v.  37, no.  4 p.806-816x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/X06-2943Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/16713Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://pubs.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/cgi-bin/rp/rp2_vols_e?cjfr3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070731b20070902c00000000  aINDdLYNe2007/07/31  aNon-US  aUSDA/FS 7aarticle03084naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002000134040001800154072000900172072000900181072000900190100001400199245017300213300001600386500002400402520137800426650001401804650002501818650003001843650002701873650001701900650001601917650001501933650002101948650002001969650002501989650002402014651002102038653003302059700001402092700001902106700001502125700001402140700001402154773007802168852000902246856011102255856009202366930003302458945002502491946001302516961001302529655001202542IND4380302220221121051700.0060518e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438030222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocontrol.2005.11.0012doi7 a10113/18132hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF900 0aL300 0aL0011 aSmith, L.10aAssessment of risk of attack to safflower by Ceratapion basicorne (Coleoptera: Apionidae), a prospective biological control agent of Centaurea solstitialis (Asteraceae)  ap. 337-344.  aIncludes references  aCeratapion basicorne (Coleoptera: Apionidae) is a prospective biological control agent of yellow starthistle (Centaurea solstitialis, Asteraceae: Cardueae), which is an important invasive alien weed in the western United States. Previous studies have shown that it is possible for this insect to oviposit on and complete development on safflower (Carthamus tinctorius) under no-choice laboratory conditions; however, it has never been reported as a pest of safflower. Field experiments were conducted at three sites in eastern Turkey during 3 years to evaluate the risk of attack on safflower by this insect in its native range. At two sites where C. basicorne was the only apionid observed, no safflower plants were attacked despite high attack rates on yellow starthistle test plants (48-98% of plants infested). At a third site, where C. basicorne and three other species in the same genus; C. scalptum, C. orientale, and C. onopordi were present, 8-26% of safflower plants were infested, but none of the insects reared from safflower during 3 years were C. basicorne. Other authors have reported rearing C. basicorne from field-collected plants of only Ce. solstitialis, Ce. cyanus, Ce. depressa, and Cnicus benedictus. Our results indicate that C. basicorne does not attack safflower under field conditions and that its introduction would not pose a risk to this crop. 3aBrentidae 3aphytophagous insects 3abiological control agents 3aCentaurea solstitialis 3aweed control 3ahost plants 3ahost range 3ahost specificity 3arisk assessment 3aCarthamus tinctorius 3anontarget organisms 3aTurkey (country) 0aclassical biological control1 aHayat, R.1 aCristofaro, M.1 aTronci, C.1 aTozlu, G.1 aLecce, F.0 tBiological control.g2006 Mar., v.  36, no.  3 p.337-344x1049-96447nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/18133Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2005.11.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20070801b20070902c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/05/30  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03582naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092024001900133024002200152024002100174040001800195072000900213100002300222245013600245300001800381500002400399500001500423506007600438520122500514506003701739650001801776650001401794650002001808650002001828650002301848650002001871650003301891650001601924650001001940650002001950650002401970650001601994650003202010650006202042650005602104650001102160650003102171650002502202650001702227650003002244650002902274650002102303653002102324653000902345653002002354700002402374700001902398700002102417700002302438700002202461773008102483852000902564856011202573856009102685930003302776945002502809946001302834961001302847655001202860IND4432816820221207070257.0100216e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443281682DNAL7 a10.1128/JVI.79.8.4838-4847.20052doi7 a157952692pmid7 aPMC10695222pmcid7 a10113/386072hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8331 aBautista, Elida M.10aConstitutive Expression of Alpha Interferon by Skin Dendritic Cells Confers Resistance to Infection by Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus  ap. 4838-4847.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe role of dendritic cells (DC) in the initiation of immune responses against foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is poorly understood. We analyzed the innate response of freshly isolated swine skin DC to the virus and show a rapid induction of beta interferon (IFN-β) mRNA but not IFN-α mRNA. However, these DC secreted both IFN-α and IFN-β proteins in response to live virus but not killed virus. Furthermore, the surface expression of swine major histocompatibility complex class II (SLA II) or CD80/CD86 molecules and antigen processing functions were not affected by FMDV exposure. Given the demonstrated sensitivity of FMDV to IFN-α/β, there was no productive or nonproductive infection of these cells. Finally, freshly isolated skin DC constitutively expressed intracellular IFN-α protein in the absence of stimulation, with no detectable secretion of the cytokine until virus exposure. In situ analysis of these DC showed that these cells express and store IFN-α in uninfected animals. This is the first demonstration of the constitutive expression of IFN-α in resident, tissue-derived DC and indicates that skin DC can play an important role in the innate immune response of swine to viral infections.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amessenger RNA 3ainfection 3adendritic cells 3agene expression 3adisease resistance 3aimmune response 3aFoot-and-mouth disease virus 3ainterferons 3aswine 2aCells, Cultured 2aCytokinesxgenetics 2aDNA Primers 2aDendritic Cellsximmunology 2aFoot-and-Mouth Diseaseximmunologyxprevention & control. 2aFoot-and-Mouth Disease Virusxgeneticsximmunology. 2aHumans 2aInterferon-alphaxgenetics 2aMicroscopy, Confocal 2aPhagocytosis 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aRNA, Messengerxgenetics 2aSkinximmunology 0aalpha-interferon 0askin 0abeta-interferon1 aFerman, Geoffrey S.1 aGregg, Douglas1 aBrum, Mario C.S.1 aGrubman, Marvin J.1 aGolde, William T.0 tJournal of virology.g2005 Apr., v.  79, no.  8 p.4838-4847x1098-55147nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/386073Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/JVI.79.8.4838-4847.20053Available from publisher's Web site  a20100220b20100305c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/02/19  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02240naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092024002000131040001800151072000900169072000900178072000900187072000900196100001800205245004200223300001600265500002400281520070600305650001701011650001801028650001701046650001001063650001101073650001101084650001101095650002801106650001501134650002101149650002701170650001401197651001501211651001601226651001001242700001501252700001501267700001801282700002001300773006301320852000901383856011101392856008901503930003301592945002501625946001101650961001301661655001201674IND4399786320221118054919.0080109e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439978632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquabot.2005.11.0042doi7 a10113/89302hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF900 0aF600 0aM001 0aX1001 aSpencer, D.F.10aEstimating Arundo donax shoot biomass  ap. 272-276.  aIncludes references  aWe developed an equation for estimating Arundo donax shoot dry weight from shoot length.

Using in-gel analysis, two PI protein activities were detected at approximately 24- and/or 28-kDa in hairy roots generated via Agrobacterium rhizogenes-mediated gene transfer. Immunoblot analysis revealed the presence of the expected ~40 kDa precursor, and in some transformants, a ~20 kDa processing intermediate and the mature 6-kDa PIs. In general, processing of the precursor in the clonal lines was reduced or not detected.

Groups fed the control diet (1.10% Lys) were also pair-fed daily with each deficient group. Compared with the free-fed control, graded decreases in feed intake occurred as the deficiency worsened, and these were significantly different with 0.66 and 0.53% Lys. Growth decreased significantly with each deficient level of Lys compared with the free-fed control and was always significantly lower than in the pair-fed control groups in each set. Plasma triiodothyronine (T3) was elevated in chicks fed 0.88 and 0.66% lysine but not with 0.53% when compared with the full-fed control treatment. However, in deficient chicks receiving 0.66 and 0.53% Lys, T3 levels were significantly higher compared with their pair-fed controls. Plasma T4 was not significantly different between any treatments. Liver weights decreased significantly at each level of Lys deficiency, but most of the differences disappeared when expressed relative to body weight. Plasma insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I decreased significantly with the most severe Lys deficiency. However, it decreased to a similar degree in the pair-fed controls, showing that this effect was primarily due to the lower feed intake. Plasma IGF-II levels did not differ between any treatments. No correlations were evident between thyroid hormones and IGF-I or IGF-II values. We concluded that the primary effect of Lys deficiency was an elevation in plasma T3 levels without accompanying changes in plasma T4. No effect of the Lys deficiency per se on plasma IGF-I and IGF-II and liver weights relative to body weights was found. 3abroiler chickens 3anutrient deficiencies 3adose response 3aL-thyroxine 3abody weight 3ainsulin-like growth factor II 2aAnimals 2aBody Weight 2aChickensxgrowth & development 2aDiet 2aInsulin-Like Growth Factor Ixanalysis 2aInsulin-Like Growth Factor IIxanalysis 2aLiverxanatomy & histology 2aLysinexadministration & dosagexdeficiency. 2aMale 2aOrgan Size 2aThyroid Hormonesxblood 2aThyroxinexblood 2aTriiodothyroninexblood1 aMcMurtry, J.1 aAlster, F.0 tPoultry science.g2005 July, v.  84, no.  7 p.1045-1050x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/84.7.10453Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/38613Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20070926b20071002c00000000  aINDdJITe2005/08/08  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03125naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092040001800112072000900130072000900139100001600148245007500164300001800239500002400257520193900281650004102220650002802261650001902289650001602308650002402324651001202348653001702360700001802377700001702395700001702412773008202429852000902511856011102520930003302631945002502664946001302689961001302702655001202715IND4365688920221118142332.0041119e200409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436568892DNAL7 a10113/97172hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP200 0aX1001 aBosch, D.D.10aEvaluation of the SWAT model on a coastal plain agricultural watershed  ap. 1493-1506.  aIncludes references  aThe Better Assessment Science Integrating point and Nonpoint Sources (BASINS) system was developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to facilitate developing total maximum daily loads (TMDLs). The Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is one of the watershed-scale simulation models within BASINS. Because of the critical nature of the TMDL process, it is imperative that BASINS and SWAT be adequately validated for regions on which they are being applied. BASINS and SWAT were tested using six years of hydrologic data from a 22 km2 subwatershed of the Little River in Georgia. Comparisons were made between water balance results obtained using high and low spatial resolution data as well as those obtained using default initial parameters versus those modified for existing groundwater conditions. In general, all scenarios simulated general trends in the observed flow data. However, for the years with lower precipitation, the total water yields simulated with the low spatial resolution data and the default initial conditions were overpredicted by up to 27% of the annual precipitation input. Total water yields simulated using the high spatial resolution input data were within 20% of the observed yields for each year of the assessment. Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiencies (E) for monthly total water yields were 0.80 using the high spatial resolution data with the modified initial conditions and 0.64 using the low spatial resolution data with the default initial conditions. While the model simulated general streamflow trends, discrepancies were observed between observed and simulated hydrograph peaks, time to peak, and hydrograph durations. A one-day time lag between the simulated and observed time to peak was the primary cause of large errors in daily flow simulations. Model modification and more extensive calibration may be necessary to increase the accuracy of the daily flow estimates for TMDL development. 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3aagricultural watersheds 3acoastal plains 3astream flow 3awatershed hydrology 3aGeorgia 0aBASINS model1 aSheridan, JM.1 aBatten, H.L.1 aArnold, J.G.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g2004 , v.  47, no.  5 p.1493-1506x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/97173Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080208b20080301c00000000  aINDdRHFe2004/12/17  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02110naa a2200349 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024002800097024002100125040001800146072000900164100001700173245008600190300001800276500002800294520094500322650002401267650002301291650002301314653001301337700001801350700001401368773010801382852000901490856011201499856007801611930003301689946001301722961001301735655001201748991600793510742620221121001529.0860210e198512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aADL860122552DNAL7 a10.1007/BF025416642doi7 a10113/239752hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5041 aSnyder, J.M.10aCapillary gas chromatographic analyses of headspace volatiles from vegetable oils  ap. 1675-1679.  aIncludes 19 references.  aEight different vegetable oils obtained commercially were analyzed for volatiles by capillary gas chromatography (GC). Volatiles generated in a GC static headspace sampler at 180 C were injected automatically onto a chemically bonded capillary column. Only a small number of GC peaks of low intensity were observed in the fresh samples, which varied in peroxide values from 0.2 to 3. Several major peaks were evident in the oils aged eight and 16 days at 60 C with peroxide values ranging from 16 to 65. Thirty-four GC peaks were identified on the basis of relative retention time of reference compounds and on the basis of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Volatile compounds identified were those expected from the autoxidation of principal unsaturated fatty acid components of each vegetable oil tested. The relative concentrations of volatile components increased with the level of oxidation as determined by peroxide value. 3aplant fats and oils 3avolatile compounds 3agas chromatography 0aanalysis1 aFrankel, E.N.1 aSelke, E.0 tJournal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g1985 Dec., v.  62, no.  12 p.1675-1679x0003-021X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/239753Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF025416643Available from publisher's Web site  a20090220b20090301c00000000  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02597naa a2200457 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024002800097024002100125040001800146072000900164072000900173100002200182245007700204300001800281500002800299520123000327650001601557650002201573650001101595650001001606650001401616650001401630650001101644650001101655650001101666650001801677650002001695653001401715700001701729700001501746773010801761852000901869856011201878856007801990930003302068946001302101961001302114655001202127991600793380742620221121001545.0860210e198512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aADL860122602DNAL7 a10.1007/BF025416692doi7 a10113/239762hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ504 0aQ1041 aMoulton, K.J.

The hydrogenated products were evaluated for flavor and oxidative stability. Processing conditions were varied to produce oils of linolenate contents between 0.4 and 2.7%, as follows: oil flow, 0.6-2.2 liters/hr; reaction temperature, 180-220 C; hydrogen pressure, 100-525 psig, and catalyst concentration, 0.5-1% copper catalyst or 0.1% nickel catalyst. Trans unsaturation varied from 8 to 20% with copper catalyst and from 15.0 to 27% with nickel catalyst. Linolenate selectivity was 9 with copper catalyst and 2 with nickel catalyst. Flavor evaluation of finished oils containing 0.01% citric acid (CA), appraised initially and after accelerated storage at 60 C, showed no significant difference between hydrogenated oils and nonhydrogenated oil. However, peroxide values and oxidative stability showed that hydrogenated oils were more stable than the unhydrogenated oil. CA+TBHQ (tertiary butylhydroquinone) significantly improved the oxidative stability of test oils over oils with CA only, but flavor scores showed no improvement. Dimethylpolysiloxane (MS) had no effect on either flavor or oxidative stability of the oils. 3asoybean oil 3ahydrogenated oils 3aflavor 3ataste 3aoxidation 3acatalysts 3acopper 3anickel 3aesters 3ahydrogenation 3afood processing 0astability1 aKoritala, S.1 aWarner, K.0 tJournal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g1985 Dec., v.  62, no.  12 p.1698-1701x0003-021X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/239763Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF025416693Available from publisher's Web site  a20090220b20090301c00000000  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02433naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131100001700140245009700157300001600254500010900270500002400379520123400403650002701637650002701664650001401691650001601705650003201721651001301753700001701766773007301783852000901856856011201865930003301977945002502010946001102035961001302046655001202059IND4430253720221116164751.0091222e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443025372DNAL7 a10113/386122hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8311 aFontem, D.A.10aAggressiveness and sensitivity to metalaxyl of Phytophthora infestans isolates from Cameroon  ap. 141-147.  aPaper presented at the Third International Late Blight Conference, held April 3-6, 2008, Beijing, China.  aIncludes references  aIsolates of Phytophthora infestans were obtained from diverse hosts (potato, tomato and garden huckleberry) in Cameroon and assessed for aggressiveness and sensitivity to metalaxyl in replicated in vitro experiments. Aggressiveness tests were conducted on detached leaves and metalaxyl sensitivity was determined on leaf disks. Inoculated leaves and disks were incubated in Petri dishes in temperature chambers at 18°C for 7-8 days, 12h daylight. The P. infestans isolates derived from potato and tomato were more aggressive than those isolated from huckleberry. The average lesion area on inoculated leaves ranged from 17 to 41%, 13 to 38% and 5 to 16% on potato, tomato and huckleberry, respectively. Variation in the sensitivity of P. infestans isolates to metalaxyl was recorded, depending on the geographic and host origins of the isolates. Resistance to metalaxyl was detected in 49.0 and 50.3% of the isolates in 2001 and 2002, respectively. Resistance to metalaxyl was greatest on isolates derived from tomato and least on those obtained from huckleberry. We discussed how assessment of metalaxyl resistance and aggressiveness among pathogen isolates would be useful for effective management of P. infestans in Cameroon. 3aPhytophthora infestans 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3ametalaxyl 3ahost plants 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3aCameroon1 aOlanya, O.M.0 tActa horticulturae.g2009 June, , no. 834 p.141-147x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/386123Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100220b20100305c00000000  aINDdARSe2010/02/19  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04122naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111024002000138040001800158072000900176072000900185100001500194245011700209300001800326500002400344520184100368650002502209650001302234650003002247650002702277650002802304650001302332650001502345650002302360650002502383650002302408650002302431650001302454650002302467650002402490650001202514650005002526650005602576650009002632650002702722650004202749650004102791650004702832650002802879650003802907650001502945700001602960700001602976700001602992700001703008700001203025700001603037773009003053852000903143856007703152856011103229930003303340945002503373946001303398961001303411655001203424IND4399824020221118055000.0080111e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439982402DNAL7 a179734422pmid7 a10.1021/pr070356a2doi7 a10113/89362hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL832 0aQ2031 aSeal, B.S.10aProteomic Analyses of a Robust versus a Poor Chicken Gastrointestinal Colonizing Isolate of Campylobacter jejuni  ap. 4582-4591.  aIncludes references  aCampylobacter spp. are a significant contributor to the bacterial etiology of acute gastroenteritis in humans. Epidemiological evidence implicates poultry as a major source of the organism for human illness. However, the factors involved in colonization of poultry with Campylobacter spp. remain unclear. Determining colonization-associated factors at the proteome level should facilitate our understanding of Campylobacter spp. contamination of poultry. Therefore, proteomic analyses were utilized to identify expression differences between two Campylobacter jejuni isolates, a robust colonizer A74/C and a poor colonizing strain of the chicken gastrointestinal system designated NCTC 11168-PMSRU. Proteomic analyses by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed the specific expression of an outer membrane-fibronectin binding protein, serine protease, and a putative aminopeptidase in the soluble portion of the robust colonizer A74C. Several proteins including a cysteine synthase and aconitate hydratase were detected specifically in the poor colonizer C. jejuni NCTC 11168-PMSRU isolate. Variation in the amino acid sequences resulting in different isoelectric points and relative mobility of the flagellin and C. jejuni major outer membrane (MOMP) protein were also detected between the two isolates. Western blotting of the bacterial proteins revealed the presence of two flagellin proteins in the poor colonizer versus one in the robust colonizing isolate, but no differences in MOMP. The results demonstrated that proteomics is useful for characterizing phenotypic variation among Campylobacter spp. isolates. Interestingly, different gene products potentially involved in robust colonization of chickens by Campylobacter spp. appear to conform to recently identified expression patterns in Biofilm or agar-adapted isolates. 3aCampylobacter jejuni 3achickens 3aintestinal microorganisms 3abacterial colonization 3agastrointestinal system 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3abacterial proteins 3aphenotypic variation 3astrain differences 3acampylobacteriosis 3azoonoses 3afood contamination 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxultrastructure. 2aCampylobacter Infectionsxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aCampylobacter jejunixgrowth & developmentxisolation & purificationxultrastructure. 2aChickensxmicrobiology 2aElectrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional 2aFlagellinxgeneticsxultrastructure. 2aGastroenteritisxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPorinsxgeneticsxultrastructure. 2aProteomics1 aHiett, K.L.1 aKuntz, R.L.1 aWoolsey, R.1 aSchegg, K.M.1 aArd, M.1 aStintzi, A.0 tJournal of proteome research.g2007 Dec., v.  6, no.  12 p.4582-4591x1535-39077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/pr070356a3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/89363Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080116b20080202c00000000  aINDdNZMe2008/01/16  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02661naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024003500113040001800148100002100166245014000187300001800327500002400345506017300369520117500542650002801717650001201745650001201757650000901769650001901778650002201797650001501819650002501834650002601859773009501885852000901980856011201989856008502101956007602186961001302262655001202275IND4463009320221117225754.0120409e20120131xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446300932DNAL7 a10113/551252hdl7 a10.1016/j.tsf.2011.12.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEvans, Kervin O.10a1,2-dielaidoylphosphocholine/1,2-dimyristoylphosphoglycerol supported phospholipid bilayer formation in calcium and calcium-free buffer  ap. 3026-3030.  aIncludes references  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aPhospholipid membranes are useful in the field of biocatalysis because a supported phospholipid membrane can create a biomimetic platform where biocatalytic processes can readily occur. In this work, supported bilayer formation from sonicated phospholipid vesicles containing 1,2-dielaidoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)] was studied using a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring and an atomic force microscope. The molar percentages of DEPC and DMPG were varied to determine the effect of overall lipid composition on supported bilayer formation. This work also explored the effect that calcium ion concentration had on supported bilayer formation. Results show that vesicles with up to 50 mol% dimyristoylphosphoglycerol can form a supported bilayer without the presence of calcium ions; however, supported bilayer formation in calcium buffer was inhibited as the anionic (negatively charged) lipid concentration increased. Data suggest that supported phospholipid bilayer formation in the absence of Ca2+ from vesicles containing negatively charged lipids is specific to phosphatidylglycerol. 3aatomic force microscopy 3abuffers 3acalcium 3aions 3alipid bilayers 3alipid composition 3amonitoring 3aphosphatidylcholines 3aphosphatidylglycerols0 tThin solid films.g2012 Jan. 31, v. 520, no. 7 p.3026-3030dElsevier B.V.x0040-60907nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/551253Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tsf.2011.12.0023Available from publisher's Web site  aARIS submissionbhttp://parking.nal.usda.gov/shortterm/113296_10434.pdf  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02790naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092024002100136040001800157072000900175072000900184072000900193100001700202245011500219300001600334500002400350520136800374650003101742650001901773650001901792650001701811650001401828650002001842650002001862653003001882700001501912700001501927700001801942773008701960852000902047856009402056856011202150930003302262945001302295946001102308961001302319655001202332IND2041810420221118170204.0940906e199408  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204181042DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-3040.1994.tb00326.x2doi7 a10113/502102hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aK001 0aB2001 aGarcia, R.L.10aChanges in net photosynthesis and growth of Pinus eldarica seedlings in response to atmospheric CO2 enrichment  ap. 971-978.  aIncludes references  aPinus eldarica L. trees, rooted in the natural soil of an agricultural field at Phoenix, Arizona, were grown from the seedling stage in clear-plastic-wall open-top enclosures maintained at four different atmospheric CO2 concentrations for 15 months. Light response functions were determined for one tree from each treatment by means of whole-tree net CO2 exchange measurements at the end of this period, after which rates of carbon assimilation of an ambient-treatment tree were measured across a range of atmospheric CO2 concentrations. The first of these data sets incorporates the consequences of both the CO2-induced enhancement of net photosynthesis per unit needle area and the CO2-induced enhancement of needle area itself (due primarily to the production of more needles), whereas the second data set reflects only the first of these effects. Hence the division of the normalized results of the first data set by the normalized results of the second set yields a representation of the increase in whole-tree net photosynthesis due to enhanced needle production caused by atmospheric CO2 enrichment. In the solitary trees we studied, the relative contribution of this effect increased rapidly with the CO2 concentration of the air to increase whole-tree net photosynthesis by nearly 50% at a CO2 concentration approximately 300 μmol mol−1 above ambient. 3aPinus brutia var. eldarica 3aphotosynthesis 3acarbon dioxide 3agas exchange 3aleaf area 3aconifer needles 3alight intensity 0acarbon dioxide enrichment1 aIdso, S.B.1 aWall, G.W.1 aKimball, B.A.0 tPlant, cell and environment.g1994 Aug., v.  17, no.  8 p.971-978x0140-77917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3040.1994.tb00326.x3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/502103Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20110920b20111007c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03056naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092024002100123040001800144072000900162100003000171245015800201300002000359500001400379500002400393520131800417650001801735650001201753650001501765650001101780650002801791650001401819650001401833650001601847650002701863650001801890650002201908650002601930650002801956653003101984700002302015700002202038700002002060700002102080773014102101852000902242856011202251856008102363930003302444945002502477946001102502961001302513655001202526IND4458079720221118033944.0110519e200307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445807972DNAL7 a10.1099/ijs.0.02514-02doi7 a10113/494432hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8311 aTomaszewski, Elizabeth K.10aPhylogenetic analysis identifies the ‘megabacterium’ of birds as a novel anamorphic ascomycetous yeast, Macrorhabdus ornithogaster gen. nov., sp. nov  ap. 1201–1205.  aanamorphs  aIncludes references  aAn organism commonly referred to as ‘megabacterium’ colonizes the gastric isthmus of many species of birds. It is weakly Gram-positive and periodic acid–Schiff-positive and stains with silver stains. Previous studies have shown that it has a nucleus and a cell wall similar to those seen in fungi. Calcofluor white M2R staining suggests that the cell wall contains chitin, a eukaryote-specific substance, and rRNA in situ hybridization demonstrates that it is a eukaryote. To characterize this organism phylogenetically, DNA was extracted from purified cells. rDNA was readily amplified by PCR with pan-fungal DNA primer sets and primer sets derived from the newly determined sequence, but not with bacteria-specific primer sets. Specific primer sets amplified rDNA from isthmus scrapings from an infected bird, but not from a non-infected bird or other control DNA. The sequence was confirmed to derive from the purified organism by in situ rRNA hybridization using a specific probe. Phylogenetic analysis of sequences of the 18S rDNA and domain D1/D2 of 26S rDNA showed the organism to be a previously undescribed anamorphic ascomycetous yeast representing a new genus. The name Macrorhabdus ornithogaster gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed for this organism. The type material is CBS 9251T (=NRRL Y-27487T). 3abird diseases 3amycoses 3aAscomycota 3ayeasts 3aanimal pathogenic fungi 3aphylogeny 3anew genus 3anew species 3anew geographic records 3aribosomal DNA 3asequence analysis 3amolecular systematics 3apathogen identification 0aMacrorhabdus ornithogaster1 aLogan, Kathleen S.1 aSnowden, Karen F.1 aKurtzman, C.

We compared the effects of underfeeding on changes in energy expenditure and respiratory quotient in young normal weight men and women [YNW, age 25.7 +/- 3.2 y(SD), body mass index (BMI) 23.1 +/- 1.6 kg/m2], young overweight men and women (YOW, age 26.1 +/- 3.5 y, BMI 27.7 +/- 2.1 kg/m2) and older (OLD) men and women (age 68.4 +/- 3.3 y, BMI 27.4 +/- 3.4 kg/m2). The thermic effect of feeding (TEF) during weight maintenance, and changes in resting energy expenditure (REE) and respiratory quotient were determined in response to undereating by an average 3.75 MJ/d for 6 wk. In addition, body composition was measured. No significant differences among the groups were observed in TEF, fasting and postprandial respiratory quotient, or the change in fasting respiratory quotient with underfeeding. However, REE adjusted for fat-free mass and fat mass was significantly lower in OLD subjects compared with YNW and YOW subjects (P < 0.05). In addition, the REE response to weight change was significantly attenuated in the OLD subjects (P = 0.023). These data suggest that the responsiveness of energy expenditure to negative energy balance is attenuated in old age, and provide further support for the hypothesis that mechanisms of energy regulation are broadly disregulated in old age. 3aelderly 3ayoung adults 3aenergy intake 3aenergy metabolism 3aenergy expenditure 3abody composition 3alipid peroxidation 3alipid metabolism 3abody weight 3amen 3awomen 3amalnutrition 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAgingxphysiology 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aBody Mass Index 2aBody Weight 2aEnergy Intake 2aEnergy Metabolismxphysiology 2aFasting 2aFeeding Behavior 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aLife Style 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aWeight Loss 0aage differences 0aaging1 aMoriguti, J.C.1 aMcCrory, M.A.1 aSaltzman, E.1 aMosunic, C.1 aGreenberg, A.S.1 aRoberts, S.B.0 tJournal of nutrition.g2001 June, v.  131, no.  6 p.1833-1838x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/284603Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090428b20090508c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle01844naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245007500146300001600221500002500237500001500262520089800277650001801175653002801193653001501221700001601236773008001252852000901332856011001341930003301451945000801484946001301492961001301505655001201518IND8705495820221121181158.0870829e198503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND870549582DNAL7 a10113/5222hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVosper, F.C.10aEnergy production and performance of a wind-driven induction generator  ap. 617-621.  aIncludes references.  a2019-12-06  aA modern wind turbine, an Enertech Model 44/25, was installed on May 26, 1982, at the USDA Conservation and Production Research Laboratory, Bushland, TX.

The wind turbine operated 64% of the time, and was available for operation over 95% of the time. The unit had net energy production of over 100,000 kw multiplied by (times) h for a 20-month period in an average windspeed of 5. 9 m/s at a height of 10 m. Power curves were established for the wind turbine at two different pitch settings and with two different sets of blade-tip brakes. 3awind machines 0aagricultural adjustment 0agenerators1 aClark, R.N.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g1985 , v.  28, no.  2 p.617-621x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/5223Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20070626b20070702c00000000  aENE  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02180naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092024002100118040001800139072000900157072000900166072000900175100002000184245009100204300001800295500002400313500001500337520076500352650001801117650001601135650002201151650002101173650001701194650001701211650001701228651001001245653002401255700001701279700002301296773011301319852000901432856011201441856007601553930003301629945002501662946001101687961001201698655001201710IND4412615020221119093621.0081114e20081130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441261502DNAL7 a10.1002/hyp.70922doi7 a10113/350132hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ800 0aK001 0aX1001 aFoltz, Randy B.10aModeling changes in rill erodibility and critical shear stress on native surface roads  ap. 4783-4788.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aThis study investigated the effect of cumulative overland flow on rill erodibility and critical shear stress on native surface roads in central Idaho. Rill erodibility decreased exponentially with increasing cumulative overland flow depth; however, critical shear stress did not change. The study demonstrated that road erodibility on the studied road changes over the course of one or more consecutive overland flow events. Therefore, model simulations that fail to take into consideration this change will probably over-estimate sediment yields. An exponential function describing the relationship between rill erodibility and cumulative overland flow depth is presented as a basis for future model development for simulating erosion on native surface roads. 3aoverland flow 3aerodibility 3asimulation models 3anational forests 3ashear stress 3aforest roads 3arill erosion 3aIdaho 0amathematical models1 aRhee, Hakjun1 aElliot, William J.0 tHydrological processes.g2008 Nov. 30, v.  22, no.  24 p.4783-4788dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0885-60877nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/350133Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.70923Available from publisher's Web site  a20091021b20091106c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/10/21  aNon-US  aUSDA/FS 7aarticle02229naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140072000900149100001700158245010900175300001600284500002400300500001500324520069000339650002201029650003001051650002001081650002401101650001601125650002001141650001601161651001401177651001701191651001301208653001701221653002401238653003001262653002801292653002701320653002801347700001601375773011501391852000901506856011201515930003301627945002501660946001301685961001301698655001201711IND4375304120221119093623.0051018e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437530412DNAL7 a10113/350142hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL700 0aL001 0aL4001 aRazowski, J.10aReview of Oregocerata Razowski (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae: Euliini) with descriptions of four new species  ap. 903-913.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aOregocerata is a poorly known genus restricted to the Andes and its associated ranges in northwestern South America (i.e., Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia) usually above 2000 m. Specimens are exceedingly rare in collections; most species are known only from the holotype male. We describe and illustrate four new species: O. triangulana (TL: Colombia), O. caucana (TL: Colombia), O. quadrifurcata (TL: Colombia), and O. submontana (TL: Venezuela); and we propose a new combination, Oregocerata chrysodetis (Meyrick). As currently defined the genus includes 9 species. It is assigned to Euliini on the basis of the possession of a characteristic hairpencil on the prothoracic leg. 3ainsect morphology 3ageographical distribution 3ainsect taxonomy 3ataxonomic revisions 3aTortricidae 3anew combination 3anew species 3aVenezuela 3aAndes region 3aColombia 0adescriptions 0aOregocerata caucana 0aOregocerata quadrifurcata 0aOregocerata triangulana 0aOregocerata submontana 0aOregocerata chrysodetis1 aBrown, J.W.0 tProceedings of the Entomological Society of Washington.g2005 Oct., v.  107, no.  4 p.903-913x0013-87977nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/350143Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20091021b20091106c00000000  aINDdNZMe2005/10/24  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04211naa a2200997 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111024002100148040001800169072000900187072000900196072000900205072000900214072000900223100002000232245015200252300001600404500002400420500001500444520134600459650002301805650002301828650002301851650001201874650001901886650001301905650002801918650001801946650001901964650002101983650002502004650001602029650001802045650002302063650002602086650002402112650002202136650003402158650001402192650002002206650002202226650001502248650001702263650003102280650001002311650000902321650001302330650001102343650001002354650001102364650001302375650004502388650001902433650002402452650001802476650001502494651001002509653002602519653001602545653001602561653001102577653003002588653003802618653001802656653001502674653001702689700002002706700001802726700001802744700001302762700002002775700001802795700001702813773007902830852000902909856011202918856008703030930003303117945002503150946001303175961001303188655001203201IND4434721620221118174217.0100329e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443472162DNAL7 a187188462pmid7 a10.1016/j.ypmed.2008.07.0142doi7 a10113/400892hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aE310 0aT300 0aT100 0aT000 0aX3801 aThompson, Debbe10aFood, fun, and fitness internet program for girls: Pilot evaluation of an e-Health youth obesity prevention program examining predictors of obesity  ap. 494-497.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aObjective: This pilot study tested whether an Internet-based intervention could achieve change in fruit, juice, and vegetable consumption, physical activity, and self-efficacy in youth at-risk of obesity. Method: Participants were 80 8-to-10-year-old African American girls at-risk of obesity, with a home computer, Internet access, and an e-mail address. A two-group design was followed. Groups differed only on incentive schedule (immediate, delayed). The 8-week home-based program, conducted entirely over the Internet, promoted fruit, juice, vegetables, and water intake and physical activity. Pre-post measures were collected through self-report via the program website. The study was conducted in the greater Houston, TX, area September through November, 2004. Results: Statistically significant pre-to-post differences were observed in fruit, juice, and vegetable consumption (p = .002), physical activity---yesterday (p < .001), physical activity---usually (p = .001), and fruit, juice, and vegetable self-efficacy (p = .003). Conclusion: Internet-based obesity prevention programs may be an effective channel for promoting healthy diet and physical activity behaviors to youth at-risk of obesity. Additional research is needed to more fully examine their effectiveness at promoting and maintaining diet and physical activity change. 3aat-risk population 3adisease prevention 3aeducation programs 3aobesity 3aworld wide web 3aInternet 3aweight control programs 3aeating habits 3ayouth programs 3ahealth promotion 3aadolescent nutrition 3aadolescents 3aself-efficacy 3aDietary Guidelines 3abehavior modification 3anutrition education 3aphysical activity 3acomputer-assisted instruction 3alifestyle 3abody mass index 3aAfrican Americans 3avegetables 3afruit juices 2aBlack or African American. 2aChild 2aDiet 2aExercise 2aFemale 2aFruit 2aHumans 2aInternet 2aObesityxetiologyxprevention & control. 2aPilot Projects 2aPlay and Playthings 2aSelf Efficacy 2aVegetables 0aTexas 0adiet-related diseases 0arisk groups 0afood guides 0aBlacks 0ahealthy physical activity 0aInternet-based obesity prevention 0afruits (food) 0aoverweight 0ahealthy diet1 aBaranowski, Tom1 aCullen, Karen1 aWatson, Kathy1 aLiu, Yan1 aCanada, Ashanti1 aBhatt, Riddhi1 aZakeri, Issa0 tPreventive medicine.g2008 Nov., v.  47, no.  5 p.494-497x1096-02607nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/400893Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2008.07.0143Available from publisher's Web site  a20100401b20100403c00000000  aINDdPNNe2010/03/31  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03037naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131100001200140245009000152300001600242500002400258520171500282650002301997650001602020650001002036650002302046650003702069650002202106650001402128650002302142650002702165650001102192650001102203650001302214700001302227700002102240700001302261700001702274773007102291852000902362856011202371930003302483945002502516946001302541961001302554655001202567IND4380341920221119193039.0060522e200606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438034192DNAL7 a10113/181202hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF5001 aSah, S.14aThe effect of repeated short-term flooding on mycorrhizal survival in snap bean roots  ap. 598-602.  aIncludes references  aSince arbuscular-mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are aerobic, symbiosis was not considered significant under flooded conditions. However, AM colonization of wetland plants is now believed more common than previously thought. In the humid tropics, storms that result in standing water for 24 hours or less are common. Short-term floods, especially on sandy soils, may leach banded fertilizer, reducing uptake efficiency. Crops planted in flood prone areas are not normally enhanced with mycorrhizal mixes. However, mycorrhizal associations tolerant to wet conditions may improve nutrient uptake as plants recover from short-term flooding. Greenhouse studies were initiated to determine the effects of frequent short-term floods (two to four events) on mycorrhizal colonization and subsequent development in snap bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) plants. Flooding produced no obvious long-term physical effects on plant shoots. In the first study, flooding did not affect survival of colonies established before the first flood event. Percent root colonization in flooded vs. nonflooded treatments was not significantly different at either 31 or 50 days after planting (DAP). As root length increased there was a concomitant increase in colonization so that percent colonization remained approximately the same in both flooded and nonflooded treatments. In the second study, three weekly floods beginning 13 DAP (cotyledon leaf open only) did not inhibit initial mycorrhizal colonization. Mycorrhizal associations should form with snap bean under conditions subject to short-term flooding. Additional research is needed to determine the efficacy of different mycorrhizal mixes under short-term flooded conditions in the field. 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3agreen beans 3aroots 3aflooded conditions 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3amycorrhizal fungi 3amortality 3aaerobic conditions 3amicrobial colonization 3ashoots 3alength 3aduration1 aReed, S.1 aJayacandran, Ke.1 aDunn, C.1 aFisher, J.B.0 tHortScience.g2006 June, v.  41, no.  3 p.598-602x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/181203Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080819b20080905c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/09/01  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03093naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002100127040001800148072000900166100001800175245008200193300001600275500002800291520193700319650002402256650001402280650002002294650001002314650001302324700001802337700001902355773008002374852000902454856008502463856011202548930003302660946001302693961001302706655001202719IND8507843820221122224634.0851216s1985    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND850784382DNAL7 a10.1080/019041685093633812doi7 a10113/323232hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF5001 aTorbert, H.A.10aGrowth and magnesium uptake of tall fescue clones with varying root diameters  ap. 731-749.  aIncludes 13 references.  aA cool season perennial grass with a root system capable of penetrating hardpans and which can accumulate adequate Mg to prevent deficiencies in forage is needed in the Coastal Plain region. A greenhouse experiment was conducted to determine the effects of magnesium (Mg) concentration in nutrient solution and root diameter on Mg uptake and growth of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.). Propagules of two fescue clones with large root diameter (LDR >1 mm), two clones with small root diameter (SDR <0.8 mm), and a single clone from 'Kentucky 31' (Ky-31) were transferred into 12-liter tanks containing Mg concentrations of 3, 21, 42, 125, 250, and 500 μM as MgSO4 and grown for 39 or 70 days. Leaf Mg concentration was increased linearly with Mg solution concentration in LDR clones for a 39-day growth period (Harvest 1), but increased according to a cubic equation in the SDR clones and the Ky-31. Predicted leaf Mg concentration as a function of solution Mg followed a cubic equation for a 70-day growth period (Harvest 2) in all clones. Predicted root Mg concentration was linearly related to Mg solution concentration for the LDR clones and the Ky-31, but followed a cubic equation for the SDR clones for the first growth period. For the second growth period, the root Mg concentration of the SDR clones and the Ky-31 was increased linearly, while the LDR clones followed a quadratic equation. Magnesium uptake followed a cubic equation with Mg solution concentration for both growth periods on all tall fescue clones. This nonlinear variation of Mg uptake and plant Mg concentration with respect to solution Mg concentration strongly suggests that a dual uptake mechanism might have been present in tall fescue clones. Root volume was greater in the SDR than LDR clones or Ky-31 for both growth periods. The Ky-31 had the greatest leaf and root dry weight for both growth periods, while the LDR clones had the lowest. 3aFestuca arundinacea 3amagnesium 3anutrient uptake 3aroots 3adiameter1 aEdwards, J.H.1 aPedersen, J.F.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g1985, v.  8, no.  8 p.731-749x0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/019041685093633813Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/323233Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090817b20091002c00000000  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03612naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092024001900131024002100150040001800171072000900189100002100198245017100219300001600390500002400406500001500430520128700445650002401732650001301756650002501769650001301794650002501807650002201832650003401854650003301888650001801921650001801939650002401957650002301981650003502004650002802039650002502067650002302092650003302115650002402148650002702172650003402199650004202233650002902275653002802304653002302332653002502355700002002380700002102400700001402421700001502435700001802450700001902468773013302487852000902620856011202629856008902741930003302830945002502863946001302888961001302901655001202914IND4432828920221116164544.0100216e200503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443282892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plasmid.2004.09.0022doi7 a157374042pmid7 a10113/386002hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8321 aDavis, Robert E.10aCryptic plasmid pSKU146 from the wall-less plant pathogen Spiroplasma kunkelii encodes an adhesin and components of a type IV translocation-related conjugation system  ap. 179-190.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aA cryptic plasmid of the wall-less plant pathogenic mollicute, Spiroplasma kunkelii CR2-3X, was cloned and its sequence analyzed. The 14,615 bp plasmid, designated pSKU146, has a nucleotide content of 28 mol% G + C, and contains 18 potential protein-coding regions (open reading frames, ORFs), of which six encode proteins that exhibit similarity to virulence-associated proteins involved in cell-to-cell adhesion or conjugal DNA transfer. One ORF encodes a 96 kDa protein, SkARP1, that is highly similar to SARP1 adhesin involved in attachment of Spiroplasma citri to insect vector gut membrane. Five ORFs encode proteins similar to TraE and Mob in walled bacteria, and to ORFs found in the integrative, conjugative element (ICEF) of Mycoplasma fermentans, respectively. Presence of domains similar to proteins of the Type IV secretion system in pathogenic bacteria suggests that spiroplasma possesses a related translocation system. Plasmid pSKU146 also contains two identical oriT regions each containing a nick sequence characteristic of the IncP conjugative plasmid family, as well as a 58 bp palindromic sequence, palSK1. Features in pSKU146 suggest that the plasmid functions as a mobile genetic element in conjugative transmission of spiroplasma pathogenicity-related genes. 3aopen reading frames 3aadhesins 3aSpiroplasma kunkelii 3aplasmids 3aamino acid sequences 3amolecular cloning 2aAdhesins, Bacterialxgenetics 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aBase Sequence 2aBinding Sites 2aCell Wallxgenetics 2aCloning, Molecular 2aConjugation, Geneticxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlantsxmicrobiology 2aPlasmidsxgenetics 2aReplication Originxgenetics 2aRibosomesxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSpiroplasmaxgeneticsxpathogenicity. 2aViral Proteinsxgenetics 0amolecular sequence data 0abacterial proteins 0anucleotide sequences1 aDally, Ellen L.1 aJomantiene, Rasa1 aZhao, Yan1 aRoe, Bruce1 aLin, ShaoPing1 aShao, Jonathan0 tPlasmid: a journal of molecular genetics with emphasis on plasmid biology.g2005 Mar., v.  53, no.  2 p.179-190x1095-98907nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/386003Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plasmid.2004.09.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20100220b20100305c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/02/19  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle01987naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131100001600140245007300156300001600229500012500245500002500370500001500395520087000410650002001280650001901300653002101319653003101340653001401371773007201385852000901457856011201466930003301578946001301611961001301624655001201637IND8507857920221117160534.0851216e198505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND850785792DNAL7 a10113/239642hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5041 aBietz, J.A.10aHigh performance liquid chromatography: How proteins look in cereals  ap. 201-212.  aPaper presented at the "Symposium on the Role of HPLC in Cereal Chemistry," Oct. 30-Nov. 1, 1983, Kansas City, Missouri.  aIncludes references.  a2019-12-05  aThe use of various forms of HPLC to fractionate and characterize cereal proteins is reviewed under headings of: materials and methods (apparatus, columns, data handling, reagents and solvents, samples), RP (reversed phase)-HPLC of cereal proteins (initial trials, optimization of conditions, characteristics of RP-HPLC separations, RP-HPLC separations of other protein classes ((besides gliadins)), preparative RP-HPLC, identification of wheat var., RP-HPLC prediction of pasta cooking quality, use of RP-HPLC in genetic studies, comparison of RP-HPLC columns, RP-HPLC analysis of glutenin, RP-HPLC of proteins from other cereals ((besides wheat£), SE (size exclusion)-HPLC of cereal proteins (analysis of gliadins, SE-HPLC of high mol. wt. gliadin, SE-HPLC analysis of glutenin subunits, SE-HPLC of native glutenin), and IE (ion exchange)-HPLC of cereal proteins. 3acereal proteins 3achromatography 0acharacterization 0amilling and baking quality 0aisolation0 tCereal chemistry.g1985 , v.  62, no.  3 p.201-212x0009-03527nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/239643Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090220b20090301c00000000  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02095naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092040001800112072000900130100001900139245015100158500011500309500002400424520070900448650002701157650001601184650001201200650001101212650002801223650003501251650001301286653002501299653002901324700002201353773011801375852000901493856011101502930003301613945002501646946001301671961001301684655001201697IND4399442920221118054921.0071228s2007    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND439944292DNAL7 a10113/89242hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ1041 aWilliams, G.D.10aDesign Considerations for the Construction and Operation of Flour Milling Facilities.

Like most agri-industrial production facilities, flour milling facilities have a number of unique design requirements. Design information, to date, has been limited. In an effort to summarize state of the art design procedures for flour milling facilities constructed in the United States, an overview of accepted standards and procedures has been assembled and discussed. With this paper engineers should become more familiar with specific design considerations for flour milling production facilities and develop appropriate references to expand their knowledge base. Educators may find this paper useful too. 3afood processing plants 3awheat flour 3amilling 3adesign 3aconstruction technology 3aoccupational health and safety 3aplanning 0abuilding foundations 0aflour milling facilities1 aRosentrater, K.A.0 tPaper.g2007, , no.  074116aAmerican Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

We investigated whether the amount of information about the required response the patient has before the trial begins also contributes to error rate. Participants performed antisaccades in five conditions. The traditional design had two goals on the left and right horizontal meridians. In the second condition, stimulus-goal confusability between trials was eliminated by displacing one goal upward. In the third, hemifield uncertainty was eliminated by placing both goals in the same hemifield. In the fourth, goal uncertainty was eliminated by having only one goal, but interspersed with no-go trials. The fifth condition eliminated all uncertainty by having the same goal on every trial. Antisaccade error rate increased by 2% with each additional source of uncertainty, with the main effect being hemifield information, and a trend for stimulus-goal confusability. A control experiment for the effects of increasing angular separation between targets without changing these types of prior response information showed no effects on latency or error rate. We conclude that other factors besides prosaccade inhibition contribute to antisaccade error rates in traditional designs, possibly by modulating the strength of goal activation. 3aprobability 2aAdult 2aCognitionxphysiology 2aDecision Makingxphysiology 2aFemale 2aFixation, Ocularxphysiology 2aGoals 2aHumans 2aMale 2aNeural Inhibitionxphysiology 2aNeuropsychological Tests 2aPhotic Stimulation 2aProbability 2aPsychomotor Performancexphysiology 2aReaction Timexphysiology 2aSaccadesxphysiology 2aVisual Fieldsxphysiology 0aAntisaccade 0aError 0aDecision1 aAbegg, Mathias 1 aRodríguez, Amadeo.1 aKoehn, J.

Throughout the 20-week study, the 22 protein fractions of 2308 and RB51 induced a similar pattern of proliferation when they were incubated with lymphocytes from the infected mice. In addition, during the 20 weeks, lymphocytes from all groups of infected mice exhibited the highest proliferation when the lymphocytes were incubated with 18-kDa or smaller proteins from either 2308 or RB51. Lymphocytes obtained from mice at 6 weeks after infection with strain RB51 or 19 exhibited similar proliferation to the 18-kDa proteins of S2308 or SRB51. Lymphocytes from strain 2308-infected mice did not proliferate to these proteins until 10 weeks after infection, and the responses were similar to those in strain RB51-infected mice but lower than those in strain 19-infected mice. Lymphocytes obtained from mice at 20 weeks after infection with strain l9 or 2308 proliferated to most of the 22 fractions of 2308 or RB51, which contained 106- to 18-kDa proteins. However, lymphocytes obtained from strain RB51-infected mice at 20 weeks did not proliferate to any of these fractions. These results indicate that mice infected with RB51 have less-persistent lymphocyte proliferative responses to 2308 proteins than do mice infected with 2308 or 19. In addition, all 2308 proteins that stimulate lymphocyte proliferation appear to be present in RB51. 3aBrucella melitensis biovar Abortus 3alymphocyte proliferation 3abacterial antigens 3alipopolysaccharides 3amutants 3astrain differences 3alymphocytes 3amice 2aAnimals 2aAntigens, Bacterialximmunology 2aBacterial Proteinsximmunology 2aBrucella abortusximmunology 2aBrucellosisximmunology 2aFemale 2aLymphocyte Activation 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 0alipopolysaccharide o antigens1 aOlsen, S.C.1 aPugh, G.W.

The principal group of goats (n = 9) each received 1 ml of 7.25 X 10(5) live P. haemolytica A1 cells in polyacrylate beads transthoracically in the left lung on days 0 and 21. Six goats were used as negative controls and received 0.3 g of polyacrylate beads subcutaneously in the right flank on days 0 and 21. Serum was obtained from all animals on days -4, 3, 7,14. 21, 24, and 32. Preimmune serum from all animals showed no detectable antibody to P. haemolytica A1 neuraminidase in an enzyme neutralization assay. None of the sera from the negative control animals possessed a significant antibody concentration in response to the P. haemolytica A1 neuraminidase. On day 32, serum samples from the nine infected animals possessed enzyme neutralizing activity that ranged from 62% to 100%. Anti-neuraminidase antibody could be detected as early as day 14 by the enzyme neutralization assay. These data demonstrate that the enzyme neuraminidase is produced in vivo during an active P. haemolytica A1 lobar infection. 3agoats 3aMannheimia haemolytica 3asialidase 3abiological production 3aantibodies 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Bacterialxanalysis 2aGoats 2aMannheimia haemolyticaxenzymologyximmunologyxpathogenicity. 2aNeuraminidasexbiosynthesisximmunology. 2aPasteurella Infectionsxenzymology 0aexperimental infections1 aPurdy, C.W.0 tInfection and immunity.g1994 Oct., v. 62, no. 10 p.4675-4678x0019-95677nnas  aDNAL  a19950703b19950711c00000000  aINDdCLD  aOther US 7aarticle03137naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001700149245014400166300001800310500001500328520139500343650001301738650002801751650001501779650002201794650002301816650000901839650001801848650002101866650001401887650001901901650002301920650001201943650001301955650001101968650001601979650002901995650000902024650000902033650002402042650004702066650001202113650000902125650002502134650003002159650004602189650002402235650001402259653002402273653002802297700001802325700001702343773008302360852000902443930003302452945001302485946001302498655001202511IND2046552620221118050556.0950623e199410  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204655262DNAL7 a79277272pmid7 aPMC3031492pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarrow, P.A.10aHost specificity of Salmonella infection in chickens and mice is expressed in vivo primarily at the level of the reticuloendothelial system  ap. 4602-4610.  a2019-12-05  aBy experimental infection, host-specific Salmonella serotypes were shown to demonstrate specificities for chickens, mice, and other laboratory animals. Following oral inoculation, four strains of Salmonella gallinarum and two S. pullorum strains, isolated from diseased poultry, were more virulent for chickens than for mice. By contrast, four strains each of S. choleraesuis and S. dublin, isolated from diseased pigs and cattle, respectively, were more virulent for mice than for chickens. These results were also reflected in the degree of virulence expressed after parenteral inoculation. In addition, S. choleraesuis, but not other serotypes, killed rats, guinea pigs, and rabbits. S. typhimurium strains varied widely in their virulence, and some strains were virulent for both mice and chickens. Four other serotypes isolated from poultry or human food poisoning cases and a nonpathogenic Escherichia coli strain were much less virulent for both experimental host species. Most of the host-specific Salmonella serotypes studied were able to colonize the distal alimentary tract and invade the tissues in both mice and chickens to various degrees. There was, however, a greater difference in the ability to survive and multiply in the visceral organs, particularly the spleen and the liver, once invasion had occurred which correlated with the virulence for the host species involved. 3achickens 3ainterspecific variation 3aSalmonella 3agenetic variation 3alaboratory animals 3amice 3aanimal organs 3ahost specificity 3avirulence 3aanimal tissues 3adefense mechanisms 2aAnimals 2aChickens 2aFemale 2aGuinea Pigs 2aIntestinesxmicrobiology 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aMononuclear Phagocyte Systemxmicrobiology 2aRabbits 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aSalmonellaxpathogenicity 2aSalmonella Infections, Animalximmunology 2aSpecies Specificity 2aVirulence 0aspecies differences 0aexperimental infections1 aHuggins, M.B.1 aLovell, M.A.0 tInfection and immunity.g1994 Oct., v. 62, no. 10 p.4602-4610x0019-95677nnas  aDNAL  a19950703b19950711c00000000  aINDdCLD  aOther US 7aarticle02555naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245008800125300001800213520166900231650001201900650002101912650001301933650002501946650002501971653001401996653002802010653001902038700002102057773008302078852000902161930003302170945001302203946001302216655001202229IND2046549520221118050736.0950623e199410  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204654952DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, A.S.12aA minor 987P protein different from the structural fimbrial subunit is the adhesion  ap. 4233-4243.  aThe 987P fimbriae produced by enterotoxigenic strains of Escherichia coli isolated from piglets mediate bacterial attachment to intestinal epithelial cells. These fimbriae consist essentially of a tight helical arrangement of one structural protein subunit encoded by fasA. Fimbriation and specific adhesion requires the expression of seven additional genes (fasB to fasH). In this study, we investigated whether FasA or another Fas protein, e.g., a potential minor fimbrial component, harbors the binding moiety for the pig 987P receptor glycoproteins. Fas proteins, specifically radiolabeled with an in vivo T7 expression system, were isolated from the periplasm and incubated with receptor-containing brush borders isolated from piglet intestinal epithelial cells. FasG bound best to brush borders, whereas no FasA adhered to them. Additional evidence that FasG, and not FasA, is the 987P adhesin was provided by ligand blotting inhibition assays indicating that FasG alone inhibited fimbrial binding to 987P receptors and that in the absence of FasG, other Fas proteins were not inhibitory. FasG was identified in purified fimbrial preparations with a specific anti-FasG antibody probe. Moreover, FasG was shown to be tightly associated with the fimbrial structure, since it was released only after disassembling fimbriae by heat and sodium dodecyl sulfate treatments. The primary structure of FasG, deduced from the DNA sequence, exhibited 19.1 to 24.4% similarily to FasA and large minor components and/or adhesins of other fimbriae. FasG is the first-described minor fimbrial subunit shown to be essential for both fimbrial biogenesis and specific adhesion. 3apiglets 3aEscherichia coli 3afimbriae 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 0aadhesions 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/l294121 aSchifferli, D.M.0 tInfection and immunity.g1994 Oct., v. 62, no. 10 p.4233-4243x0019-95677nnas  aDNAL  a19950703b19950711c00000000  aINDdCLD  aOther US 7aarticle03228naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001100128245019000139300001400329520162800343650002201971650001801993650002302011650002302034650002302057650002702080650001202107650002502119650001802144650002702162650002402189650002202213650005402235650003002289650002202319650002002341650002302361650003402384653001702418653002802435653001202463700001402475700001402489700001202503700001202515700001302527773008002540852000902620930003302629945001302662946001102675655001202686IND2042723020221118050638.0941020e199407  ja |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204272302DNAL7 a77981762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Y.10aStudies on an artificial trypsin inhibitor peptide derived from the mung bean trypsin inhibitor: chemical synthesis, refolding, and crystallographic analysis of its complex with trypsin  ap. 18-25.  aThe active fragment with Lys at the reactive site of mung bean trypsin inhibitor (MBILF) is composed of two peptide chains, Al of 26 residues and A2 of 9 residues linked via two disulfide bonds. In the present study, a peptide of 22 residues comprising the sequence of chain A1 from position 3 to 24 was synthesized by the solid-phase method. This synthetic peptide with six Cys residues contains a reactive site at position Lys11I-Ser12I (I denotes an inhibitor residue). Air oxidation and HPLC purification resulted in two antitrypsin active components, SPC1 and SPC2. Neither SPC1 nor SPC2 can stoichiometrically inhibit trypsin. The K1 values of SPC1 and SPC2 are 1.2 X 10(-7) and 4.0 X 10(-8) M, respectively. The complexes of SPC1 and SPC2 with bovine beta-trypsin (BTRY) were crystallized by ammonium sulphate precipitation at pH 6.4 and 6.0, respectively. The two crystals have the same crystal form with space group P2(1)2(1)2(1) and cell dimension of a = 63.2(2) angstroms, b = 63.5(6) A, and c = 69.8(4) angstroms. The crystal structure of one complex, SPC1-BTRY, was determined and refined at 2.2 angstroms resolution to a final R-value of 19.2%. From the resulting electron density map, 9 residues of SPC1, from position 91 to 171, were identified clearly and three-dimension atomic model of the 9-residue reactive loop formed by a disulfide bridge, Cys9I-Cys17I, was built. No electron density corresponding to the other 13 residues was observed in the present map. The refined atomic coordinates of this complex and structure factors has been deposited with the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (reference: SMF). 3aX-ray diffraction 3aVigna radiata 3atrypsin inhibitors 3asynthetic peptides 3achemical reactions 3amolecular conformation 3atrypsin 3aamino acid sequences 2aBinding Sites 2aCrystallography, X-Ray 2aFabaceaexchemistry 2aModels, Molecular 2aPeptide Fragmentsxchemical synthesisxchemistry. 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistry 2aPlants, Medicinal 2aProtein Folding 2aTrypsinxchemistry 2aTrypsin Inhibitorsxchemistry 0ainteractions 0amolecular sequence data 0apdb/smf1 aHuang, Q.1 aZhang, S.1 aLiu, S.1 aChi, C.1 aTang, Y.0 tJournal of biochemistry.g1994 July, v. 116, no. 1 p.18-25x0021-924X7nnas  aDNAL  a19941102b19941107c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02956naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001800149245010300167300001800270520137900288650001601667650001701683650001601700650002901716650002101745650001201766650004601778650005501824650000901879650002301888650002901911650003101940650002501971650002201996653002302018653003602041653004202077653002602119700002002145700001302165700001502178700001602193700002002209700002002229700001502249773008202264852000902346930003302355945001302388946001302401655001202414IND2053941520221118050743.0961107e199508  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205394152DNAL7 a76222282pmid7 aPMC1734142pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLincoln, J.A.10aExogenous myeloperoxidase enhances bacterial phagocytosis and intracellular killing by macrophages  ap. 3042-3047.  aIt is well documented that myeloperoxidase (MyPo) contributes to the bactericidal activities of neutrophils and monocytes. Since mature macrophages are devoid of this enzyme, its participation in macrophage-mediated phagocytosis and bacterial killing has not been completely defined. The present study demonstrates that exogenously added MyPo, at physiological levels, enhances both phagocytosis and killing of Escherichia coli. Murine peritoneal macrophages were exposed to various concentrations of MyPo for different time intervals. Viable opsonized E. coli was added either prior to or after addition of MyPo. Thioglycolate-induced but not resident macrophages exhibited an increase in the number of phagocytizing cells. Both resident and thioglycolate-induced macrophages demonstrated increased bactericidal activity. Physiological levels of soluble MyPo also induced a significant increase in chemiluminescence. Since luminol-dependent chemiluminescence measures reactive oxygen intermediate production, studies were done to determine whether superoxide anion or H2O2 was involved in MyPo-induced macrophage killing. Both superoxide dismutase and catalase ablated MyPo-induced bactericidal activity. The above data suggest that soluble MyPo, released from neutrophils at a site of infection or inflammation, can enhance both phagocytosis and killing of microorganisms. 3amacrophages 3aphagocytosis 3aperoxidases 3aantibacterial properties 3aEscherichia coli 2aAnimals 2aBlood Bactericidal Activityxdrug effects 2aMacrophages, Peritonealxdrug effectsximmunology. 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aPeroxidasexpharmacology 2aPhagocytosisxdrug effects 2aRecombinant Proteins 2aRespiratory Burst 0amacrophage killing 0amurine resident myeloperoxidase 0athioglycolate-induced myeloperoxidase 0ahuman myeloperoxidase1 aLefkowitz, D.L.1 aCain, T.1 aCastro, A.1 aMills, K.C.1 aLefkowitz, S.S.1 aMoguilevsky, N.1 aBollen, A.0 tInfection and immunity.g1995 Aug., v. 63, no. 8 p.3042-3047x0019-95677nnas  aDNAL  a19961202b19961205c00000000  aINDdCLD  aOther US 7aarticle03040naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001700149245011200166300001800278500001500296520134300311650001901654650001401673650001101687650002301698650001701721650001301738650002001751650002301771650002201794650001701816650001401833650002201847650001401869650001201883650004901895650001101944650003401955650002401989650003602013650001302049650004102062650006002103653001402163653005502177700001702232700001802249700001702267700001602284773008202300852000902382930003302391945001302424946001302437655001202450IND2052065420221118050654.0960711e199507  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205206542DNAL7 a77900942pmid7 aPMC1733682pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWallis, T.S.14aThe Salmonella dublin virulence plasmid mediates systemic but not enteric phases of salmonellosis in cattle  ap. 2755-2761.  a2019-12-05  aPlasmid-bearing and plasmid-free isolates and a plasmid-cured strain of Salmonella dublin were compared for virulence in calves. The plasmid-bearing strains were highly virulent, causing severe enteric and systemic disease with high mortality. In contrast, the plasmid-free strains caused diarrhea but only low mortality. The infection kinetics of a wild-type and a derivative plasmid-cured strain were compared. Both strains were isolated in high numbers from intestinal sites at 3 and 6 days after oral challenge and were isolated at comparable frequencies from systemic sites at 3 days, but not at 6 days, when the wild-type strain was predominant. The strains were equally invasive in intestinal epithelia with and without Peyer's patch and elicited comparable secretory and inflammatory responses and intestinal pathology in ligated ileal loops. The effect of the virulence plasmid on growth kinetics and on the outer membrane protein profile was assessed in an in vivo growth chamber. The virulence plasmid did not influence either extracellular growth or the expression of major outer membrane proteins. These observations demonstrate that the virulence plasmid is not involved in either the enteric phase of infection or the systemic dissemination of S. dublin but probably mediates the persistence of S. dublin at systemic sites. 3ahistopathology 3asecretion 3acattle 3astrain differences 3ainflammation 3aplasmids 3aPeyer's patches 3abacterial proteins 3aintestinal mucosa 3apathogenesis 3avirulence 3aSalmonella Dublin 3ainfection 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Outer Membrane Proteinsxchemistry 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aIleumxmicrobiology 2aIntestinal Mucosaxmicrobiology 2aPlasmids 2aSalmonellaxgeneticsxpathogenicity. 2aSalmonella Infections, Animalxmicrobiologyxpathology. 0amembranes 0aSalmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Dublin1 aPaulin, S.M.1 aPlested, J.S.1 aWatson, P.R.1 aJones, P.W.0 tInfection and immunity.g1995 July, v. 63, no. 7 p.2755-2761x0019-95677nnas  aDNAL  a19960801b19960808c00000000  aINDdCLD  aOther US 7aarticle03380naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001500149245012500164300001800289520141100307650002301718650001401741650002301755650001901778650002701797650002601824650002301850650001701873650000901890650002301899650002101922650001201943650004001955650003601995650005302031650003502084650002202119650002702141650001702168650000902185650001502194650002402209650008102233650006702314650001002381650008102391650002602472651002602498651003302524700001902557700001302576700001602589773008102605852000902686930003302695945001302728946001302741655001202754IND2051316420221118050735.0960520e199505  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205131642DNAL7 a77299102pmid7 aPMC1732522pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuessy, S.10aDiscrimination of virulent and avirulent Streptococcus suis capsular type 2 isolates from different geographical origins  ap. 1975-1979.  aIn an effort to relate the protein profile to virulence, proteins from the cellular fractions and from culture supernatants of Streptococcus suis capsular type 2 strains from different geographical origins were compared by using Western blots (immunoblots). The protein profiles of the cellular fractions were similar for the majority of virulent and avirulent isolates studied, with the exception of three virulent Canadian strains for which a 135-kDa protein was not detected. Examination of the culture supernatants revealed the presence of a 135-kDa protein in all strains except the same three virulent Canadian isolates. In addition, a 110-kDa protein was present in 14 of 16 virulent strains and not in avirulent isolates. When injected into mice, the 110-kDa protein induced an immunoglobulin G response and protected against infection with homologous and heterologous virulent strains. Four strains (1330, 0891, TD10, and R75/S2) that were avirulent in the mouse model of infection and four other strains (1591, 999, JE590, and AAH4) that were virulent in the mouse model were injected into pigs. All virulent strains reproduced the disease, and all avirulent strains failed to reproduce the disease (with the exception of transient lameness in one case and fever in another case). The 110-kDa protein therefore appears to be a reliable virulence marker and a good candidate for a subunit vaccine. 3aStreptococcus suis 3avirulence 3abacterial proteins 3aimmunoblotting 3ageographical variation 3amonoclonal antibodies 3astrain differences 3aimmunization 3amice 3aantibody formation 3aimmunoglobulin G 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Bacterialxbiosynthesis 2aAntigens, Bacterialximmunology 2aBacterial Capsulesximmunologyxtherapeutic use. 2aBacterial Proteinsximmunology 2aBlotting, Western 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aImmunization 2aMice 2aSerotyping 2aSpecies Specificity 2aStreptococcal Infectionsxepidemiologyxmicrobiologyxmortalityxveterinary. 2aStreptococcus suisxclassificationximmunologyxpathogenicity. 2aSwine 2aSwine Diseasesxepidemiologyxmicrobiologyxmortalityxprevention & control. 2aVirulenceximmunology 0aEuropexepidemiology. 0aNorth Americaxepidemiology.1 aDubreuil, J.D.1 aCaya, M.1 aHiggins, R.0 tInfection and immunity.g1995 May, v. 63, no. 5 p.1975-1979x0019-95677nnas  aDNAL  a19960605b19960611c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02604naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001600149245010200165300001800267500001500285520117100300650001101471650001601482650001701498650002201515650001301537650001901550650002301569650002901592650002101621650001201642650002801654650001101682650000901693650002101702650003101723650004501754650005901799653002101858653003601879653001501915700001801930773008201948852000902030930003302039945001302072946001302085655001202098IND2050947520221118050831.0960423e199504  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205094752DNAL7 a78904232pmid7 aPMC1731892pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMabbott, N.10aBone marrow nitric oxide production and development of anemia in Trypanosoma brucei-infected mice  ap. 1563-1566.  a2019-12-05  aMice infected with Trypanosoma brucei rapidly develop anemia, with the number of circulating erythrocytes reduced by 50% within a week after infection. The present study investigated the relationship between anemia and bone marrow nitric oxide (NO) production. Bone marrow cell populations from T. brucei-infected mice exhibited elevated levels of NO synthase activity which was inhibitable by N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester. NC production was found to coincide with suppressed bone marrow T-cell proliferation in response to stimulation with the mitogen concanavalin A both in vitro and in vivo. As this indicated that NO may inhibit proliferation in other cell types, particularly hemopoietic precursors, we examined the role of NO in anemia during trypanosome infection. NO production correlated directly with the development of anemia and treatment of infected mice with N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester in vivo to systemically inhibit NO synthesis led to a significant reduction in the anemia. Thus, elevated NO production in the bone marrow of T. brucei-infected mice is likely to play a significant role in the anemia resulting from T. brucei infection. 3aanemia 3ablood serum 3anitric oxide 3abone marrow cells 3aarginine 3aerythropoiesis 3aTrypanosoma brucei 3alymphocyte proliferation 2aAnemiaxetiology 2aAnimals 2aBone Marrowxmetabolism 2aFemale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C3H 2aNitric Oxidexbiosynthesis 2aTrypanosoma brucei bruceixpathogenicity 2aTrypanosomiasis, Africanxcomplicationsxparasitology. 0aanemia (disease) 0ang-nitro-l-arginine methylester 0ainhibition1 aSternberg, J.0 tInfection and immunity.g1995 Apr., v. 63, no. 4 p.1563-1566x0019-95677nnas  aDNAL  a19960605b19960611c00000000  aINDdCLD  aOther US 7aarticle02614naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001400149245006600163300001800229520132600247650002501573650001701598650001301615650001801628650001301646650002101659650001901680650002101699650001201720650002301732650004301755650003101798650001101829650001201840650003401852650003001886653001501916700001701931700002001948700001301968773008301981852000902064930003302073945001302106946001302119655001202132IND2050764520221118050830.0960411e199509  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205076452DNAL7 a76422792pmid7 aPMC1734782pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, B.P.10aAdherence of Borrelia burgdorferi to the proteoglycan decorin  ap. 3467-3472.  aLyme disease is a tick-borne infection that can develop into a chronic, multisystemic disorder. The causative agent, Borrelia burgdorferi, is initially deposited by the tick into the host dermis, where it associates with collagen fibers, replicates, and eventually disseminates to other tissues. We have examined the adherence of the spirochete to different components of the collagen fiber and demonstrated that decorin, a proteoglycan which decorates collagen fibers, can support the attachment of B. burgdorferi. No significant direct attachment to isolated type I or III collagens could be detected. Attachment of the spirochetes to decorin was highly specific, and the process could be inhibited by soluble decorin but not by various unlabeled, unrelated components. B. burgdorferi also bound soluble 125I-labeled decorin in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Spirochete binding of soluble 125I-labeled decorin required intact proteoglycan and could not be inhibited by either isolated core protein or glycosaminoglycan chain. B. burgdorferi expresses two decorin-binding proteins with apparent molecular masses of 19 and 20 kDa as revealed in a Western blot (immunoblot)-type assay. Our results indicate that decorin may mediate the adherence of B. burgdorferi to collagen fibers in skin and other tissues. 3aBorrelia burgdorferi 3aLyme disease 3acollagen 3aproteoglycans 3aadhesion 3abinding proteins 3aimmunoblotting 3amolecular weight 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Adhesion 2aBorrelia burgdorferi Groupxphysiology 2aCarrier Proteinsxanalysis 2aCattle 2aDecorin 2aExtracellular Matrix Proteins 2aProteoglycansxphysiology 0ainhibition1 aNorris, S.J.1 aRosenberg, L.C.1 aHook, M.0 tInfection and immunity.g1995 Sept., v. 63, no. 9 p.3467-3472x0019-95677nnas  aDNAL  a19960503b19960510c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03729naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001900149245020200168300001800370520189000388650002402278650001702302650001602319650000902335650002702344650001302371650002002384650001402404650002202418650001802440650001602458650001202474650003702486650001402523650001802537650003002555650001502585650001102600650003202611650003802643650004002681650006702721650000902788650002302797650002502820650002702845650004602872700001602918700001902934700002302953773008302976852000903059930003303068945001303101946001303114655001203127IND2050764320221118050721.0960411e199509  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205076432DNAL7 a76422772pmid7 aPMC1734762pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeetermans, W.10aMycobacterial 65-kilodalton heat shock protein induces tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 6, reactive nitrogen intermediates, and toxoplasmastatic activity in murine peritoneal macrophages  ap. 3454-3458.  aThe 65-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp65) is supposed to play a role in host defense against infections with various microbial pathogens and in autoimmune inflammatory disorders. These effects are thought to result mainly from an Hsp65 specific T-lymphocyte-mediated immune response that recognizes conserved epitopes. The aim of the present studio was to assess whether mycobacterial Hsp65 has a direct effect on resident murine peritoneal macrophages, independent of Hsp65-sensitized T lymphocytes. Exposure of peritoneal macrophages from naive C57BL/6 mice to the mycobacterial Hsp65 in vitro induced an enhanced release of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin 6. These cells also produced large amounts of reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNI) and inhibited the intracellular proliferation of Toxoplasma gondii. Small amounts of gamma interferon acted synergistically with Hsp65. Thus, exposure of murine macrophages Hsp65 results in activation of these cells. The acquisition of these characteristics by peritoneal macrophages occurred in the absence of sensitized T lymphocytes. Addition of anti-TNF-alpha antiserum resulted in an attenuation of the Hsp65-induced release of RNI and toxoplasmastatic activity, indicating that endogenous TNF-alpha is involved in the Hsp65-induced macrophage activation. The conclusion of this study is that in vitro exposure of peritoneal macrophages to the mycobacterial Hsp65 induces the release of proinflammatory cytokines and RNI and results in inhibition of the intracellular proliferation of T. gondii. These effects on murine macrophages occur independently of Hsp65-specific T lymphocytes. The proinflammatory effect of Hsp65 demonstrated in this study suggests that this heat shock protein may play a role in the initiation of inflammation that adds to a non-species-specific resistance in the early stages of infections. 3aheat shock proteins 3ainflammation 3amacrophages 3amice 3atumor necrosis factors 3anitrites 3aimmune response 3aovalbumin 3aToxoplasma gondii 3aT-lymphocytes 3ainterferons 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Proteinsxpharmacology 2aCHO Cells 2aChaperonin 60 2aChaperoninsxpharmacology 2aCricetinae 2aFemale 2aInterleukin-6xbiosynthesis 2aLipopolysaccharidesxpharmacology 2aMacrophage Activationxdrug effects 2aMacrophages, Peritonealximmunologyxmetabolismxparasitology. 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aNitritesxmetabolism 2aToxoplasmaximmunology 2aTumor Necrosis Factor-alphaxbiosynthesis1 aRaats, C.J.1 aFurth, R. van.1 aLangermans, J.A.M.0 tInfection and immunity.g1995 Sept., v. 63, no. 9 p.3454-3458x0019-95677nnas  aDNAL  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle01762naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001800149245010900167300001800276520040900294650002300703650001700726650001700743650000900760650002600769650001200795650005100807650000900858650000900867650002100876650003400897650002900931650004400960650004301004650002701047653001501074700001601089700002301105700001501128773008101143852000901224930003301233945001301266946001301279655001201292IND2041233120221118050607.0940803e199405  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204123312DNAL7 a81689852pmid7 aPMC1864832pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSternberg, J.10aInhibition of nitric oxide synthesis leads to reduced parasitemia in murine Trypanosoma brucei infection  ap. 2135-2137.  aIn murine Trypanosoma brucei infection, macrophage activation and nitric oxide (NO) production lead to suppressed splenic T-cell responses (J.

Two approaches were used, each involving the use of rat anti-T-cell surface marker monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). In the first, the adoptive transfer of immunity was studied by using the CB.17 SCID mouse (which lacks T and B cells) as the host; in the second, the effect on susceptibility of BALB/c mice to infection was examined following depletion of T cells or subsets of T cells. In adoptive immunity experiments, the conditions which differentiated between resistance associated with reconstitution of SCID mice with naive BALB/c lymphocytes and the transfer of immunity with primed lymphocytes from infected animals were determined. Primed spleen or mesenteric lymph node cells conferred better protection to recipeints than naive cells when obtained from donors which had developed resistance to infection. Adoptive immunity was abrogated when Thy.1 cells or CD-4 cells were depleted from primed cells, whele depletion of CD8 cells could reduce the level of protection. In the study of C. muris in BALB/c mice, treatment with either anti-Thy.1 plus anti-Lyt.1 or anti-CD4 MAbs increased susceptibility to a primary infection as determined by the size and duration of oocyst production, but an anti-CD8 MAb produced an increase only in oocyst shedding. Thus, both CD4 and, to a lesser extent, CD8 cells appeared to be involved in resistance to primary and secondary C. muris infection. 3amice 3aCryptosporidium 3adisease models 3aimmunity 3adisease resistance 3aT-lymphocytes 2aAnimals 2aCD8 Antigensxanalysis. 2aCD4-Positive T-Lymphocytesximmunology 2aCryptosporidiosisximmunology 2aCryptosporidiumximmunology 2aFemale 2aImmunotherapy, Adoptive 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aMice, SCID 2aT-Lymphocyte Subsetsximmunology 0acd4 lymphocytes 0acd8 lymphocytes 0ascid mice 0abalb/c mice1 aRobinson, H.A.1 aKelly, J.P.1 aBancroft, G.J.0 tInfection and immunity.g1994 June, v. 62, no. 6 p.2289-2294x0019-95677nnas  aDNAL  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdCLD  aOther US 7aarticle02281naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245011800127300001800245500001500263520104300278650002101321650001601342650002601358650002301384650001001407650002901417650001201446650001901458650002601477650001901503650002701522650002601549650001201575651001001587653001001597653001401607700001701621700001601638700001601654773008701670852000901757930003301766945001301799946001101812655001201823IND2333165720221118050801.0030620e200211  iau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233316572DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrazak, A.M.10aAntimicrobial resistance of Listeria monocytogenes isolated from various cabbage farms and packing sheds in Texas  ap. 1797-1799.  a2019-12-05  aTwenty-one isolates of Listeria monocytogenes from cabbage, environmental, and water samples were evaluated for antimicrobial resistance by the disk diffusion method. Ninety-five percent (20 of 21) of the isolates tested were resistant to two or more antimicrobial agents. This finding is significant, since multiresistant strains of Listeria spp. are not commonly found in nature. Eighty-five percent (17 of 20) of the multiresistant strains were resistant to penicillin, and the remaining multiresistant isolates were somewhat sensitive to penicillin. A multiresistant strain showing intermediate sensitivity to penicillin was resistant to gentamicin. One isolate was susceptible to all antimicrobial agents except penicillin. Penicillin- and gentamicin-resistant L. monocytogenes have not previously been reported from human, food, or environmental samples. This study provides evidence of the emergence of multiresistant L. monocytogenes strains, pointing to an increase in the potential threat to human health posed by this pathogen. 3airrigation water 3aenvironment 3aantibiotic resistance 3afood contamination 3afarms 3amultiple drug resistance 3acabbage 3apacking houses 3aenvironmental quality 3afood pathogens 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aresistance mechanisms 3astrains 3aTexas 0awater 0aisolation1 aMurano, E.A.1 aMercado, I.1 aAcuff, G.R.0 tJournal of food protection.g2002 Nov., v. 65, no. 11 p.1797-1799x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  a20030801b20030801c00000000  aINDdPNN  aNon-US 7aarticle02710naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001700149245012800166300001600294520113900310650001601449650002901465650001701494650001301511650002001524650002501544650002501569650001901594650002001613650002401633650001801657650003001675650002301705650002001728650002201748650002901770650002101799650002501820650002901845650002401874650002301898650002301921653002301944653002801967700001901995700001802014773008302032852000902115939003302124946001102157655001202168IND9302121120221118050710.0930408e19870126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930212112DNAL7 a38228162pmid7 aPMC3404692pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFortin, M.G.10aNodulin-26, a peribacteroid membrane nodulin is expressed independently of the development of the peribacteroid compartment  ap. 813-824.  aThe peribacteroid membrane (pbm) of root nodules is derived from the plant cell plasma membrane but contains in addition several nodule-specific host proteins (nodulins). Antibodies raised against purified pbm of soybean were used to immunoprecipitate polysomes to isolate an RNA fraction that served as a template for the synthesis of a cDNA probe for screening a nodule-specific cDNA library. Clone p1B1 was found to encode a 26.5 kDa polypeptide (nodulin-26) which is immunoprecipitable specifically with the anti-pbm serum. Nodulin-26 has features of a transmembrane protein and its structure differs from that of nodulin-24 which appears to be a surface protein of pbm. The expression of these two pbm nodulins was examined in nodules induced by Bradyrhizobium japonicum Tn5 mutants that arrest nodule development at different stages of pbm biosynthesis. Nodules that do not show release of bacteria from the infection thread express nodulin-24 at a very low level. In contrast, the expression of nodulin-26 occurs fully in nodules that form infection threads only and is not affected by the release of bacteria from the threads. 3aGlycine max 3aBradyrhizobium japonicum 3aroot nodules 3anodulins 3agene expression 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3ahydrophobicity 3aplasma membrane 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aCell Membranexmetabolism 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNAxmetabolism 2aMembrane Proteins 2aPlant Proteinsxgenetics 2aPlantsxgenetics 2aProtein Biosynthesis 2aRNA, Messengerxgenetics 2aRhizobiumxgenetics 2aSoybeansxgenetics 2aTemplates, Genetic 0agenetic regulation 0amolecular sequence data1 aMorrison, N.A.1 aVerma, D.P.S.0 tNucleic acids research.g1987 Jan. 26, v. 15, no. 2 p.813-824x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02893naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001600149245009400165300001800259500001500277520147100292650001801763650002501781650001601806650001201822650002801834650001201862650001801874650003301892650002301925650002501948650002201973650002801995650002702023650004202050650001302092653001702105653002502122653001502147700001402162700001402176700001702190700001402207700001502221773008602236852000902322939003302331946001102364655001202375IND9303087020221118050556.0930520e19920825xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930308702DNAL7 a15087182pmid7 aPMC3341332pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMount, S.M.10aSplicing signals in Drosophila: intron size, information content, and consensus sequences  ap. 4255-4262.  a2019-12-05  aA database of 209 Drosophila introns was extracted from Genbank (release number 64.0) and examined by a number of methods in order to characterize features that might serve as signals for messenger RNA splicing. A tight distribution of sizes was observed: while the smallest introns in the database are 51 nucleotides, more than half are less than 80 nucleotides in length, and most of these have lengths in the range of 59-67 nucleotides. Drosophila splice sites found in large and small introns differ in only minor ways from each other and from those found in vertebrate introns. However, larger introns have greater pyrimidine-richness in the region between 11 and 21 nucleotides upstream of 3' splice sites. The Drosophila branchpoint consensus matrix resembles CTAAT (in which branch formation occurs at the second A), and differs from the corresponding mammalian signal in the absence of G at the position immediately preceding the branchpoint. The distribution of occurrences of this sequence suggests a minimum distance between 5' splice sites and branchpoints of about 38 nucleotides, and a minimum distance between 3' splice sites and branchpoints of 15 nucleotides. The methods we have used detect no information in exon sequences other than in the few nucleotides immediately adjacent to the splice sites. However, Drosophila resembles many other species in that there is a discontinuity in A + T content between exons and introns, which are A + T rich. 3amessenger RNA 3aalternative splicing 3aRNA editing 3aintrons 3aDrosophila melanogaster 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aConsensus Sequencexgenetics 2aDatabases, Factual 2aDrosophilaxgenetics 2aIntronsxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aRNA Splicingxgenetics 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSoftware 0asplice sites 0anucleotide sequences 0aDrosophila1 aBurks, C.1 aHertz, G.1 aStormo, G.D.1 aWhite, O.1 aFields, C.0 tNucleic acids research.g1992 Aug. 25, v. 20, no. 16 p.4255-4262x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02510naa a2200565 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002500133245005600158300001800214300002600232500001500258520096700273650001401240650001301254650001401267650002401281650001501305650001001320650001201330650001701342650001001359650001801369650003301387650001101420650002501431650002801456650003801484650002601522650001201548650003701560651001301597651001301610653001801623653002101641653002301662653000901685653003501694700002301729700001801752773009901770852000901869939003301878945000801911946001301919655001201932991628063180742620221118050718.0810310e198010  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI810006262DNAL7 a67755202pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEllestad-Sayed, J.J.10aMilk intolerance in Manitoba Indian school children  ap. 2198-2201.  ap. 2198-2201. charts.  a2019-12-05  aIn 104 Manitoban Indian school children given a breath H2 test to determine the prevalence of milk intolerance, only 5 had H2 levels suggesting appreciable lactose malabsorption and only 2 had symptoms. Subjects ranged from 5 to 19 years old. The children were randomly assigned to 1 of 6 groups in order to identify lactose-intolerant individuals: reconstituted skimmed milk powder (SMP); SMP plus sandwich; SMP plus lactose; diluted (1:1) evaporated whole milk (EM); EM plus sandwich; and EM plus lactose. Samples of expired air were collected 2 hours after ingestion of 245 ml. of milk. Subjects on SMP exhibited significantly higher mean H2 excretion levels than those on EM. Thus, school milk programs for this population group may be safely continued, in light of the relatively low incidence of milk intolerance. However, EM seems more suitable for use than SMP. Those children who cannot hydrolyze lactose must also be considered in school milk programs. 3askim milk 3achildren 3ascreening 3alactose intolerance 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAnimals 2aBreath Tests 2aChild 2aFood Services 2aGalactosidasesxpharmacology 2aHumans 2aHydrogenxmetabolism 2aIndians, North American 2aLactose Intolerancexepidemiology 2aMilkxadverse effects 2aSchools 2abeta-Galactosidasexpharmacology 3aManitoba 0aManitoba 0aMilk programs 0amilk intolerance 0aIndians (Canadian) 0amilk 0aRespiratory hydrogen excretion1 aLevitt, Michael D.1 aBond, John H.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1980 Oct., v. 33, no. 10 p.2198-2201x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19810310c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle03392naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001400171245009000185300001600275520193300291650001702224650002502241650002602266650001802292650005602310650006002366650001102426650002502437651002602462653000802488700001502496700001702511700001502528700001502543700001602558700001502574700001702589700001302606700001302619773014502632852000902777856009202786930003302878946001102911655001202922IND4432611320221118050613.0100213e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443261132DNAL7 a200706372pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-3156.2009.02456.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaher, D.10aTranslating global health research aims into action: the example of the ALPHA network  ap. 321-328.  aThere is increasing consensus on the importance of strengthening global health research to meet health and development goals. Three key global health research aims are to ensure that research (i) addresses priority health needs, (ii) contributes to policy development, and (iii) adds value to investments in developing countries through South-South collaboration and capacity-strengthening in the South. The ALPHA network (Analysing Longitudinal Population-based HIV/AIDS data on Africa) is an illustrative example of how these global health research aims can be translated into action. The network facilitates additional collaborative HIV epidemiological research among six independent research projects in Africa studying population-based cohorts. Under the first of the earlier mentioned aims, the network addresses key epidemiology research issues in HIV/AIDS which are crucial to making progress and monitoring progress in the response against HIV/AIDS. Under the second aim, the network's scientific programme of research has contributed to strengthening the evidence base on HIV epidemiology in Africa and has informed policy development in areas such as targeted HIV prevention, social support, monitoring epidemic response and epidemic forecasting. Under the third aim, investment in the network has added value to the research investment in the individual projects through capacity development among African researchers as well as through the collaborative research outputs of the individual projects. Lessons from the network are relevant to collaborations facing similar challenges in other areas of global health research. These include the importance of establishing transparent and efficient governance for research collaborations, developing advance consensus on data sharing, ensuring effective communication for networking and demonstrating the added value of research investment in South-South collaborations. 3aepidemiology 2aDeveloping Countries 2aEpidemiologic Studies 2aGlobal Health 2aHIV Infectionsxepidemiologyxprevention & control. 2aHealth Services Researchxorganization & administration 2aHumans 2aLongitudinal Studies 0aAfricaxepidemiology. 0aHIV1 aBiraro, S.1 aHosegood, V.1 aIsingo, R.1 aLutalo, T.1 aMushati, P.1 aNgwira, B.1 aNyirenda, M.1 aTodd, J.1 aZaba, B.0 tTropical medicine & international health TM & IH.g2010 Mar., v. 15, no. 3 p.321-328dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1360-22767nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3156.2009.02456.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100213b20100305c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02689naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245008600169300001600255520162500271650001801896650000901914650000901923650001401932653001601946653001901962653001401981700001801995700001502013700001602028700002002044773011602064852000902180856009202189930003302281946001302314655001202327IND4432605920221118050719.0100213e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443260592DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1469-7998.2009.00663.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFoster, R.J.10aFood habits of sympatric jaguars and pumas across a gradient of human disturbance  ap. 309-318.  aJaguars Panthera onca coexist with pumas Puma concolor across their entire range. In areas where they occur together their coexistence may be facilitated by differences in diet. This study compared food habits of jaguars and pumas in Belize, Central America, across a protected lowland rainforest and the neighbouring human-influenced landscape. Diets were determined from 362 jaguar scats and 135 puma scats, identified by genetic analysis. In the protected forest, dietary breadths were low for jaguars and pumas and showed little overlap. In this habitat each relied heavily on a single medium-sized (5-10 kg) prey species: armadillos Dasypus novemcinctus for jaguars, and pacas Agouti paca for pumas. Both cats also took larger prey (>10 kg), mainly white-lipped peccaries Tayassu pecari by jaguars and red brocket deer Mazama americana by pumas. In unprotected fragmented lands, jaguar scats rarely contained large wild prey species; rather, a diet of relatively small wild prey was supplemented with larger domestic species. Pumas did not take domestic species and were scarce outside the protected forest, possibly indicating competition with humans for pacas and deer, which are also prized game species in the region. This study is the largest analysis to date of sympatric jaguar and puma diets in both forest and farmland. We suggest that jaguar predation on cattle may be reduced by ensuring that game hunting is sustainable and potentially by augmenting forests within the human matrix with large wild ungulates. The supplementation could benefit both of the cat species, and the local game hunting economy. 3aPanthera onca 3aPuma 3adiet 3alivestock 0acoexistence 0aprey depletion 0acarnivore1 aHarmsen, B.J.1 aValdes, B.1 aPomilla, C.1 aDoncaster, C.P.0 tJournal of zoology.g2010 Mar., v. 280, no. 3 p.309-318dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0952-83697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7998.2009.00663.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100213b20100305c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle04116naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002600152245012800178300001600306520225800322650001102580650002102591650002002612650002002632650001902652650002302671650001102694650005002705650002502755650002902780650000902809650001702818650001902835650002302854650001602877650002702893650001102920650001902931653002202950653002002972653003102992653002703023700002103050700001803071700001803089700002403107700001803131700002603149700002003175700002503195700002103220773012803241852000903369856009203378930003303470946001103503655001203514IND4432618620221118050823.0100213e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443261862DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1466-8238.2009.00504.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarbulsky, Martín F.10aPatterns and controls of the variability of radiation use efficiency and primary productivity across terrestrial ecosystems  ap. 253-267.  aThe controls of gross radiation use efficiency (RUE), the ratio between gross primary productivity (GPP) and the radiation intercepted by terrestrial vegetation, and its spatial and temporal variation are not yet fully understood. Our objectives were to analyse and synthesize the spatial variability of GPP and the spatial and temporal variability of RUE and its climatic controls for a wide range of vegetation types. A global range of sites from tundra to rain forest. We analysed a global dataset on photosynthetic uptake and climatic variables from 35 eddy covariance (EC) flux sites spanning between 100 and 2200 mm mean annual rainfall and between -13 and 26°C mean annual temperature. RUE was calculated from the data provided by EC flux sites and remote sensing (MODIS). Rainfall and actual evapotranspiration (AET) positively influenced the spatial variation of annual GPP, whereas temperature only influenced the GPP of forests. Annual and maximum RUE were also positively controlled primarily by annual rainfall. The main control parameters of the growth season variation of gross RUE varied for each ecosystem type. Overall, the ratio between actual and potential evapotranspiration and a surrogate for the energy balance explained a greater proportion of the seasonal variation of RUE than the vapour pressure deficit (VPD), AET and precipitation. Temperature was important for determining the intra-annual variability of the RUE at the coldest energy-limited sites. Our analysis supports the idea that the annual functioning of vegetation that is adapted to its local environment is more constrained by water availability than by temperature. The spatial variability of annual and maximum RUE can be largely explained by annual precipitation, more than by vegetation type. The intra-annual variation of RUE was mainly linked to the energy balance and water availability along the climatic gradient. Furthermore, we showed that intra-annual variation of gross RUE is only weakly influenced by VPD and temperature, contrary to what is frequently assumed. Our results provide a better understanding of the spatial and temporal controls of the RUE and thus could lead to a better estimation of ecosystem carbon fixation and better modelling. 3acarbon 3aclimatic factors 3adata collection 3aeddy covariance 3aenergy balance 3aevapotranspiration 3amodels 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3aprimary productivity 3aradiation use efficiency 3arain 3arain forests 3aremote sensing 3aseasonal variation 3atemperature 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3atundra 3avapor pressure 0aclimatic controls 0aeddy covariance 0agross primary productivity 0aterrestrial vegetation1 aPeñuelas, Josep1 aPapale, Dario1 aArdö, Jonas.1 aGoulden, Michael L.1 aKiely, Gerard1 aRichardson, Andrew D.1 aRotenberg, Eyal1 aVeenendaal, Elmar M.1 aFilella, Iolanda0 tGlobal ecology and biogeography.g2010 Mar., v. 19, no. 2 p.253-267dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1466-822X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2009.00504.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100213b20100305c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02355naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245012900125300001600254500001500270520119000285650001601475650001701491650001601508650001401524650002101538650001101559650000701570650001401577650001401591650001601605650001301621650001101634653000801645653001901653653001601672653001401688700001901702700001801721773010401739852000901843930003301852945001301885946001101898655001201909IND2049126120221118050919.0951206e199504  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204912612DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOpie, S.C.14aThe formation of thearubigin-like substances by in-vitro polyphenol oxidase-mediated fermentation of individual flavan-3-ols  ap. 501-505.  a2019-12-05  aAn enzymic in-vitro model tea fermentation system has been used in combination with gradient elusion reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography to study the formation from individual flavan-3-ols of resolvable and unresolvable thearubigin-like substances. It has been found that in 30 min at pH 5.6 tea polyphenol oxidase (EC 1.14.18.1) produces a distinctive range of resolvable thearubigin-like products from each flavan-3-ol substrate examined ((+)-catechin, (-)- epicatechin, (-)-epigallocatechin, (-)-epicatechin gallate and (-)-epigallocatechin gallate). However, (-)-epicatechin, and to a much lesser extent (+)-catechin, were the only flavan-3-ols converted to an unresolvable thearubigin-like hump under these conditions. In addition, it was demonstrated that varying the pH of incubation in the range 5.0-6.0 had little effect on the profile of products obtained from the simple catechins, but a pronounced effect in the case of the gallocatechins. It is concluded that the combination of (-)-epicatechin and polyphenol oxidase is the simplest model of tea fermentation that can be used to generate in quantity thearubigin-like materials for structure elucidation. 3aepicatechin 3afermentation 3atheaflavins 3agreen tea 3acatechol oxidase 3amodels 3apH 3ablack tea 3aoxidation 3atemperature 3acatechin 3aleaves 0atea 0aplant pigments 0atheaflavine 0aflavanols1 aClifford, M.N.1 aRobertson, A.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1995 Apr., v. 67, no. 4 p.501-505x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL  a19960202b19960208c00000000  aINDdRAM  aNon-US 7aarticle02562naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245009100126300001600217500001500233520121400248650001601462650001901478650001001497650002301507650001201530650001301542650003401555650002801589650001701617650001901634650001701653650001601670650002001686650002001706650001701726650001101743650001201754653001001766653001501776653001801791700001701809700001701826700001801843700001301861773010401874852000901978930003301987945001302020946001102033655001202044IND2049126420221118050903.0951206e199504  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204912642DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManzano, M.10aMicrobial and sensory quality of vegetables for soup packaged in different atmospheres  ap. 521-529.  a2019-12-05  aFresh prepacked vegetables for soup have become very popular on the Italian market, since they are already peeled, cut, washed and ready-to-use. The packaging and the modified atmosphere can prolong their shelf-life and maintain their hygienic, physicochemical and sensory characteristics during storage at +4 degrees C. The hygienic and sensory quality was evaluated by analysing microbial growth and atmosphere composition at the moment of packaging and at the end or the shelf-life of vegetables prepacked in air or under modified atmospheres, and by determining the browning or blackening of parsley and the loss of carrot exudates. A large number of different groups of microorganisms was found in raw vegetables. In spite of this high starting concentration of microbial flora, the prepackaging systems investigated did not seem to significantly influence their growth during vegetable storage at +4 degrees C. No pathogenic microorganisms were isolated from the prepackaged vegetables. The hygienic quality was similar in all packaging systems used. However, the vegetables packaged in perforated film kept their sensory characteristics better than those packaged in air or under a modified atmosphere. 3atemperature 3acarbon dioxide 3asoups 3asensory evaluation 3acarrots 3anitrogen 3acontrolled atmosphere storage 3amicrobial contamination 3afood storage 3afood packaging 3afood quality 3aplate count 3astorage quality 3afood sanitation 3acarrot juice 3aoxygen 3aparsley 0afilms 0avegetables 0aconcentration1 aCitterio, B.1 aMaifreni, M.1 aPaganessi, M.1 aComi, G.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1995 Apr., v. 67, no. 4 p.521-529x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL  a19960102b19960111c00000000  aINDdRAM  aNon-US 7aarticle02340naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245007500123300001600198500001500214520103900229650001101268650001101279650004401290650001101334650001801345650002501363650002001388650001701408650001301425650001001438650002101448650002201469650002001491650002701511653001801538653001701556653001901573653001601592653001901608653001701627700001301644700001901657773010401676852000901780930003301789945001301822946001101835655001201846IND2049124620221118050909.0951206e199504  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204912462DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZion, B.10aNonodestructive quality evaluation of fresh prunes by NMR spectroscopy  ap. 423-429.  a2019-12-05  aThe potential for utilizing nuclear magnetic resonance measurements for evaluating the quality of fresh prunes was investigated. In a 2 T magnetic flux density, the chemical shift between proton hydrogens of soluble solids and those of water is less than 100 Hz. The band width of the water resonance spectrum of fruits is relatively large and therefore it is difficult to resolve between the spectral peaks of water and soluble solids. Measurements with a 100 mm Birdcage coil failed to resolve between the resonance peaks of soluble solids and water. Good resolution was achieved with a 20 mm diameter Surface coil. Signals (free induction decay) of 30 sugar prunes were acquired, and the spectra were calculated. Tuning and matching the coil before each measurement were not necessary, and the results were better when the magnetic field was not shimmed. The ratio of the soluble solids peak height to the water peak height correlated well (r = 0.907) with the soluble solids content of the prunes, as estimated by a refractometer. 3aprunes 3aweight 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asugars 3afood analysis 3atotal soluble solids 3ainstrumentation 3afood quality 3afirmness 3awater 3afood composition 3aspectral analysis 3amagnetic fields 3anondestructive methods 0abirdcage soil 0asurface coil 0aripening stage 0amethodology 0asoluble solids 0aspectroscopy1 aChen, P.1 aMcCarthy, M.J.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1995 Apr., v. 67, no. 4 p.423-429x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL  a19960102b19960111c00000000  aINDdRAM  aNon-US 7aarticle02199naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245006000129300001600189500001500205520124400220650003001464650001501494650001801509650002101527650002401548650002001572650002001592653003001612653002001642653001701662773010401679852000901783930003301792945001301825946001101838655001201849IND2048881120221118050916.0951121e199503  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204888112DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimmonds, N.W.14aThe relation between yields and protein in cereal grain  ap. 309-315.  a2019-12-05  aAn analysis of published data on genetic relations between dry grain yields (y, t ha-1) and protein content [LP, protein as a fraction (g g-1) of dry grain] of cereals is presented. In all, 106 usable regressions of y on p across genotypes were assembled. The long-recognised negative relation between yield and protein concentration was fully substantiated. There is a strong positive relation between grain yield and protein yield. The linear regression coefficient of yield on protein concentration is related to yield, with slope about -15. This relation holds approximately over all cereals. The data can be used to estimate a characteristic parameter described by C=dy/d(yp)= approximately 15-25 at the mean of each experiment. The relationship is surprisingly consistent but no simple physiological interpretation is available. In discussion, the high C, the impact of strong negative regressions of y on p for breeding strategies, the fact that protein yield increases with gross grain yield but at falling p and certain socio-economic consequences are emphasized. An acute need for orderly reporting of experimental data is also emphasized; the existing literature is chaotic as to units, moisture contents and conversion factors. 3ageographical distribution 3acrop yield 3adata analysis 3afood composition 3asmall cereal grains 3aprotein content 3acereal proteins 0agrowth yield relationship 0acrop production 0asmall grains0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1995 Mar., v. 67, no. 3 p.309-315x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL  a19960102b19960111c00000000  aINDdRAM  aNon-US 7aarticle01961naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245009500126300001600221520081900237650000901056650001101065650001901076650001801095650002101113650002201134650001701156650002601173650003601199651001001235653001801245653001501263653001701278653002401295700001601319700001601335700001801351773010401369852000901473930003301482945001301515946001101528655001201539IND2048884720221118050753.0951121e199503  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204888472DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrevino, J.10aChanges in the non-structural carbohydrates associated with the field drying of oat forage  ap. 393-397.  aTwo trials were conducted to determine the sugars, fructans and starch in oat plants (Avena sativa L) and the changes occurring in these carbohydrate fractions during field drying in the haymaking process.

The mean of gas and particle phase concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were 468 ± 297 and 43 ± 37 pg m ⁻ ³ (average ± standard deviation, SD), respectively. The dominated PCB homologs were 3-CBs, 4-CBs, and 5-CBs. The measured PCB concentrations were higher than the values of pristine sites. In order to assess the gas/particle partitioning fate, log K P-log [graphic removed] , log K P-log K OA and the Junge-Pankow model were applied to the data. Experimental K P was well correlated with [graphic removed] and log K OA at p < 0.05. Then, dry deposition fluxes were estimated using atmospheric concentrations and dry deposition velocities obtained from literature. A correlation matrix was formed for PCB homologs including 27 congeners with concurrently measured 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and meteorological parameters. Most of PAH compounds were significantly correlated with 5-CBs and 6-CBs. 3aair 3adry deposition 3ameteorological parameters 3amodels 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 2aLimit of Detection 2aPolychlorinated Biphenylsxanalysis 2aQuality Control 2aSoil Pollutantsxanalysis 3aTurkey (country) 0aTurkey 0aCongener 0aPartitioning models 0aPAHs1 aTasdemir, Yücel 0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2010 Mar., v. 162, no. 1-4 p.67-80dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0167-63697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-009-0776-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20100213b20100305c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02532naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245013400126300001600260500001500276520146200291650001201753650002401765650002301789650001501812650001001827650001301837650001101850650000901861650001601870653001501886653001301901653001601914700001801930700001601948773010401964852000902068930003302077945001302110946001102123655001202134IND2050750620221118050848.0960411e199507  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205075062DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohamed, S.10aEffects of protein from different sources on the characteristics of sponge cakes, rice cakes (apam), doughnuts and frying batters  ap. 271-277.  a2019-12-05  aSponge cakes containing total substitution of whole egg with egg yolk had the largest volume, best texture, highest moisture, colour and flavour compared with all other cakes. Cakes made with total substitution of other proteins had smaller volumes than the control, while those made with egg white had the lowest moisture. Cakes made with whey powder had the tenderest texture. Doughnuts made with protein other than gluten had reduced oil absorption compared with the control. Doughnuts containing whey or skimmed milk had the most desirable flavour; this may be attributed to the presence of lactose. Gluten doughnuts were most disliked because of their hard texture and pale colour. Doughnuts made with total substitution of whole egg with egg white had good texture and low oil absorption. Skimmed milk powder was best for the expansion and texture of chemically leavened rice cakes (apam), while egg white produced the best expansion for yeast-leavened rice cakes, compared with the other proteins studied. The protein that produced the most desirable textures in yeast-leavened rice cakes in order of merit were skimmed milk powder, egg white and egg yolk. Whey, skimmed milk powder and gluten helped improve the crispiness of frying batters. Ovalbumin did not affect the crispiness but significantly reduced the oil absorption of the frying batters. Addition of proteins other than whey and ovalbumin, increased the oil absorption of frying batters. 3abatters 3aphysical properties 3asensory properties 3adried whey 3acakes 3aegg yolk 3afrying 3aeggs 3aegg albumen 0adried milk 0aproteins 0abaked goods1 aLajis, S.M.M.1 aHamid, N.A.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1995 July, v. 68, no. 3 p.271-277x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL  a19960503b19960510c00000000  aINDdJFM  aNon-US 7aarticle01642naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002300110245013400133300001600267500001500283520070100298650001600999650001501015650002601030650001701056650002001073650001601093653001701109700001901126773010501145852000901250930003301259945001301292946001101305655001201316IND2050317020221118050820.0960313e199509  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205031702DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNketsia-Tabiri, J.10aOptimization of process conditions and quality of salted dried tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) using response surface methodology  ap. 117-127.  a2019-12-05  aTilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) was processed by varying salting time (0-24 h), drying time (6-20 h) and drying temperature (40-60 degrees C) using the central composite rotatable design.

The critical salting times for attaining minimum moisture were 20.5, 12 and 8.5 h, respectively, for products dried at 40, 50 and 60 degrees C. At each salting time the mean hardness score was dependent on the drying temperature and time whilst the mean colour and acceptability scores were influenced by the drying temperature.

Since 1987 the FDA has limited their use as food ingredients; consequently, during recent years the tendency to replace sulphites by GRAS chemical additives such as citric and ascorbic acids has become stronger. In the present work, surface colour variations, exudate production and microbial growth were analysed on pre-peeled potatoes treated with citric and ascorbic acids. These preservatives were applied individually and as mixtures; shelf-life was extended and microbiologically safe products were obtained. Mathematical models were solved to analyse the diffusion of these acids during immersion and storage periods in order to determine the concentration profiles within the product and to predict the surface concentration to which the microorganisms are exposed. 3amathematical models 3amicrobial contamination 3apreservatives 3apotatoes 3acitric acid 3acold storage 3aascorbic acid 0aorganic acids and salts 0agrowth rate1 aLombardi, A.M.1 aZaritzky, N.E.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1995 July, v. 68, no. 3 p.311-317x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL  a19960503b19960510c00000000  aINDdJFM  aNon-US 7aarticle01879naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245006000125300001600185520104600201650001501247650001501262650002101277650002501298650002201323651001401345700001701359700001901376773010401395852000901499930003301508945001301541946001101554655001201565IND2050750920221118050929.0960411e199507  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205075092DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarr, K.M.10aRelationships between minerals in Australian brown rice  ap. 285-291.  aNinety samples of brown rice cv Amaroo, which has occupied over 50% of the area sown to rice in southern Australia in the last two seasons, were collected from the rice growing regions of southern Australia at the end of the 1991-1992 season. The samples were analysed for total nitrogen using the Kjeldahl technique, and for P, K, S, Mg, Ca, Na, Al, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo and Zn using inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy. The analysis of concentrations of elements show that Mn concentrations in Australian rice were higher and Ca concentrations lower than typical values reported for brown rice grown in other countries. For all other elements the concentrations had a similar range to those reported for overseas rice. Highly significant correlations were found between the major nutrients P, K and Mg, and also N and S. The Mg to K ratio ranged from 1.3 to 1.6 which indicates that, if Japanese criteria are used, the taste/stickiness quality within this cultivar of Australian rice could vary from undesirable to highly desirable. 3arice straw 3arice hulls 3adietary minerals 3achemical composition 3achemical analysis 3aAustralia1 aBatten, G.D.1 aBlakeney, A.B.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1995 July, v. 68, no. 3 p.285-291x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL  a19960503b19960510c00000000  aINDdJFM  aNon-US 7aarticle02540naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100003400164245011800198300001500316520117500331650002201506650001601528650001501544650001201559650001301571650003801584650002401622651001101646653002601657653002401683653002201707700002901729700003201758700002901790700002801819773013301847852000901980856008501989930003302074946001102107655001202118IND4432725520221118050845.0100213e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443272552DNAL7 a192347512pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-009-0778-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamos, Carla Alecrim Colaço 10aQuantification of reef benthos communities and variability inherent to the monitoring using video transect method  ap. 95-101.  aLong-term monitoring program of organisms is the most recommended for understanding changing processes on reefs. The video transect method presents advantages for that. Specialists state that it is important to make sure that the recorded coverage is always the same between campaigns, so that differences in results may be entirely attributed to environmental changes. This study aimed to test the capability of implementing this requirement through tracking simulation and its validity for monitoring the benthic communities of reefs using the video transect method. Ten transects 20 m long were established in Todos os Santos Bay coral reefs. Subsequent to the first transect capture, a second diver repeated the same track, simulating two different monitoring campaigns. Data were transformed and a matrix of similarity was generated using Bray-Curtis' Index. ANOSIM analysis was performed to test the similarity of the ten transects and its repetitions. The result, R = 0.08 (P = 0.928), shows that reef monitoring using video transect, the way it is described in the literature, is appropriate, but it is important to consider some premises discussed in this work. 3abenthic organisms 3acoral reefs 3amonitoring 2aAnimals 2aAnthozoa 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aVideotape Recording 0aBrazil 0aVideo transect method 0aBenthos communities 0aReef environments1 aAmaral, Fernanda Duarte 1 ade Kikuchi, Ruy Kenji Papa 1 aChaves, Eduardo Marocci 1 ade Melo, Gabriel Rivas 0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2010 Mar., v. 162, no. 1-4 p.95-101dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0167-63697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-009-0778-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100213b20100305c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02718naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002400164245011500188300001400303520105200317650005001369650001301419650001701432650001201449650003701461650001001498650000901508650001401517650002701531650001401558650001501572650001701587650001301604650002601617650003401643650002301677650003501700650004101735651001901776651001901795653000801814653002001822653001701842700002401859700002301883773013201906852000902038856008502047930003302132946001102165655001202176IND4432722920221118050802.0100213e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443272292DNAL7 a192296452pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-009-0773-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeinstein, John E. 10aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon contamination in stormwater detention pond sediments in coastal South Carolina  ap. 21-35.  aThe purpose of this study was to characterize the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) contamination in the sediments of stormwater detention ponds in coastal South Carolina. Levels of the sum of PAH analytes were significantly higher in the sediments of commercial ponds compared to that of reference, golf course, low-density residential, and high-density residential ponds. Isomer ratio analysis suggested that the predominant source of PAHs were pyrogenic; however, many ponds had a PAH signature consistent with mixed uncombusted and combusted PAH sources. PAH levels in these sediments could be modeled using both pond drainage area and pond surface area. These results demonstrate that the sediment from most commercial ponds, and a few residential and golf course ponds, were moderately contaminated with PAHs. PAH levels in these contaminated ponds exceeded between 42% and 75% of the ecological screening values for individual PAH analytes established by US EPA Region IV, suggesting that they may pose a toxicological risk to wildlife. 3aUnited States Environmental Protection Agency 3adrainage 3agolf courses 3aisomers 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3aponds 3arisk 3ascreening 3asediment contamination 3asediments 3astormwater 3asurface area 3awildlife 2aFresh Waterxanalysis 2aGeologic Sedimentsxchemistry 2aLimit of Detection 2aPolycyclic Compoundsxanalysis 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 3aSouth Carolina 0aSouth Carolina 0aPAH 0aDetention ponds 0aContaminants1 aCrawford, Kevin D. 1 aGarner, Thomas R. 0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2010 Mar., v. 162, no. 1-4 p.21-35dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0167-63697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-009-0773-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20100213b20100305c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02567naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245006900185300001600254520114300270650002001413650002501433650002601458650001701484650004301501650001601544650002601560650001801586650004101604650004201645650002501687650002301712650002201735653002501757653003301782653001801815653001601833773013401849852000901983856008501992930003302077946001102110655001202121IND4432722320221118050908.0100213e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443272232DNAL7 a192385672pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-009-0784-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSondhia, Shobha 10aPersistence and bioaccumulation of oxyfluorfen residues in onion  ap. 163-168.  aA field study was conducted to determine persistence and bioaccumulation of oxyflorfen residues in onion crop at two growth stages.

From the study, a pre-harvest interval of 118 days for onion crop after the herbicide application is suggested. 3abioaccumulation 3adevelopmental stages 3afield experimentation 3agreen onions 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aoxyfluorfen 3apesticide application 3asoil sampling 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aHalogenated Diphenyl Ethersxanalysis 2aHerbicidesxanalysis 2aLimit of Detection 2aOnionsxchemistry 0aOxyfluorfen residues 0aGreen and mature onion bulbs 0aHPLC analysis 0aPersistence0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2010 Mar., v. 162, no. 1-4 p.163-168dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0167-63697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-009-0784-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20100213b20100305c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02017naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245018400124300001400308520087800322650002301200650002101223650004201244650002001286650001701306650001601323650002001339650001601359650001401375653001101389700001401400700001701414700001501431700001601446773010301462852000901565930003301574945001301607946001101620655001201631IND2050316520221118050854.0960313e199509  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205031652DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuo, Y.H.10aSolid-state fermentation of Lathyrus sativus seeds using Aspergillus oryzae and Rhizopus oligosporus sp T-3 to eliminate the neurotoxin beta-ODAP without loss of nutritional value  ap. 81-89.  aThe presence of a neurotoxic amino acid, 3-N-oxalyl-L-2,3-diaminopropanoic acid (beta-ODAP), in the seeds of grass pea (Lathyrus sativus) is the cause of an irreversible spastic paraparesis, neurolathyrism, after overconsumption. This is a negative factor in an otherwise very tasty, nutritious, easily cultivated and hardy food crop in Asia and Africa. The reduction of beta-ODAP to less than 10% of the original content has been reached by fermenting L sativus Jamalpur seeds with Aspergillus oryzae NRRL 1988 for 48 h, followed by fermentation with Rhizopus oligosporus sp T-3 for 48 h. Other nutritional qualities were also improved in the fermented seed meal: increased content of protein, higher amino acid scores for sulphur-containing and aromatic amino acids, better resistance to high temperature and to oxidation, and drastic reduction of the flatulence factors. 3aAspergillus oryzae 3aLathyrus sativus 3aRhizopus microsporus var. oligosporus 3anutritive value 3afermentation 3aneurotoxins 3aprotein content 3atemperature 3aoxidation 0aflatus1 aBau, H.M.1 aQuemener, B.1 aKhan, J.K.1 aLambein, F.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1995 Sept., v. 69, no. 1 p.81-89x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL  a19960331b19960404c00000000  aINDdJFM  aNon-US 7aarticle02099naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245007300127300001600200520119800216650000901414650001601423650002001439650001301459650001601472650001401488650001101502650001001513650002101523700001701544700001701561773010501578852000901683930003301692945001301725946001101738655001201749IND2050316820221118050849.0960313e199509  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205031682DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDhiman, T.R.10aEffect of dietary fat source on fatty acid composition of cow's milk  ap. 101-107.  aFour multiparous ruminally cannulated cows and four primiparous cows without a ruminal cannula were used in a 4 x 4 Latin square experiment to study the effect of dietary fat source on milk fatty acid composition. Cows were ted a diet containing 550 g lucerne silage and 450 g concentrate kg-1 dietary DM. The four diets were control and fat supplementation (32 g fat kg-1 diet DM) as roasted soya beans, calcium salts of palm oil fatty acids (Megalac), or hydrogenated tallow (Alifet). Cows fed supplemental fat as roasted soya beans, Megalac, or Alifet produced 33.8, 32.6, and 32.5 kg day-1 of 3.5% FCM, respectively, compared with 31.6 kg day-1 with no fat supplementation. Addition of fat decreased milk protein percentage. Milk fat percentage was increased with Megalac and decreased with Alifet feeding. Dietary fat decreased the proportion of short- and medium-chain fatty acids (C6-C14:0) in milk and increased the proportion of long-chain fatty acids (C16:0 and longer). Roasted soya beans were most effective in reducing C16:0 and increasing C18:1, C18:2 and C18:3 acids in milk fat. Megalac did not decrease milk C16:0 content and neither Megalac nor Alifet affected C18:2 content. 3amilk 3adietary fat 3aprotein content 3asoybeans 3afatty acids 3apalm oils 3atallow 3arumen 3afood composition1 aZanten, K.V.1 aSatter, L.D.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1995 Sept., v. 69, no. 1 p.101-107x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL  a19960331b19960404c00000000  aINDdJFM  aNon-US 7aarticle01970naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245012600127300001500253500001500268520099300283650001601276650001801292650001101310650002001321650001701341650001601358653002501374700001701399700001601416700001801432773010401450852000901554930003301563945001301596946001101609655001201620IND2050316720221118050840.0960313e199509  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205031672DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIsaksson, T.10aNon-destructive determination of fat, moisture and protein in salmon fillets by use of near-infrared diffuse spectroscopy  ap. 95-100.  a2019-12-05  aNear infrared (NIR) diffuse spectroscopy was used to determine the fat, moisture and protein contents in whole and ground farmed atlantic salmon fillets. A remote fibre-optic probe was used for NIR measurements on 50 whole salmon fillets. The constituent ranges were: 91-205 g kg-1 fat, 599-709 g kg-1 moisture and 186-209 g kg-1 protein. Principal component regression resulted in the following prediction errors for ground salmon fillets, expressed as root mean square error of cross validation: 6.6 g kg-1 fat, 3.8 g kg-1 moisture and 2.0 g kg-1 protein. The corresponding prediction errors for non-destructive measurements on whole salmon fillets were 10.8 g kg-1 fat, 8.5 g kg-1 moisture and 3.7 g kg-1 protein. Regression models using the 760-1100 m range gave lower prediction errors than models using the 1100-2500 nm or 760-2500 nm ranges. The results show that fibre-optic probe NIR instruments are suited to determine fat and moisture in whole salmon fillets non-destructively. 3adietary fat 3awater content 3asalmon 3aprotein content 3aspectroscopy 3ameasurement 0achemical composition1 aTogersen, G.1 aIversen, A.1 aHildrum, K.I.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1995 Sept., v. 69, no. 1 p.95-100x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL  a19960331b19960404c00000000  aINDdJFM  aNon-US 7aarticle01604naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245005900132300001600191500001500207520079000222650001301012650002101025650002001046650001301066650001601079653001201095653001301107773010401120852000901224930003301233945001301266946001101279655001201290IND2050751820221118050703.0960411e199507  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205075182DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHitchcock, C.H.S.10aDetermination of hydrogen in irradiated frozen chicken  ap. 319-323.  a2019-12-05  aA headspace analyser based on a hydrogen-specific electronic sensor has been developed and applied to the determination of hydrogen in ice and in frozen chicken. The loss of hydrogen during storage of samples at -18 degrees C has been monitored; it has been demonstrated that the hydrogen generated during the irradiation of frozen chicken at 5 kGy can be determined for up to at least 6 months. It is concluded that hydrogen is a promising mariner for distinguishing between irradiated and unirradiated frozen food; it could provide a rapid screening test, complementing other chemical, physical and microbiological procedures. Positive detection of hydrogen provides conclusive evidence of irradiation; however, no definite conclusions can be drawn from a failure to detect hydrogen. 3achickens 3afood irradiation 3astorage quality 3ahydrogen 3afrozen meat 0asensors 0aanalysis0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1995 July, v. 68, no. 3 p.319-323x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL  a19960503b19960510c00000000  aINDdJFM  aNon-US 7aarticle02628naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245013200128300001600260500001500276520130300291650002501594650001601619650002301635650001001658650002901668650001901697650002401716650002001740650002001760650001701780650001701797650000901814650001301823650002201836650001701858650001001875653001601885653001101901653001101912653001101923700001801934700001701952773009901969852000902068930003302077945001302110946001102123655001202134IND2062180620221118050538.0980302s1991    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206218062DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohansson, L.10aEating quality and growth of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) on feed with different admixtures of leaf nutrient concentrate  ap. 217-234.  a2019-12-05  aThe effects, with regard to eating quality and to growth, of leaf nutrient concentrate (LNC in fish feed for rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss (Richardson)) were investigated in two consecutive studies. In the first study the admixture of LNC was made on an isocaloric basis, primarily by replacing a quantity of carbohydrates from the control feed. The control diet and two diets with 25% and 45% LNC, respectively, were administered for 4, 8 and 12 weeks. In the second study the LNC partly replaced protein and lipid from fish meal in the control feed. A control diet and two diets with 12.5% and 25% LNC, respectively, were administered for 16 weeks. The LNCs were obtained from lactic-acid-fermented green leaf juice mixtures. The effects of LNC in the feed indicated that: rainbow trout did not have a satisfactory growth on feed with 25% or 45% LNC incorporated whereas fish on 12.5% LNC in the feed did not differ from fish on the control feed; rainbow trout on LNC feed did not have the delicate acidulous taste characteristic of fresh rainbow trout; the muscle lipid level was reduced with increased LNC level of the feed; the relative level of monounsaturated fatty acids decreased whereas polyunsaturated fatty acids increased with an increased level of LNC, and saturated fatty acids. 3achemical composition 3afatty acids 3asensory evaluation 3afeeds 3aleaf protein concentrate 3aadipose tissue 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aMedicago sativa 3askeletal muscle 3aAvena sativa 3apalatability 3afish 3amixtures 3aBrassica oleracea 3afish feeding 3aodors 0aconsistency 0atastes 0alipids 0agrowth1 aKiessling, A.1 aCarlsson, R.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1991, v. 57, no. 2 p.217-234x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL  a19980401b19980408c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01913naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245009500129300001600224500001500240520062000255650001300875650001100888650001900899650004400918650001300962650001800975650001300993650002001006650000901026650001401035650001701049650001801066650001201084650001801096653001001114653001601124653005301140653003801193653002301231700001901254773010401273852000901377930003301386945001301419946001101432655001201443IND2061745320221118050629.0980209e199407  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206174532DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcCarthy, M.J.10aQuantifying transport phenomena in food processing with nuclear magnetic resonance imaging  ap. 257-270.  a2019-12-05  aNuclear magnetic resonance imaging is a spectroscopic technique capable of measuring food structure and transport phenomena occurring in foods and in simulated process equipment.

The inhibitors of amylase and trypsin in the extracts of germinating seeds of a pigeon pea cultivar (BDN2) were also studied. Nine trypsin inhibitor bands were detected in mature seeds of all the 12 cultivars. Inhibitory activities against amylase and trypsin were not detected in the extracts of seeds collected 11 and 27 days after flowering (DAF) by the enzyme-inhibitor assay. However, up to three trypsin inhibitor bands could be detected in the extracts of seeds collected 27 DAF by the gel-X-ray film contact technique. Two new slow-moving trypsin inhibitor bands were detected in the extracts of germinating seeds of BDN2 cultivar. These bands were prominent in extracts of seeds 10 days after germination (DAG). The amylase inhibitors and trypsin inhibitors in pigeon pea seeds are late synthesised proteins, their highest levels were observed in mature seeds and they were found to be slowly degraded during germination. Significant inhibitor activities were observed even 15 DAG.

High activity of beta-cyanoalanine synthase in all tissues indicated that the major pathway of cyanoglucoside turnover in cassava was by conversion to asparagine. 3acassava 3aenzyme activity 3ametabolism 3aenzymes 0atissues 0adistribution 0alinamarin1 aSundaresan, S.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1994 Dec., v. 66, no. 4 p.503-507x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL  a19950404b19950410c00000000  aINDdJFM  aNon-US 7aarticle01864naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245009400123300001600217520096500233650001001198650001501208650002601223651001001249653002101259653002001280700001401300700001601314700001301330700001301343773010401356852000901460930003301469945001301502946001101515655001201526IND2050773420221118050744.0960412e199510  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205077342DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanz, S.10aApplication of a statistical approach to the classification of honey by geographic origin  ap. 135-140.  aForty eight honeys from the La Rioja region of Spain were analysed to establish their quality. Fourteen legally required parameters of quality control were measured. Samples were obtained from two geographic areas of production: Valley and Sierra. These areas present different agroclimatic conditions and, thus, different flora. Classification of these honeys according to their geographic origin was achieved by applying multivariate statistical analysis to the chemical and physical data. Acidity (free acidity and pH), mineral content (electrical conductivity and ash) and factors related to degree of freshness (hydroxymethylfurfural and diastatic activity), were found to be the most important features for classification. Determination of the geographic origin of a La Rioja honey (Valley or Sierra) was possible with 83% accuracy using only these legally required quality control parameters; pollen studies were not necessary to achieve this objective. 3ahoney 3aprovenance 3adiscriminant analysis 3aSpain 0aquality controls 0afactor analysis1 aPerez, C.1 aHerrera, A.1 aSanz, M.1 aJuan, T.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1995 Oct., v. 69, no. 2 p.135-140x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL  a19960503b19960510c00000000  aINDdJFM  aNon-US 7aarticle02155naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245008500124300001600209520127500225650001401500650001601514650001401530650001701544650001601561650001101577653001601588653001301604700001401617700001601631773010401647852000901751930003301760945001301793946001101806655001201817IND2045067220221118050716.0950314e199412  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204506722DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Y.A.10aRapid determination of chlorophylls in vegetable oils by laser-based fluorometry  ap. 479-484.  aThe presence of chlorophylls in vegetable oils is considered undesirable due to their adverse eflects on oxidative deterioration, bleachability and hydrogenation. The usual methods for determination of chlorophylls in vegetable oils are absorption spectrophotometry, fluorometry and liquid chromatography using fluorescence detectors. This paper outlines a fluorometric method using a laser as the excitation source. The chlorophylls in crude palm oiL rapeseed oil, soya bean oil and olive oil were determined directly by laser-based fluorometry using (a) a helium-neon laser (632.8 nm, 5 mW) as the excitation source and an optical-multichannel analyser (OMA) with an intensified diode array as the detector, and (b) a helium-neon laser and a photomultiplier tube as the detector. The method is especially suitable for the detection of chlorophylls in crude palm oil since no pre-extraction step is required. The levels of chlorophylls measured in vegetable oils using the laser technique was also compared against values obtained by conventional spectrophotometric methods. The simplicity and rapid quantification of laser based fluorometry suggest that this technique can be readily applied to the detection of a wide variety of fluorescing species in vegetable oils. 3apalm oils 3asoybean oil 3aolive oil 3arapeseed oil 3achlorophyll 3alasers 0afluorimetry 0aanalysis1 aLow, K.S.1 aChong, C.L.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1994 Dec., v. 66, no. 4 p.479-484x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL  a19950404b19950410c00000000  aINDdJFM  aNon-US 7aarticle01874naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245012700128300001600255520099900271650001801270650001601288650002101304650001601325650002601341700001801367700001701385773010401402852000901506930003301515945001301548946001101561655001201572IND2045067520221118050651.0950314e199412  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204506752DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGodbole, S.A.10aChanges in protease inhibitory activity from pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan (L) Millsp) during seed development and germination  ap. 497-501.  aThe protease inhibitors from seeds of pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan (L) Millsp) have been studied for their physiological role. During seed development the inhibitor was detected even as early as 7 days after flowering (DAF). But the maximum amount accumulated between 14 and 28 DAF. During this period the seed accumulates a major portion of its proteins. During germination the inhibitor activity decreases from 6 days after germination up to 10 days. Accompanying this change there is a marked decrease in the amount of cotyledonary proteins. The inhibitor does not appear to be associated with the protein bodies. The endogenous protease from the seeds was identified as a serine protease and was not inhibited by the inhibitor. The inhibitor was earlier shown to be specific towards mammalian serine protease. Although the inhibitor did not inhibit the protease from Helicoverpa armigera larva as efficiently as soyabean trypsin inhibitor a defence role for the inhibitors cannot be ruled out. 3aCajanus cajan 3agermination 3aseed development 3aproteinases 3aproteinase inhibitors1 aKrishna, T.G.1 aBhatia, C.R.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1994 Dec., v. 66, no. 4 p.497-501x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL  a19950404b19950410c00000000  aINDdJFM  aNon-US 7aarticle01675naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001200110245013000122300001600252520074800268650001001016650001601026650001001042650001301052650001601065650001601081653002101097700001401118700002001132700001501152773010401167852000901271930003301280945001301313946001101326655001201337IND2045074520221118050657.0950315e199412  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204507452DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIhl, M.10aCorrelation for pigment content through colour determination using tristimulus values in a green leafy vegetable, Swiss Chard  ap. 527-531.  aThe relationship between colour parameters of the chlorophylls and carotenoids in the green leaves of Swiss chard was studied.

Wide variations in the total lipid content (40-510 g kg-1) and in the PUFA : SAFA ratio (0.3-3.8) were observed but the consumption of spices in general, and of certain varieties in particular, may provide a significant quantity of lipid having a beneficial fatty acid profile, together with some essential fatty acids. 3aspices 3afood composition 3asaturated fatty acids 3aunsaturated fatty acids 3aCameroon1 aGee, J.M.1 aKnight, D.J.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1994 Oct., v. 66, no. 2 p.213-216x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL  a19941208b19941215c00000000  aINDdDLB  aNon-US 7aarticle02442naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245013400128300001600262520158500278650000901863650001201872650001601884650001001900653002701910700001801937700001501955773010401970852000902074930003302083945001302116946001102129655001202140IND2048096620221118050637.0951004e199506  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204809662DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernandez, X.10aEffect of epinephrine administration on glycogen metabolism in red and white muscle of anaesthetized pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus)  ap. 231-239.  aThe glycogenolytic effect of exogenous epinephrine was studied in white (Longissimus) and red (Trapezius) muscle of anaesthetized pig. In addition, we assessed the metabolic action of epinephrine during the 3 h following the cessation of perfusion. Twelve purebred Large White pigs, averaging 80 kg liveweight, were used. The animals were anaesthetized and perfused (0-15 min) with 5 microgram kg-1 min-1 epinephrine or saline (control animals). Blood samples were taken to determine plasma levels of glucose, lactate and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA). Muscle samples were taken to determine the concentrations of glycogen and related metabolites, and the activity ratio of the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase. Control animals showed stable levels of plasma and muscle metabolites during the 3 h anaesthesia. However, the resting level of the activity ratio of phosphorylase was high (80%). Epinephrine treatment induced significant increases in plasma metabolites and an overall significant glycogen depletion. The extent of epinephrine-induced glycogenolysis was greater in the red Trapezius than in the white Longissimus muscle. This was associated with a greater rise in the muscle lactate content and in the activity ratio of phosphorylase in the Trapezius muscle during epinephrine administration. In both muscles, no significant glycogen depletion was observed during 3 h following the cessation of epinephrine administration. This occurred despite the fact that the activity ratio of phosphorylase remained high in the Longissimus muscle until the end of the experiment. 3apork 3amuscles 3aepinephrine 3aswine 0aglycogen phosphorylase1 aLevasseur, P.1 aEcolan, P.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1995 June, v. 68, no. 2 p.231-239x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL  a19951102b19951108c00000000  aINDdJFM  aNon-US 7aarticle01549naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245012200126300001600248520066100264650001100925650001700936650001600953650001200969650001000981700001600991700001501007700001501022700001601037773010401053852000901157930003301166945001301199946001101212655001201223IND2048096120221118050826.0951004e199506  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204809612DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanchez, A.14aThe effects of acidification and temperature during washing of Spanish-style green olives on the fermentation process  ap. 197-202.  aThe effects of temperature (22 and 40 degrees C) and acidification by HCl, H3PO(4) and fermentation brine during the washing step of Spanish-type green olive processing were studied. When acids were added to the washing waters, the diffusion rates of sugars and polyphenols from the flesh of olives to the surrounding liquid diminished. This phenomenon could be related to the pH of the washing water. Both heating and acidification during the washing step influenced later lactic acid fermentation and the final values of the combined acidity in brines. Thus, when the washing step was carried out at 40 degrees C the fermentation process was accelerated. 3aolives 3afermentation 3atemperature 3awashing 3awater1 aGarcía, P.1 aRejano, L.1 aBrenes, M.1 aGarrido, A.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1995 June, v. 68, no. 2 p.197-202x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL  a19951102b19951108c00000000  aINDdJFM  aNon-US 7aarticle02249naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245011800127300001600245520138800261650001201649650001001661650001501671650001501686650004301701653001401744700001901758773010401777852000901881930003301890945001301923946001101936655001201947IND2048096520221118050711.0951004e199506  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204809652DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKing, N.L.R.10aBitterness of cassava: identification of a new apiosyl glucoside and other compounds that affect its bitter taste  ap. 223-230.  aCompounds extracted by methanol from cassava parenchyma and cortex have been separated on a preparative HPLC column and identified by (1)H and (13)C NMR spectroscopy. A new compound isopropyl-beta-D-apiofuranosyl-(1 leads to 6)-beta-D-glucopyranoside (IAG, structure I) has been found as well as small amounts of phenylalanine and tryptophan. The composition of another HPLC fraction has not been elucidated. The amounts of the identified compounds and of linamarin, lotaustralin, citrate, malate and the various sugars present in cassava have been determined by HPLC methods. The threshold levels of bitterness of aqueous solutions of linamarin, lotaustralin and IAG, have been determined and together with published data on L-phenylalanine and L-tryptophan have allowed our evaluation of their contributions to the bitterness of cassava. Linamarin is the sole contributor in the parenchyma but (with two cultivars out of six studied) IAG contributes more to the bitterness of the cortex than does linamarin. The perception of bitterness of linamarin solutions is confounded in the presence of neutral citrate and malate which have a sour taste. These modify the taste of cassava tubers. There are many compounds that contribute to the taste of cassava tubers, hence it is not surprising that the bitterness of cassava is not always correlated positively with the cyanide potential. 3acassava 3ataste 3abitterness 3aglucosides 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 0alinamarin1 aBradbury, J.H.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1995 June, v. 68, no. 2 p.223-230x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL  a19951102b19951108c00000000  aINDdJFM  aNon-US 7aarticle01601naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002500145245010800170300001600278520052600294653004700820653001900867653001500886653002400901700002200925700002200947700002200969700001900991773012701010852000901137856008501146930003301231946001101264655001201275IND4432689620221118050732.0100213e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443268962DNAL7 a10.1007/s10517-010-0711-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aProskuryakova, T.

Although a wide variety of lipids from plants and marine animals was examined in this respect, we provide herein for the first time, experimental data that indicate that the marine unicellular alga Nannochloropsis can be efficiently used as a dietary source of the omega 3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid for pregnant and lactating dams.

Here, we show that APE1 is a target of the SIRTUIN1 (SIRT1) protein deacetylase. SIRT1 associates with APE1, and this association is increased with genotoxic stress. SIRT1 deacetylates APE1 in vitro and in vivo targeting lysines 6 and 7. Genotoxic insults stimulate lysine acetylation of APE1 which is antagonized by transcriptional upregulation of SIRT1. Knockdown of SIRT1 increases cellular abasic DNA content, sensitizing cells to death induced by genotoxic stress, and this vulnerability is rescued by overexpression of APE1. Activation of SIRT1 with resveratrol promotes binding of APE1 to the BER protein X-ray cross-complementing-1 (XRCC1), while inhibition of SIRT1 with nicotinamide (NAM) decreases this interaction. Genotoxic insult also increases binding of APE1 to XRCC1, and this increase is suppressed by NAM or knockdown of SIRT1. Finally, resveratrol increases APE activity in XRCC1-associated protein complexes, while NAM or knockdown of SIRT1 suppresses this DNA repair activity. These findings identify APE1 as a novel protein target of SIRT1, and suggest that SIRT1 plays a vital role in maintaining genomic integrity through regulation of the BER pathway.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA repair 3aX-radiation 3aacetylation 3acell death 3alysine 3amutagens 3anicotinamide 3aresveratrol 3atranscription (genetics)1 aDeRicco, Jeremy1 aNaqvi, Asma1 aHoffman, Timothy A.1 aMattagajasingh, Ilwola1 aKasuno, Kenji1 aJung, Saet-Byel1 aKim, Cuk-Seong1 aIrani, Kaikobad0 tNucleic acids research.g2010 Jan., v. 38, no. 3 p.832-845x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkp10393Available from publisher's Web site  a20100213b20100305c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02772naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092024002200121024001900143040001800162100002700180245008800207300001600295506007600311520128400387506003701671650001501708650001401723650001801737650002701755650001001782650001801792650002001810650002001830650003601850650003301886650001301919650002901932650003101961700002001992700002302012700002002035773008002055852000902135856007902144930003302223946001102256990002302267655001202290IND4432687920221207144929.0100213e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443268792DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkp10412doi7 aPMC28174642pmcid7 a199332562pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRajagopalan, Sridharan10aMechanistic differences in the transcriptional activation of p53 by 14-3-3 isoforms  ap. 893-906.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  ap53 maintains genome integrity by initiating the transcription of genes involved in cell-cycle arrest, senescence, apoptosis and DNA repair. The activity of p53 is regulated by both post-translational modifications and protein-protein interactions. p53 that has been phosphorylated at S366, S378 and T387 binds 14-3-3 proteins in vitro. Here, we show that these sites are potential 14-3-3 binding sites in vivo. Epsilon (ε) and gamma (γ) isoforms required phosphorylation at either of these sites for efficient interaction with p53, while for sigma (σ) and tau (τ) these sites are dispensable. Further, σ and τ bound more weakly to p53 C-terminal phosphopeptides than did ε and γ. However, the four isoforms bound tightly to di-phosphorylated p53 C-terminal peptides than did the mono-phosphorylated counterparts. Interestingly, all the isoforms studied transcriptionally activated wild-type p53. σ and τ stabilized p53 levels in cells, while ε and γ stimulated p53-DNA binding activity in vitro. Overall, the results suggest that structurally and functionally similar 14-3-3 isoforms may exert their regulatory potential on p53 through different mechanisms. We discuss the isoform-specific roles of 14-3-3 in p53 stabilization and activation of specific-DNA binding.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA repair 3aapoptosis 3abinding sites 3acell cycle checkpoints 3agenes 3anucleic acids 3aphosphopeptides 3aphosphorylation 3apost-translational modification 3aprotein-protein interactions 3aproteins 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptional activation1 aSade, Robert S.1 aTownsley, Fiona M.1 aFersht, Alan R.0 tNucleic acids research.g2010 Jan., v. 38, no. 3 p.893-906x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkp10413Available from publisher's Web site  a20100213b20100305c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02644naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100001800179245006300197300001800260506007600278520135600354506003701710650001001747650002201757650002001779650004401799650001601843650002501859650001501884650002001899700002201919700002401941700002101965700002301986773008202009852000902091856007802100930003302178946001102211655001202222IND4432686120221207144916.0100213e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443268612DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkp9622doi7 aPMC28174852pmcid7 a199201272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeddi, Brahim10aIntrinsic flexibility of B-DNA: the experimental TRX scale  ap. 1034-1047.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aB-DNA flexibility, crucial for DNA-protein recognition, is sequence dependent. Free DNA in solution would in principle be the best reference state to uncover the relation between base sequences and their intrinsic flexibility; however, this has long been hampered by a lack of suitable experimental data. We investigated this relationship by compiling and analyzing a large dataset of NMR ³¹P chemical shifts in solution. These measurements reflect the BI [leftright arrow] BII equilibrium in DNA, intimately correlated to helicoidal descriptors of the curvature, winding and groove dimensions. Comparing the ten complementary DNA dinucleotide steps indicates that some steps are much more flexible than others. This malleability is primarily controlled at the dinucleotide level, modulated by the tetranucleotide environment. Our analyses provide an experimental scale called TRX that quantifies the intrinsic flexibility of the ten dinucleotide steps in terms of Twist, Roll, and X-disp (base pair displacement). Applying the TRX scale to DNA sequences optimized for nucleosome formation reveals a 10 base-pair periodic alternation of stiff and flexible regions. Thus, DNA flexibility captured by the TRX scale is relevant to nucleosome formation, suggesting that this scale may be of general interest to better understand protein-DNA recognition.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aB-DNA 3acomplementary DNA 3adata collection 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3anucleosomes 3anucleotide sequences 3aphosphorus 3astable isotopes1 aOguey, Christophe1 aLavelle, Christophe1 aFoloppe, Nicolas1 aHartmann, Brigitte0 tNucleic acids research.g2010 Jan., v. 38, no. 3 p.1034-1047x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkp9623Available from publisher's Web site  a20100213b20100305c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01660naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002300110245007800133300001400211520084300225650001401068650002301082650001001105653001201115700001801127700002101145700002401166773010201190852000901292930003301301945001301334946001101347655001201358IND2045528020221118050836.0950411e199501  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204552802DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBruggen, P.C. van.10aRobust sensory evaluation of olive oil by a non-parametric scoring system  ap. 53-59.  aThe quality grade of an olive oil is attributed on the basis of a number of chemical and physical parameters, and, in accordance with EC rules, additionally by the sensory evaluation by a taste panel.

The rate of nitrogen application did not change the distribution of leaf into different standards. 3aCamellia sinensis 3atea 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aharvesting1 aOdhiambo, H.O.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1994 Dec., v. 66, no. 4 p.555-561x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL  a19950404b19950410c00000000  aINDdJFM  aNon-US 7aarticle02858naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245008800128300001300216520193400229650002002163650002102183650002102204650001102225651001302236653002502249653002302274700001902297700002202316700001502338773010102353852000902454930003302463945001302496946001102509655001202520IND2045527020221118050741.0950411e199501  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204552702DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPijls, L.T.J.10aCultivation, preparation and consumption of ensete (Ensete ventricosum) in Ethiopia  ap. 1-11.  aIn Ethiopia almost 10 million people are dependent on ensete (Ensete ventricosum (Welw) Cheesman), also known as 'false banana'. In the Gurage area in Central Ethiopia, agronomic and nutritional aspects of ensete were studied in 60 households in six villages. Ensete is propagated vegetatively and has a 6-year growing cycle during which it is transplanted three or four times. Men harvest the plants; women scrape the pseudo stem in order to separate the starchy pulp from the fibre, and pulverise the corm. The pulp is fermented and stored for up to 5-7 years in earthen pits. The yield of ensete food (ko'cho) was found to be 34kg per plant or 9.5 tons ha-1 per year. Compared with other foods grown in Ethiopia, the energy yield of ensete (6.1 MJ m-2 per year) was higher than that of all cereals, Irish potato, sweet potato and banana, but lower than that of cassava. The protein yield of ensete was higher (11.4 g m - 2 per year) than all of the crops mentioned above, except for banana and Irish potato. To make ensete bread, fermented pulp is squeezed to make it drier, chopped to shorten the fibres and a 2 cm layer is baked for 15 min. Unfermented freshly harvested corm is also eaten after boiling. All foods have a low protein content (4-22g kg-1). Bu'lla, white desiccated juice collected from the pulp, is more energy rich (8.5 MJ kg-1) than ko'cho (6.5 MJ kg-1) A dietary survey, conducted in 39 households comprising 237 persons, showed that the average daily intake of 0.55 kg ensete provided 68% Of total energy intake, 20% of protein, 28% of iron but no vitamin A. Energy intake from all food consumed was very low, being only 60% Of requirements, while protein intake at 107% was ample. Since ensete can be stored for years, is readily available throughout the year and can withstand dry periods, its cultivation can significantly improve household food security in highland areas prone to drought and famine. 3anutritive value 3afood preparation 3afood composition 3ayields 3aEthiopia 0aconsumption patterns 0aensete ventricosum1 aTimmer, A.A.M.1 aWolde-Gebriel, Z.1 aWest, C.E.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1995 Jan., v. 67, no. 1 p.1-11x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL  a19950501b19950505c00000000  aINDdJFM  aNon-US 7aarticle02358naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245009500124300001400219520154100233650002401774650001901798650001101817650001301828653002001841700001301861700001401874773010201888852000901990930003301999945001302032946001102045655001202056IND2045527720221118050708.0950411e199501  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204552772DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZotos, A.14aThe effect of frozen storage of mackerel (Scomber scombrus) on its quality when hot-smoked  ap. 43-48.  aWhole mackerel (Scomber scombrus) were frozen using a horizontal plate freezer, wrapped in plastic bags and frozen stored at -20 degrees C. At suitable intervals (11, 22 and 33 weeks) the fish were removed from the cold store and subsequently hot smoked (in gutted from) using an AFOS-Torry Mini Kiln. All smoked mackerel samples, despite their different previous histories, were assessed by the panellists as moderately acceptable products in terms of their texture and flavour, even after 33 weeks frozen storage prior to smoking. Protein denaturation, as related to salt-soluble protein, was influenced by the frozen storage history (24% drop after 33 weeks frozen storage) and seemed to be affected by the free amino acids formed during frozen storage. After smoking the denaturation was extensive (above 80%) in all mackerel samples. Lipid oxidation was quite extensive (PV 108 meq kg-1) in the 22 and 33 weeks frozen stored mackerel samples. However, no rancid flavour in the latter smoked mackerel samples was detected by taste panellists. A 58% increase in free amino acids during frozen storage was observed. Extensive losses of 74% in available lysine were observed in the 22 and 33 weeks frozen stored mackerel samples after smoking which could be due to aminocarbonyl reactions with the products of lipid oxidation. A 40% loss of thiamine was observed in the 33 weeks frozen stored samples after smoking. The histamine contents did not exceed 94 mg kg-1 and would not be expected to cause symptoms of scombrotoxin poisoning. 3aprotein composition 3afrozen storage 3alipids 3amackerel 0aheat processing1 aHole, M.1 aSmith, G.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1995 Jan., v. 67, no. 1 p.43-48x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL  a19950501b19950505c00000000  aINDdJFM  aNon-US 7aarticle01583naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245005500127300001600182520045900198650001900657650001700676650002000693650001100713650001900724650001300743650001100756650001800767650002800785650001500813650000900828650001300837650001700850650001600867650002300883653002300906653000900929653001100938700001800949773010400967852000901071930003301080945001301113946001101126655001201137IND2048473120221118050709.0951026e199502  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204847312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChurch, I.J.10aModified atmosphere packaging technology: a review  ap. 143-152.  aModified atmosphere packaging is becoming increasingly common.

Solubility of proteins in water, 0.6 M NaCl, 1.5 M urea, 8 M urea and 10 g litre-1 sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) decreased as drying progressed at all three temperatures; most of the decrease occurring in the initial 4 h of drying. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of 15 M urea, 8 M urea and SDS extracts showed that higher molecular weight (MW) protein fractions were more sensitive to drying and disappeared much earlier from electropherograms than the lower MW protein fractions. Residual solubility of proteins near the pH range of 4-6 was found to increase during drying, but solubility at acid and alkaline pH was adversely affected. Decrease of solubility by drying was more affected at acid pH, especially at higher temperatures than at alkaline pH. Sulphydryl groups registered a regular and sharp decrease with drying except at 50 degrees C, where initially an increase was observed. Apart from disulphide and hydrophobic bonds, free amino groups also appear to be involved in denaturation reactions during drying. Pepsin digestibility of fish muscle decreased slightly during drying but a clear relationship with drying temperature was not evident. Highly significant differences in proteins between protein efficiency ratio (PER), net protein utilisation (NPU) and biological value were observed between the drying temperatures. The PER and NPU of fish dried at 60 degrees C were significantly higher than those dried at 50 or 70 degrees C. 3adried fish 3aurea 3asulfhydryl groups 3aanimal proteins 3asolubility 3awater 3amolecular weight 3asodium chloride 3apH 3atemperature 3aduration 3adigestibility 3arats 3anutritive value 3amuscle tissues 3aair drying 3amarine fish 0aprotein utilization 0aprotein efficiency ratio 0ain vitro 0anempiterus japonicus 0anet protein utilization1 aSankar, T.V.1 aAmmu, K.1 aDevadasan, K.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1995 Feb., v. 67, no. 2 p.197-204x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL  a19951204b19951207c00000000  aINDdRAM  aNon-US 7aarticle02434naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245014500129300001600274520120400290650002001494650001101514650001101525650001001536650002201546650002301568650002301591650001901614650001001633650001801643650001601661650001101677650001501688650001601703650001301719650001101732653001401743653001201757700001701769700002001786773010401806852000901910930003301919945001301952946001101965655001201976IND2048477120221118050747.0951026e199502  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204847712DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuth, S.M. van10aChanges in flavour release from rehydrated diced bell peppers (Capsicum annuum) by artificial saliva components in three mouth model systems  ap. 189-196.  aThe effect of artificial saliva components on flavour release from rehydrated diced red bell peppers (Capsicum annuum) was studied in a mouth model system. This measured the dynamic headspace under oral conditions, such as temperature, volume of the mouth, salivation, and mastication (DHM). The results were compared with a dynamic headspace (DH) and a purge-and-trap (PT) model system. Volatile compounds were analysed by gas chromatography, using flame ionisation detection (FID), mass spectrometry (MS), and sniffing port detection (SPD). SPD revealed that only 12 of the 47 compounds identified by MS and FID possessed odour activity. For all saliva compositions FID peak areas of volatile compounds were largest in the PT system, followed by DHM and DH, respectively. In the PT system the less volatile compounds were relatively better released than other volatile compounds in comparison with the DHM and DH system, for all salivas. The saliva components mucin and alpha-amylase caused a relative decrease in release of the less volatile compounds in all model systems. An overall decrease in FID peak areas of volatile compounds by the latter components was observed in model system DH only. 3aCapsicum annuum 3asaliva 3aflavor 3amouth 3asimulation models 3avolatile compounds 3asensory evaluation 3adynamic models 3aodors 3aalpha-amylase 3atemperature 3avolume 3asalivation 3amastication 3aduration 3amucins 0aretention 0arelease1 aRoozen, J.P.1 aCozijnsen, J.L.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1995 Feb., v. 67, no. 2 p.189-196x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL  a19951204b19951207c00000000  aINDdRAM  aNon-US 7aarticle02243naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002300164245011200187300001600299500001500315520052500330650001900855650002300874650001200897650005200909650004500961650003201006650002501038650002601063650000901089650000901098650001701107650004001124650005301164653001701217653003001234653003301264700002001297700002101317700002001338700002501358700002401383700002001407700002101427773012701448852000901575856008501584930003301669946001101702655001201713IND4432694420221118050609.0100213e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443269442DNAL7 a203967352pmid7 a10.1007/s10517-010-0759-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTolstikova, T.

We show that shallow, macrophyte-rich lakes of the Mackenzie Delta, western Canadian Arctic, do not follow this pattern. These lakes are strong summertime CO₂ absorbers, despite DOC concentrations at or above levels commonly shown to produce CO₂ emission. Paradoxically, CO₂ levels were lowest where DOC was greatest, in lakes which appear to be annual net CO₂ absorbers, and have poor hydrologic connection to the terrestrial landscape. CO₂ in these lakes is depleted by high macrophyte productivity, and although catchment-derived C subsidies are low, within-lake DOC generation appears to occur as a byproduct of macrophyte photosynthesis and evapoconcentration. Additionally, after accounting for DOC and macrophytes, lakes that were least connected to the larger terrestrial landscape remained weaker CO₂ absorbers, suggesting that CO₂ balance may also be affected by DOC quality, foodweb structure, or inputs of pCO₂-rich riverwater to connected lakes. In contrast, a small subset of Delta lakes that were strongly affected by permafrost melting were CO₂ emitters, suggesting future permafrost degradation could engender a change in the overall CO₂ balance of these lakes from near-CO₂ neutral over the ice-free season, to clear CO₂ emission. Our work suggests that the current paradigm of lakewater CO₂ regulation may need to specifically incorporate shallow, productive lakes, and those that are poorly connected to their surrounding landscape. 3amacrophytes 3acarbon dioxide 3afood webs 3apermafrost 3alakes 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3alandscapes 3abyproducts 3adissolved organic carbon 3asubsidies 3amelting 3aphotosynthesis 3aCanada 3aArctic region 0aatmosphere1 aLesack, Lance F.

The reaction is catalyzed by lycopene β-cyclase (LCY-B), which converts lycopene into β-carotene, and by capsanthin-capsorubin synthase (CCS), which is mainly dedicated to the synthesis of κ-cyclic carotenoids (capsanthin and capsorubin) but also has LCY-B activity. Although the peptide sequences of plant LCY-Bs and CCS contain a putative dinucleotide-binding motif, it is believed that these two carotenoid cyclases proceed via protic activation and stabilization of resulting carbocation intermediates. Using pepper (Capsicum annuum) CCS as a prototypic carotenoid cyclase, we show that the monomeric protein contains one noncovalently bound flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) that is essential for enzyme activity only in the presence of NADPH, which functions as the FAD reductant. The reaction proceeds without transfer of hydrogen from the dinucleotide cofactors to β-carotene or capsanthin. Using site-directed mutagenesis, amino acids potentially involved in the protic activation were identified. Substitutions of alanine, lysine, and arginine for glutamate-295 in the conserved 293-FLEET-297 motif of pepper CCS or LCY-B abolish the formation of β-carotene and κ-cyclic carotenoids. We also found that mutations of the equivalent glutamate-196 located in the 194-LIEDT-198 domain of structurally divergent bacterial LCY-B abolish the formation of β-carotene. The data herein reveal plant carotenoid cyclases to be novel enzymes that combine characteristics of non-metal-assisted terpene cyclases with those attributes typically found in flavoenzymes that catalyze reactions, with no net redox, such as type 2 isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase. Thus, FAD in its reduced form could be implicated in the stabilization of the carbocation intermediate.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCapsicum annuum 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aalanine 3aarginine 3abeta-carotene 3abiosynthesis 3acapsanthin 3aenzyme activity 3aenzymes 3ahydrogen 3alycopene 3alysine 3apepper 3aproteins 3aredox potential 3asite-directed mutagenesis 2aAmino Acid Motifs 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBiocatalysis 2aCapsicumxenzymology 2aCarotenoidsxbiosynthesisxchemistry. 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aFlavin-Adenine Dinucleotidexmetabolism 2aFlavoproteinsxmetabolism 2aIntramolecular Lyasesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aKinetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aNADPxmetabolism 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aOxidoreductasesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolism.1 aHeintz, Dimitri1 aJadid, Nurul1 aNkeng, Paul1 aRahier, Alain1 aDeli, Jozsef1 aCamara, Bilal1 aBouvier, Florence0 tPlant physiology.g2010 July, v. 153, no. 3 p.970-979dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.110.1554403Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02298naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002000171245012800191300001600319500002400335520116400359650001001523650002101533650001001554650001001564650001201574650002401586650004301610650001101653650003101664650000901695650002401704700001501728773011701743852000901860856005501869655001201924IND4397970220221118050732.0071118e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439797022DNAL7 a180213562pmid7 a10.1111/j.1439-0264.2007.00787.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDepedrini, J.S.10aSystematization and Distribution of the Middle Cerebral Artery on the Brain Surface in Pampas Fox (Pseudalopex gymnocercus)  ap. 453-459.  aIncludes references  aThe present study has analysed 30 pampas fox brains (Pseudalopex gymnocercus), injected with latex, aiming to systematize and describe the distribution and vascularization territories of the middle cerebral artery. After being originated from the rostral branch of the internal carotid artery this vessel formed the following collateral branches: rostral choroidal artery, rostral and caudal central branches and cortical branches. Before crossing the lateral rhinal sulcus, the common trunk of the middle cerebral artery frequently bifurcated in a rostral and a caudal branch. In a smaller amount, the common trunk did not show any bifurcation, ramifying in arborescence. The vascular territory of the pampas fox middle cerebral artery included the lateral cerebral fossa, the lateral third of the olfactory trigone, the two rostral thirds of the piriform lobe, the lateral olfactory tract and most of the convex surface of the cerebral hemisphere, except for the more rostromedial areas of the frontal lobe bordering the endomarginal sulcus in the parietal and occipital lobes as well as the transverse fissure at the caudal pole of the cerebral hemisphere. 3abrain 3acarotid arteries 3afoxes 3alatex 2aAnimals 2aBrainxblood supply 2aCerebral Arteriesxanatomy & histology 2aFemale 2aFoxesxanatomy & histology 2aMale 2aSpecies Specificity1 aCampos, R.0 tAnatomia, histologia, embryologia.g2007 Dec., v. 36, no. 6 p.453-459dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0340-20967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0264.2007.00787.x 7aarticle01751naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002400142245007500166300001600241500002400257520079000281650001401071650001801085650003101103650001201134650001101146650001501157650001801172650001101190650001901201650002301220700001801243773008601261852000901347856004501356655001201401IND4414240720090207003919.0081226e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441424072DNAL7 a10.1002/star.2008007112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLockwood, Stephanie10aAmino Acid Additives Effects on Sweet Potato Starch Thermal Properties  ap. 690-695.  aIncludes references  aThis study assessed the effects of amino acid additives, aspartic acid, leucine, lysine, and methionine, on the thermal characteristics of white-fleshed and orange-fleshed Beauregard sweet potato starches.

Lysine increased the gelatinization temperature of the OFSPS. The addition of leucine, aspartic acid, and methionine had no apparent impact on the OFSPS.

We investigated the effect of menthol on the plant membrane potential to search for analogies between animal and plant perception systems. The study was conducted on the liverwort Conocephalum conicum- a non-vascular plant generating action potentials (APs) in response to different stimuli including cold. (+)Menthol, (−)menthol and (+/−)menthol induced one or more APs, depending on the concentration. In contrast to animal reactions to menthol, threshold concentrations of these isomers were the same (1 mM). The presence of menthol in medium shortened cold-induced APs, whereas low temperature prolonged the repolarization phase of AP evoked by menthol. Cells of C. conicum with anion and potassium channels blocked by anthracene-9-carboxylic acid (A9C) and tetraethylammonium chloride (TEACl) generate short spike-like voltage transients (VTs) in response to cold and light stimulation. Membrane potential changes evoked by menthol in A9C- and TEACl-treated plants differed significantly from VTs - lasted much longer and frequently occurred in series. 5 mM LaCl₃, 1 mM EGTA (ethylene glycol-bis(2-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid) (0 Ca²⁺) but not 0.2 mM verapamil blocked the putative calcium component of AP induced by menthol. Similar inhibitory effect was observed after the application of proton pump inhibitors: 0.05 mM N,N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD), 0.05 mM diethylstilbestrol (DES) or 0.01 mM carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP). Our results indicate that cold and menthol act independently, activating different membrane transporters in C. conicum cells. 3apotassium channels 3atemperature 3aaction potentials 3acalcium 3areceptors 3aisomers 3averapamil 3aanions 3amenthol 3amosses and liverworts 3adiethylstilbestrol 3aproton pump 3acold 3aethylene glycol tetraacetic acid 2aAction Potentialsxdrug effects 2aCalciumxpharmacology 2aCold Temperature 2aHepatophytaxcytologyxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aMembrane Potentialsxdrug effects 2aMembrane Transport Modulatorsxpharmacology 2aMentholxpharmacology 2aPlant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aProton Pump Inhibitors 2aProton Pumpsxmetabolism 2aReference Standards 2aTime Factors 0atransporters1 aTrebacz, Kazimierz0 tPhysiologia plantarum.g2011 Apr., v. 141, no. 4 p.352-360dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0031-93177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1399-3054.2011.01446.x 7aarticle03558naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100002100181245010800202300001800310500002400328500001500352506007600367520135600443506003701799650002701836650003001863650003101893650002601924650001001950650001201960650001901972650002901991650002702020650002102047650002402068650004202092650004602134650005402180650002702234650003002261650001802291650005402309650003702363650005502400650002802455650003202483650002002515650002702535653001302562700001702575700001902592700002102611700001702632773013402649852000902783856008002792856004802872655001202920IND4385160620221207143659.0061112e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438516062DNAL7 a169979842pmid7 aPMC16361972pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.01528-062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKikuchi, Yoshimi10aFunctional Analysis of the Twin-Arginine Translocation Pathway in Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 13869  ap. 7183-7192.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCompared to those of other gram-positive bacteria, the genetic structure of the Corynebacterium glutamicum Tat system is unique in that it contains the tatE gene in addition to tatA, tatB, and tatC. The tatE homologue has been detected only in the genomes of gram-negative enterobacteria. To assess the function of the C. glutamicum Tat pathway, we cloned the tatA, tatB, tatC, and tatE genes from C. glutamicum ATCC 13869 and constructed mutants carrying deletions of each tat gene or of both the tatA and tatE genes. Using green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused with the twin-arginine signal peptide of the Escherichia coli TorA protein, we demonstrated that the minimal functional Tat system required TatA and TatC. TatA and TatE provide overlapping function. Unlike the TatB proteins from gram-negative bacteria, C. glutamicum TatB was dispensable for Tat function, although it was required for maximal efficiency of secretion. The signal peptide sequence of the isomaltodextranase (IMD) of Arthrobacter globiformis contains a twin-arginine motif. We showed that both IMD and GFP fused with the signal peptide of IMD were secreted via the C. glutamicum Tat pathway. These observations indicate that IMD is a bona fide Tat substrate and imply great potential of the C. glutamicum Tat system for industrial production of heterologous folded proteins.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGram-negative bacteria 3agreen fluorescent protein 3aCorynebacterium glutamicum 3aproduction technology 3agenes 3amutants 3asignal peptide 3aArthrobacter globiformis 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aEscherichia coli 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArthrobacterxenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCorynebacterium glutamicumxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDextranasexmetabolism 2aEscherichia coli Proteins 2aGene Deletion 2aGreen Fluorescent Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aIndustrial Microbiologyxmethods 2aMembrane Transport Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPolysaccharidesxmetabolism 2aProtein Folding 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 0aproteins1 aDate, Masayo1 aItaya, Hiroshi1 aMatsui, Kazuhiko1 aWu, Long-Fei0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2006 Nov., v. 72, no. 11 p.7183-7192dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.01528-063Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aem.asm.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml 7aarticle02313naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001600149245013900165300001800304500001500322520083900337650002201176650002101198650002001219650001401239650001301253650001201266650003001278650001601308650002001324650002301344650003001367650002501397650003501422650003101457650002601488650003801514650003101552650001301583653002401596700001801620700001701638700001501655773008401670852000901754939003301763946001101796655001201807IND9301221120221118050708.0930301e19920511xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930122112DNAL7 a13175492pmid7 aPMC3123402pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMetzger, M.10aSite-directed and transposon-mediated mutagenesis with pfd-plasmids by electroporation of Erwinia amylovora and Escherichia coli cells  ap. 2265-2270.  a2019-12-05  aThe suicide plasmid pfdA31-Tn5 was constructed to mutagenize Erwinia amylovora and Escherichia coli strains by electroporation.

Electroporation of E. amylovora or E. coli cells with plasmid pfdA31-Tn5 yielded more than 104 transposition events per microgram DNA. We have produced and characterized transposon mutants of E. amylovora affecting either galactose metabolism or the synthesis of the phytotoxin (L)-2,5-dihydrophenylalanine. A Tn5-insertion in a gene, involved in exopolysaccharide synthesis of E. amylovora strain Ea7/74, was subcloned into vector pfdA31 and used to mutagenize E. amylovora strain Ea1/79 by site-directed recombination. 3aErwinia amylovora 3aEscherichia coli 3arecombinant DNA 3agalactose 3aplasmids 3amutants 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3atransposons 3aelectroporation 2aBlotting, Southern 2aDNA Transposable Elements 2aElectric Stimulation 2aErwiniaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aGalactosexmetabolism 2aMutagenesis, Insertionalxmethods 2aMutagenesis, Site-Directed 2aPlasmids 0agenetic engineering1 aBellemann, P.1 aSchwartz, T.1 aGeider, K.0 tNucleic acids research.g1992 May 11, v. 20, no. 9 p.2265-2270x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02776naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245009200127300001300219500002400232520186800256650001202124650001102136650001502147650001002162650001302172650001502185650001302200650002602213650001802239650000902257650002202266700001602288700001602304773009702320852000902417655001202426IND4364628020221118050423.0040922e200410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436462802DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMilroy, S.P.10aRow configuration in rainfed cotton systems: modification of the OZCOT simulation model  ap. 1-16.  aIncludes references  aOver the last 10 years, there has been a rapid expansion of rainfed cotton production in Australia. The majority of this area has used "skip row" configurations in which certain rows in the crop are not sown with the aim of providing a slowly available supply of soil moisture during periods of low rainfall. In the past, the OZCOT cotton crop simulation model has been used with long-term climate records to assess the impact of different management strategies for irrigated cotton production and to study the prospects for rainfed cotton production in the major cotton growing regions. In this paper, we present modifications made to OZCOT to better accommodate skip row. First, a simple procedure previously used to approximate light interception of row crops was assessed for its ability to enhance the capability of OZCOT to simulate skip row configurations and second, a modification to allow for the possibility that water in the skip is not as freely available as the water in the plant row was also explored. Including modifications to allow for differences in soil water extraction significantly improved predictions of crop yield for cotton in skip row configurations across a number of locations in the Eastern Australian cotton producing regions, but modifications to account for light interception in row configurations reduced the ability of the model to simulate skip row cotton yields. The modified model gave reasonable predictions of yield for solid planted and skip row crops. The performance was within the range of results published for solid planted crops over a range of nitrogen and irrigation treatments and planting dates. The model's simulation of skip row yields when compared to solid planted crops grown under the same conditions, reflected the relationships seen in the measured data and those published in the industry literature. 3aclimate 3acotton 3acrop yield 3acrops 3aindustry 3airrigation 3anitrogen 3aplant available water 3aplanting date 3arain 3asimulation models1 aBange, M.P.1 aHearn, A.B.0 tAgricultural systems.g2004 Oct., v. 82, no. 1 p.1-16dElsevier Science Ltdx0308-521X7nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02291naa a2200493 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002400133245009400157300001600251300003000267520081200297650002301109650001301132650002301145650002101168650003201189650002201221650002801243650002701271650001301298650002001311650001101331650002001342650003901362650002501401650002501426650003201451653001901483653002301502653002701525653002701552700002301579700002501602773009501627852000901722930003301731945000801764946001301772655001201785991628044540742620221118050618.0810715e198105  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI810014212DNAL7 a67860742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZlotkin, Stanley H.10aCysteine supplementation to cysteine-free intravenous feeding regimens in newborn infants  ap. 914-923.  ap. 914-923. ill., charts.  aGrowth, nitrogen balance, plasma sulfur amino acids and urinary amino acid excretion were measured in intravenously-fed newborns in which cysteine was or was not present in the infusion regimen which otherwise included all essential nutrients. Cysteine supplementation had no observable effect on nitrogen retention, weight gain, length or head circumference in these infants. Although plasma 1/2 cystine concentration increased by 60% and urinary excretion of 1/2 cystine and taurine increased 3-fold in supplemented newborns, cysteine additions had no effect on plasma methionine and taurine, nor on urinary methionine or cystathionine. The small increase in 3-methylhistidine excretion seen in cysteine-supplemented infants suggests, however, that muscle mass or muscle protein catabolism may be altered. 3aprotein metabolism 3aneonates 3aparenteral feeding 3anitrogen balance 3aanthropometric measurements 3ahematologic tests 2aAmino Acidsxmetabolism 2aAmino Acids, Essential 2aCysteine 2aGestational Age 2aHumans 2aInfant, Newborn 2aInfant, Newborn, Diseasesxtherapy 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aParenteral Nutrition 2aParenteral Nutrition, Total 0aurine analysis 0anitrogen retention 0aAmino acids metabolism 0aSupplements (Nutrient)1 aBryan, M.

During this time, New Zealand wheat containing 11 ng/g selenium was blended with Australian wheat with a much higher selenium content (150 ng/g). Blood selenium levels of South Island New Zealanders, however, did not change from minimum levels. Since the South Island produces over 90% of the New Zealand wheat crop, Australian wheat is not imported there, explaining the lower selenium levels of South Islanders. Thus, dietary selenium intakes in the North Island were apparently significantly increased by the importation of a single food commodity. 3aselenium 3anutrient intake 3awheat 3adiet 3alongitudinal studies 3anutritional status 3ahematologic tests 2aAdult 2aDiet 2aHumans 2aSeleniumxblood 2aTriticum 3aNew Zealand 0aAustralia 0aNew Zealand 0aFood imports 0aTime factors0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1981 May, v. 34, no. 5 p.936-942x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a20050114b00000000c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02616naa a2200577 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002600133245011800159300001600277300002900293520097200322650001901294650001501313650002501328650001401353650002001367650002501387650003501412650002401447650002301471650001501494650001001509650000901519650002901528650001101557650003301568650001101601650001401612650001401626650002201640650002601662651001101688651001201699651001101711653002801722700002401750700002001774700002601794700002401820700002401844773009501868852000901963939003301972945000802005946001302013655001202026991628044410742620221118050750.0810715e198105  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI810014232DNAL7 a72347182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBates, Christopher J.10aRiboflavin status in Gambian pregnant and lactating women and its implications for Recommended Dietary Allowances  ap. 928-935.  ap. 928-935. ill., chart.  aDietary riboflavin intake and riboflavin status were determined in 156 pregnant and lactating Gambian women and compared to 59 pregnant and lactating English women. Mean daily intakes were 0.5 mg and 2.3 mg for the Gambian and English subjects, respectively. Riboflavin status, as indicated by an erythrocyte glutathione reductase activation coefficient, was 1.78 and 1.19 in the two groups, respectively. Longitudinal study of the Gambian women for up to 19 months indicated that biochemical riboflavin status markedly declined near childbirth. Thus, riboflavin deficiency was characteristic of the Gambian population, and a dietary vitamin supplement was given to lactating mothers for 8 months. Supplementation raised mean riboflavin intake to 1.5 mg/day and reduced the mean activation coefficient to 1.42. Riboflavin intake greater than UK or US RDAs are therefore indicated for these women exposed to the nutritional stresses imposed by pregnancy and lactation. 3apregnant women 3ariboflavin 3avitamin deficiencies 3alactation 3anutrient intake 3alongitudinal studies 3aRecommended Dietary Allowances 3adietary supplements 3anutritional status 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aDiet 2aErythrocytesxenzymology 2aFemale 2aGlutathione Reductasexblood 2aHumans 2aLactation 2aPregnancy 2aRiboflavinxblood 2aRiboflavin Deficiency 3aGambia 3aEngland 0aGambia 0aPregnancy and nutrition1 aPrentice, Andrew M.1 aPaul, Alison A.1 aSutcliffe, Barbara A.1 aWatkinson, Michael.1 aWhitehead, Roger G.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1981 May, v. 34, no. 5 p.928-935x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19810715c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02305naa a2200505 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002000133245004300153300001400196300003400210520087900244650002101123650002101144650002101165650001401186650002001200650001001220650001201230650004001242650001101282650001801293650001101311650001501322650003501337650004801372650000901420650001601429650004801445653002101493653002601514653002101540700002301561700002001584700002601604773009401630852000901724939003301733945000801766946001301774655001201787991628044250742620221118050642.0810511e198101  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI810010052DNAL7 a68937872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReasoner, John.10aClinical studies with low-lactose milk  ap. 54-60.  ap. 54-60. ill., charts, form.  aA low-lactose milk produced milder pain and gas symptoms in 9 milk-intolerant subjects during a double-blind control clinical study.

However, the possibilities are drastically impaired if the stored data is unreliable. During a project aiming to predict splice sites in the dicot Arabidopsis thaliana, we extracted a data set from the A.thaliana entries in GenBank. A number of simple 'sanity' checks, based on the nature of the data, revealed an alarmingly high error rate. More than 15% of the most important entries extracted did contain erroneous information. In addition, a number of entries had directly conflicting assignments of exons and introns, not stemming from alternative splicing. In a few cases the errors are due to mere typographical misprints, which may be corrected by comparison to the original papers, but errors caused by wrong assignments of splice sites from experimental data are the most common. It is proposed that the level of error correction should be increased and that gene structure sanity checks should be incorporated--also at the submitter level--to avoid or reduce the problem in the future. A non-redundant and error corrected subset of the data for A.thaliana is made available through anonymous FTP. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3anucleotide sequences 3adatabases 3aalternative splicing 3adata analysis 3areliability 2aAlgorithms 2aArabidopsisxgenetics 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA, Plantxgenetics 2aDatabases, Factual 2aGenome, Plant 2aIntrons 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNeural Networks, Computer. 2aRNA Splicingxgenetics 0aerrors 0aevaluation1 aHebsgaard, S.M.1 aRouze, P.1 aBrunak, S.0 tNucleic acids research.g1996 Jan. 15, v. 24, no. 2 p.316-320x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL  a19970602b19970606c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02863naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001500149245013200164300001600296520126900312650001301581650001301594650001001607650002501617650002901642650001201671650001801683650001301701650002301714650002801737650003001765650002401795650003001819650002901849650003901878650003901917650003601956650002701992653001502019653002302034653001902057653003402076653002802110653001602138700001702154700001402171773008302185852000902268939003302277946001102310655001202321IND9102805420221118050744.0910710e19910211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910280542DNAL7 a20115222pmid7 aPMC3336372pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoller, E.14aThe promoter of the chicken alpha 2(VI) collagen gene has features characteristic of house-keeping genes and of proto-oncogenes  ap. 485-491.  aThe promoter of the chicken alpha-2(VI) collagen gene reveals several interesting features characteristic of house-keeping genes and growth control related genes. It does not possess a typical TATAA or CAAT box, but it contains several potential binding sites for transcription factors Sp1 and ETF. The 5' flanking region of the gene forms a typical 'CpG island' where the dinucleotide sequence CpG occurs with high frequency relative to the bulk genome. Consistent with the lack of a TATAA element, the gene contains multiple transcription initiation sites distributed over 75 bp of genomic DNA. A short DNA fragment (207 bp) encompassing all the transcription initiation sites and the entire CpG island shows strong promoter activity when linked to a heterologous reporter gene. The upstream region of the promoter harbours a long homopurine/homopyrimidine element (403 bp) which is sensitive to endonuclease S1. This element might have the ability to adopt an intramolecular hairpin triplex structure and could play a role in the organization of the chromatin at the alpha-2(VI) collagen locus. Our results demonstrate that the structure of the alpha-2(VI) collagen promoter is completely different from that of any other collagen promoter characterized so far. 3achickens 3acollagen 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3atranscription (genetics) 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aChickens 2aCollagenxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNucleic Acid Conformation 2aOncogenesxgenetics 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aRNA, Messengerxgenetics 2aRegulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid 2aRepetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid 2aStructure-Activity Relationship 2aTranscription, Genetic 0ainitiation 0agenetic regulation 0apromoter genes 0atranscription initiation site 0amolecular sequence data 0aembl/x565951 aHayman, A.R.1 aTrueb, B.0 tNucleic acids research.g1991 Feb. 11, v. 19, no. 3 p.485-491x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02014naa a2200421 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002600133245007000159300001600229300003000245500001500275520079200290650001701082650003001099650001301129650002801142650003001170650001701200650000901217650001201226650001101238650003501249650002601284650003001310650004201340653001801382700002101400773009601421852000901517939003301526945000801559946001301567655001201580991628043580742620221118050749.0810430e198104  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI810009592DNAL7 a67845682pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRobins-Browne, Roy M.14aThe fate of ingested lactobacilli in the proximal small intestine  ap. 514-519.  ap. 514-519. ill., charts.  a2019-12-05  aExtract: A freeze-dried commercial preparation of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus (Lactinex) dissolved in skim milk was ingested by four nonfasting and seven fasting volunteers. Samples of jejunal fluid withdrawn from the volunteers at varying intervals were cultured for lactobacilli on a selective medium. In general, it was shown that lactobacilli entered the small intestine and persisted in elevated numbers for about 3 h in fasting subjects and for up to 6 h in nonfasting individuals. By 4 hr, counts in fasting volunteers had returned to base-line levels. Although both Lactobacillus species in Lactinex entered the intestine in approximately equal numbers, L. acidophilus was recovered from more samples and in slightly greater numbers than L. bulgaricus. 3afood beliefs 3aintestinal microorganisms 3adiarrhea 3agastrointestinal system 3aLactobacillus acidophilus 3adiet therapy 2aDiet 2aFasting 2aHumans 2aIntestine, Smallxmicrobiology 2aJejunumxmicrobiology 2aLactobacillusxphysiology 2aLactobacillus acidophilusxphysiology 0aLactobacillus1 aLevine, Myron M.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1981 Apr., v. 34, no. 4 p.514-519x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19810430c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02727naa a2200601 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002200133245009400155300001600249300002400265520108500289650002001374650002001394650001401414650001401428650002501442650002601467650003201493650001501525650001001540650002501550650001001575650004601585650002101631650002101652650001801673650001101691650001101702650001101713650000901724650001201733650002401745650001601769651000901785651000901794653001101803653002401814700002101838700002801859700002401887700002001911700002301931773009601954852000902050939003302059945000802092946001302100655001202113991628043450742620221118050740.0810430e198104  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI810009622DNAL7 a72237042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGraham, George G.10aDeterminants of growth among poor children: Nutrient intake-achieved growth relationships  ap. 539-554.  ap. 539-554. charts.  aExtract: Seven-day individual weighed dietary intakes and anthropometric measurements were determined in 123 children, 2 to 19 yr of age, from 26 poor families in Lima. Statistical analyses identified common sources of nutrients and greater dependence of intakes on body size than on age. Analysis for sex identified different nutrient-growth correlations. Analysis identified percentage protein from animal sources and percentage fat calories as having significant correlations with achieved growth. In males, analysis identified percentage protein from animal sources and beta-carotene intakes as strongly associated with achieved height and weight, and percentage fat calories as strongly associated with weight quotient/height quotient ratios. In females the correlations were not as strong. The very strong association of animal protein intake with male height, despite seemingly generous total protein intakes, is difficult to reconcile with current recommendations. The possible role of vitamin A (as beta-carotene) has potentially important implications for food policies. 3adietary surveys 3anutrient intake 3acarotenes 3avitamin A 3astatistical analysis 3alow income households 3aanthropometric measurements 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aChild 2aChild Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aChild, Preschool 2aDietary Proteins 2aEnergy Intake 2aFemale 2aGrowth 2aHumans 2aMale 2aPoverty 2aRegression Analysis 2aSex Factors 3aPeru 0aPeru 0agrowth 0adisadvantaged youth1 aCreed, Hilary M.1 aMacLean, William C.

Children from six better off families had significantly higher calorie and total protein intakes and higher intakes of animal protein, fat, calcium, carotene, riboflavin, and vitamin C. When macronutrient intakes were expressed as percentages of recommended calorie intakes, all of the increase in total protein intake was due to animal protein, vegetable protein remaining constant. Almost all of the increase in adequacy of total calories was due to increasing fat intakes, relatively much less to carbohydrate, and this only among the poor families. In this population, as more money becomes available to purchase food, there is an increase in animal protein and fat intakes, over an almost constant vegetable protein and carbohydrate intake. There is a simultaneous increase in consumption of fruits and vegetables, accounting for increases in the carotene and vitamin C intakes. 3anutrient intake 3adietary surveys 3anutritional adequacy 3alow income households 2aAdolescent 2aChild 2aChild Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aChild, Preschool 2aDietary Proteins 2aEnergy Intake 2aFoodxeconomics 2aGrowth 2aHumans 2aPoverty 2aSex Factors 3aPeru 0aPeru 0adisadvantaged youth 0aFood economics and consumption 0aSocioeconomic influences1 aCreed, Hilary M.1 aMacLean, William C.

This allowed us for the first time to analyze the mode of cell wall growth in Archaea by subculturing stained cells. The data obtained show that incorporation of new cell wall material in Archaea follows the pattern observed for BACTERIA: in the coccoid species Pyrococcus furiosus incorporation was in the region of septum formation while for the rod-shaped species Methanopyrus kandleri and Methanothermus sociabilis, a diffuse incorporation of cell wall material over the cell length was observed. Cell surface appendages like fimbriae/pili, fibers, or flagella were detectable by fluorescence staining only in a very few cases although their presence was proven by electron microscopy. Our data in addition prove that Alexa Fluor dyes can be used for in situ analyses at temperatures up to 100°C.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPyrococcus 3abacteria 3acell growth 3acell walls 3aelectron microscopy 3aesters 3afimbriae 3aflagellum 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3atemperature1 aBellack, Annett1 aBertl, Markus1 aBilek, Yvonne1 aHeimerl, Thomas1 aHerzog, Bastian1 aLeisner, Madeleine1 aProbst, Alexander1 aRachel, Reinhard1 aSarbu, Christina1 aSchopf, Simone1 aWanner, Gerhard0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2011 Mar. 1, v. 77, no. 5 p.1556-1562dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.02423-103Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle06020naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001800141245019500159300001600354520401000370650002204380650001304402650001204415650002304427650002004450650001704470650001104487650002604498650001804524650001004542650001804552650002204570650002004592650002604612650002104638650001704659650002704676650002704703650002804730650001204758650002404770650001904794650001404813650001304827650001104840650002704851650001504878650001604893650002704909650001904936650001604955650001704971650002104988650003605009650002305045700001405068700001405082700001405096773006505110852000905175856008105184930003305265945001305298946001105311655001205322IND2197464120221118050718.0990310e199810  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219746412DNAL7 a10.1007/s0042500504152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorcuende, R.10aSucrose-feeding leads to increased rates of nitrate assimilation, increased rates of alpha-oxoglutarate synthesis, and increased synthesis of a wide spectrum of amino acids in tobacco leaves  ap. 394-409.  aTo investigate the importance of the sugar supply for the regulation of nitrogen and organic acid metabolism, various sugars and nitrogenous compounds were supplied for 8 h to detached tobacco leaves in low light. (i) In control leaves supplied with water, there was a large decrease of the Nia transcript level, a 50% decline of nitrate reductase (NR) activity, starch increased and sugars remained low, nitrate decreased by 50%, and amino acids increased only slightly during the 8 h incubation. About half of the nitrogen accumulating in amino acids was present in glutamine (Gln). (ii) When 25 mM sucrose was supplied, the in-vivo rate of nitrate assimilation (estimated from the accumulation of ammonium and amino acids) increased 2-fold. The Nia transcript level still decreased, but the decline of NR activity was less pronounced and NR activation was increased. The in-vivo net rate of ammonium assimilation (estimated from the accumulation of amino acids) also doubled after feeding sucrose. Ammonium and glutamate (Glu) decreased and Gln rose markedly, showing that in-vivo activity of glutamine synthetase had been stimulated. Glutamine still accounted for about half of the nitrogen, indicating that sucrose does not selectively stimulate glutamine synthase. Glutamate and aspartate decreased and all the minor amino acids increased, showing that the amino acid biosynthesis pathways are activated by sucrose. There was a decrease of 3-phosphoglycerate (3PGA) and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and a large increase of alpha-oxoglutarate, showing that the flow of carbon from glycolysis into organic acids has been stimulated by sucrose. (iii) The changes of 3PGA, PEP, alpha-oxoglutarate, Glu, aspartate and the minor amino acids were smaller when 50 mM glucose was supplied, even though the internal levels of sugars at the end of the incubation resembled those found after feeding 25 mM sucrose. This indicates that the signals that regulate nitrogen and respiratory metabolism are derived from the uptake or metabolism of sucrose, rather than glucose. (iv) A different spectrum of changes was found when 20 mM nitrate was supplied. The estimated rate of nitrate assimilation increased 2-fold, and this was accompanied by an increase of NR activity but not of NR activation. Nitrate-feeding did not lead to a decrease of Glu, and the increase of minor amino acids was slightly smaller than with sucrose. There was a decrease of sugars, starch, and hexose phosphates, but 3PGA and PEP were not significantly decreased and isocitrate increased instead of alpha-oxoglutarate. (v) A different spectrum of changes was also found when 10 mM Gln was supplied. The estimated rate of nitrate assimilation decreased, and this was accompanied by a decrease of NR activity and NR activation. Glutamate did not decrease, and the increase of minor amino acids was smaller than with sucrose. Starch and sugars remained high and, although hexose phosphates decreased, 3PGA and PEP were not significantly decreased. Isocitrate remained unaltered and the increase of alpha-oxoglutarate was smaller than after supplying sucrose. (vi) When 25 mM sucrose was added together with 20 mM nitrate or 10 mM Gln, the effect on NR activity, NR activation and the estimated rate of nitrate assimilation was additive to the effect of nitrate, and antagonistic to the effect of Gln. Sucrose still led to a decrease of Glu, an increase of the minor amino acids, a decrease of 3PGA and PEP, and an increase of alpha-oxoglutarate when it was supplied together with nitrate or Gln. (vii) It is concluded that sucrose initiates a co-ordinate activation of nitrate assimilation, ammonium assimilation, amino acid biosynthesis, and alpha-oxoglutarate synthesis. Sucrose acts in concert with nitrate and antagonistically to Gln to increase NR activity and nitrate assimilation, and complements the action of nitrate and Gln to increase the flow of nitrogen from ammonium into amino acids, and to increase alpha-oxoglutarate formation. 3aNicotiana tabacum 3anitrates 3asucrose 3anutrient solutions 3anutrient uptake 3abiosynthesis 3aleaves 3aamino acid metabolism 3aglutaric acid 3agenes 3amessenger RNA 3anitrate reductase 3aenzyme activity 3aquantitative analysis 3anitrogen content 3apyruvic acid 3a3-phosphoglyceric acid 3aaspartate transaminase 3aglutamate decarboxylase 3aglucose 3anitrogen metabolism 3aisocitric acid 3aglutamine 3afructose 3astarch 3a2-phosphoglyceric acid 3amalic acid 3acitric acid 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aphotosynthesis 3achlorophyll 3afluorescence 3afree amino acids 3achemical constituents of plants 3aammonium compounds1 aKrapp, A.1 aHurry, V.1 aStitt, M.0 tPlanta.g1998 Oct., v. 206, no. 3 p.394-409x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0042500504153Available from publisher's Web site  a20040625b00000000c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02350naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001300141245005300154300001600207500001500223520103200238650002001270650003001290650001801320650002101338650001101359650002701370650001401397650002001411650002301431650001401454650002101468650001101489650001801500650002301518653003401541653002301575653001101598653003001609700001701639773006501656852000901721856008101730930003301811945001301844946001101857655001201868IND2197463320221118050734.0990310e199810  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219746332DNAL7 a10.1007/s0042500504092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEbel, J.10aEarly events in the elicitation of plant defence  ap. 335-348.  a2019-12-04  aPlants successfully use inducible defence mechanisms to combat potential pathogens.

The elicitor-binding sites studied so far show a high degree of ligand specificity, as do the candidate binding proteins identified for some of the ligands. Following elicitor perception, a number of rapid reactions are detectable in plant cells, including enhanced ion fluxes across the plasma membrane, formation of reactive oxygen intermediate, changes in protein phosphorylation, and lipid oxidation. Intriguing questions arising from these observations are whether the elicitor-binding proteins constitute receptors in plant defence signaling and whether any of the rapid events participate in signal transduction during defence activation. 3aplasma membrane 3afungal diseases of plants 3aion transport 3abinding proteins 3alipids 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aoxidation 3aphosphorylation 3ainduced resistance 3areceptors 3aoligosaccharides 3aoxygen 3aglycoproteins 3adefense mechanisms 0areactive oxygen intermediates 0aliterature reviews 0aplants 0aelicitor binding proteins1 aMithofer, A.0 tPlanta.g1998 Oct., v. 206, no. 3 p.335-348x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0042500504093Available from publisher's Web site  a19990405b19990413c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03311naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100002100141245015800162300001600320520179000336650001402126650004302140650001202183650002402195650001402219650002902233650003602262650001602298650001702314650001302331650002202344650001102366650002602377650001102403650001602414653001402430700002402444700001702468700002502485700001802510700001502528700002002543700001802563773006502581852000902646856008102655930003302736945001302769946001102782655001202793IND2197464520221118050820.0990310e199810  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219746452DNAL7 a10.1007/s0042500504182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerez-Garcia, A.10aCytosolic localization in tomato mesophyll cells of a novel glutamine synthetase induced in response to bacterial infection or phosphinothricin treatment  ap. 426-434.  aIn tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) leaves, the predominant glutamine synthetase (GS; EC 6.3.1.2) is chloroplastic (GS2; 45 kDa) whereas the cytosolic isoform (GS1; 39 kDa) is represented as a minor enzyme. Following either infection by Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) or treatment with phosphinothricin (PPT), a GS inhibitor, GS1 accumulated in the leaves. In contrast to healthy control leaves. where GS1 was restricted to the veins, in infected and PPT-treated leaves the GS1 polypeptide was also detected in the leaf blade, moreover, it was more abundant than GS2. Different immunological approaches were therefore used to investigate whether or not the GS1 polypeptide expressed in Pst-infected and PPT-treated tomato leaves was distributed among different tissues and subcellular compartments in the same way as the constitutive GS1 expressed in healthy leaves. By tissue-printing analysis, a similar GS immunostaining was observed in epidermis, mesophyll and phloem of leaflet midrib cross-sections of control, infected and PPT-treated leaves. Immunocytochemical localization revealed that GS protein was present in the chloroplast of mesophyll cells and the cytoplasm of phloem cells in healthy leaves; however, in Pst-infected or PPT-treated leaves, a strong labelling was observed in the cytoplasm of mesophyll cells. Two-dimensional analysis of GS polypeptides showed that, in addition to the constitutive GS1, a GS1 polypeptide different in charge was present in tomato leaflets after microbial infection or herbicide treatment. All these results indicate that a novel cytosolic GS is induced in mesophyll cells of Pst-infected or PPT-treated leaves. A possible role for this new cytosolic GS in the remobilization of leaf nitrogen during infection is proposed. 3ainfection 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3acytosol 3aimmunocytochemistry 3amesophyll 3aglutamate-ammonia ligase 3aPseudomonas syringae pv. tomato 3aglufosinate 3achloroplasts 3aisozymes 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aleaves 3aquantitative analysis 3aphloem 3aplant veins 0aepidermis1 aPereira-Lorenzo, S.1 aPissarra, J.1 aGarcia Gutierrez, A.1 aGazorla, F.M.1 aSalema, R.1 aVicente, A.

The patch-clamp technique was used to monitor changes in plasma-membrane surface area of individual guard-cell protoplasts (GCPs) by measuring membrane capacitance (Cm), a parameter proportional to the surface area. The membrane capacitance increased under hypoosmotic conditions and decreased after hypertonic treatment. As the specific capacitance remained constant, this demonstrates that osmotically induced changes in surface area are associated with incorporation and removal of membrane material. Osmotically induced fusion and fission of plasma-membrane material was not affected by removal of extracellular Ca2+. Dialysing protoplasts with very low (<2 nM) or high (1 micromolar) Ca2+ had no effect on changes in Cm under hypo- and hyperosmotic conditions. However, the rate of change in surface area was dependent on the size of the difference in osmotic potential applied. The larger the osmotic difference and thus changes in membrane tension caused by water influx or efflux, the faster the change in Cm. The results therefore demonstrate that osmotically induced fusion and fission of plasma-membrane material in GCPs are Ca2+ -independent and modulated by membrane tension. 3aVicia faba 3aprotoplasts 3aguard cells 3asurface area 3aosmosis 3astomatal movement 3avolume 3acapacitance 3aplasma membrane 3ainorganic ions 3acalcium0 tPlanta.g1998 Oct., v. 206, no. 2 p.329-333x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0042500504083Available from publisher's Web site  a19990405b19990413c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02842naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245011200169300001600281500002400297520177000321650001902091650002502110650002502135650001802160650002702178650002302205650002302228650001102251700001902262700001802281700001902299773011002318852000902428856005502437655001202492IND4426724120221118050803.0091002e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442672412DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-459X.2009.00235.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarlucci, A.10aMapping the effect of information about animal welfare on consumer liking and willingness to pay for yogurt  ap. 712-730.  aIncludes references  aPreference mapping identified different groups of consumers on the basis of their disconfirmations (occurring when the product is either better or worse than expected) and assimilations (occurring when actual liking [L] moves toward the expectations). The negative disconfirmation of a group of consumers (Group 1) was based on the information about animal welfare (the products were worse than expected because the information about animal welfare induced high expectations), whereas in Group 2 the sensory properties of the products prevailed in orienting consumer disconfirmation (products were worse than expected because the sensory properties of low-fat yogurt were disliked). The map of assimilation showed that consumers from Group 1 had higher assimilation for plain yogurt associated with high welfare standards as a consequence of the high discrepancy between blind and expected L for these products. A similar behavior was observed for Group 2 (higher discrepancy between blind and expected L corresponding to higher assimilation for low-fat yogurt paired with high welfare standards). Consumers based their choices both on sensory properties (plain yogurts were preferred to low-fat yogurts) and on information about animal welfare (products associated with high welfare standards were preferred to the others). Preference mapping was able to identify groups of consumers behaving differently, as compared with the general trend, on the basis of their disconfirmations and assimilations. Consumer willingness to pay reflected the hedonic behavior, thus validating the auction procedure for food liking evaluation purposes and providing a useful tool to obtain information about the real value (i.e., in monetary terms) consumers give to animal welfare. 3aanimal welfare 3aconsumer information 3aconsumer preferences 3afood analysis 3alow fat dairy products 3asensory properties 3awillingness to pay 3ayogurt1 aMonteleone, E.1 aBraghieri, A.1 aNapolitano, F.0 tJournal of sensory studies.g2009 Oct., v. 24, no. 5 p.712-730dBlackwell Publishing Incx0887-82507nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-459X.2009.00235.x 7aarticle02535naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245006100172300001600233500002400249500001500273520138000288650002401668650002201692650002601714650002301740650001601763650001001779650001201789650001901801650001301820650002401833651001301857653001501870700003201885700002201917700001901939773010301958852000902061856005502070655001202125IND4409558820221118050711.0080829e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440955882DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1744-697X.2008.00112.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Yunxiang10aPhytosociological study of steppe vegetation in Mongolia  ap. 107-116.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aUsing phytosociological methods, vegetation data were collected from 144 stands in seven areas across approximately 800 km, covering a large proportion of the east-west axis of the Mongolian steppe. Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) was used to identify trends within the complete set of vegetation data from all 144 stands. We recognized four phytosociological plant communities and seven lower units, among which three of the communities (the Stipa baicalensis-Agropyron cristatum, Stipa grandis-Achnatherum sibiricum and Chamaerhodos erecta-Artemisia scoparia communities) may be considered valuable additions to the current classification system of Mongolian steppe by Hilbig (1995 ). Three lower units of the Stipa krylovii-Cleistogennes squarrosa community were identical with associations described by Hilbig (1990 ), which named typical sub-association of Cymbario dahuricae-Stipetum krylovii, Cymbario dahuricae-Stipetum krylovii and Amygdalo pedunculatae-Spriaeetum aquilegifolia. The present floristic composition of the community types, which showed a high density of unpalatable species, suggests that intensive grazing has become a widespread problem across the entire Mongolian steppe. On the other hand, the first ordination axis of DCA was associated with land used for cultivation. The stands abandoned over 10 years had high scores on the first axis. 3acommunity structure 3aplant communities 3abotanical composition 3aArtemisia scoparia 3aAchnatherum 3aStipa 3asteppes 3aphytosociology 3aland use 3aAgropyron cristatum 3aMongolia 0avegetation1 aTsendeekhuu, Tsagaanbandiin1 aNarantuya, Naidan1 aNakamura, Toru0 tGrassland science.g2008 Sept., v. 54, no. 3 p.107-116dBlackwell Publishing Asiax1744-69617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-697X.2008.00112.x 7aarticle02522naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100002300138245015400161300001800315520123100333650002301564650003801587650001301625650003301638650001301671650002701684650004401711650001101755650001701766700001701783700002001800700002101820700002001841773014201861852000902003856007802012930003302090946001302123655001202136IND4420684420221118050622.0090515e20090615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442068442DNAL7 a10.1002/polb.217232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamamoto, Tomoyuki10aCorrelation study among oxygen permeability, molecular mobility, and amorphous structure change of poly(ethylene-vinylalcohol copolymers) by moisture  ap. 1181-1191.  aOxygen permeability and the free-volume hole size (cavity size) of ethylene-vinylalcohol copolymers (EVOH) indicate abnormal humidity dependence, that is, they have minimum values in the range of around 20-40% RH, not showing a monotonic increase with humidity. To clarify this abnormal phenomenon, we investigated its molecular mobility and amorphous structure change by means of solid-state NMR and temperature-modulated differential scanning calorimetry (TMDSC). The glass transition temperature (Tg) decreased with humidity. Specimens stored at 15-60% RH showed large enthalpy relaxation, and it was found that the amorphous structure became more compact and the molecular conformation became more stable by ageing within this range of humidity. Under these conditions, solid-state NMR measurement showed a component with intermediate relaxation time in the amorphous region. The results obtained by TMDSC and solid-state NMR showed a reduction in molecular mobility by densifying in the amorphous region under the condition of 15-60% RH. The fact that the oxygen permeability and the cavity size of EVOH indicate minimum values at low humidity are attributed to the reduction in molecular mobility by enthalpy relaxation. 3acomposite polymers 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aenthalpy 3aglass transition temperature 3ahumidity 3amolecular conformation 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoxygen 3apermeability1 aKanda, Taiji1 aNishihara, Yuko1 aOoshima, Tetsuya1 aSaito, Yoichiro0 tJournal of polymer science.g2009 June 15, v. 47, no. 12 p.1181-1191dWiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Companyx0887-62667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/polb.217233Available from publisher's Web site  a20090515b20090608c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02862naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001700141245009000158300001600248500001500264520160100279650001901880650001301899650002501912650001801937650001001955650002501965650001601990650001402006650002302020650001902043650001602062650001002078650001102088653001102099653001602110653002102126700001802147700001502165773006502180852000902245856008102254930003302335945001302368946001102381655001202392IND2204076220221118050501.0000425e199911  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220407622DNAL7 a10.1007/s0042500506602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaroco, J.P.10aPhotosynthetic acclimation of maize to growth under elevated levels of carbon dioxide  ap. 115-125.  a2019-12-04  aThe effects of elevated CO(2) concentrations on the photochemistry, biochemistry and physiology of C(4) photosynthesis were studied in maize (Zea mays L.). Plants were grown at ambient (350 microliters L(-1)) or ca. 3 times ambient (1100 microliters L(-1)) CO(2) levels under high light conditions in a greenhouse for 30 d. Relative to plants grown at ambient CO(2) levels, plants grown under elevated CO(2) accumulated ca. 20% more biomass and 23% more leaf area. When measured at the CO(2) concentration of growth, mature leaves of high-CO(2)-grown plants had higher light-saturated rates of photosynthesis (ca. 15%), lower stomatal conductance (71%), higher water-use efficiency (225%) and higher dark respiration rates (100%). High-CO(2)-grown plants had lower carboxylation efficiencies (23%), measured under limiting CO(2), and lower leaf protein contents (22%). Activities of a number of C(3) and C(4) cycle enzymes decreased on a leaf-area basis in the high-CO(2)-grown plants by 5-30%, with NADP-malate dehydrogenase exhibiting the greatest decrease. In contrast, activities of fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase and ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase increased significantly under elevated CO(2) condition (8% and 36%, respectively). These data show that the C(4) plant maize may benefit from elevated CO(2) through acclimation in the capacities of certain photosynthetic enzymes. The increased capacity to synthesize sucrose and starch, and to utilize these end-products of photosynthesis to produce extra energy by respiration, may contribute to the enhanced growth of maize under elevated CO(2). 3acarbon dioxide 3aZea mays 3astomatal conductance 3acarboxylation 3astems 3awater use efficiency 3aacclimation 3aleaf area 3abiomass production 3aphotosynthesis 3achlorophyll 3aroots 3aleaves 0agrowth 0arespiration 0aplant physiology1 aEdwards, G.E.1 aKu, M.S.B.0 tPlanta.g1999 Nov., v. 210, no. 1 p.115-125x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0042500506603Available from publisher's Web site  a20000802b20000808c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03432naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001600141245016000157300001400317500001500331520186100346650001102207650001802218650001702236650002002253650002202273650001802295650001802313650002002331650003202351650001002383650002202393650001902415650002002434650002102454650002102475650001002496650001902506653001802525700002102543700001602564700001702580700001602597700002002613700001602633700001902649773006302668852000902731856008102740930003302821945001302854946001102867655001202878IND2204074020221118050622.0000425e199911  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220407402DNAL7 a10.1007/s0042500506532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHenzler, T.10aDiurnal variations in hydraulic conductivity and root pressure can be correlated with the expression of putative aquaporins in the roots of Lotus japonicus  ap. 50-60.  a2019-12-04  aThe hydraulic conductivity of excised roots (LP(r)) of the legume Lotus japonicus (Regel) K. Larsen grown in mist (aeroponic) and sand cultures. was found to vary over a 5-fold range during a day/night cycle. This behaviour was seen when Lp(r) was measured in roots exuding, either under root pressure (osmotic driving force), or under an applied hydrostatic pressure of 0.4 MPa which produced a rate of water flow similar to that in a transpiring plant. A similar daily pattern of variation was seen in plants grown in natural daylight or in controlled-environment rooms, in plants transpiring at ambient rates or at greatly reduced rates, and in plants grown in either aeroponic or sand culture. When detached root systems were connected to a root pressure probe, a marked diurnal variation was seen in the root pressure generated. After excision, this circadian rhythm continued for some days. The hydraulic conductivity of the plasma membrane of individual root cells was measured during the diurnal cycle using a cell pressure probe. Measurements were made on the first four cell layers of the cortex, but no evidence of any diurnal fluctuation could be found. It was concluded that the conductance of membranes of endodermal and stelar cells may be responsible for the observed diurnal rhythm in root LP(r). When mRNAs from roots were probed with cDNA from the Arabidopsis aquaporin AthPIP1a gene, an abundant transcript was found to vary in abundance diurnally under high-stringency conditions. The pattern of fluctuations resembled closely the diurnal pattern of variation in root LP(r). The plasma membranes of root cells were found to contain an abundant hydrophobic protein with a molecular weight of about 31 kDa which cross-reacted strongly to an antibody raised against the evolutionarily conserved N-terminal amino acid sequence of AthPIP1a. 3acortex 3amessenger RNA 3aroot systems 3aimmunochemistry 3acomplementary DNA 3aroot pressure 3atranspiration 3agene expression 3aroot hydraulic conductivity 3aLotus 3adiurnal variation 3ahydrophobicity 3aplasma membrane 3amolecular weight 3acircadian rhythm 3aroots 3aplant proteins 0aplant tissues1 aWaterhouse, R.N.1 aSmyth, A.J.1 aCarvajal, M.1 aCooke, D.T.1 aSchaffner, A.R.1 aSteudle, E.1 aClarkson, D.T.0 tPlanta.g1999 Nov., v. 210, no. 1 p.50-60x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0042500506533Available from publisher's Web site  a20000802b20000808c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01994naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100002100149245006000170300001800230520088000248650001601128650001501144650002401159650001501183650002401198650001201222650001801234650003301252650001001285650002501295650002801320650002301348700001301371700001601384700001401400700001901414773008601433852000901519939003301528946001101561655001201572IND9302652820221118050516.0930403e19920611xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930265282DNAL7 a16148592pmid7 aPMC3369132pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVon Haeseler, A.10aComputer methods for locating kinetoplastid cryptogenes  ap. 2717-2724.  aRNA editing in the mitochondria of kinetoplastid protozoa involves the insertion and/or deletion of precise numbers of uridine residues at precise locations in the transcribed RNA of certain genes. These genes are known as cryptogenes. In this paper we study computational algorithms to search for unknown cryptogenes and for the associated templates for insertion of uridines, gRNA sequences. The pairwise similarity search algorithm of Smith and Waterman (1) is modified to study this problem. The algorithm searches for unknown gRNAs given the cryptogene sequence. The method is tested on 4 known cryptogenes from L. tarentolae which are known to have 7 associated gRNAs. The statistical distribution of the longest gRNA when comparing random sequences is derived. Finally we develop an algorithm to search for cryptogenes using amino acid sequences from related proteins. 3aRNA editing 3aalgorithms 3acomputer techniques 2aAlgorithms 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxgenetics 2aGenes 2aLeishmaniaxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aSequence Alignment1 aBlum, B.1 aSimpson, L.1 aSturm, N.1 aWaterman, M.S.0 tNucleic acids research.g1992 June 11, v. 20, no. 11 p.2717-2724x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01639naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245007600124300001600200500001500216520065200231650001300883650002400896650002200920650001300942650002500955650001800980650002500998650002201023650001901045650001501064653000801079653002201087700001501109773008801124852000901212939003301221946001101254655001201265IND9205941020221118050448.0920924e19840111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920594102DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQueen, C.12aA comprehensive sequence analysis program for the IBM personal computer  ap. 581-599.  a2019-12-05  aWe have developed a versatile program for the analysis of nucleic acid and protein sequences on the IBM Personal Computer.

Their characterization requires that all the sequence surrounding the repeat be known in order to be able to design primers for PCR amplification. However, when using DNA libraries with large cloned inserts, this sequence characterization is not immediately practicable. In this paper, we describe a new strategy, based both on the use of a microsatellite specific probing and on the creation of nested deleted clones with the Exonuclease III, in order to position microsatellites in a range allowing direct sequencing. This method was applied to the screening of a mouse chromosome 19 DNA specific library. in this way, thirteen clones were identified by specific probing and seven were submitted to the nested deletion strategy. Five of them presented microsatellite sequences in specific deleted subclones which were selected and sequenced. Primers were designed for each of them and polymorphism between the genomes of several inbred strain of mouse have been determined. These microsatellites were mapped, three of them to chromosome 19 and two to chromosome 11. 3aDNA libraries 3asatellite DNA 3aclones 3achromosome mapping 2aAnimals 2aBacteriophage lambdaxgenetics 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aGene Library 2aGenetic Markers 2aGenetic Testingxmethods 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred Strainsxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOligodeoxyribonucleotidesxgenetics 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aPolymorphism, Geneticxgenetics 2aRepetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acidxgenetics 0aembl/x66850 0aembl/x66853 0aembl/x66851 0amolecular sequence data 0aembl/x66854 0anucleotide sequences1 aPoirier, C.1 aSimon-Chazottes, D.1 aBarnier, C.1 aGuenet, J.L.0 tNucleic acids research.g1992 July 25, v. 20, no. 14 p.3665-3669x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL  a19931201b19931207c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02239naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123072001700141072001700158100001800175245009800193300001600291500001500307520099200322650002401314650001601338650002201354650001401376650001101390650001401401650003201415650001401447650001401461653002101475653001401496653001101510653002001521700001501541700001301556773006501569852000901634856008101643930003301724945001301757946001101770655001201781IND2204079620221118050619.0000425e199911  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220407962DNAL7 a10.1007/s0042500506672doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Apoptotic features were detected in the cells of hybrid seedlings of Nicotiana glutinosa L. x N. repanda Willd. Condensation of chromatin and fragmentation of nuclei were observed in the leaf protoplasts isolated from hybrid seedlings expressing this lethality. Fragmentation of nuclei was correlated with the progression of lethal symptoms, as confirmed by fluorimetry of the nuclear DNA using laser scanning cytometry. Agarose gel analysis of DNA extracted from hybrid leaves showing lethality revealed a specific ladder pattern suggesting nucleosomal fragmentation associated with nuclear fragmentation. In-situ detection of DNA fragmentation using terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-fluorescein nick end labeling (TUNEL) showed that this process occurred in all leaf cells. This is the first evidence that apoptosis can induce suicide of hybrid plants, thus leading to reproductive isolation. 3aNicotiana glutinosa 3aprotoplasts 3aplant development 3aseedlings 3aleaves 3achromatin 3ainterspecific hybridization 3amortality 3aapoptosis 0adna modification 0aNicotiana 0anuclei 0acell structures1 aYamada, T.1 aNiwa, M.0 tPlanta.g1999 Nov., v. 210, no. 1 p.168-171x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0042500506673Available from publisher's Web site  a20101020b20101108c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03707naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100001100160245014200171300001400313500001500327520189600342650001702238650001102255650002202266650001002288650001002298650002502308650001202333650001402345650002002359650002202379650001102401650001802412650001002430650002102440650002302461650001002484650002802494650001102522650002102533650006002554650001202614650000902626650002402635650002402659650005202683650002202735650002602757653001502783653002602798653001602824700001902840773006302859852000902922856008102931930003303012945001303045946001103058655001203069IND2202572020221118050816.0000215e199907  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220257202DNAL7 a104670292pmid7 a10.1007/s0042500506042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, M.10aPurification, characterization, and immunolocalization of hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA: tyramine N-(hydroxycinnamoyl)transferase from opium poppy  ap. 33-44.  a2019-12-04  aA development-specific and elicitor-inducible acyltransferase [hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA: tyramine N-(hydroxycinnamoyl) transferase (THT; EC 2.3.1.110)] that catalyzes the transfer of hydroxycinnamic acids from hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA esters to hydroxyphenethylamines was purified 988-fold to apparent homogeneity from opium poppy (Papaver somniferum L.) cell-suspension cultures. The purification procedure, which resulted in a 6.8% yield, involved hydrophobic interaction and anion-exchange chromatography, followed by affinity chromatography on Reactive Yellow-3-Agarose using the acyl donor (feruloyl-COA) as eluent. Purified THT had an isoelectric point of 5.2, a native molecular mass of approximately 50 kDa, and consisted of two apparently identical 25-kDa subunits as determined by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified enzyme was able to synthesize a variety of amides due to a relatively low specificity for cinnamoyl-CoA derivatives and hydroxyphenethylamines. The best substrates were feruloyl-CoA (V K(m)-1 13.4 mkat g(-1) M(-1)) and tyramine (V K(m)-1 6.57 mkat g(-1) M(-1)). The THT activity increased during development of opium poppy seedlings, occurred at high levels in roots and stems of mature plants, and was induced in cell-suspension cultures after treatment with a pathogen-derived elicitor. Immunoblot analysis using THT mouse polyclonal antibodies did not always show a correlation between THT polypeptide and enzyme activity levels. For example, despite low THT activity in leaves, an abundant 25-kDa immunoreactive polypeptide was detected. Immunohistochemical localization showed that THT polypeptides occur in cortical and xylem parenchyma, immature xylem vessel elements, root periderm, anthers, ovules, and the inner layer of the seed coat, but are most abundant in phloem sieve-tube members in roots, stems, leaves, and anther filaments. 3apolypeptides 3aovules 3aplant development 3atesta 3astems 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aanthers 3aseedlings 3aenzyme activity 3aisoelectric point 3aphloem 3aglycopeptides 3axylem 3amolecular weight 3aPapaver somniferum 3aroots 3acell suspension culture 3aleaves 3aacyltransferases 2aAcyltransferasesxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aAnimals 2aMice 2aMolecular Structure 2aPapaverxenzymology 2aPeptidesxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aPlants, Medicinal 2aSubstrate Specificity 0asubstrates 0aplant vascular system 0aderivatives1 aFacchini, P.J.0 tPlanta.g1999 July, v. 209, no. 1 p.33-44x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0042500506043Available from publisher's Web site  a20000501b20000508c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02587naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001700149245010300166300001800269520113800287650003001425650001801455650002001473650001201493650001201505650004201517650001801559650002301577650002301600650005301623650002301676650004101699650002801740650003001768650004001798650005501838650002801893650002201921700001601943700001901959773008601978852000902064939003302073946001102106655001202117IND9302651720221118050539.0930512e19920625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930265172DNAL7 a16205902pmid7 aPMC3124232pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavies, J.P.10aExpression of the arylsulfatase gene from the beta 2-tubulin promoter in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii  ap. 2959-2965.  aArylsulfatase, produced by Chlamydomonas reinhardtii during sulfur-limited growth, is secreted into the periplasmic space and is readily assayed using a chromogenic substrate. To assess the usefullness of the gene encoding arylsulfatase (ars) as a reporter gene in C. reinhardtii, we have fused the promoter region of the beta-2-tubulin gene (tubB2) to the coding region of an ars genomic clone to form a tubB2/ars chimeric sequence. This construct was introduced into C. reinhardtii, strain CC425 (cw-15, arg-2), via cotransformation with the argininosuccinate lyase gene (which complements the arg-2 lesion) (1). Transformants expressing arylsulfatase (Ars) in sulfur-sufficient medium were isolated and subsequently shown to contain the tubB2/ars gene. RNA analysis determined that tubB2/ars transcripts accumulated in these cells. Abundance of the chimeric transcript increased immediately following deflagellation in a manner similar to that of the endogenous tubB2 transcript. Thus, chimeric genes incorporating ars coding sequences and heterologous promoters can be used to examine regulated gene expression in C. reinhardtii. 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3aarylsulfatase 3agene expression 3atubulin 2aAnimals 2aArylsulfatasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBase Sequence 2aBlotting, Northern 2aBlotting, Southern 2aChlamydomonas reinhardtiixenzymologyxgenetics. 2aCloning, Molecular 2aGene Expression Regulationxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aPromoter Regions, Geneticxgenetics 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTransformation, Genetic 2aTubulinxgenetics1 aWeeks, D.P.1 aGrossman, A.R.0 tNucleic acids research.g1992 June 25, v. 20, no. 12 p.2959-2965x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02409naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001400141245010700155300001600262520112600278650002301404650001901427650001501446650001001461650001801471650001101489650002101500650001701521650002501538650001201563650001501575650002701590650001401617650001201631650002001643650002001663653001301683653001301696700001801709773006501727852000901792856008101801930003301882945001301915946001101928655001201939IND2202083320221118050608.0991228e199906  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220208332DNAL7 a10.1007/s0042500505912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Z.10aSperm cell surface characteristics of Plumbago zeylanica L. in relation to transport in the embryo sac  ap. 539-544.  aMyosin associated with the male germ cells of angiosperms interacts with actin, promoting transport of the non-motile generative and later sperm cells in the pollen tube. Myosin localizing on the sperm cell plasma membrane seems negligible in Plumbago, as reflected by the absence of: (i) anti-myosin labeling using immunoelectron microscopy, (ii) sperm motility on actin matrices, and (iii) electrophoretic movement changes after addition of antibody. Sperm cells injected directly into actively streaming Nitella internodal cells, however, follow actin bundles and their movement is sensitive to ATP and Mg(2+). This may be based on simple charge binding since negatively charged latex beads also migrate on actin, whereas neutral or positively-charged latex beads do not. Sperm cells are negatively charged according to capillary microelectrophoresis, whereas killed sperm cells, which are positively charged do not migrate. The sperm cell that normally fertilizes the egg has a higher calculated charge (8.277 x 10(3) esu/cm(2)) compared with the sperm cell that fuses with the central cell (6.120 x 10(3) esu/cm(2)). 3aPlumbago zeylanica 3aembryo (plant) 3aembryo sac 3aactin 3aspermatocytes 3amyosin 3aactive transport 3apollen tubes 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aNitella 3ainternodes 3aadenosine triphosphate 3amagnesium 3acations 3aelectrophoresis 3aplasma membrane 0amotility 0amovement1 aRussell, S.D.0 tPlanta.g1999 June, v. 208, no. 4 p.539-544x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0042500505913Available from publisher's Web site  a20000302b20000309c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02902naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245007800156300001600234500002000250520168900270592002801959650002501987650002202012650001602034650002002050650002102070650000902091650001702100650001102117650002202128650002002150650001302170650001202183650001702195650002102212700001602233700001302249773013502262856007402397852000902471655001202480IND60619171420221117160154.0181030e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061917142DNAL7 a10.1111/jsap.129122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimpson, K.10aLong‐term outcome of primary immune‐mediated thrombocytopenia in dogs  ap. 674-680.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence of relapse after discharge from the hospital in dogs with a diagnosis of presumed primary immune‐mediated thrombocytopenia, risk factors associated with relapse and whether or not indefinite use of immunosuppressive medication influences risk of relapse. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical records from August 2007 through July 2016 were reviewed to identify dogs with a diagnosis of presumed primary immune‐mediated thrombocytopenia. Data collection included signalment, initial diagnostic tests, treatment, incidence of relapse, survival duration and follow‐up testing. RESULTS: A total of 45 dogs were diagnosed, treated and monitored for at least one year for presumed primary immune‐mediated thrombocytopenia. 89∙6% of patients survived to discharge and 31% of those experienced a relapse following discharge. The median time from diagnosis to relapse was 79 days. Of dogs that experienced a relapse, 50% had at least one further relapse. There was no difference in age, body weight, gender, breed, platelet count at presentation, nadir packed cell volume during hospitalisation, incidence of melaena or initial treatment between the relapsing and non‐relapsing groups. In the relapsing group, time to platelet recovery was significantly longer and these patients were more likely to have received a blood transfusion. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This study does not provide evidence to support the use of long‐term immunosuppressive medications to prevent relapse. However, the data suggest that patients with more severe disease at the time of diagnosis or that have already experienced a relapse should be monitored more closely.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood platelet count 3ablood transfusion 3abody weight 3adata collection 3adisease severity 3adogs 3adrug therapy 3agender 3aimmunosuppression 3amedical records 3apatients 3arelapse 3arisk factors 3athrombocytopenia1 aChapman, P.1 aKlag, A.0 tjournal of small animal practice.g2018 Nov., v. 59, no. 11 p.674-680dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl45484x0022-45107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jsap.129123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02669naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245012700164520138400291592002801675650000901703650002601712650002201738650000901760650001601769650002401785650002401809650001701833650001601850653002201866653002901888653002401917653002101941700001801962700001701980700001401997700001502011700001602026773011102042856008502153852000902238655001202247IND60684191120221120053437.0200318e20200601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068419112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2020.1063782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Guang10aExperimental study on effective microwave heating/fracturing of coal with various dielectric property and water saturation  aMicrowave heating is a promising technology in coal processing and coal seam permeability enhancement. It is vital to investigate the influencing factors for microwave heating of coal to ensure the optimal heating effect and the best energy efficiency. To address this, different types of coal samples with various water saturation were treated with various microwave powers and irradiation times. Thermocouple and infrared thermal image system were used to measure the temperature of coal samples during and after microwave treatment. Through analysing the temperature, the effects of dielectric property and water saturation of coal, microwave power and treatment time on microwave heating were investigated. It was found the heating rate of coal samples increases with the loss factor at the initial heating period, which then changes as the composition changes under microwave irradiation. It was also found that coal samples with low water saturation have much better microwave heating effects. Moisture not only impedes microwave heating but also facilitates uniformed heating, which impedes the formation of thermal fractures. Additionally, the experiment results suggest the average temperature increases with microwave power and irradiation time. However, extending the microwave irradiation time is more effective when the microwave power increases to a certain extent.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoal 3adielectric properties 3aenergy efficiency 3aheat 3airradiation 3amicrowave radiation 3amicrowave treatment 3apermeability 3atemperature 0aMicrowave heating 0aCoalbed methane recovery 0aDielectric property 0aWater saturation1 aHuang, Jinxin1 aHu, Guozhong1 aYang, Nan1 aZhu, Jieqi1 aChang, Ping0 tFuel processing technology.g2020 June 01, v. 202 p.106378-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12445x0378-38207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2020.1063783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02090naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100001900190245010100209300001600310500001500326506007600341520057800417592002800995506003701023650001601060650004201076650001901118650002001137650001701157650003301174650001201207650001801219650001401237650001801251653002901269653001801298653001201316653001501328700001701343700001701360700001901377700001501396773009301411856008301504852000901587655001201596IND60530719620221207142549.0170320e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053071962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gdata.2016.01.0052doi7 aPMC47786242pmcid7 a269814132pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGanguli, Sayak10aAnalyses of MYMIV-induced transcriptome in Vigna mungo as revealed by next generation sequencing  ap. 226-228.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMungbean Yellow Mosaic Virus (MYMIV) is the viral pathogen that causes yellow mosaic disease to a number of legumes including Vigna mungo.

The aims of this study were to investigate the effects of vegetation type on the oviposition behavior of this pest in an open field and the hatching success of the offspring in the following year. The results showed that vegetation type did have a significant effect on whether any egg pods were laid by O. d. asiaticus. Once the females laid eggs, vegetation type and cage number had a significant effect on the number of egg pods laid. The highest number of egg pods was found in the Cleistogenes squarrosa treatment, followed by Stipa krylovii and then Leymus chinensis, while the Artemisia frigida treatment contained the lowest number of egg pods. The O. d. asiaticus eggs laid in S. krylovii and C. squarrosa treatments had a significantly higher hatching success rate (over 53%) than the other two grasses (below 40%). In short, habitats with C. squarrosa and S. krylovii grasses are likely to be preferred by ovipositing females, thus population monitoring efforts of O. d. asiaticus should focus on these habitats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemisia frigida 3aKengia squarrosa 3aLeymus chinensis 3aOedaleus 3aStipa krylovii 3aagricultural land 3aanimals 3acages 3aeggs 3aentomology 3agrasslands 3aprogeny 3aChina 0agrass type 0aoffspring 0aegg pod 0adistribution pattern 0agrasshopper1 aZhang, Yan1 aWang, Guangjun1 aLowry, Alyssa1 aHuang, Wenjiang1 aDong, Yingying1 aShang, Suqin1 aLuke, Belinda0 tEnvironmental entomology.g2021 Apr. 28, v. 50, no. 4 p.790-794dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl3243x0046-225X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/nvab0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02828naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002000180245018100200300001800381500002000399506007600419520135800495592002801853506003701881650001601918650002101934650002001955650001001975650001601985650001202001650001602013650002002029650001802049650001002067650000902077700003002086700002402116700003102140773012902171856007302300852000902373655001202382IND60587370720221207131246.0180102e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058737072DNAL7 a10.1111/pce.129402doi7 aPMC55182342pmcid7 a282407772pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFootitt, Steven12aA laboratory simulation of Arabidopsis seed dormancy cycling provides new insight into its regulation by clock genes and the dormancy‐related genes DOG1, MFT, CIPK23 and PHYA  ap. 1474-1486.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEnvironmental signals drive seed dormancy cycling in the soil to synchronize germination with the optimal time of year, a process essential for species' fitness and survival. Previous correlation of transcription profiles in exhumed seeds with annual environmental signals revealed the coordination of dormancy‐regulating mechanisms with the soil environment. Here, we developed a rapid and robust laboratory dormancy cycling simulation. The utility of this simulation was tested in two ways: firstly, using mutants in known dormancy‐related genes [DELAY OF GERMINATION 1 (DOG1), MOTHER OF FLOWERING TIME (MFT), CBL‐INTERACTING PROTEIN KINASE 23 (CIPK23) and PHYTOCHROME A (PHYA)] and secondly, using further mutants, we test the hypothesis that components of the circadian clock are involved in coordination of the annual seed dormancy cycle. The rate of dormancy induction and relief differed in all lines tested. In the mutants, dog1‐2 and mft2, dormancy induction was reduced but not absent. DOG1 is not absolutely required for dormancy. In cipk23 and phyA dormancy, induction was accelerated. Involvement of the clock in dormancy cycling was clear when mutants in the morning and evening loops of the clock were compared. Dormancy induction was faster when the morning loop was compromised and delayed when the evening loop was compromised.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3acircadian clocks 3aedaphic factors 3agenes 3agermination 3amutants 3aphytochrome 3aprotein kinases 3aseed dormancy 3aseeds 3asoil1 aÖlçer‐Footitt, Hülya1 aHambidge, Angela J.1 aFinch‐Savage, William E.0 tPlant, cell and environment.g2017 Aug., v. 40, no. 8 p.1474-1486dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl11406x0140-77917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pce.129403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01820naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245011200175300001600287520087400303592002801177650001301205650001001218650001801228650001301246650001501259650001401274700001701288700002101305773008201326856008901408852000901497655001201506IND60095846520221116154731.0141104e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009584652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2010.12.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuric-Nesic, J.10aOn the void reduction mechanisms in vibration assisted consolidation of fibre reinforced polymer composites  ap. 320-327.  aVibration- and vacuum-assisted curing experiments of laminate composites were carried out using a method involving a flat curing chamber and heat transfer fluid. The laminates were made with woven glass fabric and epoxy resin systems, and were subjected to void content analysis. Of the wide range of frequencies studied (0–8kHz), the low frequency vibrations (around 10Hz) resulted in significant void content reduction (by approximately 60%) compared to curing without vibration assistance. Analysis of solubility, diffusion and dynamic effects leads to a hypothesis for the possible mechanisms of void reduction, which include bubble growth and escape by reduction of pressure (vacuum), dissolution and growth by the Thomson–Freundlich effect, and enhancement of the diffusion and growth process due to vibrations amplified by damped natural resonance frequency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aepoxides 3aglass 3aheat transfer 3apolymers 3asolubility 3avibration1 aCompston, P.1 aStachurski, Z.H.0 tComposites.g2011 Mar., v. 42, no. 3 p.320-327dElsevier Ltdx1359-835X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesa.2010.12.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03744naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001900181245015100200300001600351500002000367506007600387520182400463592002802287596002102315596001802336506003702354650001402391650001702405650002302422650002402445650001502469650001902484650001602503650001402519650001002533650002202543650000902565650001302574650001202587650001702599650001402616650002502630650001702655650001402672650001402686650000902700650001702709651001802726700006002744700006302804700005702867773013502924856007403059852000903133655001203142IND60619171620221207140000.0181030e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061917162DNAL7 a10.1111/jsap.129042doi7 aPMC65599422pmcid7 a300395672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoffman, J.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of 1519 dogs with hyperadrenocorticism from a population of 70,574 dogs reported to the Veterinary Medical Database. Signalment, presence or absence of hyperadrenocorticism, aetiology of hyperadrenocorticism (if described), frequency of select comorbidities and causes of death were evaluated in dogs with and without hyperadrenocorticism. RESULTS: Hyperadrenocorticism was more frequent in females. Neutering was associated with a minor, but significant, increase in the odds of hyperadrenocorticism. Hyperadrenocorticism was the presumed cause of death of 393 (25∙9%) of affected dogs. When aetiology was specified (527 dogs, corresponding to 34∙7% of the cases), pituitary‐dependent hyperadrenocorticism [387 (73∙4%) out of 527 dogs] was more common than functional adrenocortical tumour [136 (25∙8%) out of 527 dogs). Hyperadrenocorticism was over‐represented in certain expected (miniature poodle, dachshund) and unexpected (Irish setter, bassett hound) breeds compared with the population at large. Of the select comorbidities investigated, dogs with hyperadrenocorticism were at increased risk for concurrent diabetes mellitus, urinary tract infection, urolithiasis, hypertension, gall bladder mucocoele and thromboembolic disease compared with dogs without hyperadrenocorticism. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Hyperadrenocorticism is significantly associated with certain comorbid conditions but is not a major cause of mortality in affected dogs. Documented patterns now provide targets for prospective clinical research.  aPublisher supplied data  aT32GM007103cNIH  aAG044284cNIH0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDachshund 3aIrish Setter 3aPoodle (dog breed) 3abiomedical research 3acastration 3acohort studies 3acomorbidity 3adatabases 3adeath 3adiabetes mellitus 3adogs 3aetiology 3afemales 3agall bladder 3ahospitals 3ahyperadrenocorticism 3ahypertension 3amortality 3aneoplasms 3arisk 3aurolithiasis 3aNorth America1 aLourenço, B.

Our previous study indicated that one of the key targets of Yinlan is the Pregnane X Receptor (PXR). To verify that PXR is the main active target for Yinlan's anti-hyperlipidemia effect, and to discover the agonists and antagonists with both suitable content and pharmacokinetic profile accordingly. an UHPLC-TOF-MS method was first applied to screen components in Yinlan capsule, peaks found in the ion current chromatogram were identified by the database (AB Sciex Analyst Software 1.6), and those with obvious responses were set as candidates; cytobiological experiment was carried out in the subsequent step, using HepG2 cell incubated with midazolam and monomer of the candidate compounds, yield of 1’-hydroxy- midazolam was used as an index to evaluate the PXR-CYP3A4 regulation activity of each component; a UHPLC-MS method was used for determination of the candidates showed obvious changes in 1’-hydroxy- midazolam yield, and compounds had suitable content in Yinlan capsule were validated for their PXR regulatory activities by QT-PCR; then components with both good PXR/CYP3A4 regulatory activity and suitable content underwent pharmacokinetic research to evaluate their in-body movements, compounds with acceptable pharmacokinetic parameters were finally chosen as quality marker of Yinlan's anti-hyperlipidemia effect via regulation of PXR activity. Comparisons of results in each step of evaluation were carried out using SPSS software, and the compounds with obvious difference (p<0.05, with model group or control) were marked as active ones. The agonists (components in Yinlan that up-regulate the PXR activity) inhibit inflammatory reactions and promote the synthesis of bile and fatty acids, while the antagonists (components in Yinlan that down-regulate the PXR activity) accelerate energy metabolism and the decomposition of bile and fatty acids. In other words, the desired efficacy of Yinlan can be achieved when the activity of the antagonists surpasses the activity of the agonists. As it was indicated by content determination and pharmacokinetic research, the antagonists with adequate content and metabolomic profile to take effect showed greater efficacy over agonists. The anti-hyperlipidemic effect of Yinlan consequently results from suppressing PXR expression, promoting bile acid excretion, and fatty acid decomposition, and such activity results from the fact that the antagonist surpasses the agonist. It is suggested that both sides should be taken into consideration when investigating the therapeutic mechanism of Yinlan and the related active components.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagonists 3aantagonists 3abile 3abile acids 3acomputer software 3adatabases 3aenergy metabolism 3aexcretion 3afatty acids 3ahuman cell lines 3ahyperlipidemia 3ametabolomics 3apharmacokinetics 3apregnanes 3atherapeutics 0aPregnane X Receptor 0aAnti-hyperlipidemic effect 0aYinlan capsule 0aAgonistic and antagonistic activity1 aLi, Dongmei1 aLi, Xi-Yuan1 aXiao, Guanlin1 aBi, Xiaoli1 aChen, Weitao1 aShi, Zhiqi1 aZeng, Xiaohui1 aSun, Dongmei1 aCao, Li-Zhong0 tPhytomedicine plus.g2021 Aug., v. 1, no. 3 p.100086-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27657x2667-03137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phyplu.2021.1000863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03450naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245017000169300001600339520173400355592002802089650001602117650001002133650001802143650002102161650001402182650002002196650002202216650002702238650001302265650002702278650002702305650001602332650002802348650001602376650004702392650002602439650001102465650001202476650001002488653001902498653001702517653002102534653002302555700002102578700002102599700002002620700003002640700002202670773010902692856008602801852000902887655001202896IND60525888120221123013156.0190319e20160602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052588812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2016.03.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarra, Angela10aFactors affecting somatic embryogenesis in eight Italian grapevine cultivars and the genetic stability of embryo-derived regenerants as assessed by molecular markers  ap. 123-127.  aEmbryogenic cultures have been used in cryopreservation, genetic transformation, propagation, virus elimination, induced mutagenesis and in many other biotechnological applications, providing excellent opportunities for biotechnology advances in grapevine. Unfortunately the efficiency of somatic embryogenesis (SE) is genotype-dependent in addition to showing interaction with explant type used and the plant growth regulator (PGR) composition. In order to identify the interaction of these parameters in SE, we tested eight wine grapevine cultivars, three explant types (ovary, anther/filament and stigma/style) and four PGR combinations in a statistically designed experiment. The genotype was the major determining factor, with embryogenic response varying from 0.1 to 5.1% (about 50-fold difference). For PGR composition of the medium, embryogenesis ranged between 0.5 and 3.3% (a ≈7-fold difference). The explant type was the least important factor with embryogenesis ranging between 0.8% (anther/filament) and 2.3% (ovary)—only a ≈3-fold change. Anther/filament, that had generally been considered to be the most promising explant, surprisingly gave the lowest embryogenesis percentage. Genetic homogeneity of plants developed from in vitro SE was assessed in comparison to mother plants using six inter-simple sequence repeat and ten random amplified polymorphic DNA primers that produced reproducible and clear bands ranging from 150 to 3500bp. The amplification products were monomorphic across all the regenerated plants and their respective mother plants confirming the genetic homogeneity of the regenerants and demonstrating the suitability of SE for in vitro grapevine germplasm conservation and propagation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA primers 3aVitis 3abiotechnology 3acryopreservation 3acultivars 3agenetic markers 3agenetic stability 3agenetic transformation 3agenotype 3agermplasm conservation 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amutagenesis 3aplant growth substances 3aplant ovary 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3asomatic embryogenesis 3astigma 3aviruses 3awines 0aVitis vinifera 0aConservation 0aGenetic fidelity 0aPlant regeneration1 aSajeva, Maurizio1 aAbbate, Loredana1 aSiragusa, Mirko1 aPathirana, R.q(Ranjith),1 aCarimi, Francesco0 tScientia horticulturae.g2016 June 02, v. 204 p.123-127dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2016.03.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02480naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002700146245008400173300001800257520113400275592002801409650001101437650001101448650001201459650003801471650001801509650002301527650003101550650001601581650001301597650001901610650002101629700003301650700002501683700002901708700002801737700002401765700002001789700002001809773012601829856008201955852000902037655001202046IND60567915520180615000000.0170501e20170309xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056791552DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b005162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerreira, Margarida
L.10aInfluence of Nanosegregation on the Phase Behavior of Fluorinated Ionic Liquids  ap. 5415-5427.  aFluorinated ionic liquids (FILs) have received increasing attention due to their physicochemical properties. They allow us to enlarge the tuneability power of traditional ionic liquids. With the aim to understand the thermodynamic behavior of these compounds, a study of solid–fluid transitions using differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, rheology, and molecular dynamics simulation has been performed. A comparison between different cations, anions, and hydrogenated alkyl chains was carried out using ionic liquids with fluorinated alkyl chain lengths equal to or longer than four carbon atoms. In this work, we provide evidence of the fluorinated domain influence on the thermodynamic behavior of these compounds. Moreover, the results suggest that the nanosegregation of the fluorous domains might be an interesting structural feature that modifies and/or enhances the rich phase behavior of the FILs, increasing the probability of these compounds to adopt different conformations. This information is crucial to design the best FIL and can increase their potential on a wide range of applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanions 3acarbon 3acations 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aionic liquids 3amolecular dynamics 3aphysicochemical properties 3aprobability 3arheology 3athermodynamics 3athermogravimetry1 aPastoriza-Gallego, María J.1 aAraújo, João M.

Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and antimicrobial resistance of Campylobacter isolates from fresh chicken products at retail were studied. A total of 512 samples including: thigh, breast, marinated and minced chicken were purchased from different retail stores. Half of the samples were packed and the other half were unpacked. The 39.4% of the samples were Campylobacter positive; being unpacked chicken products (45.3%) more contaminated than packed chicken (33.6%). PFGE typing showed a high diversity among isolates; clustering 204 isolates into 76 PFGE types: 55 clusters of C. jejuni, 19 of C. coli and 2 of C. lari. C. coli genotypes showed higher resistance than other Campylobacter species. Although modified atmosphere packaging can reduce the prevalence of Campylobacter spp., it does not avoid their presence in at least 33.6% of packed chicken products analyzed. Some pulsotypes might persist in the processing plant or butcher shops environment for longer than previously thought. More stringent control measures are needed in previous steps of the chicken food chain, in order to avoid the presence of Campylobacter spp. strains at retail that can compromise consumer's safety.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCampylobacter 3aantibiotic resistance 3abreast meat 3abutcher shops 3acontrol methods 3afood chain 3agenotype 3aminced chicken meat 3amodified atmosphere packaging 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3araw meat 0aCampylobacter spp. 0aPFGE 0aAntibiotic resistance 0aPersistence1 aMelero, Beatriz1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8982-81861 aDiez, Ana Ma1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0176-446X1 aJaime, Isabel1 aRovira, Jordi0 tFood microbiology.g2018 Dec., v. 76 p.457-465dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34976x0740-00207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fm.2018.07.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01974naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245009500174300001600269520046900285592002800754650002700782650002800809650002300837650001900860650001500879650002000894650001400914650002100928650001200949653000800961653001100969653000800980653001900988653001501007653002201022653002101044700002201065700002401087700002301111700002301134700002601157700002801183700002101211773015301232856008601385852000901471655001201480IND60539243020221123033623.0190215e20140131xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053924302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.febslet.2013.12.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeifman, Alexey A.10a2,3-Dihydroxy-quinoxaline induces ATPase activity of Herpes Simplex Virus thymidine kinase  ap. 509-511.  a2,3-Dihydroxy-quinoxaline, a small molecule that promotes ATPase catalytic activity of Herpes Simplex Virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK), was identified by virtual screening.

It is important to have a detailed study of the geological evolution of the CE-5 sample return region. This work aims to study the geological background, topography, geomorphology, major chemical composition, mineralogy, and chronology of the landing site region. First, we used the map of topography obtained by the Kaguya TC merged Digital Terrain Model (DTM) to analyze the topographic characteristics. Then, we used the Kaguya Multiband Imager (MI) reflectance data to derive FeO and TiO₂ abundance and the hyperspectral data of the Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M³) onboard the Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft to study the mineralogy of the landing site region. Later, we defined and dated the geological units of the landing area using the crater size–frequency distribution (CSFD) method. Finally, we conducted a detailed analysis of the volcanism and tectonism that occurred in the CE-5 landing area. The study region has experienced multi-stage magmatic activities (~3.36 Ga to ~1.22 Ga) and formed multiple mare units with different chemical and mineral compositions. The relationship between the wrinkle ridges cut by small impact craters suggests that the U7/Em5 has experienced Copernican aged tectonism recently ~320 Ma. The U7/Em5 unit where the Chang’e-5 sample return mission landed is dominantly composed of mature pyroxene and the basalts are mainly high-iron and mid-titanium basalts. Additionally, the analysis of pure basalt in the U7/Em5 suggests that the samples returned by the CE-5 mission may contain the ejecta and ray materials of young craters, including sharp B, Harding, Copernicus, and Aristarchus.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasalt 3achemical composition 3alandscapes 3amares 3amineralogy 3amodels 3areflectance 3aspacecraft 3atopography 3avolcanic activity 3aChina1 aCheng, Weiming 1 aJiao, Yimeng 1 aLiu, Jianzhong 1 aChen, Jianping 1 aWang, Baixue 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Nov. 19, v. 13, no. 22dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs132246793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03396naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002600156245007300182300001400255500002000269520195700289592002802246650001902274650001202293650001302305650002002318650002302338650001602361650002202377650001002399650001502409650001702424650002202441650001602463650001202479650001202491650002302503650001102526650001602537650002602553650001502579650001202594650001202606651001002618700001702628700001402645773012002659856009002779852000902869655001202878IND60682579020221118194503.0200130e199710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068257902DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1574-0862.1997.tb00464.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsenso‐Okyere, W.K.10aUnderstanding the health and nutritional status of children in Ghana  ap. 59-74.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe data set of the Ghana Living Standards Survey (GLSS, round 1, 1987/1988) was utilized to analyse the principal determinants (publicly and privately) of health and nutrition of children under five in Ghana. While in most health and nutrition studies the emphasis is either on health‐related factors such as occurrence of illness, immunization, accessibility to light (electricity), the role of breastfeeding, or on food availability and food‐consumption‐related factors, in the present study, an attempt has been made to incorporate both aspects simultaneously. On the basis of the GLSS, Ghanaian households spend at the average approximately 60% of total expenses on food. Changes in relative prices of the various food commodities differently affect household food availability. Lowering prices of relatively cheap foods (e.g., millet, cassava) tends to have a strong positive effect on total household kcal availability. At the level of the household, the absolute number of nondependents, presumed to represent the available labour force, is positively correlated with household food availability. There is also a positive correlation between the mothers' level of education (10 yrs of schooling and above) and the nutrition level of children. Occurrence of illness in children could be shown to negatively affect their health and nutrition status. Finally, a specific finding in the analysis was a rather strong negative effect of prolonged breastfeeding on the nutritional status of children. Among the policy recommendations emanating from the research are: (1) promotion of efficient production and marketing of cassava, (2) efforts to achieve slowing down of rural‐urban migration to prevent labour shortages in rural households, (3) improving water and sanitation conditions, (4) expanding immunization programmes in particular in rural areas, and (5) promoting better weaning practices when children are no longer fully breastfed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreast feeding 3acassava 3achildren 3adata collection 3aeducational status 3aelectricity 3afood availability 3afoods 3ahouseholds 3aimmunization 3aissues and policy 3alabor force 3amillets 3amothers 3anutritional status 3aprices 3arural areas 3arural urban migration 3asanitation 3asurveys 3aweaning 3aGhana1 aAsante, F.A.1 aNubé, M.0 tAgricultural economics.g1997 Oct., v. 17, no. 1 p.59-74dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl41636x0169-51507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-0862.1997.tb00464.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02270naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245009400163300001400257520110400271592002801375650004301403650001801446650001601464650000901480650002301489650001801512650001701530650001601547650000701563650001201570650001101582650002101593650002301614650001301637700002101650773011501671856007701786852000901863655001201872IND60765380120221118011512.0220419e20080624xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076538012DNAL7 a10.17221/642-hortsci2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTzortzakis N, G.10aImpacts of the substrate medium on tomato yield and fruit quality in soilless cultivation  ap. 83-89.  aThe performance and suitability of different substrates for the soilless culture of tomato plants (<I>Lycopersicum esculentum</I> Mill., cv.

Plants grown in a maize stem-containing medium produced earlier fruits, followed by pumice. Plants grown in pumice and perlite substrates obtained lower total yield; a higher yield was associated with the addition of maize shredded stems. Pumice + 50% maize and 100% maize produced higher total number of fruits per plant. Fruit quality parameters such as mean fruit weight, fruit firmness, total soluble solids, titratable acidity, ascorbic acid and carotenoids were influenced by the treatment, while EC, pH and dry matter content were not. The results suggest that the addition of maize in perlite and pumice could improve inorganic substrates properties for tomato soilless culture, leading to higher yields and better fruit quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3aascorbic acid 3acarotenoids 3acorn 3adry matter content 3afruit quality 3afruit weight 3agreenhouses 3apH 3aperlite 3apumice 3asoilless culture 3atitratable acidity 3atomatoes1 aEconomakis C, D.0 tZahradnictví.g, v. 35, no. 2 p.83-89dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21417x0862-867X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/642-hortsci3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02645naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245008100158520130900239592002801548650002401576650002001600650003101620650001801651650002101669650001101690650002901701650001901730650001501749650001501764650001701779651001001796700001901806700001801825700003501843700001701878700001501895700001401910700001301924700001801937700001901955773012901974856007502103852000902178655001202187IND60757942220221119135355.0211125e20211119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075794222DNAL7 a10.3390/rs132246802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Yangyang 12aA Satellite-Based Method for National Winter Wheat Yield Estimating in China  aSatellite-based models have tremendous potential for monitoring crop production because satellite data can provide temporally and spatially continuous crop growth information at large scale. This study used a satellite-based vegetation production model (i.e., eddy covariance light use efficiency, EC-LUE) to estimate national winter wheat gross primary production, and then combined this model with the harvest index (ratio of aboveground biomass to yield) to convert the estimated winter wheat production to yield. Specifically, considering the spatial differences of the harvest index, we used a cross-validation method to invert the harvest index of winter wheat among counties, municipalities and provinces. Using the field-surveyed and statistical yield data, we evaluated the model performance, and found the model could explain more than 50% of the spatial variations of the yield both in field-surveyed regions and most administrative units. Overall, the mean absolute percentage errors of the yield are less than 20% in most counties, municipalities and provinces, and the mean absolute percentage errors for the production of winter wheat at the national scale is 4.06%.

Four vegetation types—montane desert steppe (mean elevation: 1761 m), montane shrub (mean elevation: 2077 m), subalpine coniferous forest (mean elevation: 2485 m), and subalpine shrub (mean elevation: 2903 m)—were sampled on the western slope of the Helan Mountains. The 16SrRNA gene and ITS1 were performed by single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing with the PacBio sequencing platform. The Chao1 and Shannon–Wiener diversity of soil fungi and bacteria were more diverse in the soil of the lower elevation gradient compared to that of the upper one. Differences in abundance among phyla were found via One-way ANOVA(analysis of variance), yet the dominant soil fungal phyla (Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Mortierellomycota) and bacterial phyla (Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Bacteroidetes) were the same across the elevation gradient. Pearson correlations and redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that plant diversity (Shannon–Wiener diversity [H] and Margalef richness [D]), solar radiation, mean annual temperature, soil organic matter, soil moisture content, slope, mean annual precipitation, and elevation all significantly influenced the community composition of different soil fungal and bacterial phyla. Although plant diversity significantly affects fungal and bacterial diversity, the results imply that the influence of plant functional diversity on soil microbial community variation should not be ignored.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcidobacteria 3aAscomycota 3aBacteroidetes 3aBasidiomycota 3aProteobacteria 3aaltitude 3aanalysis of variance 3aatmospheric precipitation 3aclimate 3acommunity structure 3aconiferous forests 3aecosystems 3afunctional diversity 3agenes 3ashrubs 3asoil fungi 3asoil organic matter 3asoil water content 3asolar radiation 3aspecies diversity 3asteppes 3atemperature 3atopographic slope 3aChina1 aYu, Jian 1 aWang, Jifei 1 aLi, Xiaowei 0 tForests.g2022 Aug. 26, v. 13, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f130913603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04679naa a2200865 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245017100167506011700338506007600455520211700531592002802648506003702676650001402713650001902727650001902746650001902765650001402784650001702798650001802815650002402833650002402857650000902881650003702890650002402927650002102951650002002972650001302992650002803005650002503033650003203058653002303090653002603113653001703139653002103156653001003177653001003187653000903197653000803206653000703214653000703221653000803228653000803236653000803244653000903252653000903261653001003270653000903280653000903289653000803298653000903306653000803315653001003323700001703333700001303350700001103363700001203374700001703386700001603403700001303419700005703432700001403489700001703503700001803520700001703538700005603555773009603611856008503707852000903792655001203801IND60780582220221207090511.0220809e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078058222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phymed.2022.1542832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Hanzhao10aTetrahydrocurcumin improves lipopolysaccharide-induced myocardial dysfunction by inhibiting oxidative stress and inflammation via JNK/ERK signaling pathway regulation  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAcute myocardial dysfunction in patients with sepsis is attributed to oxidative stress, inflammation, and cardiomyocyte loss; however, specific drugs for its prevention are still lacking. Tetrahydrocurcumin (THC) has been proven to contribute to the prevention of various cardiovascular diseases by decreasing oxidative stress and inflammation. This study was performed to investigate the functions and mechanism of action of THC in septic cardiomyopathy. After the oral administration of THC (120 mg/kg) for 5 consecutive days, a mouse model of sepsis was established via intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 10 mg/kg) injection. Following this, cardiac function was assessed, pathological section staining was performed, and inflammatory markers were detected. Myocardial systolic function was severely compromised in parallel with the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and enhanced cardiomyocyte apoptosis in mice with sepsis. These adverse changes were markedly reversed in response to THC treatment in septic mice as well as in LPS-treated H9c2 cells. Mechanistically, THC inhibited the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6, by upregulating mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 1, to block the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK). Additionally, THC enhanced the levels of antioxidant proteins, including nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2, superoxide dismutase 2, and NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1, while decreasing gp91ᵖʰᵒˣ expression. Furthermore, upon THC treatment, Bcl-2 expression was significantly increased, along with a decline in Bax and cleaved caspase-3 expression, which reduced cardiomyocyte loss. Our findings indicate that THC exhibited protective potential against septic cardiomyopathy by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation through the regulation of JNK/ERK signaling. The findings of this study provide a basis for the further evaluation of THC as a therapeutic agent against septic cardiomyopathy.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aapoptosis 3acardiac output 3acardiomyocytes 3acardiomyopathy 3acaspase-3 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3alipopolysaccharides 3amechanism of action 3amice 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aoral administration 3aoxidative stress 3aphosphorylation 3aquinones 3areactive oxygen species 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aTetrahydrocurcumin 0aSeptic cardiomyopathy 0aInflammation 0aOxidative stress 0aCCK-8 0aCK-MB 0acTnI 0aERK 0aHE 0aIL 0aJNK 0aLDH 0aLPS 0aLVEF 0aLVFS 0aMAPKs 0aNQO1 0aNrf2 0aROS 0aSOD2 0aTHC 0aTUNEL1 aZhang, Liyun1 aJia, Hao1 aXu, Lu1 aCao, Yu1 aZhai, Mengen1 aLi, Kaifeng1 aXia, Lin1 aJiang, Liqing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2595-91091 aLi, Xiang1 aZhou, Yenong1 aLiu, Jincheng1 aYu, Shiqiang1 aDuan, Weixun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4475-70670 tPhytomedicine.g2022 Sept., v. 104 p.154283-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:12402x0944-71137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2022.1542833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01695naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001500154245011800169300001600287500001700303520062900320592002800949650001100977650000900988650001600997650001001013650002501023650001801048700001701066700001701083700001601100700001501116773011701131856008801248852000901336655001201345IND60571360520221120204024.0170712e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057136052DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1748-5827.2012.01285.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoupil, A.10aEmbolised mesothelial cells in a tracheobronchial lymph node associated with idiopathic chylopericardium in a dog  ap. 664-667.  aCase Reports  aA 5·5‐year‐old male castrated Bernese mountain dog presented with respiratory difficulties and was diagnosed with haemorrhagic pericardial effusion which transformed into chylopericardium.

We characterized the community composition and diversity of cyanobacterial nifH phylotypes associated with each of two feather moss species (Pleurozium schreberi and Hylocomium splendens) on each of 30 lake islands varying in ecosystem properties in northern Sweden. • Nitrogen fixation was measured using acetylene reduction, and nifH sequences were amplified using general and cyanobacterial selective primers, separated and analyzed using density gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) or cloning, and further sequenced for phylogenetic analyses. • Analyses of DGGE fingerprinting patterns revealed two host‐specific clusters (one for each moss species), and sequence analysis showed five clusters of nifH phylotypes originating from heterocystous cyanobacteria. For H. splendens only, N2 fixation was related to both nifH composition and diversity among islands. • We demonstrated that the cyanobacterial communities associated with feather mosses show a high degree of host specificity. However, phylotype composition and diversity, and nitrogen fixation, did not differ among groups of islands that varied greatly in their availability of resources. These results suggest that moss species identity, but not extrinsic environmental conditions, serves as the primary determinant of nitrogen‐fixing cyanobacterial communities that inhabit mosses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3aHylocomium splendens 3aPleurozium schreberi 3aacetylene reduction 3aboreal forests 3acommunity structure 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3agenes 3ahost specificity 3aislands 3alakes 3amosses and liverworts 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fixation 3asequence analysis 2aBiodiversity 2aBryopsidaxmicrobiology 2aCyanobacteriaxenzymologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDNA Fingerprinting 2aEcosystem 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aHost Specificity 2aNitrogen Fixationxgenetics 2aOxidoreductasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aTrees 3aSweden 0aSweden1 aBay, Guillaume1 aRasmussen, Ulla1 aWardle, David A.1 aNilsson, Marie‐Charlotte0 tnew phytologist.g2011 Oct., v. 192, no. 2 p.507-517dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2011.03809.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02771naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005800146245019600204300001600400520115200416592002801568650002801596650003301624650001001657650001201667650001201679650001601691650001801707650001601725650001201741650002701753650001201780650001701792650001201809653002801821653001401849653001701863653001801880653001801898653000901916700002701925700002301952700002201975700002301997700002202020700002102042773010002063856008102163852000902244655001202253IND60611137420221121100440.0200508e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061113742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fm.2018.07.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlmeria, Sonia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0558-548810aEvaluation of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration validated method for detection of Cyclospora cayetanensis in high-risk fresh produce matrices and a method modification for a prepared dish  ap. 497-503.  aThe performance of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) validated method for regulatory detection of Cyclospora cayetanensis in leafy greens and berries was evaluated in additional high-risk fresh produce items and in a dish prepared with these produce commodities. The method was robust and reproducible in basil, parsley, shredded carrots, shredded cabbage and carrot mix, and could detect as few as 5 oocysts in 25 g samples. Some differences in C. cayetanensis detection were found among the fresh produce analyzed. Significantly lower target gene copy numbers per reaction were obtained with shredded carrots, and shredded cabbage and carrot mix compared to leafy greens, which highlights the importance of evaluating the performance characteristics of validated methods in different food matrices.

Astragaloside IV (AS-Ⅳ) is a phytochemical naturally occurring in Astragalus membranaceus that has good anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-stress properties. However, the effects of AS-IV on the homeostasis of Th17/Treg cells in colitis mice remains unknown. To investigate the protective effects and potential immunomodulatory mechanisms of AS-IV on UC. This study was constructed for DSS-induced acute colitis and recurrent colitis, with AS-IV administered prophylactically and therapeutically, respectively. The balance of Th17/Treg cells was analyzed by flow cytometry, their specific nuclear transcription factors were detected by RT-PCR as well as their secreted inflammatory cytokines were detected by ELISA and RT-PCR. Notch signaling-related proteins were detected by RT-PCR and Western blotting. Oxidative stress indicators were measured by biochemical technology. In this study, AS-IV treatment not only effectively prevented and alleviated the clinical symptoms of DSS-induced colitis mice, including weight loss, DAI soaring, colon length shortening and colon weight gain, but also significantly improved ulcer formation, inflammatory cell infiltration and index, and regulated the expression of inflammatory cytokines in colon tissues. Importantly, the efficacy of high-dose AS-IV (100 mg/kg/day) in mice with recurrent colitis in this study was comparable to that of 5-ASA. AS-IV early administration was able to reshape the homeostasis of Th17/Treg cells in mice with acute colitis; meanwhile, AS-IV inhibited Th17 cell responses and promoted Treg cell responses in mice with recurrent colitis. Moreover, AS-IV not only inhibited the activation of Notch signaling pathway in colitis mice, but also prevented and ameliorated DSS-induced oxidative stress injury. In conclusion, AS-IV effectively prevented and alleviated UC by reshaping Th17/Treg cell homeostasis and anti-oxidative stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAstragalus membranaceus 3aantioxidants 3aastragalosides 3acolon 3acytokines 3aflow cytometry 3ahomeostasis 3aoxidative stress 3aphytochemicals 3atherapeutics 3aulcerative colitis 3aweight gain 3aweight loss 0aAstragaloside IV 0aUlcerative colitis 0aTh17/Treg 0aAnti-oxidative stress1 aLiu, Wenjun1 aXiong, Yanxia1 aLi, Yingmeng1 aWan, Qi1 aZhou, Wen1 aZhao, Haimei1 aXiao, Qiuping1 aLiu, Duanyong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2855-28110 tPhytomedicine.g2022 Sept., v. 104 p.154287-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:12402x0944-71137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2022.1542873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03749naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072000900165072000900174072000900183072000900192100001800201245014100219300001600360500002400376520171000400650001902110650002002129650001202149650001402161650001702175650002002192650002402212650001502236650002202251650001402273650002602287650002002313650001602333650001202349650002602361650001002387650004502397650004402442650003802486650001602524653002402540653001802564653002302582700001702605700001702622700002102639700001802660773012202678852000902800856008602809856010802895930003303003945002503036946001303061961001303074655001203087IND4383012620221122052529.0060823e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438301262DNAL7 a166861572pmid7 a10.1603/0022-0493-99.2.5372doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aF400 0aF600 0aF3001 aCastell, C.L.10aInfluence of Plant Ontogeny and Abiotic Factors on Resistance of Glandular-Haired Alfalfa to Potato Leafhopper (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae)  ap. 537-543.  aIncludes references  aLaboratory experiments were conducted to characterize the trichome-based defense of glandular-haired alfalfa, Medicago sativa L., against the potato leafhopper, Empoasca fabae (Harris). Within-plant variability in leafhopper resistance was examined by caging adult leafhoppers to either basal or apical stem internodes of the leafhopper-resistant, glandular-haired M. sativa genotype G98A or the susceptible, nonglandular-haired M. sativa 'Ranger'. Young, actively secreting glandular trichomes are located on apical internodes of G98A, whereas senesced gland heads are found on older, basal internodes of G98A. After 96 h, the highest cumulative leafhopper mortality and lowest number of excretory droplets were associated with apical internodes of G98A. No difference was detected in mortality and feeding levels among insects caged to basal internodes of G98A and basal and apical internodes of Ranger. The influence of abiotic factors on leafhopper resistance was evaluated by caging adult leafhoppers to either G98A or Ranger under four combinations of low and high light (250 and 1,000 μmol s-1 m-2) and temperature regimes (17 and 30°C). After 96 h, the highest cumulative mortality was associated with leafhoppers confined to G98A under high light and high temperature conditions. Temperature level and plant type also had an effect on the production of excretory droplets, resulting in the highest number of excretory droplets being associated with Ranger under the high temperature regime. These results indicate that certain regions of M. sativa G98A are better protected against the potato leafhopper than others and that temperature influences resistance levels of glandular-haired alfalfa. 3aEmpoasca fabae 3aMedicago sativa 3aalfalfa 3atrichomes 3aplant glands 3apest resistance 3avarietal resistance 3ainternodes 3aplant development 3amortality 3aenvironmental factors 3alight intensity 3atemperature 2aAnimals 2aHemipteraxphysiology 2aLight 2aMedicago sativaxgeneticsxparasitology. 2aPlant Diseasesxgeneticsxparasitology. 2aPlant Leavesxanatomy & histology 2aTemperature 0aglandular trichomes 0aplant defense 0aexcretory droplets1 aRanger, C.M.1 aBackus, E.A.1 aEllersieck, M.R.1 aJohnson, D.W.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2006 Apr., v. 99, no. 2 p.537-543dEntomological Society of Americax0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0022-0493-99.2.5373Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://puck.esa.catchword.org/vl=4081177/cl=17/nw=1/rpsv/journal/journal3_home.htm3electronic resource  a20060920b20061003c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/09/19  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04464naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245009700158520309000255592002803345650003103373650002103404650002903425650003503454650004303489650001503532650002903547650000903576650001503585650001203600650001503612651001003627651001803637700002003655700002003675700002003695700001303715700001303728700001603741700001803757700001803775773012903793856007503922852000903997655001204006IND60757942520221119135416.0211125e20211119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075794252DNAL7 a10.3390/rs132246822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yahao 10aCharacterizing Spatial Patterns of Pine Wood Nematode Outbreaks in Subtropical Zone in China  aPine wood nematode (PWN), Bursaphelenchus xyophilus, originating from North America, has caused great ecological and economic hazards to pine trees worldwide, especially affecting the coniferous forests and mixed forests of masson pine in subtropical regions of China. In order to prevent PWN disease expansion, the risk level and susceptivity of PWN outbreaks need to be predicted in advance. For this purpose, we established a prediction model to estimate the susceptibility and risk level of PWN with vegetation condition variables, anthropogenic activity variables, and topographic feature variables across a large-scale district. The study was conducted in Dangyang City, Hubei Province in China, which was located in a subtropical zone. Based on the location of PWN points derived from airborne imagery and ground survey in 2018, the predictor variables were conducted with remote sensing and geographical information system (GIS) data, which contained vegetation indices including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference moisture index (NDMI), normalized burn ratio (NBR), and normalized red edge index (NDRE) from Sentinel-2 imagery in the previous year (2107), the distance to different level roads which indicated anthropogenic activity, topographic variables in including elevation, slope, and aspect. We compared the fitting effects of different machine learning algorithms such as random forest (RF), K-neighborhood (KNN), support vector machines (SVM), and artificial neural networks (ANN) and predicted the probability of the presence of PWN disease in the region. In addition, we classified PWN points to different risk levels based on the density distribution of PWN sites and built a PWN risk level model to predict the risk levels of PWN outbreaks in the region. The results showed that: (1) the best model for the predictive probability of PWN presence is the RF classification algorithm. For the presence prediction of the dead trees caused by PWN, the detection rate (DR) was 96.42%, the false alarm rate (FAR) was 27.65%, the false detection rate (FDR) was 4.16%, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was equal to 0.96; (2) anthropogenic activity variables had the greatest effect on PWN occurrence, while the effects of slope and aspect were relatively weak, and the maximum, minimum, and median values of remote sensing indices were more correlated with PWN occurrence; (3) modeling analysis of different risk levels of PWN outbreak indicated that high-risk level areas were the easiest to monitor and identify, while lower incidence areas were identified with relatively low accuracy. The overall accuracy of the risk level of the PWN outbreak was identified with an AUC value of 0.94. From the research findings, remote sensing data combined with GIS data can accurately predict the probability distribution of the occurrence of PWN disease. The accuracy of identification of high-risk areas is higher than other risk levels, and the results of the study may improve control of PWN disease spread.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBursaphelenchus xylophilus 3aPinus massoniana 3aanthropogenic activities 3ageographic information systems 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aprediction 3aprobability distribution 3arisk 3asubtropics 3asurveys 3atopography 3aChina 3aNorth America1 aDian, Yuanyong 1 aZhou, Jingjing 1 aPeng, Shoulian 1 aHu, Yue 1 aHu, Lei 1 aHan, Zemin 1 aFang, Xinwei 1 aCui, Hongxia 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Nov. 19, v. 13, no. 22dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs132246823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02753naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001800191245006900209300001400278506007600292520113500368592002801503506003701531650001801568650001801586650002601604650001501630650002001645650002801665650001101693650002001704650003001724650000901754650002701763650002601790650001501816650002301831650001401854653003101868653002401899653002001923653001401943700001401957700002101971773012401992856008502116961001302201852000902214655001202223IND60628329820221207093234.0190318e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062832982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2018.12.0062doi7 aPMC65269552pmcid7 a307127932pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaabis, Sarah10aEffects and immune responses of probiotic treatment in ruminants  ap. 58-66.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGut microbial colonization and establishment are vital to ruminant health and production.

In the North Eastern USA, this pest causes severe economic loss in agricultural crops. Breeding populations have been confirmed in Switzerland and Canada; however, their pathways of entry and genetic diversity remain unknown. To determine invasion pathways and source population(s), the diversity of specimens from Asia, North America, and Europe was investigated. Genetic diversity in Asia was higher than that in the Canada and Switzerland. Although three haplotypes were detected among Canadian H. halys, one haplotype dominated. In contrast, two out of three haplotypes were found frequently among Swiss samples. Based on molecular data and interception records it appears likely that H. halys in Canada is derived from the movement of established US populations. Further, North American populations likely originated from the Hebei/Beijing regions of China. The area of origin of the Swiss samples remains unclear. Although the dominant haplotype in Switzerland was consistent with Asian samples collected in the Hebei and Beijing provinces, it was not the dominant haplotype in these regions and further sampling is necessary to its confirm the distribution and abundance in the area of origin. The remaining two haplotypes were unique to Switzerland and no matches were found among our Asian samples. Interestingly, no haplotypes were shared between the North American and Swiss samples, indicating that the two invasions were separate and distinct events and did not result from the movement of goods and materials between USA and Europe.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHalyomorpha halys 3acrops 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3apests 3aCanada 3aChina 3aEastern United States 3aSwitzerland1 aHaye, T.1 aFraser, H.1 aZhang, J.0 tJournal of pest science.g2014 Mar., v. 87, no. 1 p.17-28dSpringer-Verlagx1612-47587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10340-013-0529-3  aDNAL 7aarticle02706naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001400146245005100160300001400211520141100225592002801636650001601664650000901680650001201689650002401701650001901725650002401744650000901768650002801777650001201805650002001817650001001837650001601847650001001863650001601873653001201889653001901901653001601920700001801936700002301954700001401977700002001991773013602011856008002147852000902227655001202236IND60622089020221121163059.0181123e200602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062208902DNAL7 a10.1177/10820132060623872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuber, E.10aVacuum Cooling of Cooked Mussels (Perna perna)  ap. 19-25.  aMussels pass through a thermal treatment during industrial processing with hot water or steam and then are pre-cooled before the manual extraction of the meat. This pre-cooling is classically accomplished by the immersion of the cooked mussels in cold water. In this work, vacuum cooling of mussels after the cooking stage was used as a technique to quickly decrease the product temperature and to avoid a possible microbial contamination by the cooling water or by manipulation. In about 3 minutes, mussels were cooled from about 90 °C to 20 °C. The relative weight loss during the vacuum cooling of the whole sample (meat and shell) was about 8% of the initial sample’s weight, for temperatures drop cited above. In this way, there was a 8.7 0.26 °C temperature drop for each 1% of weight loss. For separated meat (without shell), the ratio was 7.5 0.30 ºC per 1% weight loss, which agreed with the literature for vacuum cooling of meats in general. A simple numerical simulation was able to determine weight loss during the vacuum cooling process, providing data that agreed very well with experimental results. The vacuum cooling technique is a promising alternative for processing pre-cooked mussels, because process time is shortened and cross-contamination risk is significantly reduced in the cooling stage. The water loss is not a serious problem when the cooled mussels are canned in brine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPerna perna 3acold 3acooking 3across contamination 3aheat treatment 3amathematical models 3ameat 3amicrobial contamination 3amussels 3aprocessing time 3asteam 3atemperature 3awater 3aweight loss 0amussels 0avacuum cooling 0aweight loss1 aSoares, L.

The test elicited a far greater proportion of ‘no preference’ responses from placebo pairs than expected, thus increasing its power. Although the reasons for this were not fully understood at the time the test was first introduced, a necessary understanding of the mechanism later evolved with the help of a recently published systems analysis and some results from social psychology. Later, to this was added a warning that the test was prone to odd sample bias. The bias could be avoided by adjustment of the counterbalancing controls, using a method similar to that for the replicated duo-trio difference-preference test. Unfortunately, there had been some misunderstanding about the instructions in the warning, so an experiment was performed to re-affirm the warning using the correct instructions. The experiment confirmed that the test was prone to the odd sample bias, so that the counterbalancing changes were adopted. Yet, the bias was not present for all products being tested. This suggested that there are still some questions to be answered for what is still an under-researched area.  aPublisher supplied data 3afood quality 3aplacebos 3apsychology 0aPaired preference tests 0aTriadic preference test 0aPlacebo pairs 0aInattentive preference choice 0aIdenticality norm and power 0aCentral and subroutine processing 0aOdd sample bias1 aSong, Jiahui1 aQian, Jiayi1 aZhong, Fang1 aO'Mahony, Michael0 tFood quality and preference.g2022 Dec., v. 102 p.104669-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46499x0950-32937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodqual.2022.1046693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02688naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245007300165300001800238520105000256592002801306650002301334650003401357650001801391650002501409650001601434650002101450650001801471650001701489650001701506700002101523700002101544700002101565700001801586700002001604700002301624700002501647700001901672700001901691700002301710700002101733700002201754700002201776700001901798700002601817700001601843700001901859700002101878700001801899773012601917856008202043852000902125655001202134IND60567916020180615000000.0170501e20170309xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056791602DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b007212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetit, Tristan10aUnusual Water Hydrogen Bond Network around Hydrogenated Nanodiamonds  ap. 5185-5194.  aNanodiamonds exhibit exceptional colloidal properties in aqueous media that lead to a wide range of applications in nanomedicine and other fields. Nevertheless, the role of surface chemistry on the hydration of nanodiamonds remains poorly understood. Here, we probed the water hydrogen bond network in aqueous dispersions of nanodiamonds by infrared, Raman, and X-ray absorption spectroscopies applied in situ in aqueous environment. Aqueous dispersions of nanodiamonds with hydrogenated, carboxylated, hydroxylated, and polyfunctional surface terminations were compared. A different hydrogen bond network was found in hydrogenated nanodiamonds dispersions compared to dispersions of nanodiamonds with other surface terminations. Although no hydrogen bonds are formed between water and hydrogenated surface groups, a long-range disruption of the water hydrogen bond network is evidenced in hydrogenated nanodiamonds dispersion. We propose that this unusual hydration structure results from electron accumulation at the diamond–water interface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3acarboxylation 3acolloidal properties 3adispersions 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydroxylation 3ananodiamonds 3ananomedicine1 aPuskar, Ljiljana1 aDolenko, Tatiana1 aChoudhury, Sneha1 aRitter, Eglof1 aBurikov, Sergey1 aLaptinskiy, Kirill1 aBrzustowski, Quentin1 aSchade, Ulrich1 aYuzawa, Hayato1 aNagasaka, Masanari1 aKosugi, Nobuhiro1 aKurzyp, Magdalena1 aVenerosy, Amélie1 aGirard, Hugues1 aArnault, Jean-Charles1 aOsawa, Eiji1 aNunn, Nicholas1 aShenderova, Olga1 aAziz, Emad F.0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2017 Mar. 09, v. 121, no. 9 p.5185-5194dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.7b007213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02125naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002400142245012600166300001300292520103700305592002801342650002001370650001101390650001401401650001301415650001101428650001101439650001301450650000701463650001901470650001501489650001401504650002301518650001001541773011401551856007701665852000901742655001201751IND60765380620221118011640.0220422e20080212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076538062DNAL7 a10.17221/645-hortsci2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSotiropoulos Τ, E.10aPerformance of the apple (<i>Malus domestica</i> Borkh) cultivar Imperial Double Red Delicious grafted on five rootstocks  ap. 7-11.  aThe performance of the apple (<I>Malus domestica</I> Borkh) cultivar Imperial Double Red Delicious (Imperial D.R.D.) grafted on the following 5 rootstocks: (<I>I</I>) seedling, (<I>ii</I>) M 7, (<I>ii</I>) MM 104, (<I>iv</i) MM 106, and (<I>v</I>) MM 109 was investigated.

(-)-Epigallocatechin-gallate (EGCG) is one of the major potent green tea catechins; however, detailed mechanisms of EGCG transport and metabolism in the human small intestine remain unknown due to lack of a suitable model. We investigated metabolite profiles of EGCG in the fresh human duodenal biopsy, cryopreserved human duodenal mucosal enterocytes and Caco-2 cells, and found that EGCG was readily metabolized into methylated and sulphate conjugates, which are major metabolites in these models. Next, we examined possible efflux transporters of EGCG and its metabolites using specific inhibitors of MRP2, P-gp and BCRP in Caco-2 cell monolayers. MRP2 was thereby identified as an efflux transporter, and further analysis using MRP2-knockout Caco-2 cells and vesicular transport assays confirmed that MRP2 is a selective efflux transporter of EGCG and its metabolites. Assuming that functional inhibition of MRP2 would result in efficient uptake of EGCG, we screened for MRP2 functional blockade and identified quercetin, which led to increased intracellular accumulation and basal transport of EGCG in Caco-2 cells. This result suggested that co-administration of quercetin and EGCG would enable efficient transport of EGCG in the human intestine. Therefore, we performed co-oral administration of quercetin and EGCG in human subjects to examine whether this occurred in humans. These studies demonstrated that MRP2 is a selective transporter of EGCG and conjugates and Caco-2 is a model to examine transport mechanisms and metabolites of polyphenols in the human small intestine.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aP-glycoproteins 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3abiopsy 3acryopreservation 3aenterocytes 3aepigallocatechin gallate 3aflavanols 3agreen tea 3ahuman cell lines 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3amethylation 3amodels 3apolyphenols 3aquercetin 3asmall intestine 3asulfates 0a(-)-Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) 0aMultidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) 0aEfflux transporter 0aIntestinal absorption 0aCaco-2 cells 0aBCRP 0aEGCG 0aEGCG-3”Me 0aEGCG-4”Me 0aLC-MS 0aMRP2 0aP-gp1 aHayashi, Akane1 aIkeda, Naohiro1 aMorita, Osamu1 aTasaki, Junichi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1798-51600 tJournal of nutritional biochemistry.g2022 Sept., v. 107 p.109071-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl44770x0955-28637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnutbio.2022.1090713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02904naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006300152245008600215300001600301520149500317592002801812650001201840650001901852650001501871650001101886650001301897650001301910650002201923650002001945651001001965653001501975653002201990653002202012653001902034653002002053653002802073653001802101700006302119700002202182700002302204700001602227773010702243856008702350852000902437655001202446IND60611137720221121100420.0190405e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061113772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jrurstud.2017.05.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChaudhury, Abrar S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3094-763910aTies that bind: Local networks, communities and adaptive capacity in rural Ghana  ap. 214-228.  aCurrent models of adaptation to climate change focus on common causes of vulnerability among individuals and communities in an attempt to improve their capacity to adapt. These models tend to neglect the impact on vulnerability of local relationships that include political and economic power structures. We use social network analysis to examine the connectivity and positions of vulnerable rural households and their capacity to adapt. We collected empirical data from a community of 58 smallholders in upper west Ghana on external relations with 'local actors' that are independent, operate beyond the community yet have direct relations with the community. These connections provide important resources and knowledge to build adaptive capacity that would not be generated from within the community. Our results highlight that certain external relations expose households to knowledge and other forms of capital, which in turn strengthen their ability to access and mobilise resources to respond to environmental change. However, not all external relations offer equal opportunities, which results in a stratified community and variation in the households’ capacity to adapt. The network approach also identifies points where local actors can link communities and households to remote agencies crucial for planning and implementing effective adaptation.

This epithelium contains the first lens cells to encounter noxious external stimuli and cells that can develop compensatory or protective responses. Lens epithelial cells express the gap junction proteins, connexin43 (Cx43) and connexin50 (Cx50). Cx43 and Cx50 form gap junction channels and hemichannels with different properties. Although they may form heteromeric hemichannels, Cx43 and Cx50 probably do not form heterotypic channels in the lens. Cx50 channels make their greatest contribution to intercellular communication during the early postnatal period; subsequently, Cx43 becomes the predominant connexin supporting intercellular communication. Although epithelial Cx43 appears dispensable for lens development, Cx50 is critical for epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation. Cx43 and Cx50 hemichannels and gap junction channels are regulated by multiple different agents. Lens epithelial cell connexins contribute to both normal lens physiology and pathology.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acell communication 3acell proliferation 3aconnexins 3aepithelial cells 3aepithelium 3aeye lens 3agap junctions 3apostpartum period 0aConnexin43 0aConnexin50 0aCataract 0aLens1 aMinogue, Peter J.1 aOsmolak, Patricia1 aSnabb, Joseph I.1 aBeyer, Eric C.0 tFEBS letters.g2014 Apr. 17, v. 588, no. 8 p.1297-1303dElsevier B.V.aFederation of European Biochemical SocietieswJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2013.12.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02810naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245011700164300001400281520139100295592002801686650002101714650001001735650001901745650001801764650001301782650002201795650002501817650001701842650001701859650001801876650001001894653001701904653001801921653002101939653001801960653002401978653002802002653002602030653002602056700001802082700001502100773013602115856008002251852000902331655001202340IND60622089220221121163039.0181123e200602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062208922DNAL7 a10.1177/10820132060624432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZamora, L. M.10aComparative Survival Rates of Lactic Acid Bacteria Isolated from Blood, Following Spray-drying and Freeze-drying  ap. 77-84.  aThe effect of two dehydration technologies, spray-drying and freeze-drying, on the viability of 12 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were compared. All LAB cultures had been previously isolated from porcine blood and were candidates to be used as biopreservatives in order to maintain the quality of porcine blood until further processing to obtain added-value blood derivatives is carried out. The residual viability and the reductions in microbial counts in dried LAB samples at 20 °C and 5 °C during 60-day storage were determined. Cellular damage due to freeze-drying was observed immediately after drying whereas cellular damage due to spray-drying did not become evident until the subsequent phase of storage. For most of the strains, the faster decrease in viability of spray-dried as compared to freeze-dried cultures was compensated by the higher percentage of viable cells obtained after dehydration, leading to comparable survival rates at the end of the storage period. Dehydration resulted in a good alternative to freezing at 80 °C for preservation purposes. Spray-drying has been shown to be as suitable as freeze-drying for preserving LAB strains during a 2-month storage period. Results suggest the possibility of achieving a good formulation system for the LAB strains with a high number of viable cells to be used for the industrial development of bioprotective cultures.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiopreservatives 3ablood 3acell viability 3afreeze drying 3afreezing 3aindustrialization 3alactic acid bacteria 3aspray drying 3astorage time 3asurvival rate 3aswine 0aspray-drying 0afreeze-drying 0abio-preservation 0aporcine blood 0aLactococcus garviae 0aEnterococcus raffinosus 0aLactobacillus murinus 0aLactobacillus reuteri1 aCarretero, C.1 aParés, D.0 tFood science and technology international.g2006 Feb., v. 12, no. 1 p.77-84dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl3949853x1082-01327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10820132060624433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02281naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002500156245011000181300001400291520120600305592002801511650002401539650001201563650000901575650001101584650001501595650001101610650001701621650001901638651001001657700001401667700001701681700001901698700001701717773010701734856005701841852000901898655001201907IND50085922120221118010200.0140412e198901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008592212DNAL7 a10.1111/j.2042-3306.1989.tb02090.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJENKINSON, D.

Clinical data were collected for comparison with the histological results in each instance. Horses were assigned to one of three categories on the basis of the resulting change in the number of thin glandular profiles in a cooler environment. Group 1, which was classed as normal, had a low initial value, which was maintained. Group 2, typical of mild and moderately affected animals, had a high initial value, which fell markedly after as little as six weeks in the cool environment. Animals in Group 3, classed as severely affected, had a high initial value which remained high even after prolonged exposure to the cool environment. Light microscopical examination of the sweat glands in the heat, and after six weeks in a cool environment, provided a means of predicting the degree of anhidrotic severity and the potential for recovery in a cool climate. This was superior to clinical observation, although a diagnostic test based on glandular function is still required.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aclimate 3aheat 3ahorses 3aprediction 3asummer 3asweat glands 3athermal stress 3aChina1 aLONEY, C.1 aELDER, H.

While recent studies provide information on the effects of different tree compositions on biological productivity, water and soil protection, additional parameters such as fodder production by the trees or the impact of silvopasture on the grazing potential themselves have rarely been addressed. We determined fodder production in Acacia victoriae woodland and savanna by measuring annual vegetation and tree biomass growth. We developed mathematical models for calculating the vegetative biomass available for grazing. In order to get accurate estimation for the grazing capacity, we differentiated between the grazing and the browsing fodder availability, and adapted the model to the most abundant grazers in the Negev, goats and sheep. Grazing capacity for sheep and goats was twice bigger in A. victoriae woodland than in the adjacent sustainably managed shrubland and four times higher than in degraded shrubland. The mathematical model presented in this paper can be applied in order to plan and realize high yielding and sustainable silvopasture in arid environments resistant to degradation and desertification while providing adequate fodder reserves during drought years.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcacia 3abiomass 3abrowsing 3adesertification 3adrought 3aforage 3agoats 3agrazing 3amathematical models 3apastures 3aplanning 3aplanting 3arangelands 3asavannas 3asheep 3ashrublands 3atrees 3aIsrael 0aBrowsing 0aDrylands 0aGrazing potential 0aModeling 0aSilvopasture 0aWoodland1 aLeu, S.1 aBudovsky, A.0 tJournal of arid environments.g2013 July, v. 94 p.27-36dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl11719x0140-19637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaridenv.2013.02.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02480naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001300146245008900159300001800248520122800266592002801494650002201522650002001544650001701564650001801581650002201599650002301621650001301644700005801657700001701715700001401732700001301746700005801759700006501817773013501882856008002017852000902097655001202106IND60606092320221120085811.0180724e20180301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060609232DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b122722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Wei10aSingle-Component Oligomer Nanoparticle-Based Size-Dependent Dual-Emission Modulation  ap. 4199-4205.  aMultichromophoric oligomers offer a versatile platform for nanoparticle multicolor fluorescent modulation. A donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D) type oligomer (DDBTD), with blue emitting antenna and red emitting core, is chosen to assemble into fluorescent colloidal nanoparticles (FCNs) using a nanoprecipitation method. By modulating the DDBTD concentrations in good solvent, the DDBTD nanoparticles with average diameters ranging from sub-10 to 300 nm are obtained by the nanoprecipitation process in aqueous solution. Interestingly, multicolor photoluminescence (PL) can be realized from bright blue (∼440 nm) to rose red (∼630 nm) based on FCNs size control. The size-dependent PL originates from the aggregation-enhanced fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from diphenyl-aminofluorenyl antenna unit (blue emitter) to benzothiadiazole-based core (red emitter). Furthermore, the lifetime measurement of the FCNs in excited state shows a size-dependent behavior, which confirms that the size-dependent multicolor PL modulation is adjusted by FRET in the nanoscale oligomer. This work highlights the potential of the single-component multichromophoric oligomer FCNs for luminescent modulation applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence 3ananoparticles 3aphotoluminescence 3aphysical chemistry 3asolvents1 aSun, Mingliang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6245-38441 aYu, Liangmin1 aSong, Xin1 aLi, Feng1 aLee, Chun-Sing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6557-453X1 aRoy, Vellaisamy A.

Single crystals of hybrid perovskites, such as CH₃NH₃PbI₃ and CH₃NH₃PbBr₃, were certified to be advantageous over thin films as photodetectors. However, their resistance toward heat and moisture hinders their future development. Fully inorganic perovskite CsPbBr₃ stands a chance to fill the gap as a novel photodetector with perovskite structure. We revealed the growth of CsPbBr₃ single crystal was of a 2D nucleation mechanism. Similarities of d values and octahedra arrangements along [101] and [020] orientations restricted single-crystal growth. Under optimized conditions, orthorhombic CsPbBr₃ single crystals with (101) crystallographic facets were grown by using methyl alcohol as antisolvent from saturated DMSO solution. The optoelectronic properties of the single crystal were explored through a metal–semiconductor–metal photodetector device. Meanwhile, their steady and transient performances were also investigated. A highest responsivity of 0.028 A/W and a response time of <100 ms were achieved.  aPublisher supplied data 3abromine 3achlorine 3acrystals 3adetectors 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3aelectronic equipment 3aheat 3alead 3amethanol 3aphysical chemistry1 aDu, Songjie1 aZuo, Zhiyuan1 aZhao, Ying1 aCui, Hongzhi1 aZhan, Xiaoyuan0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2017 Mar. 09, v. 121, no. 9 p.4917-4923dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.7b011713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03422naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245007800161300001600239520235100255592002802606650002102634650000902655650002602664650002102690650001702711650001602728650001502744650001702759650002002776650001202796700002102808700001702829773012802846856007702974852000903051655001203060IND60765380920221118011707.0220419e20121205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076538092DNAL7 a10.17221/6464-vetmed2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSiugzdaite, J.10aSusceptibility of Mycoplasma bovis field isolates to antimicrobial agents  ap. 575-582.  aThe purpose of this study was to determine the antibacterial susceptibility of field isolates of Mycoplasma bovis originating from the upper respiratory tract of cattle of different ages. Bacteriological examination of 90 nasal swabs collected from calves at three months of age identified M. bovis in 31 (34.44%) samples. Seventeen (18.88%) of these animals still housed M. bovis in their nasal cavity at nine months and five animals (5.55%) still at seventeen months of age. M. bovis were confirmed by biochemical and antigenic methods. To confirm that these belonged to the M. bovis species isolated mycoplasmas were tested using the PCR method. Fifteen field strains of M. bovis isolated from the same cattle at three, nine and seventeen months (five strains from each age group) were selected for antibacterial susceptibility testing against six groups of antimicrobial agents using an agar dilution method. The MIC<sub>90 </sub>ranges established for tylosin, tulathromycin, enrofloxacin, florfenicol and lincomycin were 0.39&ndash;0.78 &micro;g/ml, 0.50&ndash;1.00 &micro;g/ml, 0.78&ndash;1.56 &micro;g/ml, 3.12 &micro;g/ml and 0.39&ndash;0.78 &micro;g/ml, respectively. The range of MIC<sub>90 </sub>for oxytetracycline was from 50 to 100 &micro;g/ml. Preliminary examination of the antimicrobial susceptibility of field strains of M. bovis did not reveal significant differences between different age groups of cattle. After evaluation of the MIC<sub>90</sub> data with the SPSS 13.0 statistical package it was found that M. bovis isolates from animals at three, nine and seventeen months were similarly susceptible to tylosin and tulathromycin. Statistically significant differences in susceptibility of M. bovis isolated from cattle of different ages were found to florfenicol compared with tulathromycin (P < 0.01), lincomycin (P < 0.01) and enrofloxacin (P < 0.05). The susceptibility of all M. bovis isolates to oxytetracycline and penicillin G significantly differed from the sensitivity to all other antimicrobial agents used in the present study (P < 0.05). The in vitro susceptibility test showed that field isolates of M. bovis isolated from cattle of different ages were similarly sensitive to tylosin, tulathromycin, lincomycin and enrofloxacin.

Butyrate, one of the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), has shown vasodilation effects. We examined whether sodium butyrate administration in pregnancy and lactation can prevent hypertension induced by a maternal tryptophan-free diet in adult progeny and explored the protective mechanisms. Pregnant Sprague–Dawley rats received normal chow (CN), tryptophan-free diet (TF), sodium butyrate 400 mg/kg/d in drinking water (CNSB), or TF diet plus sodium butyrate (TFSB) in pregnancy and lactation. Male offspring were sacrificed at the age of 16 weeks (n=8 per group). Compared with normal chow, offspring exposed to the maternal tryptophan-free diet had markedly increased blood pressure, associated with activation of the renin–angiotensin system (RAS). Treatment with sodium butyrate rescued maternal TF-exposed offspring from hypertension. The protective effect of sodium butyrate is related to alterations to microbiome composition, increased renal expression of SCFA receptor G protein-coupled receptor 41 (GPR41) and GPR109A, and restoration of RAS balance. In summary, these results suggest that sodium butyrate protects against maternal TF-induced offspring hypertension, likely by modulating gut microbiota, its derived metabolites, and the RAS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aG-protein coupled receptors 3aadults 3ablood pressure 3adiet 3ahypertension 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alactation 3amales 3amaternal nutrition 3ametabolites 3amicrobiome 3apregnancy 3aprogeny 3aprotective effect 3arats 3arenin-angiotensin system 3asodium butyrate 3atryptophan 3avasodilation 0aButyrate 0aHypertension 0aDevelopmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) 0aRenin–angiotensin system 0aGut microbiota 0aShort-chain fatty acid 0aTryptophan1 aYu, Hong-Ren1 aLin, I-Chun1 aTiao, Mao-Meng1 aHuang, Li-Tung1 aHou, Chih-Yao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8007-60771 aChang-Chien, Guo-Ping1 aLin, Sufan1 aTain, You-Lin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7059-64070 tJournal of nutritional biochemistry.g2022 Oct., v. 108 p.109090-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl44770x0955-28637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnutbio.2022.1090903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02810naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245013100167300001800298520170200316592002802018650001002046650001502056650001502071650002702086650001302113650001402126650001502140650002902155700001802184700002702202700002502229773011102254856008602365852000902451655001202460IND60530415620221120094242.0160721e20160621xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053041562DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.6b013212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCapiau, Sara12aA Novel, Nondestructive, Dried Blood Spot-Based Hematocrit Prediction Method Using Noncontact Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy  ap. 6538-6546.  aDried blood spot (DBS) sampling is recognized as a valuable alternative sampling strategy both in research and in clinical routine. Although many advantages are associated with DBS sampling, its more widespread use is hampered by several issues, of which the hematocrit effect on DBS-based quantitation remains undoubtedly the most widely discussed one. Previously, we developed a method to derive the approximate hematocrit from a nonvolumetrically applied DBS based on its potassium content. Although this method yielded good results and was straightforward to perform, it was also destructive and required sample preparation. Therefore, we now developed a nondestructive method which allows to predict the hematocrit of a DBS based on its hemoglobin content, measured via noncontact diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The developed method was thoroughly validated. A linear calibration curve was established after log/log transformation. The bias, intraday and interday imprecision of quality controls at three hematocrit levels and at the lower and upper limit of quantitation (0.20 and 0.67, respectively) were less than 11%. In addition, the influence of storage and the volume spotted was evaluated, as well as DBS homogeneity. Application of the method to venous DBSs prepared from whole blood patient samples (n = 233) revealed a good correlation between the actual and the predicted hematocrit. Limits of agreement obtained after Bland and Altman analysis were −0.076 and +0.018. Incurred sample reanalysis demonstrated good method reproducibility. In conclusion, mere scanning of a DBS suffices to derive its approximate hematocrit, one of the most important variables in DBS analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3ahematocrit 3ahemoglobin 3anondestructive methods 3apatients 3apotassium 3aprediction 3areflectance spectroscopy1 aWilk, Leah S.1 aAalders, Maurice C.

Once used extensively for mineral exploration in its early days, the technology is increasingly being applied in other industries alongside ground-based investigation techniques. This paper reviews the application of onshore AEM in Norway over the past decades. Norway’s rugged terrain and complex post-glacial sedimentary geology have contributed to the later adoption of AEM for widespread mapping compared to neighbouring Nordic countries. We illustrate AEM’s utility by using two detailed case studies, including time-domain and frequency domain AEM. In both cases, we combine AEM with other geophysical, geological and geotechnical drillings to enhance interpretation, including machine learning methods. The end results included bedrock surfaces predicted with an accuracy of 25% of depth, identification of hazardous quick clay deposits, and sedimentary basin mapping. These case studies illustrate that although today’s AEM systems do not have the resolution required for late-phase, detailed engineering design, AEM is a valuable tool for early-phase site investigations. Intrusive, ground-based methods are slower and more expensive, but when they are used to complement the weaknesses of AEM data, site investigations can become more efficient. With new developments of drone-borne (UAV) systems and increasing investment in AEM surveys, we see the potential for continued global adoption of this technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3abedrock 3aclay 3adata collection 3ageophysics 3alandscapes 3aNorway1 aBaranwal, Vikas C.1 aPfaffhuber, Andreas A.1 aChristensen, Craig W.1 aSkurdal, Guro H.1 aRønning, Jan Steinar1 aAnschütz, Helgard 1 aBrönner, Marco 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Nov. 19, v. 13, no. 22dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs132246873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02277naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006300151245010200214300001600316520097700332592002801309650002601337650001401363650001301377650001101390650001401401650002201415650001201437650002401449650001201473651001901485651001301504653001901517653002101536653002701557653002301584653002601607700002401633773010301657856008601760852000901846655001201855IND60628330420221121230100.0210112e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062833042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fishres.2018.12.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDamiano, Matthew D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0394-632010aPopulation dynamics of eastern oysters in the Choptank River Complex, Maryland during 1989–2015  ap. 196-207.  aThe eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) fishery in the Choptank River Complex (CRC), Maryland supports a large fishery. The CRC is also host to some of the largest oyster restoration projects in the world. Yet the relative effects of harvest and restoration on the population dynamics of eastern oyster in the CRC have not been assessed. We developed stage-based population models for each region of the CRC in AD Model Builder using dredge survey and harvest data provided by Maryland Department of Natural Resources from 1989 to 2015. Patterns in exploitation rates over time varied among regions. Abundance generally decreased during 1989–2003 and increased thereafter. Recruitment was greatest in the late 1990s, 2010, and 2012, which led to increases in abundance. Natural mortality was low across all regions during 2004-2015. Habitat, recruitment, and abundance declined 50–70% during 1989–2015, but fishery effort increased in years with higher abundance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrassostrea virginica 3afisheries 3ahabitats 3amodels 3amortality 3anatural resources 3aoysters 3apopulation dynamics 3asurveys 3aChoptank River 3aMaryland 0aChesapeake Bay 0aStock assessment 0aMarine protected areas 0aOyster restoration 0aCrassostrea virginica1 aWilberg, Michael J.0 tFisheries research.g2019 Apr., v. 212 p.196-207dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33528x0165-78367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2018.12.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03269naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245008200172506011700254506007600371520177200447592002802219506003702247650002802284650001102312650001402323650002002337650001402357650001902371650001302390650002002403650001402423653003202437653001702469653001802486653001402504653001102518653000802529700002502537700002302562700001902585773011002604856008802714852000902802655001202811IND60644305220221207073735.0220726e20190801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064430522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2019.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoroglu, Aysun10aComparison of Coastal Vulnerability Index applications for Barcelona Province  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) is one of the simplest and commonly used methods to assess coastal vulnerability to sea-level rise (SLR) driven erosion and/or inundation. In this way, it is a common tool contributing to the decision-making process in long-term coastal planning and management. However, there is not a unique approach to be adopted, and existing ones can supply different information and, thus, promote different decisions. Within this context, the main goal of this paper is to compare and evaluate different methodologies to determine CVI, and to suggest the most appropriate approach that can be generically applied for coastal vulnerability assessment. For doing this, the approaches proposed by Gornitz (1991), Shaw et al. (1998), Thieler and Hammar-Klose (2000), and Lopez et al. (2016) are applied along the 160 km long the Barcelona coastline in the Spanish Mediterranean. Shaw et al.‘s (1998) method appears to be the more realistic approach to assess vulnerability of the Barcelona coast while the overall vulnerability level calculated by the equation proposed by Gornitz (1991) indicate a wide variability, from highly vulnerable to a very low level of vulnerability. This study shows that the ranking tables generated from site-specific databases may not be applicable elsewhere, and indicates that it might be prudent to develop site or region-specific ranking categories to compute the overall CVI in order to provide reliable inputs to local coastal zone management initiatives. Despite the potential bias in the categorization of the overall CVI classes and their expert opinion/judgment approval requirements, CVI tools help decision makers to take the necessary actions to increase the resilience of coastal zones to SLR.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acoastal zone management 3acoasts 3adatabases 3adecision making 3aequations 3aexpert opinion 3aplanning 3arisk assessment 3asea level 0aCoastal vulnerability index 0aCoastal zone 0aVulnerability 0aBarcelona 0aPython 0aGIS1 aRanasinghe, Roshanka1 aJiménez, José A.1 aDastgheib, Ali0 tOcean & coastal management.g2019 Aug. 01, v. 178 p.104799-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11975x0964-56917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2019.05.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02192naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245008900154300001600243500002000259520109900279592002801378650001501406650002001421650000901441650001201450650001701462650001401479650002501493650000901518650001601527650001501543650001501558700001701573700001601590773011701606856007401723852000901797655001201806IND60571361420221120162338.0170712e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057136142DNAL7 a10.1111/jsap.125462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNemec, A.10aOral and dental diseases in a population of domestic ferrets (Mustela putorius furo)  ap. 553-560.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOBJECTIVE: Domestic ferrets have been used for many purposes, but recently their popularity as companion animals has increased greatly. However, data on their oral and dental diseases are rare. The objective of this study was therefore to describe oral and dental diseases in a population of client‐owned domestic ferrets. METHODS: In this cross‐sectional clinical study, detailed oral and dental examination and full‐mouth dental radiographs were performed in 57 client‐owned ferrets. RESULTS: Variations in occlusion and number of roots per tooth were noted in comparison with previously published literature on ferrets. Periodontal disease, attrition/abrasion and dental fractures, especially of the canine teeth, were commonly observed. Periapical disease associated with dental fractures, malocclusion, tooth resorption and neoplasia was uncommon. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study indicates that thorough oral and dental examination supported by dental radiography under general anaesthesia should be performed in domestic ferrets as a part of regular veterinary care.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanesthesia 3abone resorption 3adogs 3aferrets 3amalocclusion 3aneoplasms 3aperiodontal diseases 3apets 3aradiography 3aresorption 3atooth root1 aZadravec, M.1 aRačnik, J.0 tjournal of small animal practice.g2016 Oct., v. 57, no. 10 p.553-560dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-45107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jsap.125463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02491naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245009400160520144900254592002801703650002301731650002301754650001201777650001501789650001701804650001301821650001201834651002501846700002701871700002401898700002801922773012001950856007402070852000902144655001202153IND60794184520221120031736.0220922e20220827xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079418452DNAL7 a10.3390/f130913702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGorbunov, Roman 10aWater Balance Components of Sub-Mediterranean Downy Oak Landscapes of Southeastern Crimea  aThis article discusses the processes of moisture intake, redistribution, and consumption within the downy oak forest community, along with their interannual and interseasonal water balance dynamics. The study of the water balance components was conducted using a combination of field research methods and geoinformation modeling on the territory of the Karadag landscape and ecological station of the Karadag Nature Reserve for the period from 2010 to 2020. The study of the water balance of downy oak forests located at the furthest extent of their range represents an important problem, whose solution will further scientific understanding by uncovering individual patterns of the internal organization of such systems. The indicators having the most tangible impact on the water balance are the amount of precipitation and evapotranspiration. The average annual precipitation on the territory of Karadag for the analyzed period was 448 mm; in recent years, a decrease in the amount of precipitation has been recorded. The evapotranspiration values within the downy oak forests approximately coincide with the values of this indicator in the Mediterranean region to average 450 mm per year. The influence of stemflow and relief features on the redistribution of moisture within the landscape is described. The analyzed water balance components’ dynamics form conditions conducive to the displacement of steppe communities by forest species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconservation areas 3aevapotranspiration 3aforests 3alandscapes 3aspatial data 3astemflow 3asteppes 3aMediterranean region1 aTabunshchik, Vladimir 1 aGorbunova, Tatiana 1 aSafonova, Marii︠a︡,0 tForests.g2022 Aug. 27, v. 13, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f130913703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02633naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245008000170300001600250520121600266592002801482650002301510650001501533650002501548650001301573650001101586650001301597650001101610650001201621650001001633650002001643650001101663650002101674650001201695650001101707650001501718650000901733650001201742650001601754651001001770653003901780653003601819653001501855700001301870700001701883773013801900856008002038852000902118655001202127IND60622089720221120053543.0181123e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062208972DNAL7 a10.1177/10820132060638382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEspinosa-Martos, I.10aNote. Low Molecular Weight Carbohydrates in Foods Usually Consumed in Spain  ap. 171-175.  aLow molecular weight carbohydrates (LMWC) were determined in foods usually consumed in Spain, namely: rice, biscuits, white bread, noodles, honey, as well as the most common vegetables of the Mediterranean diet. LMWC in foods contained mono-, di- and oligosaccharides; soluble sugars ranged from 0.2% to 83.8% in rice and honey, respectively. All samples contained different amounts of sucrose, glucose and fructose, except for garlic that only contained sucrose (2.4%). Inulin was high in garlic (13.5%), followed by onion (1.4%) and globus artichoke (0.5%). Minor inulin contents were detected in biscuits (0.2%) and a trace in noodles, white bread and endives. Non-digestible oligosaccharides (NDO) detected in the samples ranged from 12% honey, 3.2% garlic, 3.7% onion, 1.3% globus artichoke and minor amounts in noodle, endive, biscuit and white bread. According to the determined LMWC contents and the current intake of these foods in Spain, the amount of mono- and disaccharide would be 4.3 kg/person/year, while that of inulin plus non-digestible oligosaccharides, 0.4 kg/person/year. Thus, the estimated daily intake of the potential prebiotics inulin plus NDO from the foods selected was 1.1 g/person.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMediterranean diet 3aartichokes 3aaverage daily intake 3abiscuits 3aendive 3afructose 3agarlic 3aglucose 3ahoney 3ainsoluble fiber 3ainulin 3amolecular weight 3anoodles 3aonions 3aprebiotics 3arice 3asucrose 3awhite bread 3aSpain 0alow molecular weight carbohydrates 0anon-digestible oligosaccharides 0aprebiotics1 aRico, E.1 aRupèrez, P.0 tFood science and technology international.g2006 Apr., v. 12, no. 2 p.171-175dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl3949853x1082-01327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10820132060638383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02695naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245014200166300001400308520125800322592002801580650002101608650001201629650001701641650001901658650001101677650002201688650001301710651001801723651001001741653001001751653002201761653001401783653003601797653003301833653001901866700001801885700001501903700001801918700001701936700001701953700001901970700001901989773010902008856008702117852000902204655001202213IND60112745720221121212606.0190318e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011274572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaridenv.2013.02.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Jixi10aPrecipitation variability in Hulunbuir, northeastern China since 1829 AD reconstructed from tree-rings and its linkage with remote oceans  ap. 14-21.  aPrecipitation is the main factor limiting the radial growth of Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica in the Hulunbuir region, northeastern China. We used tree-ring width data to reconstruct precipitation from prior August to current July during the 1829–2009. The reconstruction was verified by the jackknife method, and accounts for 60.49% of the actual precipitation variance during their common period (1951–2009). Over the past 181 years, the climate in the Hulunbuir region has experienced distinct dry–wet alternations at the decadal scale. The Hulunbuir area experienced seven wet periods and seven dry periods, and there was no significant long-term increase or decrease in precipitation. The reconstructed precipitation sequence for Hulunbuir was largely consistent with the precipitation sequence of Helan Mountain and Baiyinaobao in China. Multi-taper method spectral analysis found periodicities of 18.6, 7.2, 4.0, 2.7–2.8, 2.4 and 2.2 years in 0.05 significant level and 10.2, 8.9, 5.0 and 2.0 years at 0.1 significant level. Our reconstructions are significantly correlated with the intensity of the East Asia Summer Monsoon, El Niño/Southern Oscillation, Pacific Decadal Oscillation, Arctic Oscillation and North Atlantic Oscillation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus sylvestris 3aclimate 3agrowth rings 3amonsoon season 3aoceans 3aspectral analysis 3avariance 3aArctic region 3aChina 0aChina 0aDendroclimatology 0aHulunbuir 0aPinus sylvestris var. mongolica 0aPrecipitation reconstruction 0aTeleconnection1 aShi, Zhongjie1 aXu, Lihong1 aYang, Xiaohui1 aJia, Zhiqing1 aLü, Shihai,1 aFeng, Chaoyang1 aShang, Jianxun0 tJournal of arid environments.g2013 Aug., v. 95 p.14-21dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl11719x0140-19637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaridenv.2013.02.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02562naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245009900154300001600253500002000269520160500289592002801894650002401922650000901946650001401955650000901969650000901978700001801987700001802005700001302023773011702036856007402153852000902227655001202236IND60571361620221120162505.0170712e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057136162DNAL7 a10.1111/jsap.125412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAuger, M.10aUse of CT to evaluate and compare intranasal features in brachycephalic and normocephalic dogs  ap. 529-536.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOBJECTIVES: To evaluate and compare nasal mucosal contact, septal deviation and caudal aberrant nasal turbinates in brachycephalic and normocephalic dogs using computed tomography. METHODS: Dogs without nasal disease and having undergone computed tomography scan of the head (plica alaris to the cribiform plate) were retrospectively selected and divided into brachycephalic and normocephalic groups. Eighteen brachycephalic and 32 normocephalic dogs were included. Anatomic criteria were used to locate predetermined pairs of intranasal structures and nasal mucosal contact was described as present or absent for each site. Septal deviations were identified and measured using angle of septal deviation. Caudal aberrant nasal turbinates were identified and categorised when present. RESULTS: Prevalence of nasal mucosal contact was significantly higher in brachycephalic dogs. No significant difference was seen in prevalence or in angle of septal deviation between groups. Prevalence of caudal aberrant nasal turbinates was significantly higher in brachycephalic dogs. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Nasal mucosal contact and caudal aberrant nasal turbinates were significantly more prevalent in brachycephalic dogs than in normocephalic dogs in our study. Computed tomography can be a valuable aid in obtaining data on nasal mucosal contact, caudal aberrant nasal turbinates and septal deviations. Combination of computed tomography with endoscopy and functional airway testing would be useful to further evaluate the correlation between intranasal features and symptoms of brachycephalic airway syndrome.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputed tomography 3adogs 3aendoscopy 3ahead 3anose1 aAlexander, K.1 aBeauchamp, G.1 aDunn, M.0 tjournal of small animal practice.g2016 Oct., v. 57, no. 10 p.529-536dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-45107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jsap.125413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02487naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245008100180300001600261520104700277592002801324650001001352650002401362650002301386650001901409650001901428650001301447650004201460650001701502650002001519650001301539653003501552653002901587653001101616653001301627653003001640700002501670700002001695700002101715700001801736700002701754773015301781856008601934852000902020655001202029IND60539244420221117160714.0190215e20140214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053924442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.febslet.2014.01.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDubińska-Magiera, Magda10aContribution of small heat shock proteins to muscle development and function  ap. 517-530.  aInvestigations undertaken over the past years have led scientists to introduce the concept of protein quality control (PQC) systems, which are responsible for polypeptide processing. The PQC system monitors proteostasis and involves activity of different chaperones such as small heat shock proteins (sHSPs). These proteins act during normal conditions as housekeeping proteins regulating cellular processes, and during stress conditions. They also mediate the removal of toxic misfolded polypeptides and thereby prevent development of pathogenic states. It is postulated that sHSPs are involved in muscle development. They could act via modulation of myogenesis or by maintenance of the structural integrity of signaling complexes. Moreover, mutations in genes coding for sHSPs lead to pathological states affecting muscular tissue functioning.This review focuses on the question how sHSPs, still relatively poorly understood proteins, contribute to the development and function of three types of muscle tissue: skeletal, cardiac and smooth.  aPublisher supplied data 3agenes 3aheat shock proteins 3amuscle development 3amuscle protein 3amuscle tissues 3amutation 3apathological processes and conditions 3apolypeptides 3aquality control 3atoxicity 0aProtein quality control system 0aSmall heat shock protein 0aStress 0aSkeletal 0aCardiac and smooth muscle1 aJabłońska, Jadwiga1 aSaczko, Jolanta1 aKulbacka, Julita1 aJagla, Teresa1 aDaczewska, Małgorzata0 tFEBS letters.g2014 Feb. 14, v. 588, no. 4 p.517-530dElsevier B.V.aFederation of European Biochemical SocietieswJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2014.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02790naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245010400156300001600260520121900276592002801495650001601523650002501539650002001564650001101584650001101595650002201606650002001628650002001648650002801668650002201696650001601718650001301734650001501747650001401762650001401776650001301790650001201803653001201815653001401827653001301841653001501854653002201869653001801891700002201909700002501931700002601956700002001982700002102002773013102023856007302154852000902227655001202236IND60567916820180530000000.0170501e20120101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056791682DNAL7 a10.1021/pr200701y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNanjo, Yohei10aMass Spectrometry-Based Analysis of Proteomic Changes in the Root Tips of Flooded Soybean Seedlings  ap. 372-385.  aFlooding injury is a major problem in soybean cultivation. A proteomics approach was used to clarify the occurrence of changes in protein expression level and phosphorylation in soybeans under flooding stress. Two-day-old seedlings were flooded for 1 day, proteins were extracted from root tips of the seedlings and digested with trypsin, and their expression levels and phosphorylation states were compared to those of untreated controls using mass spectrometry-based proteomics techniques. Phosphoproteins were enriched using a phosphoprotein purification column prior to digestion and mass spectrometry. The expression of proteins involved in energy production increased as a result of flooding, while expression of proteins involved in protein folding and cell structure maintenance decreased. Flooding induced changes of phosphorylation status of proteins involved in energy generation, protein synthesis and cell structure maintenance. The response to flooding stress may be regulated by both modulation of protein expression and phosphorylation state. Energy-demanding and production-related metabolic pathways may be particularly subject to regulation by changes in protein phosphorylation during flooding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3abiochemical pathways 3acell structures 3aenergy 3afloods 3amass spectrometry 3aphosphoproteins 3aprotein folding 3aprotein phosphorylation 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteolysis 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3aroot tips 3aseedlings 3asoybeans 3atrypsin 0asoybean 0aroots tip 0aflooding 0aproteomics 0aphosphoproteomics 0atranscription1 aSkultety, Ludovit1 aUváčková, L'ubica1 aKlubicová, Katarína1 aHajduch, Martin1 aKomatsu, Setsuko0 tJournal of proteome research.g2012 Jan. 01, v. 11, no. 1 p.372-385dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23605x1535-39077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/pr200701y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03534naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006100147245010200208300001600310500001400326520180400340592002802144650001602172650001902188650001002207650001002217650001602227650001102243650002702254650002702281650002602308650001102334650001802345650001602363650001402379650001502393650002202408650002002430650002602450650002402476650000902500650001902509650001102528650001602539650001302555651001902568651001102587653002302598653002602621653002102647700002902668700002902697773012802726856008102854852000902935655001202944IND60719691720221118095430.0201204e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071969172DNAL7 a10.1017/S00144797200002772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRurangwa, Edouard1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2748-374914aThe response of climbing bean to fertilizer and organic manure in the Northern Province of Rwanda  ap. 722-737.  aNAL-light  aClimbing beans play a central role in food security of rural households in the densely populated highlands of East and Central Africa. Soil fertility degradation and the lack of nutrient inputs are major limitations to yield of beans and other crops. We conducted field trials in Northern Rwanda in Kinoni and Muko villages to evaluate the effect of mineral N, P, and K fertilizers (both alone and in combination) and farmyard manure on nitrogen fixation and grain yields of climbing bean in smallholder farmers’ fields. The trials were laid down in a randomized complete block design with seven replicate blocks in each village. Manure and fertilizer application led to greater yields in all fields, and the largest yields were achieved when manure was combined with NPK. Large variability in yield between fields was observed. Application of fertilizer together with manure increased the grain yield from 1.5 to 3.9 t ha⁻¹ in Kinoni and from 2.6 to 5.4 t ha⁻¹ in Muko. Fertilizer and/or manure increased stover yield from 0.8 to 2.3 t ha⁻¹ in Kinoni and from 1.5 to 3.4 t ha⁻¹ in Muko. Application of 30 kg P ha⁻¹ and 5 t manure ha⁻¹ led to increased N and P uptake (from 49 to 106 kg N ha⁻¹ and from 6.1 to 12.4 kg P ha⁻¹ in Kinoni and from 46 to 128 kg N ha⁻¹ and from 5.3 to 17.9 kg P ha⁻¹ in Muko). There was no clear relationship between soil fertility characteristics and the response of climbing bean to applied inputs at Muko site. However, at Kinoni site, limited response to manure and NPK application was observed in plots where soil available P and soil exchangeable K were relatively low. Our results show the benefits of using manure along with mineral fertilizers for increased climbing bean yields and nutrient uptake in smallholder farming systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3aanimal manures 3abeans 3acrops 3adegradation 3adesign 3aexchangeable potassium 3afertilizer application 3afield experimentation 3afields 3afood security 3agrain yield 3ahighlands 3ahouseholds 3anitrogen fixation 3anutrient uptake 3apotassium fertilizers 3asmall-scale farming 3asoil 3asoil fertility 3astover 3avariability 3avillages 3aCentral Africa 3aRwanda 0aPhaseolus vulgaris 0a15N natural abundance 0aNutrients uptake1 aVanlauwe, B.q(Bernard),1 aGiller, K.

Regression analyses were carried out on the multiple‐linear, quadratic, and Cobb‐Douglas functional forms of total wheat production in the region effected by cultivation area, fertilizer usage, and rainfall. From the economical theories' point of view the model revealed good insight. The models were statistically significant at the 95% confidence level. Irrigation is valued quite substantially. Output elasticities of inputs are less than 1 and function coefficient is elastic. Thus input employment can be increased to increase wheat production. Further research based on factor analysis is recommended.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acrop production 3acrops 3acultivation area 3aelasticities 3aemployment 3afactor analysis 3afertilizers 3airrigation 3amodels 3aproduction functions 3arain 3aregression analysis 3awheat 3aTurkey (country)0 tAgricultural economics.g1998 Jan., v. 18, no. 1 p.75-87dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl41636x0169-51507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-0862.1998.tb00489.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03450naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245018700168300001800355520157400373592002801947650004401975650002202019650002302041650001502064650001502079650002202094650001402116650001602130650001202146650001302158650001302171650001102184650001702195650001502212650001702227650000902244650002402253650001502277650001102292650003402303650003302337650002502370650001302395650002502408650000902433653002402442653002602466653001802492653001302510653001802523653002302541653001502564700001402579700001602593773012102609856008502730852000902815655001202824IND60619168620221123014509.0181030e20181217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061916862DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2017.13750272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIgberase, E.10aMathematical modelling of Pb²⁺, Cu²⁺, Ni²⁺, Zn²⁺, Cr⁶⁺ and Cd²⁺ ions adsorption from a synthetic acid mine drainage onto chitosan derivative in a packed bed column  ap. 3203-3220.  aStudies on the adsorption of toxic metal ions in batch mode using modified chitosan beads have been reported by several authors in literature; for large-scale operations, packed bed column studies are performed to generate data that are directly applicable in real wastewater treatment. In this work, the application potential of chitosan derivative for the uptake of Pb²⁺, Cu²⁺, Ni²⁺, Zn²⁺, Cr⁶⁺, and Cd²⁺ ions from aqueous solution in a packed bed adsorption column was investigated. On this note, the adsorbent was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Scanning electron microscope (SEM); the effect of breakthrough parameters such as influent concentration, bed height, and feed flow rate was determined. The experimental data were fitted to mathematical column models, namely Bed Depth Service Time (BDST), Yoon-Nelson and Thomas model. The removal efficiency, breakthrough and exhaustion time increased with an increase in bed height but decreased with an increase in the flow rate and influent concentration. The mathematical models applied in this study were successful in describing experimental data. Desorption studies were performed with no loss in the mass of the beads, and the breakthrough and exhaustion time were found to be the same on reusing the beads.

Rhynchocystis (Cyperaceae) in Macaronesia with Description of Two New Species  ap. 304-320.  aPopulations of Carex sect. Rhynchocystis (Cyperaceae) from the Macaronesian archipelagos (Azores and Madeira) have traditionally been treated either as a variety of the widely distributed Western Palearctic C. pendula, or directly synonymized under it. However, recent phylogenetic studies have shown that Azorean populations of C. pendula display a certain degree of differentiation from mainland plants, while the phylogenetic relationships of Madeiran populations remain unclear. Here we perform an integrated systematic study focused on the Macaronesian populations of Carex sect. Rhynchocystis to elucidate their phylogenetic relationships and taxonomic status. We reconstructed a molecular phylogeny based on five DNA regions and conducted a multivariate morphological analysis. Divergence time estimates show that the Macaronesian populations can be traced back to a Plio-Pleistocene origin. Our results suggest that these island populations of C. pendula are better treated as two distinct species within Carex sect. Rhynchocystis (i.e. C. leviosa from the Azores and C. sequeirae from Madeira). We provide morphological characters to differentiate the new species from C. pendula s. s., detailed descriptions of the three taxa, a revised key for the entire section, as well as detailed analytical drawings of the two newly described species. We also perform a critical evaluation of the taxonomic diversity of Carex in the Azores and Madeira. Finally, we informally assessed the conservation status of the new species at a global scale under IUCN categories and criteria, resulting in the proposal of the categories Least Concern for C. leviosa and Critically Endangered for C. sequeirae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarex 3aDNA 3aPalearctic region 3aconservation status 3anew species 3aphylogeny 3aspecies diversity 3aAzores 0abudding speciation 0aisland endemism 0aMadeira 0ataxonomy1 aJiménez-Mejías, Pedro1 aBenítez-Benítez, Carmen1 aSchaefer, Hanno1 aMartín-Bravo, Santiago0 tSystematic botany.g2021 Aug. 11, v. 46, no. 2 p.304-320dAmerican Society of Plant ToxonomistswJournal:jnl7985x0363-64457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1600/036364421X162317820474423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02081naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100006700190245010200257300001500359506007600374520058800450592002801038506003701066650000801103650001301111650001101124650002001135650001101155650001501166650002601181650001601207650003501223653002001258653002601278653000801304653003401312653001901346653001201365700002501377700002501402773009201427856008301519852000901602655001201611IND60530716720221207144920.0170320e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053071672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gdata.2015.12.0072doi7 aPMC47786552pmcid7 a269813752pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalomon-Torres, Ricardo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6486-213110aAnalysis of copy number variations in Mexican Holstein cattle using axiom genome-wide Bos 1 array  ap. 97-100.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRecently, for copy number variation (CNV) analysis, bovine researchers have focused mainly on the use of genome-wide SNP genotyping arrays.

In this context, the freeze-drying process was evaluated using either vacuum freezing (VF-FD) or contact freezing (CF-FD) as initial stage. The incorporation of VF in the freeze-drying cycle allowed to reduce up to 1/4 of the initial moisture in the freezing stage, reducing the amount of water that needs to be removed in the subsequent stages (sublimation and desorption). The extremely porous structure formed during VF leads to sublimation rates three times higher in comparison to CF. Moreover, the VF-FD instant coffee showed a higher retention of volatile compounds. Thus, the results presented in this work indicate that vacuum freezing is an efficient approach to improve the freeze-drying rate of aqueous solutions in which the aromatic profile is relevant.  aPublisher supplied data 3adesorption 3afood science 3afreeze drying 3ainstant coffee 3asublimation 0aVacuum processing 0aLyophilization 0aVolatile compounds 0aInstant coffee1 aSchmidt, F.C.0 tInnovative food science & emerging technologies.g2022 June, v. 78 p.103022-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl69720x1466-85647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ifset.2022.1030223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03714naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245008700168500001900255520206600274592002802340650001602368650001902384650001502403650001702418650001202435650002502447650001802472650001502490650001902505650001302524650002302537650002302560650001802583650001602601650001402617653002902631653004802660653004002708700001602748700001602764700001702780700001902797700001702816700001402833700001602847700001902863700001702882700001602899700001702915773011902932856008803051852000903139655001203148IND60707426620221120160039.0210320e20201220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070742662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1416082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDenaro, R.10aMarine hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria breakdown poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET)  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPollution of aquatic ecosystems by plastic wastes poses severe environmental and health problems and has prompted scientific investigations on the fate and factors contributing to the modification of plastics in the marine environment. Here, we investigated, by means of microcosm studies, the role of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria in the degradation of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), the main constituents of plastic bottles, in the marine environment. To this aim, different bacterial consortia, previously acclimated to representative hydrocarbons fractions namely, tetradecane (aliphatic fraction), diesel (mixture of hydrocarbons), and naphthalene/phenantrene (aromatic fraction), were used as inocula of microcosm experiments, in order to identify peculiar specialization in poly(ethylene terephthalate) degradation. Upon formation of a mature biofilm on the surface of poly(ethylene terephthalate) films, the bacterial biodiversity and degradation efficiency of each selected consortium was analyzed. Notably, significant differences on biofilm biodiversity were observed with distinctive hydrocarbons-degraders being enriched on poly(ethylene terephthalate) surface, such as Alcanivorax, Hyphomonas, and Cycloclasticus species. Interestingly, ATR-FTIR analyses, supported by SEM and water contact angle measurements, revealed major alterations of the surface chemistry and morphology of PET films, mainly driven by the bacterial consortia enriched on tetradecane and diesel. Distinctive signatures of microbial activity were the alteration of the FTIR spectra as a consequence of PET chain scission through the hydrolysis of the ester bond, the increased sample hydrophobicity as well as the formation of small cracks and cavities on the surface of the film. In conclusion, our study demonstrates for the first time that hydrocarbons-degrading marine bacteria have the potential to degrade poly(ethylene terephthalate), although their degradative activity could potentially trigger the formation of harmful microplastics in the marine environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlcanivorax 3aCycloclasticus 3aHyphomonas 3abiodiversity 3abiofilm 3acleavage (chemistry) 3acontact angle 3ahydrolysis 3ahydrophobicity 3ainoculum 3amarine environment 3amicrobial activity 3amicroplastics 3anaphthalene 3apollution 0aMarine plastic pollution 0aPoly(ethylene terephthalate) biodegradation 0aMarine hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria1 aAulenta, F.1 aCrisafi, F.1 aDi Pippo, F.1 aCruz Viggi, C.1 aMatturro, B.1 aTomei, P.1 aSmedile, F.1 aMartinelli, A.1 aDi Lisio, V.1 aVenezia, C.1 aRossetti, S.0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Dec. 20, v. 749 p.141608-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1416083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01536naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245010900155300001800264520056000282592002800842650001000870650002300880650002300903650001200926700001400938700001700952700001900969700001800988773013301006856007401139852000901213655001201222IND60617467120221118100220.0181025e20180306xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061746712DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cc00493e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Song10aPd(ii)-Catalyzed asymmetric 1,6-conjugate addition of arylboronic acids to Meldrum's acid-derived dienes  ap. 2522-2525.  aA Pd(ii)-catalyzed asymmetric 1,6-addition of arylboronic acids to Meldrum's acid-derived dienes was developed.

A series of Meldrum's acid-derived dienes and arylboronic acids were tolerable to the reaction conditions, giving the desired adducts in moderate to high yields with good enantioselectivities (up to 96% ee).

In present study, mesoporous Si/C (MP-Si/C) composite with nanosized primary particles of 30–50 nm and pore diameter of 20–40 nm was proposed, which displays superior Li storage properties. Firstly, Polyacrylic acid (PAA) was applied to fulfill in-situ carbon coating and inhibit the particle growth of SiO₂ generated from tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) in stöber reaction. Secondly, Mg gas was introduced to create nano-sized Si with meso-pores and three-dimensional carbon network via the gas-cutting effect. The cycling stability and rate capability were both significantly enhanced with capacity of 671 mAh/g after 400 cycles and 593 mAh/g after 500 cycles at 2 A/g and 4 A/g, respectively, which was highly relevant to the selection of carbon source PAA and its corresponding carbon coating and Mg reduction effect. Moreover, this method bypasses the use of costly nano-silicon, which provides inspiration for the commercialization of silicon-based anodes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acarbon 3acommercialization 3apolyacrylic acid 3aporous media 0aSilicon-based anode 0aPAA 0aPorous silicon 0aMagnesium thermal reduction 0aSi/C1 aLi, Haoyu1 aYang, Zhiwei1 aLai, Yizhu1 aYang, Qing1 aDuan, Pengxin1 aZheng, Zhuo1 aLiu, Yang1 aSun, Yan1 aZhong, Benhe1 aWu, Zhenguo1 aGuo, Xiaodong0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2022 Dec., v. 627 p.151-159dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2022.06.1493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02754naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245005900171300001600230520146000246592002801706650002501734650001801759650001301777650001501790650001201805650001001817650002001827650001501847650001001862650001101872650002801883651001601911653001501927653001301942653001501955653002501970653001001995653002002005700001302025700001602038700001602054773012002070856008502190852000902275655001202284IND60535323720221116154540.0190401e20150430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053532372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2015.02.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan den Brom, R.10aHaemonchus contortus resistance to monepantel in sheep  ap. 278-280.  aIn a sheep farm in the Netherlands with a suspected Haemonchus contortus resistance to monepantel (Zolvix®, Novartis Animal Health), a fecal egg count reduction test was carried out in two groups of lambs, according to the method of the World Association for the Advancement of Veterinary Parasitology. Group 1 was the untreated control group, and group 2 was treated with monepantel at the manufacturer's recommended dose rate. Efficacy of treatment with monepantel was 0%. Larval identification of pre- and post-treatment coprocultures revealed 100% H. contortus larvae.On this farm, after a perceived reduction in efficacy of ivermectin and doramectin, the sheep farmer started using monepantel in July 2012, and since then, monepantel was used as the sole anthelmintic. Breeding sheep were treated twice each year in 2013 and 2014, and lambs two times in 2012, four times in 2013, and three times in 2014, before monepantel resistance was suspected, and confirmed three weeks later. Although the frequency of monepantel treatments on this farm was relatively high with treatments on thirteen separate occasions in two years time, possibly establishing favorable conditions for a competitive advantage for resistant H. contortus, it is remarkable that resistance to monepantel was established in such a very short period.This study confirms, to the best of our knowledge, the first case of H. contortus resistance to monepantel occurring in the field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaemonchus contortus 3aanthelmintics 3abreeding 3adoramectin 3afarmers 3afarms 3afecal egg count 3aivermectin 3alambs 3alarvae 3aveterinary parasitology 3aNetherlands 0aMonepantel 0aZolvix® 0aResistance 0aHaemonchus contortus 0aSheep 0aThe Netherlands1 aMoll, L.1 aKappert, C.1 aVellema, P.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2015 Apr. 30, v. 209, no. 3-4 p.278-280dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2015.02.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02932naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100006000183245023000243506007600473520106000549592002801609596004501637506003701682650001201719650001701731650001001748650002101758650001501779650002301794650001101817650002201828650001801850650001201868650002601880650001101906650001501917650001301932650001801945700006301963700006102026700007502087700007002162773012002232856007702352852000902429655001202438IND60624021720221207094642.0181203e20180301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062402172DNAL7 a10.1155/2018/82409322doi7 aPMC58528562pmcid7 a296869312pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValavala, Sriram1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3747-366410aAnalytical Method Development and Validation for the Quantification of Acetone and Isopropyl Alcohol in the Tartaric Acid Base Pellets of Dipyridamole Modified Release Capsules by Using Headspace Gas Chromatographic Technique  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA simple, sensitive, accurate, robust headspace gas chromatographic method was developed for the quantitative determination of acetone and isopropyl alcohol in tartaric acid-based pellets of dipyridamole modified release capsules. The residual solvents acetone and isopropyl alcohol were used in the manufacturing process of the tartaric acid-based pellets of dipyridamole modified release capsules by considering the solubility of the dipyridamole and excipients in the different manufacturing stages. The method was developed and optimized by using fused silica DB-624 (30 m × 0.32 mm × 1.8 µm) column with the flame ionization detector. The method validation was carried out with regard to the guidelines for validation of analytical procedures Q2 demanded by the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH). All the validation characteristics were meeting the acceptance criteria.

Typically, both the clinical outcome of these infections and the distribution of G. duodenalis assemblages and Cryptosporidium species are age-dependent, with the occurrence of diarrhoeal disease being mainly associated with young animals and sub-clinical, low intensity infections being predominantly found in adult animals.To investigate the prevalence and genetic diversity of G. duodenalis and Cryptosporidium spp. in asymptomatic adult cattle, a total of 362 faecal samples were collected in four farms in the province of Álava, Northern Spain, between November 2011 and December 2012. The presence of G. duodenalis was estimated by real-time PCR, and the assemblages were determined by multilocus sequence-based genotyping of the glutamate dehydrogenase and β-giardin genes of the parasite. Detection and identification of Cryptosporidium species was carried out by sequencing of a partial fragment of the small-subunit ribosomal RNA gene.Overall, G. duodenalis and Cryptosporidium spp. were detected in 68 (18.8%) and 45 (12.4%), respectively, of the 362 animals tested. Strikingly, four isolates representing two novel sub-types of G. duodenalis assemblage F were identified at the gdh, but not the bg, locus. This is the first report describing the presence of the feline-specific G. duodenalis assemblage F in bovine isolates. Additionally, five (three novel and two known) sub-types of G. duodenalis assemblage E were also identified at the gdh locus and a single one (assigned to sub-assemblage EII) at the bg locus. Of nine Cryptosporidium isolates, four (including a novel sub-type) were assigned to the cat-specific C. felis, two were typed as C. bovis, and the remaining three were only characterized at the genus level. Data presented here provide epidemiological and molecular evidence demonstrating that the host range specificity of G. duodenalis assemblages and Cryptosporidium species may be wider than previously anticipated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryptosporidium 3aGiardia lamblia 3aadults 3acattle 3afarms 3afeces 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3agenotyping 3agiardin protein 3aglutamate dehydrogenase 3ahost range 3aloci 3aparasites 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3ayoung animals 3aSpain 0aGiardia 0aCryptosporidium 0aCattle 0aEpidemiology 0aGenotyping 0aSpain1 ade Lucio, Aida1 aBailo, Begoña1 aCano, Lourdes1 ade Fuentes, Isabel1 aCarmena, David1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4015-85530 tVeterinary parasitology.g2015 Apr. 30, v. 209, no. 3-4 p.258-263dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2015.02.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03714naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006300150245013200213300001600345520206200361592002802423650002202451650002302473650001102496650002102507650002102528650001502549650001802564650002002582650002602602650003802628650001002666650001702676650001702693650000902710650002102719650001102740650000902751650000902760650001502769650001602784650002102800651001202821653001602833653002202849653001602871653002902887653001202916700001802928773012002946856008503066852000903151655001203160IND60535324020221116154455.0190401e20150430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053532402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2015.02.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSelemetas, Nikolaos1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2433-643310aDetection of major climatic and environmental predictors of liver fluke exposure risk in Ireland using spatial cluster analysis  ap. 242-253.  aFasciolosis caused by Fasciola hepatica (liver fluke) can cause significant economic and production losses in dairy cow farms. The aim of the current study was to identify important weather and environmental predictors of the exposure risk to liver fluke by detecting clusters of fasciolosis in Ireland. During autumn 2012, bulk-tank milk samples from 4365 dairy farms were collected throughout Ireland. Using an in-house antibody-detection ELISA, the analysis of BTM samples showed that 83% (n=3602) of dairy farms had been exposed to liver fluke. The Getis-Ord Gi* statistic identified 74 high-risk and 130 low-risk significant (P<0.01) clusters of fasciolosis. The low-risk clusters were mostly located in the southern regions of Ireland, whereas the high-risk clusters were mainly situated in the western part. Several climatic variables (monthly and seasonal mean rainfall and temperatures, total wetdays and raindays) and environmental datasets (soil types, enhanced vegetation index and normalised difference vegetation index) were used to investigate dissimilarities in the exposure to liver fluke between clusters. Rainfall, total wetdays and raindays, and soil type were the significant classes of climatic and environmental variables explaining the differences between significant clusters. A discriminant function analysis was used to predict the exposure risk to liver fluke using 80% of data for modelling and the remaining subset of 20% for post hoc model validation. The most significant predictors of the model risk function were total rainfall in August and September and total wetdays. The risk model presented 100% sensitivity and 91% specificity and an accuracy of 95% correctly classified cases. A risk map of exposure to liver fluke was constructed with higher probability of exposure in western and north-western regions. The results of this study identified differences between clusters of fasciolosis in Ireland regarding climatic and environmental variables and detected significant predictors of the exposure risk to liver fluke.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFasciola hepatica 3aantibody detection 3aautumn 3aclimatic factors 3acluster analysis 3adairy cows 3adairy farming 3adata collection 3adiscriminant analysis 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afarms 3afascioliasis 3aliver flukes 3amilk 3amodel validation 3amodels 3arain 3arisk 3asoil types 3atemperature 3avegetation index 3aIreland 0aFasciolosis 0aFasciola hepatica 0aLiver fluke 0aSpatial cluster analysis 0aIreland1 ade Waal, Theo0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2015 Apr. 30, v. 209, no. 3-4 p.242-253dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2015.02.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02562naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245007600162300001600238520147100254592002801725650002001753650002001773650001501793650001101808650001101819650001601830653002701846653003101873653002301904653002501927653001501952700001901967773012201986856008302108852000902191655001202200IND60782038320221118173253.0220921e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078203832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2022.06.1552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHatte, S.10aNovel nonwetting solid-infused surfaces for superior fouling mitigation  ap. 308-319.  aFouling is a ubiquitous issue in several environmental and energy applications. Here we introduce novel nonwetting solid-infused surfaces (SIS) with superior anti-fouling characteristics that are durable than conventional nonwetting surfaces in a dynamic flow environment. A systematic study is presented to elucidate the fouling mitigation performance of SIS in comparison to lubricant-infused surface (LIS) and conventional smooth surface. Copper tubes with SIS, LIS or smooth inner walls are fabricated and subjected to accelerated calcium sulfate fouling in a flow fouling experimental setup. Fouling on the various surface types is quantified in terms of asymptotic fouling resistance, and the fundamental morphological differences in the interactions of the foulant and the various surface types are analyzed. Based on a systematic sweep of the parameter combinations using design of experiments and Taguchi analysis, an analytical dependence of asymptotic fouling resistance on the governing parameters namely, Reynolds number, foulant concentration and temperature is derived. The analytical model is shown to predict the asymptotic fouling resistance to within 20% accuracy with a 95% confidence. In addition, for the first time, the effects of shear durability on the fouling mitigation performance of LIS vis-à-vis SIS are studied. It is shown that the novel nonwetting SIS offers a robust option for superior fouling mitigation over LIS in the long run.  aPublisher supplied data 3aReynolds number 3acalcium sulfate 3adurability 3aenergy 3amodels 3atemperature 0aSolid-infused surfaces 0aLubricant-infused surfaces 0aFouling resistance 0aDynamic flow fouling 0aDurability1 aPitchumani, R.0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2022 Dec., v. 627 p.308-319dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2022.06.1553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02689naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100007100147245012900218520127500347592002801622650002401650650001001674650001501684650001201699650001601711650002501727650001601752650001001768650002601778653002301804653002501827653002001852653001601872653002901888653001601917653001201933653002301945700002601968700002101994700002102015773011602036856008202152852000902234655001202243IND60776552120221120185723.0220714e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077655212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.asd.2022.1011732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZaffaroni-Caorsi, Valentina1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4166-960010aEffect of vibrational mating disruption on flight activity and oviposition to control the grapevine pest, Scaphoideustitanus  aThe increasing demand for safe and sustainably produced food is leading to the development of strategies of pest control alternative to chemicals. One innovative method is Vibrational Mating Disruption (VMD) to disrupt insect communication in plants. VMD was proven effective in preventing mating of the grapevine pest Scaphoideus titanus, vector of flavescence dorée. However, the stress induced by VMD on the target species has the potential to influence other crucial aspects of the insect biology and ethology. Therefore, the goal of this study was to understand side effects of VMD on the flight activity and oviposition of S. titanus. The results of our experiments conducted in the greenhouse showed that in the presence of a receptive female, males fly more if exposed to vibrations than in the silent control but not differently from singles males in silence. Surprisingly, we found that also females subjected to VMD fly more than in the silence. Regarding oviposition, we found that mated females exposed to vibrations and single females (unmated) laid significantly fewer eggs than mated females in silence. In conclusion, this study shows the potential of VMD to interfere, besides with mating, with other important biological aspects of the pest species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScaphoideus titanus 3aVitis 3aarthropods 3afemales 3agreenhouses 3ainsect communication 3aoviposition 3apests 3aphytoplasmal diseases 0aBiological control 0aApplied biotremology 0aFlight activity 0aOviposition 0aBehavioural manipulation 0aLeafhoppers 0aVectors 0aFlavescence dorée1 aNieri, R.q(Rachele),1 aPugno, Nicola M.1 aMazzoni, Valerio0 tArthropod structure & development.g2022 July, v. 69 p.101173-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl67358x1467-80397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.asd.2022.1011733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03575naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245007300172300001600245520192400261592002802185650002502213650003602238650000902274650001802283650000902301650002602310650001002336650001002346650001102356650001202367650002202379650001102401650001002412650001202422650001502434650001402449650001402463650001202477650001102489650001102500650001902511650001402530650001002544650001102554650001002565651001602575700002202591700001702613700001902630700001702649700001902666700002402685700002202709700001802731773011002749856008102859852000902940655001202949IND50073560120221122205415.0150213e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007356012DNAL7 a10.1007/s00334-013-0424-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan den Bos, Valerie10aRoman impact on the landscape near castellum Fectio, The Netherlands  ap. 277-298.  aCastellum Fectio was one of the largest fortifications along the Limes, the northern border of the Roman Empire. The castellum, situated 5 km southeast of Utrecht, the Netherlands, was occupied from around the start of our Era to ca. A.D. 260. It was situated along a river bend of the Rhine that was cut off from the main stream during the occupation of the Roman fort. A 6 m long sediment sequence was recovered from the infill of the residual channel and pieces of Roman wall plaster, glume bases of Triticum spelta and radiocarbon dates indicate that the sediments were deposited during the period of Roman occupation. The combined palaeoecological analyses—palynological, macrobotanical, entomological and geochemical—allow a detailed reconstruction of changing environmental conditions as a consequence of the Roman occupation. The pollen record reveals a dramatic decrease in arboreal pollen, suggesting that the Romans were involved in large-scale deforestation, transforming semi-open parkland to a landscape of meadows and agricultural fields. Non-pollen palynomorphs, botanical macrofossils and insect remains support this conclusion. The recorded mycoflora shows a shift from assemblages characterised by the tree pathogen Kretzschmaria deusta to assemblages dominated by spores of fungi associated with herbaceous plants, concurrent with the decrease in arboreal pollen. The presence of masticated bran fragments of cereals, clover remains, eggs of intestinal parasites and entomological and geochemical data in the upper part of the sequence indicates that these sediments largely consist of faeces that were dumped into the former channel. Surprisingly, seeds of salt tolerant species are encountered in the sediments of this inland site, which was situated outside the influence of the sea. Horses may have brought these seeds to Fectio in their intestinal tracts after grazing in coastal meadows.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKretzschmaria deusta 3aTriticum aestivum subsp. spelta 3abran 3adeforestation 3aeggs 3aenvironmental factors 3afeces 3afungi 3agrains 3agrazing 3aherbaceous plants 3ahorses 3alimes 3ameadows 3apalynology 3aparasites 3apathogens 3aplaster 3apollen 3arivers 3asalt tolerance 3asediments 3aseeds 3aspores 3atrees 3aNetherlands1 aBrinkkemper, Otto1 aBull, Ian D.1 aEngels, Stefan1 aHakbijl, Tom1 aSchepers, Mans1 avan Dinter, Marieke1 avan Reenen, Guido1 avan Geel, Bas0 tVegetation history and archaeobotany.g2014 May, v. 23, no. 3 p.277-298dSpringer-Verlagx0939-63147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00334-013-0424-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02276naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245011500163300001600278520076500294592002801059650002001087650002001107650001001127650001001137650001001147650001301157650001201170650001001182650003001192650001801222650002201240651001001262653001501272653001301287653002001300653002301320653001101343653000801354700001501362700001701377700001801394700001601412700002501428700001701453700005901470773013501529856008501664852000901749655001201758IND60535324120221116154408.0190401e20150430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053532412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2015.02.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQi, Meng10aMolecular identification of Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia duodenalis in grazing horses from Xinjiang, China  ap. 169-172.  aA total of 262 fecal specimens collected from grazing horses at five locations in Xinjiang, China were examined by PCR for Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia duodenalis.

Our objective was to investigate associations between potential endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and female fertility in two cohorts of women attending fertility clinics. : In a total population of 333 women in Sweden and Estonia, we studied the associations between chemicals and female fertility, evaluating ovarian sensitivity index (OSI) as an indicator of ovarian response, as well as clinical pregnancy and live birth from fresh and frozen embryo transfers. We measured 59 chemicals in follicular fluid samples and detected 3 phthalate metabolites, di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) metabolites, 1 paraben, and 6 PFAS in >90% of the women. Associations were evaluated using multivariable-adjusted linear or logistic regression, categorizing EDCs into quartiles of their distributions, as well as with Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression. : We observed statistically significant lower OSI at higher concentrations of the sum of DEHP metabolites in the Swedish cohort (Q4 vs Q1, β = -0.21, 95% CI: −0.38, −0.05) and methylparaben in the Estonian cohort (Q3 vs Q1, β = -0.22, 95% CI: −0.44, −0.01). Signals of potential associations were also observed at higher concentrations of PFUnDA in both the combined population (Q2 vs. Q1, β = −0.16, 95% CI -0.31, −0.02) and the Estonian population (Q2 vs. Q1, β = −0.27, 95% CI -0.45, −0.08), and for PFOA in the Estonian population (Q4 vs. Q1, β = −0.31, 95% CI -0.61, −0.01). Associations of chemicals with clinical pregnancy and live birth presented wide confidence intervals. : Within a large chemical mixture, we observed significant inverse associations levels of DEHP metabolites and methylparaben, and possibly PFUnDA and PFOA, with OSI, suggesting that these chemicals may contribute to altered ovarian function and infertility in women.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBayesian theory 3aassisted reproductive technologies 3afemale fertility 3afollicular fluid 3ametabolites 3amethylparaben 3aphthalates 3apregnancy 3aregression analysis 3aresearch 3aEstonia 3aSweden1 aZou, Runyu1 aBjörvang, Richelle D.1 aRoos, Kristine1 aSjunnesson, Ylva1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4500-51231 aHallberg, Ida1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5395-050X1 aHolte, Jan1 aPikki, Anne1 aLenters, Virissa1 aPortengen, Lützen1 aKoekkoek, Jacco1 aLamoree, Marja1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7373-77381 aVan Duursen, Majorie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3838-97311 aVermeulen, Roel1 aSalumets, Andres1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1251-81601 aVelthut-Meikas, Agne1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1927-90161 aDamdimopoulou, Pauliina0 tEnvironmental research.g2022 Sept. 25,  p.114447-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2022.114447  aDNAL 7aarticle04271naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245007900173300001600252520263600268592002802904650001902932650001802951650001802969650000902987650002002996650001403016650001903030650000903049650002603058650001103084650002303095650002303118650001103141650001103152650002403163650002103187650001403208650001303222650001803235650000903253650002603262650002003288650001603308650001103324653002503335653002303360653001003383653001603393653001303409700002203422700002303444773012003467856008503587852000903672655001203681IND60535324220221116154449.0190401e20150430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053532422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2015.02.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeathwick, Dave M.12aA model for the dynamics of the free-living stages of equine cyathostomins  ap. 210-220.  aAnthelmintic resistance in strongyle nematode parasites of horses is an expanding global problem and steps need to be taken to slow its development before control becomes more problematic. A move away from traditional deworming programmes, involving frequent whole-herd treatments with broad spectrum anthelmintics, to a more strategic or targeted use of chemicals is required. However, anthelmintic resistance management strategies which also maintain effective control are invariably more complicated and often require a greater understanding of both nematode epidemiology and grazing management, than does the simple routine use of chemicals. Here, as a first step in applying a modelling approach to resistance management in horses, a model is proposed to describe the dynamics on pasture of the free-living stages of equine cyathostomins. Firstly, the development and survival of the pre-infective stages is considered as a single process driven by temperature, and secondly, two populations of infective stage larvae (L3) are considered; those within the faecal pat and those on the herbage. Both are modelled using the box-car train approach which allows for variable development rates within a cohort of individuals and full overlap of generations. Uniquely, L3 survival is modelled as an ageing process where larvae progress through physiological age classes at a rate determined by temperature and rainfall. Model output reflects the dynamics of free-living stages under a range of environments. Under extreme cold, there is no development to L3 but eggs can survive for long periods to develop if conditions become favourable, while L3 survival is reduced under repeated freeze–thaw cycles. Under tropical conditions, development is rapid and a large number of L3 can be produced but survival of L3 is short. In temperate climates development tends to be slower, with large numbers of L3 produced over the warmer months but fewer over winter, and L3 survival tends to be higher all year round. Although attempts to validate model output against field studies were compromised by the lack of published detail or an inability to access specific weather records, outputs averaged over multiple sets of weather data was often appropriate for that location. Variation in model output when using weather data sets which started on different days within the same week suggests that day-to-day differences in weather may affect the number of L3 developing on pasture and that optimisation of anthelmintic use to minimise pasture infectivity may require a more detailed understanding of weather effects than previously thought.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyathostominae 3aage structure 3aanthelmintics 3acold 3adata collection 3adeworming 3adynamic models 3aeggs 3afield experimentation 3aforage 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3agrazing management 3ahorses 3alarvae 3ameteorological data 3amodel validation 3aparasites 3apastures 3apathogenicity 3arain 3aresistance management 3atemperate zones 3atemperature 3awinter 0aEquine cyathostomins 0aFree-living stages 0aModel 0aDevelopment 0aSurvival1 aDonecker, John M.1 aNielsen, Martin K.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2015 Apr. 30, v. 209, no. 3-4 p.210-220dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2015.02.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01957naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002800154245012100182300001600303520072400319592002801043650001201071650001201083650003001095650002301125650001601148650001901164651001401183651001101197653003701208653003301245653001801278700002801296700002801324773013401352856008801486852000901574655001201583IND60747836820221121064424.0210820e20210811xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074783682DNAL7 a10.1600/036364421X162317820475692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuiz Sánchez, Eduardo,13aAn Overlooked New Endemic Species of Rhipidocladum (Poaceae: Bambusoideae: Bambuseae: Arthrostylidiinae) from Mexico  ap. 333-338.  aRhipidocladum is the fourth most speciose genus in the bamboo subtribe Arthrostylidiinae. The species in this genus have a wide geographical distribution from North America (Mexico) to South America (Argentina). In Mexico, there are five Rhipidocladum species, two of which are endemic. During a recent review of herbaria, we found some specimens of Rhipidocladum from Guerrero, Jalisco, and Nayarit that do not fit morphologically with any of the five Rhipidocladum species presently known in Mexico nor any other species in the genus. Here we describe and illustrate Rhipidocladum barbinode, a new species endemic to Mexico.

With a two‐way coupled hydrodynamic and wave model system, this study investigated how the Lake Erie dynamics are impacted by the wave‐induced surface and radiation stresses on the seasonal‐mean and episodic scales. The results showed that the surface radiation stress was the same as or an order of magnitude larger than the wave‐induced surface stress in the nearshore area (<5 km offshore), while the latter prevailed in the offshore areas. By enhancing air‐lake momentum and heat transfers, the wave‐enhanced surface stress improved the model's skill in simulating hydrodynamics in the Central and Eastern Basins, and it was of greater importance (at least an order of magnitude larger) in modifying surges, offshore currents, and thermal structures compared to those of the radiation stress. Nevertheless, the radiation stress played key roles in wave‐induced nearshore currents, especially in the shallow Western Basin. Their significances reached O (0.01–0.1 m/s) on the seasonal and episodic scales, respectively, and could have similar importance in other shallow water environments.  aPublisher supplied data  cGreat Lakes Fishery Commission 3abasins 3ageophysics 3agravity 3ahydrodynamics 3alakes 3amodels 3amomentum 3aresearch 3aLake Erie1 aXia, Meng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4295-385X0 tJournal of geophysical research.g2017 Sept., v. 122, no. 9 p.7291-7311dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017JC0129343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02540naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245009400163300001600257520133600273592002801609650002801637650001301665650001201678650001701690650002101707650001601728653002401744653003801768653003301806700001401839700001501853700001601868700001401884700001401898700001301912773012501925856008302050852000902133655001202142IND60782038620221118173227.0220830e20221115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078203862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2022.06.1572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Pingsu10aHomogeneous interfacial water structure favors realizing a low-friction coefficient state  ap. 324-333.  aHypothesis: The use of water to reduce friction has always played a significant role in a wide range of areas ranging from biology to engineering. Many efforts have been made to extensively investigate the water behavior between two contacted surfaces, but its role in water-based friction remains incompletely understood. Experiments: Herein, we utilize the sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy to identify interfacial water structures upon adjusting the wettability of titanium dioxide (TiO₂) and silicon surfaces. And the corresponding wettability-tunable underwater friction is measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Findings: It demonstrates that enhanced wettability induces higher friction on the TiO₂ surface but lower friction on the silicon surface. Although the tribological properties of TiO₂ show independence of surface forces in contrast to the case of silicon, both TiO₂ and silicon surfaces covered with homogeneous water molecules correspond to a lower friction coefficient. This observation indicates that a homogeneous interfacial water structure, dominating over surface forces, is of the utmost importance for achieving low friction. Our results shed new light on the origins of friction in the presence of water and reveal the ubiquitous role of interfacial water structures on friction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic force microscopy 3afriction 3asilicon 3aspectroscopy 3atitanium dioxide 3awettability 0aUnderwater friction 0aIntermolecular and surface forces 0aInterfacial water structures1 aLiu, Yuan1 aSang, Xiao1 aTan, Junjun1 aYe, Shuji1 aMa, Liran1 aTian, Yu0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2022 Nov. 15, v. 626 p.324-333dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2022.06.1573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02816naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245010200176300001600278520131500294536014701609592002801756596011501784650001301899650001201912650001101924650000901935650001401944650002101958651001001979651002201989653000702011653002002018653002702038653001302065700002502078700002002103700001802123700001902141773012802160856008502288852000902373655001202382IND60619169420221120062652.0181030e20181117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061916942DNAL7 a10.1080/15320383.2018.15120812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBettoschi, Alexandre10aArsenic speciation in marine sediments: A comparison between two sequential extraction procedures  ap. 723-735.  aArsenic distribution and mobility in marine sediments was investigated by means of total extraction and two sequential extraction procedures i.e. a modified sequential extraction procedure proposed by the European Standard, Measurementand Testing (SM&T) program, formerly the Community Bureau of Reference (BCR) procedure and a five steps sequential extraction based on the Wenzel extraction procedure, called modified Wenzel extraction. Sediments were collected from Cagliari’s harbour and Cagliari’s gulf, in Western Mediterranean Sea, Italy. The modified Wenzel extraction provided a more detailed As binding pattern and turned out to be much more appropriate than the modified SM&T procedure for gaining information regarding the mobilization of As within marine sediments. In the harbour, the largest part of As is contained in the residual fraction. At the contrary, As concentration, which is higher in the Cagliari’s gulf, is primarily associated with amorphous and crystalline hydrous Fe(Mn, Al) oxide. Moreover, this study suggests the possibility to segregate different types of marine sediments depending of human or industrial activities and to trace As contaminated marine sediments to determine the origin of contamination following the percentile of As contained in each extraction steps.  aThis work was supported by the EU-funded MOMAR Project (Integrated system for monitoring and control of the marine environment) (2009–2012).  aPublisher supplied data  cEU-funded MOMAR Project (Integrated system for monitoring and control of the marine environment) (2009–2012) 3aaluminum 3aarsenic 3ahumans 3airon 3amanganese 3amarine sediments 3aItaly 3aMediterranean Sea 0aAs 0amarine sediment 0asequential extractions 0asardinia1 aMarrucci, Alessandro1 aMarras, Barbara1 aAtzori, Marco1 aSchintu, Marco0 tSoil & sediment contamination.g2018 Nov. 17, v. 27, no. 8 p.723-735dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000152x1549-78877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15320383.2018.15120813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02018naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100003600154245011100190300001600301520089000317592002801207650001501235650001201250650001201262650001601274650001301290650001501303650001901318651001101337653002101348653001501369653001901384700002201403773013401425856008801559852000901647655001201656IND60747837020221122081157.0210820e20210811xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074783702DNAL7 a10.1600/036364421X162317820475872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBatista Gomes, Francisca Maiara10aThree New Species of Lychnocephalus (Asteraceae: Vernonieae) from the Serra do Cipó, Minas Gerais, Brazil  ap. 476-485.  aLychnocephalus cipoensis, L. grazielae, and L. jolyanus, three new species from the Cerrado of the Brazilian Central Plateau, are hereby described and illustrated.

The case study of inventory and analysis of the ancient land use structures in the Czech Republic)  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe paper deals with the process of searching and inventorying of relict - so-called pre-industrial landscape - in Moravia (approximately 1/3 of the territory in the east of the Czech Republic). So far, during the inventory of pre-industrial landscape segments in Moravia, around 1,500 land use mosaic areas have been registered, surviving without significant changes since the completion of maps of the so-called stable cadastre realized in the 1830s to the present. Each of these areas with a steady mosaic has been supplemented with substantial quantitative and qualitative characteristics. This paper presents the results of geodatabase analysis of segments of the pre-industrial landscape concerning the sea elevation and morphology of the area. The results show that although numerous parts of stable ancient landscapes have been preserved at higher altitudes, they reach larger separate areas and larger aggregate areas at lower altitudes with more fertile soils. Hypotheses attempting to explain this territorial disparity are also presented in the text of the paper.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3ainventories 3aland policy 3aland use 3alandscapes 3aspatial data 3aCzech Republic 0aPre-industrial landscape 0aLand-use 0aGIS 0aOrthophotomap 0aMoravia1 aKrejčí, Tomáš1 aNováková, Eva0 tLand use policy.g2020 Sept., v. 97 p.104712-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.1047123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02284naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006800142245011600210520107700326592002801403650002201431650001301453650002201466650001601488650001401504650001201518650001401530650001201544650002301556650002001579650002401599650001001623650002101633700002701654700002401681773010801705856007601813852000901889655001201898IND60624022320221120183700.0181130e20180419xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062402232DNAL7 a10.1155/2018/83128572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFellahi, Zine El Abidine1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1066-325X10aAnalysis of Direct and Indirect Selection and Indices in Bread Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)

Significant genetic variation existed among parents and crosses for the traits measured. The following were the most efficient indices for simultaneous selection of superior lines for yield and its components: base index of Williams, followed by the sum of ranks index of Smith and Hazel. The selection-based index provided the highest grain yield gains as compared to the other selection criteria, except for flag leaf area, indicating that the direct and indirect monotrait selection were not appropriate in the situation analyzed in this work. PCA identified Ain Abid × Mahon-Demias, Ain Abid × Rmada, and Ain Abid × El-Wifak as the most promising populations.

While most previous studies on the reforested lands have focused on C stock recovery, soil C turnover has largely been overlooked. We evaluated soil C turnover rate by calculating the isotopic enrichment factors of α (defined as the slope of the regression between the δ¹³C difference and ln-transferred C concentrations in mineral soil samples relative to the surface litter) and β (defined as the slope of the regression between δ¹³C and log-transferred C concentrations) along 0–30 cm soil profiles in a 400-year-old monsoon evergreen broad-leaved forest (MEBF), a 51-year-old mixed-native plantation (NP1), a 31-year-old mixed-native plantation (NP2), a 31-year-old Acacia mangium plantation (AP), a 31-year-old mixed-conifer plantation (CP), and a 31-year-old secondary forest with natural restoration (SF). Results showed that soil C stocks did not differ among the six forests. The estimated α values ranged from 1.0023 to 1.0086 and increased in the order of MEBF = NP1 < NP2 = AP = CP < SF. The estimated β values ranged from −19.70 to −5.22 but showed an opposite trend to α values. Additionally, changes of the α and β values among these forests were mainly regulated by soil water content and bulk density. Our findings demonstrate that forest restoration could enhance soil C stock equivalent to the undisturbed old-growth forests within a few decades, but the rate of soil C turnover in these restored forests were still higher.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcacia mangium 3abulk density 3acarbon sinks 3adeciduous forests 3aforest restoration 3aisotopic enrichment 3amineral soils 3amonsoon season 3aold-growth forests 3asecondary forests 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil profiles 3asoil sampling 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3astable isotopes 3atropical forests 3aChina 0aReforestation 0aSoil carbon stock 0aSoil carbon turnover 0aStable carbon isotopes1 aZhang, Huiling1 aDeng, Qi1 aHui, Dafeng1 aChu, Guowei1 aMeng, Ze1 aZhou, Guoyi1 aZhang, Deqiang0 tForest ecology and management.g2020 Apr. 15, v. 462 p.117988-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2020.1179883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03535naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002900153245008200182500001900264520198000283592002802263650002302291650005202314650000802366650001802374650001602392650001202408650000902420650001602429650001102445650001402456650001402470650000902484650001502493650001602508651001002524651001302534651001002547653001502557653001302572653001302585653002302598653000802621653002002629700002102649700002602670700002202696700002402718700002302742773011902765856008802884852000902972655001202981IND60707427620221120171157.0210320e20201220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070742762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1416212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMendez-Espinosa, Juan F.10aAir quality variations in Northern South America during the COVID-19 lockdown  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLockdown measures led to air pollution decrease in several countries around the world such as China and India, whereas other regions experimented an increase in pollutant concentrations. Northern South America (NSA) was one of those areas where pollution changed during lockdown due to high fire activity. This study aims to analyze, for the first time in NSA, the behavior of selected criteria air pollutants during the implementation of the SARS-CoV-2 lockdown in two high populated cities of the region: Bogotá and Medellín in Colombia. A set of tools including surface measurements, as well as satellite and modeled data were used. 24-hour average concentrations of PM₁₀, PM₂.₅, and NO₂ were collected from air quality stations for the lockdown period ranging from February 21 to June 30, 2020. The Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) was used to analyze the fire flux OC as a biomass burning (BB) indicator, and tropospheric NO₂ concentrations were retrieved from TROPOMI. The HYSPLIT model was used to analyze back trajectories and fire data were obtained from MODIS sensor measurements. Our analysis shows short-term background NO₂, PM₁₀, and PM₂.₅ concentration reductions of 60%, 44%, and 40%, respectively, for the strict lockdown; and 62%, 58%, and 69% for the relaxed lockdown. Corresponding long-term reductions were of 50%, 32%, and 9% for the strict lockdown; and 37%, 29%, and 19% for the relaxed lockdown. Regional BB increased PM₂.₅ concentrations by 20 μg/m³ during the strict lockdown, and the Saharan dust event increased PM₁₀ concentrations up to 168 μg/m³ in Bogotá, and 104 μg/m³ in Medellín, bringing an additional risk of morbidity and mortality for population. Regional BB has several causes that need to be properly managed to benefit local air quality improvement plans. Future cleaner transport policies equivalent to reduced lockdown mobility could bring pollution close to WHO guidelines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aair 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3abiomass 3adust 3aenvironment 3amodels 3amorbidity 3amortality 3arisk 3asatellites 3atroposphere 3aChina 3aColombia 3aIndia 0aSARS-CoV-2 0aPandemic 0aLockdown 0aParticulate matter 0aNO2 0aBiomass burning1 aRojas, Nestor Y.1 aVargas Cullel, Jorge,1 aPachón, Jorge E.1 aBelalcazar, Luis C.1 aRamírez R., Omar,0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Dec. 20, v. 749 p.141621-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1416213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02396naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245013100172300001300303520112400316592002801440650001401468650001101482650001801493650002101511650001401532650001301546650002401559650001301583650001901596650001501615650001301630650003401643650003301677650002101710650003801731650001101769700001701780773007901797856008901876852000901965655001201974IND60095843820221116154656.0141104e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009584382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2010.09.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, S.P.10aEffect of CNTs growth on carbon fibers on the tensile strength of CNTs grown carbon fiber-reinforced polymer matrix composites  ap. 8-15.  aCarbon nanotubes and nanofibers were directly grown on carbon fiber substrate by catalytic decomposition of acetylene precursor using thermal chemical vapor deposition process.

The morphology of carbon nanomaterials grown on carbon fibers was examined by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM). Electron microscopic observations revealed uniform coverage of carbon fibers with carbon nanotubes, nano- fibers and filaments. The composites made of carbon nanotubes coated carbon fibers showed 69% higher tensile strength as compared to composites made of carbon fiber which had undergone similar heat treatment but without carbon nanotubes growth. The results of tensile test revealed that both the high vacuum condition and choice of an appropriate catalyst precursor strongly influence the fiber properties thereby affect the resultant properties of the composites made of these surface modified carbon fibers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylene 3acarbon 3acarbon fibers 3acarbon nanotubes 3acatalysts 3acoatings 3acomposite materials 3aepoxides 3aheat treatment 3ananofibers 3apolymers 3ascanning electron microscopes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atensile strength 3atransmission electron microscopes 3avapors1 aLakkad, S.C.0 tComposites.g2011 Jan., v. 42, no. 1 p.8-15dElsevier Ltdx1359-835X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesa.2010.09.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03918naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245013500177520226400312592002802576650001102604650001002615650002102625650002602646650001102672650002102683650002302704650001502727650002002742650001002762650001802772650002202790650001202812650002602824650001302850650001302863650001102876650001702887650002202904650003202926650001402958651001102972653001002983653001302993653001703006653001903023653002103042653003203063653001403095653003303109773011603142856008503258852000903343655001203352IND60684189420221122105733.0200228e20200401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068418942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2020.1179502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSkłodowski, Jarosław10aTwo directions of regeneration of post-windthrow pine stands depend on the composition of the undergrowth and the soil environment  aAlongside fires, windthrows are among the strongest forest disturbances, which is why research on the regeneration of windthrown forests is so important for silviculture. While there have been many studies devoted to the regeneration of windthrown boreal spruce forests, few have dealt with the regeneration of Scots pine forests in the temperate zone.In Pisz Forest (northern Poland), the State Forests administration left 475.6 ha of pine stands disturbed by windthrow for research on spontaneous ecosystem recovery, leaving all broken trees untouched. For the 11-year study (beginning in 2008, six years after the windthrow, when saplings became more abundant), 10 × 10 m research plots were established in pine stands with different classes of severity of windthrow disturbance: severely disturbed stands (canopy cover up to 30%), moderately disturbed stands (canopy cover of 40–60%) and the least disturbed stands (canopy cover of 70–90%). Each year all saplings on the plots were recorded, with measurements of their height, diameter at breast height, and changes in the percentage cover of forest floor vegetation and its species composition. Selected environmental variables were measured as well. Density of pine saplings in the severely disturbed stands was lower than in the moderately and least disturbed stands, while the density of birch saplings was higher in the moderately disturbed stands than in the least disturbed stands. Moss P. schreberi particularly favored spontaneous regeneration of pine saplings, while the nitrophilous grass D. flexuosa, overgrowing entire surfaces, impeded it. Soil cover by a litter layer alone also significantly hampered the emergence of tree saplings.An elevated content of nitrogen in the soil was conducive to rapid coverage of the area by D. flexuosa, while limiting cover by moss P. schreberi. Moss P. schreberi and shrubs V. vitis-idaea preferred soil with a high respiration rate, while grass D. flexuosa avoided it. Two directions of spontaneous regeneration of windthrown stands were shown, depending on cover by grass or mosses and on the initial content of nitrogen in the soil, which provided the basis for indicating two different forest management strategies in windthrown pine forests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetula 3aPicea 3aPinus sylvestris 3aVaccinium vitis-idaea 3acanopy 3acell respiration 3aconiferous forests 3aecosystems 3aedaphic factors 3afires 3aforest litter 3aforest management 3agrasses 3amosses and liverworts 3anitrogen 3asaplings 3ashrubs 3asilviculture 3aspecies diversity 3atree and stand measurements 3awindthrow 3aPoland 0aStorm 0aRecovery 0aP. schreberi 0aV. vitis-idaea 0aNitrogen content 0aSoil respiration succession 0aLAI index 0aPrincipal response curve PRC0 tForest ecology and management.g2020 Apr. 01, v. 461 p.117950-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2020.1179503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02817naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006200147245013300209520135500342592002801697650002401725650001901749650002301768650001001791650001201801650001201813650001001825653009301835653002101928653003001949653002901979653003302008700005702041700002702098700006302125700005702188773008302245856008202328852000902410655001202419IND60724294020221119022407.0220214s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072429402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mex.2021.1012132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEgner, Władysław1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1643-952010aExperimental and numerical modeling approach for thermomechanical low cycle fatigue analysis of cyclically non-stabilized steels  aThe widely used fatigue life prediction models, such as the Coffin–Manson model or S–N curve related models are based on the assumption that the response of a material experiencing low cycle fatigue loading is stabilized during some period. However, for many materials such a stabilized state is hardly observed, and the activated mechanisms for cyclic hardening or softening depend on test conditions. In general, the selected test conditions (stress or strain control) should depend on the intended use of the obtained material data. If testing conditions do not correspond to the operation mode of the considered mechanical facilities, the above mentioned life prediction models will produce inaccurate results. Hence, selecting and identifying proper fatigue parameters, which would represent the state of a material during the whole fatigue life, is extremely important in reliability evaluation of structures. In the case of non-stabilizing steels, the common challenges are:•Selecting and performing a suitable set of experimental tests to recognize various aspects of the material behavior under low-cycle thermomechanical fatigue;•Adjusting a proper constitutive modelling, reflecting the real physical phenomena taking place in the material microstructure;•Effective numerical implementation and optimal parameter identification.  aPublisher supplied data 3amathematical models 3amicrostructure 3aphysical phenomena 3asteel 3astrains 3atesting 3awills 0aIdentification of thermo-mechanical fatigue behavior of cyclically non-stabilized steels 0aMaterial testing 0aThermo-mechanical fatigue 0aNumerical implementation 0aIdentification of parameters1 aSulich, Piotr1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6012-64391 aMroziński, Stanisław1 aPiotrowski, Michał1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6986-88901 aEgner, Halina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4055-36330 tMethodsX.g2021, v. 8 p.101213-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23402x2215-01617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mex.2021.1012133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01167naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245008900167300001600256520033400272592002800606650002600634650001400660650001100674700002300685773009900708856008500807852000900892655001200901IND60743052720221122004054.0210708e20210618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074305272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.oneear.2021.05.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYeo, Sara K.10aEnvironmental documentaries in a digital age should be ethical, not just captivating  ap. 780-782.  aThe rise of digital streaming platforms has increased the reach of documentary films, bringing questions of ethics to the forefront.

Accordingly, aberrant expression of BMAL1 and CLOCK (core components of circadian pathway) has been identified in cancers. In present study, transcript expression of BMAL1 and CLOCK was assessed, and proteins interactions were mapped, in colorectal cancer (CRC). Low BMAL1 gene expression was observed in tumors as compared to normal tissue samples from GSE39582, GSE21510 and TCGA publicly available datasets for CRC. BMAL1 and CLOCK were suppressed in APC low (WNT activated) and MYC high tumors. Moreover, BMAL1 was slightly upregulated in TGFβ-activated and BRAF-mutated tumors, whereas CLOCK was overexpressed in KRAS-mutated tumors. Protein interaction network of the core circadian molecules identified important CRC-related proteins physically associating with BMAL1 and CLOCK. Therefore, expressional correlation of circadian drivers with frequently altered pathways in CRC as well as interactions of BMAL1 and CLOCK with physiologically functional proteins highlight their importance in CRC while paving way for in depth study of circadian pathway in oncogenesis.  aThe current study is funded by Higher Education Commission (HEC), Pakistan under the Project ID: 2989.  aPublisher supplied data  a2969 3acarcinogenesis 3acircadian clocks 3acolorectal neoplasms 3adata collection 3aresearch 0aBMAL1 0aCLOCK 0acircadian rhythm 0acolorectal cancer1 aQadir, Javeria1 aRiaz, Syeda Kiran1 aSultan, Aimen1 aArif, Aiza1 aMalik, Muhammad Faraz Arshad0 tBiological rhythm research.g2022 Sept. 02, v. 53, no. 9 p.1400-1413dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12260x1744-41797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09291016.2021.19406233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02617naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006100142245007100203300001800274500002000292520148700312592002801799650001201827650001501839650001401854650001301868650001101881650001601892650002501908650001101933651001601944700001901960700005801979773013202037856007702169852000902246655001202255IND60789640520221122094810.0220822e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078964052DNAL7 a10.1002/2017JC0130112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernandez, Denise1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8192-953710aVariability of the subtropical mode water in the Southwest Pacific  ap. 7163-7180.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe variability of Subtropical Mode Water (STMW) in the Southwest Pacific is investigated using a 28 year‐long time series (1986–2014) of high‐resolution expendable bathythermograph data north of New Zealand (PX06) and a shorter time series, the Roemmich‐Gilson monthly Argo optimal interpolation for the 2004–2014 period. The variability in STMW inventories is compared to the variability in air‐sea heat fluxes, mixed layer depths and transport of the East Auckland Current (EAUC) to assess both the atmospheric and oceanic roles influencing the formation and decay of STMW. The STMW north of New Zealand has a short lifespan with little persistence of the water mass from 1 year to the next one. Deeper mixed layers and negative anomalies in surface heat fluxes are correlated with increased formation of STMW. The heat content of the STMW layer is anticorrelated with inventories, particularly during the El Niño years. This suggests that large volumes of STMW are coincident with cooler conditions in the prior winter and less oceanic heat storage. There is significant seasonal and interannual variability in STMW inventories, however there are no trends in STMW properties, including its core layer temperature over the last decade. The variability of the winter EAUC transport is highly correlated with the STMW inventories and thermocline depth in the following spring, suggesting ocean dynamics deepen the thermocline and precondition for deeper mixed layers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3ageophysics 3alongevity 3aresearch 3aspring 3atemperature 3atime series analysis 3awinter 3aNew Zealand1 aSutton, Philip1 aBowen, Melissa1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1425-50820 tJournal of geophysical research.g2017 Sept., v. 122, no. 9 p.7163-7180dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017JC0130113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03639naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245017600173520189000349592002802239650003002267650002702297650002202324650002502346650002302371650001202394650002402406650002002430650002202450650001002472650001602482650001102498650001202509650001402521650002202535650001402557650002202571650002402593650001402617650001402631653003802645653002202683700002402705700001402729700002602743700002602769700001902795700002402814700001502838700001902853773010702872856008502979852000903064655001203073IND60684189620221122105738.0200318e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068418962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2020.1086032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlwis, Priyangi A.10aDisruption of the Burkholderia pseudomallei two-component signal transduction system BbeR-BbeS leads to increased extracellular DNA secretion and altered biofilm formation  aTwo-component signal transduction systems (TCSTS) are abundant among prokaryotes and regulate important functions, including drug resistance and virulence. The Gram-negative bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, which causes the severe infectious disease melioidosis, encodes 136 putative TCSTS components. In silico analyses of these TCSTS indicated that the predicted BbeR-BbeS system (BPSL1036-BPSL1037) displayed significant amino acid sequence similarity to the Shigella flexneri virulence-associated OmpR-EnvZ osmoregulator. To assess the function of the B. pseudomallei BbeR-BbeS system, we constructed by allelic exchange a ΔbbeRS double mutant strain lacking both genes, and single ΔbbeR and ΔbbeS mutants. All three mutant strains caused disease in the BALB/c acute melioidosis model at the same rate as the wild-type strain, displayed unchanged swarming motility on semi-solid medium, and were unaffected for viability on high-osmolarity media. However, when cultured at 37 °C for at least 14 days, ΔbbeS and ΔbbeR colonies developed a distinct, hypermucoid morphology absent in similarly-cultured wild-type colonies. At both 30 °C and 37 °C, these hypermucoid strains produced wild-type levels of type I capsule but released increased quantities of extracellular DNA (eDNA). Upon static growth in liquid medium, all B. pseudomallei strains produced pellicle biofilms that contained DNA in close association with bacterial cells; however, the ΔbbeS and ΔbbeR strains produced increased biofilms with altered microscopic architecture compared to the wild-type. Unusually, while the ΔbbeS and ΔbbeR single-deletion mutants displayed clear phenotypes, the ΔbbeRS double-deletion mutant was indistinguishable from the wild-type strain. We propose that BbeR-BbeS indirectly affects eDNA secretion and biofilm formation through cross-talk with one or more other TCSTS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBurkholderia pseudomallei 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aShigella flexneri 3aamino acid sequences 3abacterial motility 3abiofilm 3acomputer simulation 3adrug resistance 3aenvironmental DNA 3agenes 3amelioidosis 3amodels 3amutants 3aphenotype 3aprokaryotic cells 3asecretion 3asequence homology 3asignal transduction 3aviability 3avirulence 0aTwo-component signal transduction 0aExtracellular DNA1 aTreerat, Puthayalai1 aGong, Lan1 aDeveson Lucas, Deanna1 aAllwood, Elizabeth M.1 aPrescott, Mark1 aDevenish, Rodney J.1 aAdler, Ben1 aBoyce, John D.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2020 Mar., v. 242 p.108603-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2020.1086033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03292naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245014800173300001600321520170700337592002802044650002102072650000902093650001002102650001702112650001002129650001302139650001102152650001402163650001602177650001402193650001702207651001002224653003102234653002902265653001402294653001602308653000902324653001402333700002202347700002202369700001802391700002102409700002402430700001802454700002002472700002202492700002202514773012002536856008502656852000902741655001202750IND60535324820221116154507.0190401e20150430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053532482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2015.02.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiannelli, Alessio10aEfficacy of Broadline® spot-on against Aelurostrongylus abstrusus and Troglostrongylus brevior lungworms in naturally infected cats from Italy  ap. 273-277.  aThe increasing reports of Aelurostrongylus abstrusus infection and the new information on Troglostrongylus brevior have spurred the interest of the scientific community towards the research of pharmaceutical compounds effective against both pathogens. A novel topical combination of fipronil, (S)-methoprene, eprinomectin and praziquantel (Broadline®, Merial) has been released for the treatment of a variety of feline parasitic infections. The present study reports the efficacy of this spot-on in treating cats naturally infected by feline lungworms. Client owned cats (n=191) were enrolled from three geographical areas of Italy and faecal samples were examined by floatation and Baermann techniques. Twenty-three individuals were positive for L1 of A. abstrusus (n=18) or T. brevior (n=3) or for both species (n=2) and they were topically treated with Broadline®. Seventeen of them were also concomitantly infected by other parasites. Four weeks after treatment, faecal samples were collected and examined to assess the efficacy of a single administration of the product. Based on lungworm larvae counts, the efficacy of the treatment was 90.5% or 100% for A. abstrusus or T. brevior, respectively. Cats released significantly lower amounts of lungworm larvae after treatment compared to pre-treatment (p<0.0001). All but three cats were negative for other nematodes after treatment and all cats recovered from respiratory signs. Results of this study indicate that a single administration of the topical combination fipronil, (S)-methoprene, eprinomectin and praziquantel is effective and safe for the treatment of A. abstrusus and/or T. brevior infections in cats living under field conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAelurostrongylus 3acats 3adrugs 3aeprinomectin 3afeces 3afipronil 3alarvae 3alungworms 3aparasitoses 3apathogens 3apraziquantel 3aItaly 0aAelurostrongylus abstrusus 0aTroglostrongylus brevior 0aLungworms 0aBroadline® 0aCats 0aTreatment1 aBrianti, Emanuele1 aVarcasia, Antonio1 aColella, Vito1 aTamponi, Claudia1 aDi Paola, Giancarlo1 aKnaus, Martin1 aHalos, Lénaïg1 aBeugnet, Frederic1 aOtranto, Domenico0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2015 Apr. 30, v. 209, no. 3-4 p.273-277dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2015.02.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02236naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001600142245012800158300001600286520114600302592002801448650001801476650001601494650001401510651001001524653001701534653001401551653001801565653001501583653003401598700001901632773016201651856007601813852000901889655001201898IND60747837520221122081212.0210820e20210818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074783752DNAL7 a10.3157/061.147.02042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiu, Shuang10aNew Species of the Genus Psychomyia Latreille (Trichoptera: Psychomyiidae) from China, with a Phylogney of Oriental Species  ap. 503-594.  aSeventeen new species of Psychomyia from China are described and illustrated, these species are: P. biacicularis Li, Qiu, and Morse, sp. nov.; P. cuspidata Li, Qiu, and Morse, sp. nov.; P. didymos Li, Qiu, and Morse, sp. nov.; P. ensiformis Li, Qiu, and Morse, sp. nov.; P. erecta Li, Qiu, and Morse, sp. nov.; P. hirta Li, Qiu, and Morse, sp. nov.; P. humecta Li, Qiu, and Morse, sp. nov.; P. longa Li, Qiu, and Morse, sp. nov.; P. machengensis Li, Qiu, and Morse, sp. nov.; P. meridionalis Li, Qiu, and Morse, sp. nov.; P. polyacantha Li, Qiu, and Morse, sp. nov.; P. rhombiformis Li, Qiu, and Morse, sp. nov.; P. rivalis Qiu, Morse, and Wiberg-Larsen, sp. nov.; P. trilobata Li, Qiu, and Morse, sp. nov.; P. similis Li, Qiu, and Morse, sp. nov.; P. trotispina Li, Qiu, and Morse, sp. nov.; and P. valida Li, Qiu, and Morse, sp. nov.Psychomyia chompuMalicky and Chantaramongkol, 1993; P. flavidaHagen, 1861; P. forcipataMartynov, 1934; and P. minima (Martynov, 1910) are reported from China for the first time.

In this work, a deeper knowledge of the performance of airborne microorganisms would allow improving the designs of the air-conditioning installations to restrict hospital-acquired infections (HAIs). A solution containing Escherichia coli (E. coli) as a model of airborne bacteria was nebulized using the Collison nebulizer to simulate bioaerosols in various hospital areas such as patients’ rooms or bathrooms. Results showed that the bioaerosol source had a significant influence on the airborne bacteria concentrations since 4.00 10², 6.84 10³ and 1.39 10⁴ CFU mL⁻¹ were monitored during the aerosolization for 10 min of urine, saliva and urban wastewater, respectively. These results may be explained considering the quite narrow distribution profile of drop sizes around 1.10–1.29 μm obtained for urban wastewater, with much vaster distribution profiles during the aerosolization of urine or saliva. The airborne bacteria concentration may increase up to 10⁷ CFU mL⁻¹ for longer sampling times and higher aerosolization pressures, causing several cell damages. The cell membrane damage index (ID) can vary from 0 to 1, depending on the genomic DNA releases from bacteria. In fact, the ID of E. coli was more than two times higher (0.33 vs. 0.72) when increasing the pressure of air flow was applied from 1 to 2 bar. Finally, the ventilation air flow also affected the distribution of bioaerosols due to its direct relationship with the relative humidity of indoor air. Specifically, the airborne bacteria concentration diminished almost below 3-logs by applying more than 10 L min⁻¹ during the aerosolization of urine due to their inactivation by an increase in their osmotic pressure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aEscherichia coli 3aWorld Health Organization 3aair 3aair flow 3abioaerosols 3acell membranes 3ahospitals 3amodels 3aosmotic pressure 3arelative humidity 3aresearch 3asaliva 3aurine 3awastewater 0aBioaerosol 0aHospital 0aUrban wastewater1 aLacasa, Engracia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1508-58151 aCañizares, Pablo1 aRodrigo, Manuel A.1 aSáez, Cristina,0 tEnvironmental research.g2023 Jan. 01, v. 216 p.114458-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2022.114458  aDNAL 7aarticle02150naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245009000171300001600261520110500277592002801382650001301410650002401423650002601447650002801473650002601501650001401527650001301541650001601554650001501570700001701585700001801602773008201620856008901702852000901791655001201800IND60095844220221116154906.0141104e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009584422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2010.10.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIoannou, G.10aDielectric and functional properties of polymer matrix/ZnO/BaTiO₃ hybrid composites  ap. 104-110.  aCeramic–polymer composites incorporating ferroelectric and piezoelectric crystal particles, randomly distributed within the polymer matrix represent a novel class of materials. Composites including ferroelectric and/or piezoelectric particles are expected to exhibit functional properties because of the varying polarization of the ceramic particles. In the present study polymer matrix/ZnO/BaTiO₃ composites were prepared, in different filler concentrations. The dielectric response of all samples was studied by means of broadband dielectric spectroscopy, over a wide temperature (from 30°C to 160°C) and frequency (from 10⁻¹Hz to 10MHz) range. Experimental data were analyzed by means of dielectric permittivity and electric modulus formalisms. Dielectric permittivity and loss are increasing with ceramic filler and diminishing rapidly with frequency. The functionality of the composite systems is related to the abrupt variation of the real part of permittivity, in the vicinity of the characteristic Curie temperature of BaTiO₃, and to the relaxing polarization of the ZnO particles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aceramics 3acomposite materials 3adielectric properties 3adielectric spectroscopy 3afunctional properties 3aparticles 3apolymers 3atemperature 3azinc oxide1 aPatsidis, A.1 aPsarras, G.C.0 tComposites.g2011 Jan., v. 42, no. 1 p.104-110dElsevier Ltdx1359-835X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesa.2010.10.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02234naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100005400190245013800244300001600382506007600398520065600474592002801130506003701158650002601195650001401221650001701235650002001252650001701272650001801289650002201307650001501329651001001344653001901354653001401373653001301387653002801400653002401428700001801452700001501470700001301485700001701498700001301515700001501528773009301543856008301636852000901719655001201728IND60530718020221207144927.0170320e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053071802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gdata.2015.12.0192doi7 aPMC47786402pmcid7 a269813862pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Peng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4064-984610aCultivation-independent comprehensive investigations on bacterial communities in serofluid dish, a traditional Chinese fermented food  ap. 127-128.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSerofluid dish (or Jiangshui, in Chinese), a traditional food in the Chinese culture, is made from vegetables by fermentation.

This study aimed to explore the psychometric properties of the Bangla version of the CSM and validate it with sleep habits, BRUnel Mood Scale (BRUMS) and Positive Mental Health Scale (PMH-scale). The sample consisted of 1164 (38.8% women) Bangladeshi university students aged between 18 and 27 (M = 21.9, SD = 1.88). Using confirmatory factor analysis, the competing factorial models of the CSM and measurement invariance for sex were tested. The Bangla CSM showed high internal consistency reliability (α = .88) and excellent retest reliability (ICC = .92). The cut-off values for the Bangla CSM were 26 or less for evening-types (lower 10 percentiles) and 46 or more for morning-types (upper 10 percentiles). The Bangla CSM consisted of two components: morningness and morning affect. From eight factorial models, the two-factor bifactor model was found invariant for sex. Higher CSM score (morningness) was significantly related with earlier sleep times, better mood and mental health, which support its validity. The CSM is a valid and psychometrically robust tool for assessing morningness-eveningness in Bangladeshi students.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiological rhythms 3aemotions 3afactor analysis 3amental health 3amodels 3aresearch 3asleep 0aCircadian rhythm 0amorningness-eveningness 0achronotype 0aBangla CSM 0asleep habits1 aDíaz-Morales, Juan F.1 aKhan, Mozibul H.

Here, POSs were generated from apple pectin, rhamnogalacturonan-I and homogalacturonan with different degrees of esterification (high and low) using an optimized concentration of trifluoroacetic acid. The resulting POSs were analytically characterized, revealing that they contain linear and branched oligomers with a degree of polymerization (DP) up to 7. Biological activity of the generated POSs was determined in terms of immuno- and bacterio-modulatory perspectives. POSs significantly reduced the inflammatory response triggered by lipopolysaccharide and promoted the growth of several bacteria beneficial to the human gut. Overall results indicate that the degree of esterification of POSs is not a key element, but length of the DP and structure of POSs are responsible for biological outcomes. Owing to their biological activity, the POSs generated here can be considered as effective prebiotics and can be exploited for maintaining immune and microbial homeostasis in the human gut.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapples 3abioactive properties 3adigestive system 3aesterification 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3ahydrocolloids 3ainflammation 3alipopolysaccharides 3aoligosaccharides 3apolygalacturonic acid 3apolymerization 3aprebiotics 0aPectin oligosaccharides 0aImmunomodulatory 0aBacterio-modulatory 0aGut microbiota1 aSuraj Prakash,1 aBhatia, Ruchika1 aNegi, Manorma1 aSingh, Jagdeep1 aBishnoi, Mahendra1 aKondepudi, Kanthi Kiran0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2020 Nov., v. 108 p.105988-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2020.1059883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02723naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245007400156300001600230500002000246520136900266592002801635650001101663650002501674650002001699650002401719650002301743650001501766650001001781650001401791650002601805650002601831650001601857650002401873650002101897650001901918650002901937650001001966700001801976700002001994700001802014773015102032856007302183852000902256655001202265IND60587369420221120202000.0180102e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058736942DNAL7 a10.1111/jvp.123662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiguère, S.10aComparative pharmacokinetics of minocycline in foals and adult horses  ap. 335-341.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe objective of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetics of minocycline in foals vs. adult horses. Minocycline was administered to six healthy 6‐ to 9‐week‐old foals and six adult horses at a dose of 4 mg/kg intragastrically (IG) and 2 mg/kg intravenously (i.v.) in a cross‐over design. Five additional oral doses were administered at 12‐h intervals in foals. A microbiologic assay was used to measure minocycline concentration in plasma, urine, synovial fluid, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry was used to measure minocycline concentrations in pulmonary epithelial lining fluid (PELF) and bronchoalveolar (BAL) cells. After i.v. administration to foals, minocycline had a mean (±SD) elimination half‐life of 8.5 ± 2.1 h, a systemic clearance of 113.3 ± 26.1 mL/h/kg, and an apparent volume of distribution of 1.24 ± 0.19 L/kg. Pharmacokinetic variables determined after i.v. administration to adult horses were not significantly different from those determined in foals. Bioavailability was significantly higher in foals (57.8 ± 19.3%) than in adult horses (32.0 ± 18.0%). Minocycline concentrations in PELF were higher than in other body fluids. Oral minocycline dosed at 4 mg/kg every 12 h might be adequate for the treatment of susceptible bacterial infections in foals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abacterial infections 3abioavailability 3acerebrospinal fluid 3across-over studies 3aepithelium 3afoals 3ahalf life 3aintravenous injection 3aliquid chromatography 3aminocycline 3aoral administration 3apharmacokinetics 3asynovial fluid 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aurine1 aBurton, A.

Existing ground probing approaches mainly rely on contact machineries, which exhibit slow responses and damage sugarcane plants. This paper presents a rapid and non-contact terrain sensing method using ground penetrating radar (GPR) to realise the automatic height control of the base-cutter. In this study, a 1.6-GHz air-coupled GPR antenna was first mounted on a knockdown roller to measure the vertical distance between the ground and the antenna. The geographic relationship between the detection height and cutter cylinder length was established, based on which the base-cutter height was adjusted by changing the cylinder length. The obtained GPR signal was analysed to locate the ground surface. Post-process techniques were used to enhance the GPR signal contrast between the air and ground layer. To evaluate the penetrating ability and accuracy of the GPR method, sugarcane stalks were densely placed on the soil surface to mimic the extreme conditions of sugarcane fields. The influences of the height/depth of respective highlands/potholes, slope of the ground, and the moisture content of the soil on the GPR imaging were systematically investigated. The numerical and laboratory results confirmed the high accuracy of the proposed GPR method. Hence, a field experiment was conducted, and the soil surface was clearly visualised by GPR imaging. This study demonstrates the significant potential of the GPR-based method for the detection of a sugarcane field surface, which verifies its feasibility for use in manufactured automatic sugarcane harvesters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3afield experimentation 3alandscapes 3asoil 3asugarcane 3atopography 3awater content 0aSugarcane harvesting 0aCutter height control 0aGround penetrating radar 0aTerrain detection 0aNon-contact method1 aZhang, Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5594-92031 aJiao, Shengjie1 aZheng, Ting1 aLi, Jie1 aZhao, Tieshuan0 tBiosystems engineering.g2022 July, v. 219 p.103-123dElsevier LtdaIAgrEwJournal:jnl70639x1537-51107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2022.04.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01902naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006500148245016600213300001800379500001900397520055800416592002800974650005301002650002301055650001901078650001001097650001301107650002501120650001401145650002001159653002301179653001701202653003401219653001201253700002601265773013401291856008201425852000901507655001201516IND60719688920221118094824.0201204e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071968892DNAL7 a10.1094/PHYTO-04-20-0131-A2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO’Leary, Michael L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6151-626810aComplete Genome Sequence Resource of a Strain of Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens pv. flaccumfaciens, the Causal Agent of Bacterial Wilt of Common Bean, from Turkey  ap. 2010-2013.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCurtobacterium flaccumfaciens pv. flaccumfaciens is the causal agent of bacterial wilt of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), a disease that can reduce yields of this economically important crop worldwide.

A poly (N-isopropylacrylamide-co-divinylbenzene-co-N, N′-methylenediacrylamide) [Poly (NIPAAm-co-DVB-co-MBAA)] monolithic column was designed according to the chemical structures of selected TAs and used as an extraction medium engaging in hydrophobic, π-π, and hydrogen bonding interactions with analytes, allowing them to be effectively extracted. A number of important parameters were systematically optimized to achieve maximal extraction efficiency. The ion intensity of the TAs signals obtained by in-tube SPME-MS were higher than the direct MS mode by about 400 folds with the signal-to-noise ratio improved by 2–7 folds. The detection limits of the six TAs were determined as 1.99–4.06 ng g−1, with good linearity with correlation coefficients exceeding 0.99 obtained under optimal extraction conditions. Besides, TA recoveries in cigarette tobacco spiked at three concentration levels were in the range of 76.4–100.2%, and the corresponding RSDs (n = 5) were obtained as 4.32–7.16%. The extraction performance of the poly (NIPAAm-co-DVB-co-MBAA) monolithic column was well reproducible, with intra- or inter-day precision RSDs determined not to exceed 7.38%. Finally, no marked matrix effects were observed when the developed method was applied to the analysis of both high-abundance and trace-level TAs in practical samples, and the above technique was therefore concluded to be well suited for the detection of TAs in cigarette tobacco or other products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaloids 3achemical structure 3achromatography 3acigarettes 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrophobicity 3amass spectrometry 3asignal-to-noise ratio 3asolid phase microextraction 0aIn-tube solid-phase microextraction 0aPoly(N-isopropyl-acrylamide-co-divinyl-benzene-co-N, N′-methylene diacrylamide) monolithic microextraction 0aMass spectrometry 0aTobacco alkaloids 0aExtraction and enrichment1 aYang, Shutong1 aWang, Liang1 aWei, Wanghui1 aDing, Chuan-Fan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5207-84730 tTalanta.g2019 June 01, v. 198 p.118-127dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2019.01.0733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02107naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100004000142245009500182300001600277520116900293592002801462650001001490650001101500650001201511650001301523650001501536650001501551650001301566773014001579856007701719852000901796655001201805IND60765378320221119152052.0220422e20170929xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076537832DNAL7 a10.17221/64/2015-rae2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWynand Jacobus van der Merwe, Steyn12aA novel method for the quantification of interfacial tomato stresses during transportation  ap. 128-135.  aTransportation of tomatoes on farm and market roads causes interfacial stresses of tomatoes due to truck dynamics as affected by road and transportation conditions. These stresses may affect the shelf-life of tomatoes if they are high enough to cause damage to the fruit. This paper describes a novel method for the in situ measurement of the stresses during actual transportation of tomatoes, providing the producer information that can assist in taking decisions regarding the use of alternative routes, maintenance of existing routes or changes in packing to prevent excessive stresses onto tomatoes. The process involves measurement of the stresses using a stress-sensor that is recording the interfacial stresses continuously during transportation. These stresses can be correlated to road conditions (quantified through standard road-roughness statistics) and used to subject tomatoes in laboratory conditions to similar stresses to study shelf-life effects of transportation stresses. The paper focuses on the measurement process and first-order data analysis, and excludes a detailed study on the physiological effects of the measured stresses on tomatoes.  aPublisher supplied data 3afarms 3afruits 3amarkets 3aresearch 3ashelf life 3astatistics 3atomatoes0 tResearch in Agricultural Engineering.g, v. 63, no. 3 p.128-135dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21420x1212-91517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/64/2015-rae3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03064naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245014900175300001600324520160700340592002801947650001601975650002201991650001702013650001202030650001402042650002602056650001002082650001502092650000802107650001302115650001102128650001602139650001402155650002102169651001802190651001102208653001802219653001702237653001402254653001802268700003002286700002002316700002102336773012002357856008402477852000902561655001202570IND60544916220221116190915.0160901e20130915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054491622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2013.06.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchatz, Elizabeth R.10aResponse of benthos to stress factors in Holocene Arctic fjord settings: Maktak, Coronation, and North Pangnirtung Fjords, Baffin Island, Canada  ap. 652-668.  aMaktak, Coronation and North Pangnirtung Fjords are situated on Cumberland Peninsula, Baffin Island, Canada, having a common freshwater source from the Penny Ice Cap. Bottom photographs were examined to identify epifaunal trails and shallow endobenthic burrow openings exposed on the seafloor surface. These were compared to biogenic sedimentary structures revealed through x-radiograph images and direct observations of Lehigh gravity core samples. Intermediate- and deep-tier structures characterize the ichnofabrics of the glaciomarine sediments. Extensive bioturbation by the shallow-tier and epibenthic tracemakers, most notably ophiuroid echinoderms (brittlestars) and other organisms, has destroyed much of the primary sedimentary fabric (i.e. lamination) resulting in homogenous silty clay sediments. The dominant deep-tier structure consisting of an open, three-dimensional boxwork burrow system is the most pervasive biogenic structure observed within the core samples. Interestingly, although proximal–distal trends in benthic macrofaunal composition are evident in the bottom photographs, ichnofabrics remain relatively constant along the length of the fjords. Environmental factors influencing the biological community in these modern high latitude fjords differ from conditions described in Paleozoic and Cenozoic fjord environments. An increasing number of recent studies are expanding significantly on the fjord ichnology database, and provide the basis for the revision of the currently proposed fjord trace-fossil model, accommodating the complexity and diversity of fjord settings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOphiuroidea 3abenthic organisms 3abioturbation 3aburrows 3adatabases 3aenvironmental factors 3afauna 3afreshwater 3aice 3alatitude 3amodels 3aphotographs 3asediments 3asilty clay soils 3aArctic region 3aCanada 0aArctic fjords 0aGlaciomarine 0aIchnology 0aLate Holocene1 aMángano, María Gabriela1 aAitken, Alec E.1 aBuatois, Luis A.0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2013 Sept. 15, v. 386 p.652-668dElsevier B.V.x0031-01827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2013.06.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03386naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245015500169300001600324520188300340592002802223650002202251650001202273650001902285650001402304650002402318650001602342650002502358650001402383650001102397650001102408650002502419650001202444651002102456653001802477653001902495653001202514653001802526653001502544653002102559700001602580700002002596700001902616700001802635700001402653773012002667856008402787852000902871655001202880IND60544916320221116190956.0160901e20130915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054491632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2013.06.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGalloway, J.M.10aClimate change and decadal to centennial-scale periodicities recorded in a late Holocene NE Pacific marine record: Examining the role of solar forcing  ap. 669-689.  aWe present a decadal-scale late Holocene climate record based on diatoms, biogenic silica, and grain size from a 12-m sediment core (VEC02A04) obtained from Frederick Sound in the Seymour-Belize Inlet Complex of British Columbia, Canada. Sediments are characterized by graded, massive, and laminated intervals. Laminated intervals are most common between c. 2948–2708cal. yr BP and c. 1992–1727cal. yr BP. Increased preservation of laminated sediments and diatom assemblage changes at this time suggest that climate became moderately drier and cooler relative to the preceding and succeeding intervals. Spectral and wavelet analyses are used to test for statistically significant periodicities in time series of proxies of primary production (total diatom abundance, biogenic silica) and hydrology (grain size) preserved in the Frederick Sound record. Periodicities of c. 42–53, 60–70, 82–89, 241–243, and 380yrs are present. Results are compared to reconstructed sunspot number data of Solanki et al. (2004) using cross wavelet transform to evaluate the role of solar forcing on NE Pacific climate. Significant common power of periodicities between c. 42–60, 70–89, 241–243, and of 380yrs occur, suggesting that celestial forcing impacted late Holocene climate at Frederick Sound. Replication of the c. 241–243yr periodicity in sunspot time series is most pronounced between c. 2900cal. yr BP and c. 2000cal. yr BP, broadly correlative to the timing of maximum preservation of laminated sedimentary successions and diatom assemblage changes. High solar activity at the Suess/de Vries band may have been manifested as a prolonged westward shift and/or weakening of the Aleutian Low in the mid-late Holocene, which would have diverted fewer North Pacific storms and resulted in the relatively dry conditions reconstructed for the Seymour-Belize Inlet Complex.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3ahydrology 3ameteorological data 3aperiodicity 3aprimary productivity 3asediments 3asilica 3astorms 3atime series analysis 3awavelet 3aBritish Columbia 0aLate Holocene 0aClimate change 0aDiatoms 0aSolar forcing 0aNE Pacific 0aWavelet analysis1 aWigston, A.1 aPatterson, R.T.1 aSwindles, G.T.1 aReinhardt, E.1 aRoe, H.M.0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2013 Sept. 15, v. 386 p.669-689dElsevier B.V.x0031-01827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2013.06.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03213naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100001700158245007200175300001400247520148500261592002801746650002201774650001601796650001101812650002301823650001901846650000901865650001001874650001901884650001201903650001301915650001001928650002301938650001201961650003501973650001202008650003902020650001102059650003302070650004102103650000902144650000902153650001602162650005302178650001602231650001702247650006902264700001402333700001902347700001902366700001702385700001202402773011502414856007302529852000902602655001202611IND50072432420221120063848.0150206e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007243242DNAL7 a236921852pmid7 a10.1111/mve.120162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJOHANSEN, H.10aBlow fly responses to semiochemicals produced by decaying carcasses  ap. 26-34.  aVolatiles from mouse carcasses in decay stages ranging from fresh to 33 days old were used to investigate oriented flight and landings in male and female blow flies of Calliphora vicina Robineau‐Desvoidy (Diptera: Calliphoridae). Oriented flight increased significantly from 36% towards fresh carcasses to 68%, 61% and 65% towards carcasses aged 3 days, 6 days and 9 days, respectively. Carcasses aged 20 days and 33 days were significantly less attractive, achieving 51% and 41% attraction, respectively. No differences emerged between the sexes in oriented flight, but a significant increase in female landings at the most attractive carcasses was observed. Headspace collections from the different stages of decay showed a succession in the volatile profile emitted from the carcasses and identified nine chemicals which peak in quantity in concurrence with the most attractive stages of decay. Three of these chemicals also showed dose–response effects as indicated by a significant correlation between the amount present and the proportion of flies responding. Blow flies are important pests and efficient traps are needed. The significant interaction between fly sex and carcass age highlights behavioural differences between male and female blow flies which can be exploited in blow fly trapping. Three new volatile chemicals, butylated hydroxyl toluene, 3‐hydroxy‐2‐butanone and nonanal, emitted from dead mice are suggested as potential attractants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCalliphora vicina 3aattractants 3aflight 3aheadspace analysis 3ameat carcasses 3amice 3apests 3asemiochemicals 3atoluene 3atrapping 3atraps 3avolatile compounds 2aAnimals 2aBehavior, Animalxdrug effects 2aCadaver 2aDipteraxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aFemale 2aFlight, Animalxdrug effects 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aMale 2aMice 2aOrientation 2aPheromonesxchemistryxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aSex Factors 2aTime Factors 2aVolatile Organic Compoundsxchemistryxmetabolismxpharmacology.1 aSOLUM, M.1 aKNUDSEN, G.

The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of FTO gene may exert different impacts on different types of BC. In this study, we investigated the association between FTO SNP rs9939609 and the status of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), P53, and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) in BC patients. Our case–control study was included 540 Iranian participants aged 35 to 70 (180 women with BC as the case group and 360 healthy controls). After genotyping for risk allele rs9939609 of the FTO gene, a logistic regression was applied to elucidate the association between FTO SNP rs9939609 and BC risk based on the receptor status. The number of HER-2 negative patients was significantly higher in FTO rs9939609 risk allele carrier group (61.5% vs. 41.4%, P < 0.05). A significant association was found between BC and rs9939609 FTO gene polymorphism only in HER2 negative BC patients (OR = 1.79, CI95%: 1.2–3.56, P = 0.03). No association was identified between FTO rs9939609 polymorphism and the status of ER, PR, and P53. We indicated that FTO SNP rs9939609 can be a potential therapeutic target particularly in HER-2 negative BC cases. The importance of this risk allele in BC pathogenesis needs to be further highlighted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3abreast neoplasms 3acase-control studies 3aclinical nutrition 3aerbB-2 receptor 3aestrogen receptors 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3apathogenesis 3aprogesterone receptors 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3atherapeutics 0aFTO 0ars9939609 0aBreast cancer 0aHER2 0aFTO 0aSNP 0aBMI 0aER 0aPR 0aHER-21 aHatami, Hossein1 aFathi, Soroor1 aHasanpour Ardekanizadeh, Naeemeh1 aBourbour, Fatemeh1 aRastgoo, Samira1 aShafiee, Fatemeh1 aAkbari, Mohammad Esmail1 aGholamalizadeh, Maryam1 aMosavi Jarrahi, Seyed Alireza1 aDoaei, Saeid0 tClinical nutrition ESPEN.g2022 June, v. 49 p.495-498dElsevier LtdaEuropean Society for Clinical Nutrition and MetabolismwJournal:23538x2405-45777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnesp.2022.02.1223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02003naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245010800168300001600276520082700292592002801119650001501147650001401162650002801176650001301204650001601217650001101233653002001244653003001264653002201294653002101316653001601337653002201353700002401375700002301399773010301422856008301525852000901608655001201617IND60592193720221123015601.0180331e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059219372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2016.11.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJansen, Gunnar10aHULK – Simple and fast generation of structured hexahedral meshes for improved subsurface simulations  ap. 159-170.  aShort for Hexahedra from Unique Location in (K)convex Polyhedra – HULK is a simple and efficient algorithm to generate hexahedral meshes from generic STL files describing a geological model to be used in simulation tools based on the finite element, finite volume or finite difference methods.

The workflow addresses the management of large subsurface dataset, mainly seismic lines and well logs, and the construction of a 3D velocity model able to describe the variation of the velocity parameters related to strong facies and thickness variability and to high structural complexity. Although it is applicable in many geological contexts (e.g. foreland basins, large intermountain basins), it is particularly suitable in wide flat regions, where subsurface structures have no surface expression.The Vel-IO 3D tool is composed by three scripts, written in Python 2.7.11, that automate i) the 3D instantaneous velocity model building, ii) the velocity model optimization, iii) the time-depth conversion. They determine a 3D geological model that is consistent with the primary geological constraints (e.g. depth of the markers on wells).The proposed workflow and the Vel-IO 3D tool have been tested, during the EU funded Project GeoMol, by the construction of the 3D geological model of a flat region, 5700km² in area, located in the central part of the Po Plain. The final 3D model showed the efficiency of the workflow and Vel-IO 3D tool in the management of large amount of data both in time and depth domain. A 4 layer-cake velocity model has been applied to a several thousand (5000–13,000m) thick succession, with 15 horizons from Triassic up to Pleistocene, complicated by a Mesozoic extensional tectonics and by buried thrusts related to Southern Alps and Northern Apennines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aTriassic period 3abasins 3acomputers 3adata collection 3ageophysics 3amodels 3atectonics 3awells 0a3D geological modeling 0a3D velocity model 0aPo Plain 0aTime-depth conversion 0aVelocity analysis1 aD’Ambrogi, Chiara0 tComputers & geosciences.g2017 Feb., v. 99 p.171-182dElsevier LtdwJournal:12438x0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2016.11.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02632naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245010100165520136000266592002801626650001501654650002601669650001301695650002001708650003101728650002901759650001001788650001801798650002601816650001401842650003301856650001401889650001701903650002001920700002701940700002001967700003001987773011902017856007702136852000902213655001202222IND60707855020221122065028.0200821e20200810xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070785502DNAL7 a10.3390/genes110809142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaderi, Reyhaneh 10aUsing Micro- and Macro-Level Network Metrics Unveils Top Communicative Gene Modules in Psoriasis  a(1) Background: Psoriasis is a multifactorial chronic inflammatory disorder of the skin, with significant morbidity, characterized by hyperproliferation of the epidermis. Even though psoriasis’ etiology is not fully understood, it is believed to be multifactorial, with numerous key components. (2) Methods: In order to cast light on the complex molecular interactions in psoriasis vulgaris at both protein–protein interactions and transcriptomics levels, we studied a set of microarray gene expression analyses consisting of 170 paired lesional and non-lesional samples. Afterwards, a network analysis was conducted on the protein–protein interaction network of differentially expressed genes based on micro- and macro-level network metrics at a systemic level standpoint. (3) Results: We found 17 top communicative genes, all of which were experimentally proven to be pivotal in psoriasis, which were identified in two modules, namely the cell cycle and immune system. Intra- and inter-gene interaction subnetworks from the top communicative genes might provide further insight into the corresponding characteristic interactions. (4) Conclusions: Potential gene combinations for therapeutic/diagnostics purposes were identified. Moreover, our proposed workflow could be of interest to a broader range of future biological network analysis studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell cycle 3adiagnostic techniques 3aetiology 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agene regulatory networks 3agenes 3aimmune system 3amicroarray technology 3amorbidity 3aprotein-protein interactions 3apsoriasis 3atherapeutics 3atranscriptomics1 aSaadati Mollaei, Homa 1 aElofsson, Arne 1 aHosseini Ashtiani, Saman 0 tGenes.g2020 Aug. 10, v. 11, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes110809143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03091naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245013700166300001400303520162000317592002801937650001701965650001401982650002201996650001402018650001402032650001202046650001902058650002002077650002202097650001302119650002102132650001802153650001102171650000702182650001702189650001102206653002702217653002502244653002702269653002402296653002102320653000902341700002102350700001502371700001802386773007502404856008502479852000902564655001202573IND60581479320221116170504.0171005e20160301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058147932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2015.11.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDan, Ding,10aUtilization of deep eutectic solvents as novel mobile phase additives for improving the separation of bioactive quaternary alkaloids  ap. 85-90.  aDeep eutectic solvents (DESs) were used as novel mobile phase additives to improve chromatographic separation of four quaternary alkaloids including coptisine chloride, sanguinarine, berberine chloride and chelerythrine on a C18 column. DESs as a new class of ionic liquids are renewably sourced, environmentally benign, low cost and easy to prepare. Seven DESs were obtained by mixing different hydrogen acceptors and hydrogen-bond donors. The effects of organic solvents, the concentration of DESs, the types of DESs and the pH values of the buffer solution on the separation of the analytes were investigated. The composition of acetonitrile and 1.0% deep eutectic solvents aqueous solution (pH 3.3, adjusted with hydrochloric acid) in a 32:68 (v/v) ratio was used as optimized mobile phase, with which four quaternary alkaloids were well separated. When a small amount of DESs was added in the mobile phase for the separation of alkaloids on the C18 column, noticeable improvements were distinctly observed such as decreasing peak tailing and improving resolution. The separation mechanism mediated by DESs as mobile phase additives can be attributed to combined effect of both hydrogen acceptors and hydrogen-bond donors. For example, choline chloride can effectively cover the residual silanols on silica surface and ethylene glycol can reduce the retention time of analytes. The proposed method has been applied to determine BerbC in Lanqin Chinese herbal oral solution and BerbC tablet. Utilization of DESs in mobile phase can efficiently improve separation and selectivity of analytes from complex samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3aadditives 3aaqueous solutions 3aberberine 3achlorides 3acholine 3achromatography 3aethylene glycol 3ahydrochloric acid 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen bonding 3aionic liquids 3amixing 3apH 3asanguinarine 3asilica 0aDeep eutectic solvents 0aQuaternary alkaloids 0aMobile phase additives 0aRetention mechanism 0aCholine chloride 0aHPLC1 aZhang, Mingliang1 aWan, Yiqun1 aQiu, Hongdeng0 tTalanta.g2016 Mar. 01, v. 149 p.85-90dElsevier B.V.x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2015.11.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02490naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002700156245010900183300001600292500001900308500002000327520120700347592002801554650002401582650003101606650003501637650003801672650001301710650000901723650002201732650002201754650001501776650001701791650001701808700002501825700002501850773011801875856009001993852000902083655001202092IND60734297620221118023412.0210417e198703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073429762DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.1987.tb00877.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHETRICK, B.

Although growth of each of the plant species benefited from the mycorrhizal fungus under adequately watered conditions, inoculation had no effect on the growth of corn or sudan grass when cyclic drought stress was imposed on these plants. In contrast, growth of mycorrhizal big bluestem was significantly greater than non‐mycorrhizal big bluestem, even under severe drought stress. Drought‐stressed mycorrhizal plants without phosphorus amendment were not larger than drought‐stressed, non‐inoculated, fertilized (15 mg kg ¹p) plants, suggesting no increased drought tolerance. The ability of Glomus etunicatum Becker & Hall to benefit plant growth under drought stress was apparently plant‐mediated and possibly related to the dependency of the plant on this mycorrhizal fungus. Under adequately watered conditions, inoculated corn and sudan grass were respectively 1.23 and 1.13 times larger than non‐inoculated plants, while inoculated big bluestem was 6.56‐fold larger than non‐inoculated control plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAndropogon gerardii 3aClaroideoglomus etunicatum 3aSorghum bicolor subsp. bicolor 3aSorghum bicolor subsp. drummondii 3aZea mays 3acorn 3adrought tolerance 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aphosphorus 3aplant growth 3awater stress1 aKITT, D.

In this study, we aim to use Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to gain new structural insights into amyloid formation of HEWL under heat and acidic condition. We reveal that the fibril-forming solution of HEWL has the capability to form fibril and oligomer with distinct β-sheet configurations under different temperatures. Amyloid fibril with parallel β-sheet configuration is formed at elevated temperature, while oligomer with antiparallel β-sheet configuration is formed at room temperature. The interplay between fibrillation and oligomerization suggests that the two β-sheet aggregates consume the same amyloidogenic materials such as peptide fragments and nicked HEWL due to lysozyme hydrolysis under heat and acidic condition. Temperature-dependent FTIR reveals that the oligomer is unstable at elevated temperature, demonstrating its off-pathway nature. The temperature-dependent formation of parallel and antiparallel β-sheet configurations discovered in lysozyme system is compared with that of amyloid-β and α-synuclein systems and the implication is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aambient temperature 3aamyloid 3aegg albumen 3aheat 3ahens 3ahydrolysis 3alysozyme 3amodels 3aoligomerization 3aphysical chemistry1 aLi, Yiyi1 aHao, Wenying1 aHu, Xiaoqian1 aMa, Gang0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2013 Apr. 18, v. 117, no. 15 p.4003-4013dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp40035593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02448naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245015600172300001800328520104500346592002801391650002401419650003001443650001501473650001101488650001501499650001101514650002401525650002901549650002901578650003601607700002201643700002101665700002401686700002401710700002101734700003301755773015501788856008601943852000902029655001202038IND60549825320170925000000.0160909e20150724xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054982532DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jnatprod.5b001792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSinisi, Annamaria10aPoly-Electrophilic Sesquiterpene Lactones from Vernonia amygdalina: New Members and Differences in Their Mechanism of Thiol Trapping and in Bioactivity  ap. 1618-1623.  aIn addition to known compounds, the leaves of Vernonia amygdalina afforded the new sesquiterpene lactones 14-O-methylvernolide (2), 3′-deoxyvernodalol (6), and vernomygdalin (8). These and related compounds were evaluated for modulation of a series of thiol trapping-sensitive transcription factors (NF-κB, STAT3, and Nrf2), involved in the maintenance of the chronic inflammatory condition typical of human degenerative diseases. Vernolide (1) emerged as a potent inhibitor of STAT3 and NF-κB and showed cytostatic activity toward the prostate cancer cell line DU45, arresting the cell cycle at the S phase. The exomethylene lactones are characterized by multiple Michael acceptor sites, as exemplified by vernolide (1) and vernodalol (5). By using the nuclear magnetic resonance-based cysteamine assay, the most reactive thiophilic site could be identified in both compounds, and competitive experiments qualified vernolide (1) as being more thiophilic than vernodalol (5), in agreement with the results of the pharmacological assays.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVernonia amygdalina 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3acysteamine 3ahumans 3ainterphase 3aleaves 3aprostatic neoplasms 3asesquiterpenoid lactones 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B1 aMillán, Estrella1 aAbay, Solomon M.1 aHabluetzel, Annette1 aAppendino, Giovanni1 aMuñoz, Eduardo,1 aTaglialatela-Scafati, Orazio0 tJournal of natural products.g2015 July 24, v. 78, no. 7 p.1618-1623dAmerican Chemical Society and American Society of Pharmacognosyx1520-60257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jnatprod.5b001793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02167naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245013700169300001400306520087400320592002801194650001401222650001501236650001701251650001501268650002201283650001101305650001101316650001501327650001301342651001001355653001501365653001701380653002001397653001401417653001201431653002501443700003301468700002201501773011701523856008401640852000901724655001201733IND60544916920221116191020.0160901e20131001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054491692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2013.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeyrot, Daniel10aPaleoecology of the late Campanian/early Maastrichtian Fossil-Lagerstätte of “Lo Hueco” (Cuenca, Spain): Palynological insights  ap. 27-39.  aDetailed palynological analyses of the late Campanian/early Maastrichtian Fossil-Lagerstätte of “Lo Hueco” have been undertaken.

The palynofloras of the site revealed different micro-environments. The main differences among them may be related to water availability within a coastal environment. The overwhelming presence of pollen grains (especially Emmapollis? spp., but also Sparganiaceaepollenites spp.), herein described and related to Typhaceae, distinguishes the assemblages of Lo Hueco from the other late Cretaceous European palynofloras.

Wood-based materials are advantageous in that they have potentially lower environmental impacts as compared with other materials such as steel. However, using wood per se does not automatically ensure more sustainability. Few prospective sustainability assessment methods or studies on the use of wood-based materials in automotive applications have been carried out, although these are needed to reduce unintended, negative sustainability effects and to support sustainable oriented research and innovation. Therefore, this study was conducted to assess the potential sustainability effects and consequences of introducing a wood-based component into an automotive application. METHODS: A combination of methods was used to analyze the potential sustainability effects when introducing wood into automotive applications. This prospective life cycle sustainability analysis solely relied on secondary data. The environmental impacts were analyzed using a simplified environmental life cycle assessment on the product level. A multi-regional input-output-based assessment was conducted to model the country-specific environmental and socioeconomic consequences. The potential shift in social risks and opportunities on a national scale was analyzed by conducting a generic social life cycle assessment. Various aspects of each approach differ, with each providing a specific perspective of the system under study. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The results indicate that implementing wood into automotive application can have environmental, social, and economic benefits, according to most of the indicators analyzed. Mostly due to the product weight reduction due to the use of a wood-based component, the results show that environmental impacts decrease. Some possible consequences of using wood-based materials are increased value added and increasing the number of jobs in European countries. Similarly, the social risks and opportunities are shifted from countries all over the world to European countries, which perform better than developing countries according to several indicators. However, some indicators, such as migrant acceptance or local supplier quantity, perform better in the current situation. CONCLUSIONS: The presented case study is particularly notable, because the results clearly indicate the advantages of using wood-based materials in automotive applications, although the application of such relatively holistic and complex approaches often may lead to rather indifferent pictures. Policy makers, researchers, and companies can apply this combination of methods that rely solely on generic data to obtain both feasible and informative results. These methods also allow users to link the product level assessment with a regional and social perspective and screen critical topics to support sustainability research and innovation.  aPublisher supplied data  a861421cÖsterreichische Forschungsförderungsgesellschaft 3acase studies 3aissues and policy 3alife cycle assessment 3asteel 3aweight loss 3awood1 aZimek, Martina1 aAsada, Raphael1 aBauernfeind, Daniel1 aBaumgartner, Rupert J.1 aStern, Tobias0 tinternational journal of life cycle assessment.g2020 Oct., v. 25, no. 10 p.2027-2049dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000000330x0948-33497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11367-020-01803-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02561naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245020400166300001200370520118300382592002801565650003501593650002101628650001101649650002001660650003301680650001201713650001501725650002801740650000701768650001301775653006901788653001801857653005201875653002601927700001701953700001401970773007301984856008502057852000902142655001202151IND60581479520221116170407.0171005e20160301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058147952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2015.11.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Pei10aOne-step displacement dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction coupled with graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry for the selective determination of methylmercury in environmental samples  ap. 1-5.  aA novel method for the selective determination of methylmercury (MeHg) was developed by one-step displacement dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction (D-DLLME) coupled with graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. In the proposed method, Cu(II) reacted with diethyldithiocarbamate (DDTC) to form Cu-DDTC complex, which was used as the chelating agent instead of DDTC for the dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction (DLLME) of MeHg. Because the stability of MeHg-DDTC is higher than that of Cu-DDTC, MeHg can displace Cu from the Cu-DDTC complex and be preconcentrated in a single DLLME procedure. MeHg could be extracted into the extraction solvent phase at pH 6 while Hg(II) remained in the sample solution. Potential interference from co-existing metal ions with lower DDTC complex stability was largely eliminated without the need of any masking reagent. Under the optimal conditions, the limit of detection of this method was 13.6ngL−1 (as Hg), and an enhancement factor of 81 was achieved with a sample volume of 5.0mL. The proposed method was successfully applied for the determination of trace MeHg in some environmental samples with satisfactory results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3achelating agents 3acopper 3adetection limit 3aliquid-phase microextraction 3amercury 3ametal ions 3amethylmercury compounds 3apH 3asolvents 0aOne-step displacement dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction 0aMethylmercury 0aGraphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry 0aEnvironmental samples1 aKang, Caiyan1 aMo, Yajun0 tTalanta.g2016 Mar. 01, v. 149 p.1-5dElsevier B.V.x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2015.11.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02993naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011400164520165000278592002801928650002701956650003401983650001302017650002902030650001602059650001502075650001802090650001502108650001302123650001602136653001602152653001702168653001402185653001602199653001502215700001802230700006502248700001702313700002002330773011802350856008202468852000902550655001202559IND60750990720221121062432.0220103e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075099072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eti.2021.1019422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMawad, Asmaa10aSynergistic degradation of phenanthrene by constructed Pseudomonas spp. consortium compared with pure strains  aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are highly persistent compounds as well as they have a toxic impact to all living organisms. Removal of these xenobiotic compounds by mixed bacteria is achieving a maximum degradation rate over the pure strains. So, this study substantiates the application of constructed bacterial consortium for degradation of 400 mg/L phenanthrene within 30 days of incubation at 30 °C. The consortium consisted of two bacterial species Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes (B1) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (B2). It exhibited a significantly higher phenanthrene degradation efficiency (97.5%) compared to pure strains B1 and B2 (52.5 and 47.6%), respectively. The phenanthrene degradation rate by the individual strains was enhanced in the presence of salicylic and phthalic acids as intermediates pathway. On the other side, the degradation rate was reduced in the presence of catechol suggesting a feedback inhibition of catabolic enzymes. The ring-cleavage dioxygenases were induced in all treatments. However, the induction of ortho cleavage dioxygenase (2.44 U/mg protein) was higher than meta cleavage dioxygenase (0.42 U/mg protein). Six main metabolites were detected by GC–MS analysis. Among them, four metabolites were detected in the extract of phenanthrene growing consortium suggesting three main pathways, phthalate, salicylic and benzocoumarin by the constructed consortium. Therefore, this study provides a measuring of phenanthrene degradation efficacy by bacterial consortium and paved the way to increase the potential of using the consortium for successful removal of PAHs from the polluted environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aPseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes 3acatechol 3aenvironmental technology 3ametabolites 3aoxygenases 3aphenanthrenes 3aphthalates 3atoxicity 3axenobiotics 0aDioxygenase 0aPhenanthrene 0aPhthalate 0aPseudomonas 0aSalicylate1 aAlbasri, Hiba1 aShalkami, Abdel-Gawad1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2568-41331 aAlamri, Saad1 aHashem, Mohamed0 tEnvironmental technology & innovation.g2021 Nov., v. 24 p.101942-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23259x2352-18647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eti.2021.1019423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03909naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005200148245008500200300001800285520253000303592002802833596010602861650001802967650001002985650001602995650002503011650000903036650000903045650002003054650002603074650001203100650001303112650001703125650001003142651001103152700001503163700001703178700001703195700001603212773015503228856008303383852000903466655001203475IND60711260220221122220237.0210820e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071126022DNAL7 a10.1007/s11367-020-01811-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZira, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7333-361010aSocial life cycle assessment of Swedish organic and conventional pork production  ap. 1957-1975.  aPURPOSE: Sustainable animal food systems are increasingly important to society. Yet for pork, the most consumed meat product in Europe, there is no social life cycle assessment (S-LCA) in the literature. The breath and complexity of social issues and lack of data makes the task challenging. This study examines the risk of negative social impacts in Swedish pork production systems and includes workers, farmers, consumers, local community, society, and pigs as stakeholders. METHODS: The objective was to assess the risk of negative social impacts for the production and consumption of 1000-kg pork (fork weight—bone free meat including cooking losses) originating from two different systems: organic and conventional pork production. Relevant social sustainability issues for pork production systems were identified through a literature search and a consultative workshop with experts. A life cycle inventory was conducted to collect data for activity variables and compute Social Risk (SR), a measure of the risk of negative social impacts related to a reference (here the average European social conditions). Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) was used to obtain weights for subcategories. The SR scores and the weights were used to calculate Social Risk Time (SRT) that relates the Social Risk to the functional unit by considering the ‘exposure’ to the risk, and the Social Hotspot Index (SHI), which relates the SRT to the worst possible situation for that system. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The conventional pork system had 42% of inventory indicators with SR > 0.5 and the organic pork system had 32%. For all stakeholders, the pig farm had the largest SRT in both production systems except for workers in the organic pork system where the soybean farm had the largest SRT. In the conventional pork system, society as well as farmers at the pig farm had SHI > 0.5 slightly, meaning performing the same as European average. In the organic pork system, SHI < 0.5 for all stakeholders and subsystems. CONCLUSION: Swedish pork production has lower risk of negative social impacts than the average European social conditions for most of the stakeholders: workers, pigs, local community, and consumers. Farmers and society at the subsystem pig farm have the same risk of negative social impacts as the average European social conditions. Due to the dependence of the results of the chosen reference level, the reliance on certification, and the indicators included, results should be interpreted and used with care.  aPublisher supplied data  a696231cSusPig a european project within ERA-Net on Sustainable Animal Production European Commission 3acertification 3afarms 3ainventories 3alife cycle inventory 3apork 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3asocial sustainability 3asociety 3asoybeans 3astakeholders 3aswine 3aEurope1 aRöös, E.1 aIvarsson, E.1 aHoffmann, R.1 aRydhmer, L.0 tinternational journal of life cycle assessment.g2020 Oct., v. 25, no. 10 p.1957-1975dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000000330x0948-33497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11367-020-01811-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03054naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245014800165300001400313520134100327592002801668650003101696650001301727650001801740650001301758650001901771650001501790650001401805650002401819650000901843650002301852650002201875650003301897650001401930650001301944650001601957653001801973653003101991653001002022653001702032653003302049653001602082653000802098653000702106653000802113653000802121653000802129700002202137700002202159700002602181700002502207700001602232773012602248856008102374852000902455655001202464IND4469516120221121023855.0190318e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446951612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2012.07.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAouadhi, Chedia10aInactivation of Bacillus sporothermodurans LTIS27 spores by high hydrostatic pressure and moderate heat studied by response surface methodology  ap. 50-56.  aBacillus sporothermodurans is a milk spoilage bacterium producing resistant endospores that survive ultra-high temperature treatment. The inactivation of B. sporothermodurans LTIS27 spores by combined hydrostatic pressure and heat treatments was studied. A central composite experimental design was used to evaluate the effect of pressure (300–500 MPa), temperature (30–50 °C), and pressure-holding time (10–30 min) on the inactivation of spores in distilled water and skim milk. The inactivation observed was shown to fit well with the values predicted by the quadratic equation, since Radj2 were 0.970 and 0.977 in distilled water and milk, respectively. By analyzing the response surface plots, the inactivation was shown to be higher in distilled water than in milk under all the conditions tested. This was probably due to a protective effect of milk against inactivation by pressure. The optimum process parameter values for a 5-log cycle reduction of spores were calculated as 477 MPa/48 °C for 26 min and 495 MPa/49 °C for 30 min in water and in milk, respectively. This study shows the efficiency of hydrostatic pressure in combination with moderate temperature to inactivate B. sporothermodurans spores. Such treatments could be applied by the dairy industry to ensure the commercial sterility of UHT milk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus sporothermodurans 3aUHT milk 3aUHT treatment 3abacteria 3adairy industry 3aendospores 3aequations 3aexperimental design 3aheat 3apressure treatment 3aprotective effect 3aresponse surface methodology 3askim milk 3aspoilage 3atemperature 0aHigh pressure 0aBacillus sporothermodurans 0aSpore 0aInactivation 0aResponse surface methodology 0aTemperature 0aDPA 0aHP 0aHRS 0aRSM 0aUHT1 aSimonin, Hélène1 aPrévost, Hervé,1 ade Lamballerie, Marie1 aMaaroufi, Abderrazak1 aMejri, Slah0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2013 Jan., v. 50, no. 1 p.50-56dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2012.07.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03278naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100001800167245014000185300001400325520127500339592002801614650002801642650003101670650002701701650001601728650002001744650001801764650001001782650001201792650001401804650001401818650002801832650002501860650002101885650001301906650001301919650002401932650004601956650002202002650004002024650004102064650004002105650002602145650005102171650002802222650001302250650002702263650003402290650005402324700002102378700002102399700002102420700001802441700002202459773008002481856008202561852000902643655001202652IND60098907320221116151551.0141105e20110515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009890732DNAL7 a212363222pmid7 a10.1016/j.gene.2011.01.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYokoi, Ken-ji10aCharacterization of the histidine decarboxylase gene of Staphylococcus epidermidis TYH1 coded on the staphylococcal cassette chromosome  ap. 32-41.  aHistamine production from histidine in fermented food results in food spoilage, and is harmful to consumers. From fish-miso, we have isolated a new bacterial strain Staphylococcus epidermidis TYH1, which produced histamine under acidic condition in the medium supplemented with glucose. Using oligonucleotides deduced from the histidine decarboxylase gene (hdcA) of Lactobacillus hilgardii, about 14-kbp DNA region of the TYH1 genome was cloned and sequenced. This region contained two putative genes hdcATYH₁ and hdcPTYH₁ encoding proteins HdcATYH₁ (310 amino acid residues) and HdcPTYH₁ (495 residues), respectively. Nucleotide sequence around this hdc cluster showed similarity to SCCpbp4 region of S. epidermidis ATCC 12228. Downstream of the cluster, ccrA, ccrB (Type II, respectively) and pbp4 were located. The CcrA and CcrB proteins catalyzed excision of the hdc cluster from the TYH1 chromosome, upon introduction into the TYH1 strain via multicopy plasmid. When hdcATYH₁ was expressed in Staphylococcus warneri M, histamine was extracellularly accumulated in dependence on exogenous histidine. These results indicate that the gene encoding a histidine decarboxylase resides in a movable genetic element, SCC. This new element is designated as SCChdc.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus hilgardii 3aStaphylococcus epidermidis 3aStaphylococcus warneri 3achromosomes 3afermented foods 3afood spoilage 3agenes 3aglucose 3ahistamine 3ahistidine 3ahistidine decarboxylase 3anucleotide sequences 3aoligonucleotides 3aplasmids 3aproteins 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBlotting, Western 2aDNA Transposable Elementsxgenetics 2aDNA, Bacterialxchemistryxgenetics. 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aHistaminexmetabolism 2aHistidine Decarboxylasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aStaphylococcus epidermidisxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aHarada, Yasuyuki1 aShozen, Kei-Ichi1 aSatomi, Masataka1 aTaketo, Akira1 aKodaira, Ken-Ichi0 tGene.g2011 May 15, v. 477, no. 1-2 p.32-41dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2011.01.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03284naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100002100167245010600188300001400294520171700308592002802025650002002053650001702073650001702090650002202107650001402129650001002143650001802153650002502171650001302196650001402209650000902223650002202232650001302254650002302267650003302290650003302323650002502356650002202381650002802403650003702431650001402468650002402482651000902506700001902515700001902534700001802553773008002571856008202651852000902733655001202742IND60098907520221116151540.0141105e20110515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009890752DNAL7 a212773622pmid7 a10.1016/j.gene.2011.01.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Ching-chia10aGene tree discordance of wild and cultivated Asian rice deciphered by genome-wide sequence comparison  ap. 53-60.  aAlthough a large number of genes are expected to correctly solve a phylogenetic relationship, inconsistent gene tree topologies have been observed. This conflicting evidence in gene tree topologies, known as gene tree discordance, becomes increasingly important as advanced sequencing technologies produce an enormous amount of sequence information for phylogenomic studies among closely related species. Here, we aim to characterize the gene tree discordance of the Asian cultivated rice Oryza sativa and its progenitor, O. rufipogon, which will be an ideal case study of gene tree discordance. Using genome and cDNA sequences of O. sativa and O. rufipogon, we have conducted the first in-depth analyses of gene tree discordance in Asian rice. Our comparison of full-length cDNA sequences of O. rufipogon with the genome sequences of the japonica and indica cultivars of O. sativa revealed that 60% of the gene trees showed a topology consistent with the expected one, whereas the remaining genes supported significantly different topologies. Moreover, the proportions of the topologies deviated significantly from expectation, suggesting at least one hybridization event between the two subgroups of O. sativa, japonica and indica. In fact, a genome-wide alignment between japonica and indica indicated that significant portions of the indica genome are derived from japonica. In addition, literature concerning the pedigree of the indica cultivar strongly supported the hybridization hypothesis. Our molecular evolutionary analyses deciphered complicated evolutionary processes in closely related species. They also demonstrated the importance of gene tree discordance in the era of high-speed DNA sequencing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza rufipogon 3aOryza sativa 3acase studies 3acomplementary DNA 3acultivars 3agenes 3ahybridization 3anucleotide sequences 3apedigree 3aphylogeny 3arice 3asequence analysis 3atopology 2aChromosome Mapping 2aChromosomes, Plantxgenetics 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aDNA, Plantxgenetics 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenome, Plantxgenetics 2aOryzaxclassificationxgenetics. 2aPhylogeny 2aSpecies Specificity 0aAsia1 aSakai, Hiroaki1 aNuma, Hisataka1 aItoh, Takeshi0 tGene.g2011 May 15, v. 477, no. 1-2 p.53-60dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2011.01.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03721naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024002600132040001800158100002200176245010100198300001200299500001500311506017300326520163700499650001702136650001902153650003102172650001202203650002602215650001202241650001202253650002702265650001302292650002602305650002802331650001402359650002302373650000902396650002602405650003502431650002502466650002202491650002102513650001502534650002802549650001302577651001802590651002102608653003602629700002102665700002302686700002202709773009902731856011202830856003902942956009602981961000903077852000903086655001203095IND50071712220221214225547.0131216s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007171222DNAL7 a2947212aris7 a10113/581472hdl7 a10.1603/IPM130122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCullen, Eileen M.10aResistance to Bt corn by western corn rootworm (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) in the U.S. corn belt  ap. 1-6.  a2019-12-06  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aTransgenic Bt corn hybrids that produce insecticidal proteins from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner have become the standard insect management tactic across the United States Corn Belt. Widespread planting of Bt corn creates intense selection pressure for target insects to develop resistance, and evolution of resistance is the greatest threat to benefits associated with Bt corn such as reduced reliance on conventional insecticides. Recognizing the threat of resistance, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency requires seed companies to include an insect resistance management (IRM) plan when applying to register a Bt trait. The goal of IRM plans is to delay Bt resistance in populations of target insects. One element of IRM is the presence of a non-Bt refuge to maintain Bt-susceptible individuals within a population, and growers are required to implement IRM on-farm by planting a refuge. Field-evolved resistance has not been detected for the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner), even though this species has been exposed to Bt proteins common in US corn hybrids since 1997. The IRM situation is unfolding differently for Bt corn rootworm protected corn and the western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte. In this paper, we examine the scientific evidence for D. v. virgifera adaptation to Bt rootworm traits and cropping system practices that have contributed to the first reports of field-evolved resistance to a Bt toxin by D. v. virgifera. We explain why this issue has developed, and emphasize the necessity of an integrated pest management approach to address the issue. 3ainsecticides 3agenetic traits 3aintegrated pest management 3ainsects 3ainsecticidal proteins 3agrowers 3ahybrids 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aplanting 3abiological resistance 3apesticide use reduction 3agermplasm 3aOstrinia nubilalis 3acorn 3aresistance management 3aDiabrotica virgifera virgifera 3abusiness enterprises 3atransgenic plants 3acropping systems 3apopulation 3aevolutionary adaptation 3abacteria 3aUnited States 3aCorn Belt region 0aEnvironmental Protection Agency1 aGray, Michael E.1 aGassmann, Aaron J.1 aHibbard, Bruce E.0 tJournal of integrated pest management.g2013, v. 4, no. 3 p.1-6wJournal:2278x2155-74707nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/581473Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/IPM13012  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Hibbard%20594721.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02438naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245010300167520124400270592002801514650000901542650001501551650001801566650002001584650003001604650002401634650001701658650001801675650001701693650002701710650002001737650002201757700002301779700001801802700002701820773011901847856007701966852000902043655001202052IND60707855720221122065202.0200821e20200812xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070785572DNAL7 a10.3390/genes110809232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRekawiecki, Robert 10aProgesterone Receptor Coregulators as Factors Supporting the Function of the Corpus Luteum in Cows  aProgesterone receptor (PGR) for its action required connection of the coregulatory proteins, including coactivators and corepressors. The former group exhibits a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity, while the latter cooperates with histone deacetylase (HDAC). Regulations of the coregulators mRNA and protein and HAT and HDAC activity can have an indirect effect on the PGR function and thus progesterone (P4) action on target cells. The highest mRNA expression levels for the coactivators—histone acetyltransferase p300 (P300), cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), and steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1)—and nuclear receptor corepressor-2 (NCOR-2) were found in the corpus luteum (CL) on days 6 to 16 of the estrous cycle. The CREB protein level was higher on days 2–10, whereas SRC-1 and NCOR-2 were higher on days 2–5. The activity of HAT and HDAC was higher on days 6–10 of the estrous cycle. All of the coregulators were localized in the nuclei of small and large luteal cells. The mRNA and protein expression levels of the examined coactivators and corepressor changed with the P4 level. Thus, P4 may regulate CL function via the expression of coregulators, which probably affects the activity of the PGR.  aPublisher supplied data 3acows 3acyclic AMP 3aestrous cycle 3agene expression 3ahistone acetyltransferase 3ahistone deacetylase 3aluteal cells 3amessenger RNA 3aprogesterone 3aprogesterone receptors 3aprotein content 3aprotein synthesis1 aDobrzyn, Karolina 1 aKotwica, Jan 1 aKowalik, Magdalena  K.0 tGenes.g2020 Aug. 12, v. 11, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes110809233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03600naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245012800165300001400293520213400307592002802441650001102469650001102480650001702491650001202508650002002520650001602540650001102556650001502567650001502582650001302597650001702610650001202627650001402639650001402653650001302667651001102680653003902691653001702730653002902747653001502776653001202791700001702803700001802820700001302838700002102851773011702872856008402989852000903073655001203082IND60544917420221116190956.0160901e20131001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054491742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2013.07.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTohver, E.10aShaking a methane fizz: Seismicity from the Araguainha impact event and the Permian–Triassic global carbon isotope record  ap. 66-75.  aThe Late Permian and Early Triassic periods are marked by large fluctuations in the carbon isotope record, but the source(s) of the disturbance to the global carbon cycle and the link to the end-Permian mass extinction are widely debated. This contribution explores the possible isotopic effects of an impact event into the hydrocarbon-rich rocks of the Paraná–Karoo Basin. Recent U–Pb and 40Ar/39Ar dating of the 40km Araguainha impact structure of central Brazil reveals an age of 254.7±2.5Ma (2σ error) for this event. The calculated energy (105–106MT of TNT equivalent) released by this impact is less than threshold values of 107–108MT TNT equivalent for global mass extinctions. Thus, the Araguainha crater is unlikely to have been the cause of the end-Permian biotic crisis. However, the combined seismic effects from the impact itself and the post-impact collapse of the 20–25km diameter transient crater to its present 40km diameter would result in large magnitude earthquakes (Mw 9.3–10.5) and tsunamis in the shallow marine Paraná–Karoo Basin. Slope failure and sediment liquefaction are predicted to have occurred within a 700–3000km radius of the crater, causing large-scale release of methane from organic-rich sediments of this basin, including the oil shale horizons of the Iratí Formation. New geological evidence for seismicity in the Paraná Basin at the time of impact is presented, together with a compilation of existing carbon isotope data from the Paraná Basin, which demonstrate a widespread pattern of disturbance consistent with the release of methane. These two datasets suggest that both seismicity and methane release took place within ca.1000km of the impact site, with mass balance calculations suggesting ca. 1600GT of methane were released into the atmosphere at this time. Methane release at this scale would have significant climate effects and would contribute to a sharp (<1ka) negative shift in δ13C values at the time of the impact, which should be distinguishable from the more gradual shift over 0.5–1Ma caused by contemporaneous intrusion of the Siberian traps.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3acarbon 3acarbon cycle 3aclimate 3adata collection 3aearthquakes 3aenergy 3aextinction 3ageophysics 3aisotopes 3aliquefaction 3amethane 3aoil shale 3asediments 3atsunamis 3aBrazil 0aPermian–Triassic mass extinction 0aImpact event 0aCarbon isotope excursion 0aSeismicity 0aMethane1 aCawood, P.A.1 aRiccomini, C.1 aLana, C.1 aTrindade, R.I.F.0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2013 Oct. 01, v. 387 p.66-75dElsevier B.V.x0031-01827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2013.07.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02666naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006500147245021100212520115100423592002801574650001501602650001101617650002201628650001601650650001401666650001501680650002901695650002401724650001901748650001301767650000701780650003301787650002301820650001601843650001901859653001501878653001501893653001901908700006201927700002201989773011802011856008202129852000902211655001202220IND60750991220221121062524.0220103e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075099122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eti.2021.1019472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakabi, Ahmad Shirani1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9376-793710aApple stem as a high performance cellulose based biosorbent for low cost and eco-friendly adsorption of crystal violet from aqueous solutions using experimental design: Mechanism, kinetic and thermodynamics  aIn this work, apple stem as a novel cellulose based biosorbent, was used for adsorption of crystal violet from aqueous solution. The biosorbent was characterized by SEM and FT-IR. The effect of dominant parameters including pH, time, temperature, amount of biosorbent, and initial dye concentration on the adsorption of crystal violet were studied. Experimental design was used to describe the adsorption (%) as a function of the parameters via response surface methodology. At experimental optimum conditions consisting pH of 10, time of 20 min, temperature of 35 °C, amount of biosorbent of 20 mg, and initial dye concentration of 100 mg L⁻¹, the dye removal (%) of 96.0 ± 0.5 was acquired. The results of adsorption isotherm studies affirm the fitness and accordance of experimental data in Langmuir model with maximum adsorption capacity of 153.85 mg g⁻¹. The kinetic and thermodynamic parameters were assessed and the positive ΔH∘ and ΔS∘ values revealed the endothermic nature of the adsorption process. Moreover, the kinetic of crystal violet adsorption onto the apple stem conformed the pseudo-second order kinetic model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aapples 3aaqueous solutions 3abiosorbents 3acellulose 3aendothermy 3aenvironmental technology 3aexperimental design 3agentian violet 3akinetics 3apH 3aresponse surface methodology 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 0aApple stem 0aBiosorbent 0aCrystal violet1 aShirani, Mahboubeh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9844-46081 aSemnani, Abolfazl0 tEnvironmental technology & innovation.g2021 Nov., v. 24 p.101947-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23259x2352-18647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eti.2021.1019473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02486naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245012500206300001800331520134300349592002801692650002501720650003001745650001201775650002601787650001301813700002401826700001601850700002601866700002101892773015501913856008302068852000902151655001202160IND60711260820221122193318.0210820e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071126082DNAL7 a10.1007/s11367-020-01806-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLøkke, Søren1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4544-178810aHow green are supported ‘green’ business models? Time for the life cycle approach to enter public support programmes  ap. 2086-2092.  aPURPOSE: ‘Green’ business models¹ have received considerable political and financial support, which for the public is a validation of the sustainability of the business models. The sustainability performance seems, however, often questionable, and the purpose of this paper is to investigate the performance of a specific public support programme for green business models. METHODS: Based on an analytical framework of key elements of life cycle assessment (LCA), 14 business models supported financially by the Danish Fund for Green Business Development were investigated. This included text analysis and interviews with companies receiving funding. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Results document that despite clear ambitions of improving environmental performance, life cycle assessment and other quantitative methods are rarely applied among supported companies to document the environmental benefits of their green business models. Furthermore, the companies rarely consider substitution and alternatives or apply a holistic perspective in terms of impacts. CONCLUSIONS: There is an urgent need to strengthen credibility of public support programme on the performance of green business models. The LCA community has, as expert community, a special role in pointing at the implications and need of documenting environmental performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness development 3aenvironmental performance 3afunding 3alife cycle assessment 3apolitics1 aSchmidt, Jannick H.1 aLyhne, Ivar1 aKørnøv, L.q(Lone),1 aRevsbeck, Rasmus0 tinternational journal of life cycle assessment.g2020 Oct., v. 25, no. 10 p.2086-2092dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000000330x0948-33497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11367-020-01806-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03432naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001500188245010400203300001600307500001900323506007600342520161100418592002802029506003702057650002202094650002602116650000902142650001602151650001502167650002302182650002402205650002902229650001802258650001102276650002402287651001202311651001102323653004502334653001602379653003002395653002202425653002002447700002202467700001802489700002002507700001502527700002002542700001802562700002002580700001602600773013602616856008102752852000902833655001202842IND60650510920221207141640.0190710e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065051092DNAL7 a10.1017/S00218596180000472doi7 aPMC61995462pmcid7 a303696292pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLalić, B.10aSeasonal forecasting of green water components and crop yield of summer crops in Serbia and Austria  ap. 658-672.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA probabilistic crop forecast based on ensembles of crop model output estimates, presented here, offers an ensemble of possible realizations and probabilistic forecasts of green water components, crop yield and green water footprints (WFs) on seasonal scales for selected summer crops. The present paper presents results of an ongoing study related to the application of ensemble forecasting concepts in crop production. Seasonal forecasting of crop water use indicators (evapotranspiration (ET), water productivity, green WF) and yield of rainfed summer crops (maize, spring barley and sunflower), was performed using the AquaCrop model and ensemble weather forecast, provided by The European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecast. The ensemble of estimates obtained was tested with observation-based simulations to assess the ability of seasonal weather forecasts to ensure that accuracy of the simulation results was the same as for those obtained using observed weather data. Best results are obtained for ensemble forecast for yield, ET, water productivity and green WF for sunflower in Novi Sad (Serbia) and maize in Groß-Enzersdorf (Austria) – average root mean square error (2006–2014) was <10% of observation-based values of selected variables. For variables yielding a probability distribution, capacity to reflect the distribution from which their outcomes will be drawn was tested using an Ignorance score. Average Ignorance score, for all locations, crops and variables varied from 1.49 (spring barley ET in Groß-Enzersdorf) to 3.35 (sunflower water productivity in Groß-Enzersdorf).  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHelianthus annuus 3aagricultural sciences 3acorn 3acrop models 3acrop yield 3aevapotranspiration 3ameteorological data 3aprobability distribution 3aspring barley 3asummer 3aweather forecasting 3aAustria 3aSerbia 0aEnsembles of crop model output estimates 0agreen water 0aseasonal weather forecast 0astaple food crops 0awater footprint1 aFiranj Sremac, A.1 aEitzinger, J.1 aStričević, R.1 aThaler, S.1 aMaksimović, I.1 aDaničić, M.1 aPeris̆ić, D.,1 aDekić, Lj.0 tJournal of agricultural science.g2018 July, v. 156, no. 5 p.658-672dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl46135x1469-51467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00218596180000473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03198naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100006000191245006600251300001600317506007600333520160600409592002802015506003702043650002402080650002902104650002002133650002002153650001902173650001502192650001202207650001402219650000902233650001402242650001402256650002702270650001502297650002502312653001202337653000902349653002402358653002002382653002702402700001602429700001802445700002302463773008902486856008402575852000902659655001202668IND60565133420221207113509.0170320e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056513342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2016.01.0882doi7 aPMC55094632pmcid7 a269077022pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeador, James P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6861-804810aContaminants of emerging concern in a large temperate estuary  ap. 254-267.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis study was designed to assess the occurrence and concentrations of a broad range of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) from three local estuaries within a large estuarine ecosystem. In addition to effluent from two wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), we sampled water and whole-body juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and Pacific staghorn sculpin (Leptocottus armatus) in estuaries receiving effluent. We analyzed these matrices for 150 compounds, which included pharmaceuticals, personal care products (PPCPs), and several industrial compounds. Collectively, we detected 81 analytes in effluent, 25 analytes in estuary water, and 42 analytes in fish tissue. A number of compounds, including sertraline, triclosan, estrone, fluoxetine, metformin, and nonylphenol were detected in water and tissue at concentrations that may cause adverse effects in fish. Interestingly, 29 CEC analytes were detected in effluent and fish tissue, but not in estuarine waters, indicating a high potential for bioaccumulation for these compounds. Although concentrations of most detected analytes were present at relatively low concentrations, our analysis revealed that overall CEC inputs to each estuary amount to several kilograms of these compounds per day. This study is unique because we report on CEC concentrations in estuarine waters and whole-body fish, which are both uncommon in the literature. A noteworthy finding was the preferential bioaccumulation of CECs in free-ranging juvenile Chinook salmon relative to staghorn sculpin, a benthic species with relatively high site fidelity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLeptocottus armatus 3aOncorhynchus tshawytscha 3aadverse effects 3abioaccumulation 3abrackish water 3aecosystems 3aestrone 3aestuaries 3afish 3ajuveniles 3ametformin 3apersonal care products 3aphilopatry 3awastewater treatment 0aEstuary 0aFish 0aWastewater effluent 0aPharmaceuticals 0aPersonal care products1 aYeh, Andrew1 aYoung, Graham1 aGallagher, Evan P.0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2016 June, v. 213 p.254-267dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2016.01.0883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02583naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245009800168520118600266592002801452650002401480650002001504650001401524650001501538650001601553650001901569650001801588650001501606653001701621653001901638653001901657653002001676653002101696700001401717700005701731700005801788700002001846700002101866700006301887773010301950856008702053852000902140655001202149IND60741872320221118053515.0220307e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074187232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2021.1119262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarian, Max10aExploring the lubrication mechanisms of synovial fluids for joint longevity – A perspective  aSynovial fluids are complex fluids responsible for the exceptional lubrication present in synovial joints. These fluids consist of various constituents, including hyaluronic acid, surface-active proteins (i.e., lubricin), surface-active phospholipids, as well as various other proteins such as human serum albumin and γ -globulin seric proteins, each of them playing an essential role in lubrication. Being the key to the most efficient biotribological systems, this article is intended to review the current understanding of the underlying lubrication mechanisms of the synovial fluids enables prospective usage in numerous applications, especially as a lubricant for hip and knee prosthetics in combatting osteoarthritis. Current research focuses on the determination of the role of proteins in prosthetic lubrication, optimal material combinations for prosthesis, and the effects of relevant physical variables in prosthetic lubrication. The characterization of prosthetic lubrication and wear mechanisms by synovial fluids represents a prominent challenge in tribological research, yet also an important hurdle to overcome towards optimal lubrication of articular prosthetics.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahuman serum albumin 3ahyaluronic acid 3alongevity 3alubricants 3alubrication 3aosteoarthritis 3aphospholipids 3aprostheses 0aBiotribology 0aSynovial fluid 0aSynovial joint 0aHip replacement 0aKnee replacement1 aShah, Raj1 aGashi, Blerim1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0563-80731 aZhang, Stanley1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2388-84201 aBhavnani, Kiran1 aWartzack, Sandro1 aRosenkranz, Andreas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9006-11270 tColloids and surfaces.g2021 Oct., v. 206 p.111926-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2021.1119263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02872naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001200152245013900164520135100303592002801654650001301682650001501695650002701710650002101737650001901758650001601777650002501793650001801818650001601836650001401852650001501866650001601881650001501897650002201912650001901934650001301953650001601966653003001982653002202012653002302034700001802057700001802075700001202093700001702105700001602122700001702138773010302155856008702258852000902345655001202354IND60741872420221118053520.0220307e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074187242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2021.1119282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Ran10aZwitterionic PMCP-functionalized titanium surface resists protein adsorption, promotes cell adhesion, and enhances osteogenic activity  aTitanium (Ti) has excellent biocompatibility and corrosion resistance and is widely used as a biomedical material for orthopedic implants. However, the bare Ti surface limits cell adhesion without biological activity and promotes unnecessary protein adsorption, which can activate the coagulation pathway with blood-contacting devices. To improve the antifouling and biological activity of Ti, zwitterionic poly[2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl choline phosphate] (PMCP) was used to modify the Ti surface via surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization. The Ti-PMCP surface reduced bovine serum albumin and fibrinogen adsorption owing to the zwitterionic antifouling property. Ti-PMCP is involved in the unique interaction between PMCP on the Ti surface and phosphate choline on cell membranes, and therefore, the Ti-PMCP surface can promote the adhesion and proliferation of MC3T3-e1 cells and bone marrow mesenchymal cells (BMSCs). In addition, the Ti-PMCP surface was effective in promoting the osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-e1 cells and BMSCs because the phosphate group in MCP can stimulate osteogenic signaling pathways. Therefore, the PMCP-modified Ti surface can resist protein adsorption and promote the adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation of osteoblast-related cells and has great potential in bone tissue engineering.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aadsorption 3aantifouling activities 3abiocompatibility 3abone formation 3abone marrow 3abovine serum albumin 3acell adhesion 3acoagulation 3acorrosion 3afibrinogen 3aorthopedics 3aphosphates 3aphosphorylcholine 3apolymerization 3atitanium 3azwitterions 0aSurface functionalization 0aCholine phosphate 0aProtein adsorption1 aCui, Xuezhong1 aXin, Qiangwei1 aLu, Min1 aLi, Zhiqiang1 aLi, Jianshu1 aChen, Xingyu0 tColloids and surfaces.g2021 Oct., v. 206 p.111928-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2021.1119283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02208naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245007800167300001800245520107400263592002801337650001601365650002401381650002201405650001401427650002501441650003201466650001301498700001601511700001401527700001901541700002001560700001601580773015501596856008601751852000901837655001201846IND60549826120221120172927.0160909e20150724xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054982612DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jnatprod.5b003252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Qi-Ming10aAntiviral Matrine-Type Alkaloids from the Rhizomes of Sophora tonkinensis  ap. 1683-1688.  aThree new matrine-type alkaloids, (+)-5α-hydroxyoxysophocarpine (1), (−)-12β-hydroxyoxysophocarpine (2), and (+)-5α-hydroxylemannine (3), along with 14 known analogues, (−)-sophocarpine (4), (−)-5α-hydroxysophocarpine (5), (−)-9α-hydroxysophocarpine (6), (+)-12α-hydroxysophocarpine (7), (−)-12β-hydroxysophocarpine (8), (+)-oxysophocarpine (9), (+)-matrine (10), (+)-sophoranol (11), (+)-9α-hydroxymatrine (12), (−)-14β-hydroxymatrine (13), (+)-oxymatrine (14), (+)-5α-hydroxyoxymatrine (15), (−)-14β-hydroxyoxymatrine (16), and (+)-sophoramine (17), were isolated from the rhizomes of Sophora tonkinensis.

The power generated from wind energy is clean, zero emission and volatility. The generation of Wind energy is stochastic due to the variation of velocity of wind. The Unification of WECS with the utility grid is a major formidable area of research. The integration of grid with WECS is done by means of Rotor side converter and Grid side inverter. These two converters are linked by using a DC link capacitor in a conventional system. In this paper, a novel topology had been proposed. The conventional system DC link element is replaced by Reboost converter. A Reboost converter is a DC–DC converter which bestows boosting or increased output voltage. It comprises a power MOSFET switch, hence the switching stress is minimized and efficiency of the proposed converter is predominant. The Reboost converter dispenses a continuous input current that lessen the voltage stress. The output ripple voltage and total harmonic distortion factor are minimized. A comparative analysis on different types of wind generators are performed by implementing the Reboost converter. The input voltage total harmonic distortion, output voltage, output power and output voltage total harmonic distortion factor are determined. The MATLAB Simulation on different types of wind generators are analyzed and the results prove that Doubly fed induction generators are expedient.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitors 3aelectric potential difference 3aenvironmental technology 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3atopology 3awind 3awind power 3azero emissions 0aReboost converter 0aBridge configuration 0aBridgeless configuration 0aDC link capacitor 0aWind Energy Conversion System (WECS) 0aTotal Harmonic Distortion (THD) 0aPMSG 0aSCIG 0aDFIG1 aImmanuel, D.

The methodological framework is illustrated by a concrete study of a phosphate inoculant introduced in US corn production. METHODS: The framework considers a shift from an initial agricultural practice (reference system) to an alternative practice (alternative system) on an area of cropland A. To ensure system equivalence (same functional output), the alternative system is expanded with displaced or induced crop production elsewhere to level out potential changes in crop output from the area A. Upstream effects are analyzed in terms of changes in agricultural inputs to the area A. The yield effect is quantified by assessing the impacts from changes in crop production elsewhere. The field effect from potential changes in direct emissions from the field is quantified via biogeochemical modeling. Downstream effects are assessed as impacts from potential changes in post-harvest treatment, e.g., changes in drying requirements (if crop moisture changes). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: An inoculant with the soil fungus Penicillium bilaiae has been shown to increase corn yields in Minnesota by 0.44 Mg ha⁻¹ (~ 4%). For global warming, the upstream effect (inoculant production) was 0.4 kg CO₂e per hectare treated. The field effect (estimated via the biogeochemical model DayCent) was − 250 kg CO₂e ha⁻¹ (increased soil carbon and reduced N₂O emissions) and the yield effect (estimated by simple system expansion) was − 140 kg CO₂e ha⁻¹ (corn production displaced elsewhere). There were no downstream effects. The total change per Mg dried corn produced was − 36 kg CO₂e corresponding to a 14% decrease in global warming impacts. Combining more advanced methods indicates that results may vary from − 27 to − 40 kg CO₂e per Mg corn. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS: The present paper illustrates how environmental impacts from changes in agricultural practices can be logically categorized according to where in the life cycle they occur. The paper also illustrates how changes in emissions directly from the field (the field effect) can be assessed by biogeochemical modeling, thereby improving life cycle inventory modeling and addressing concerns in the literature. It is recommended to use the presented approach in any LCA of changes in agricultural practices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPenicillium 3acase studies 3acorn 3acropland 3alife cycle inventory 3amodels 3aphosphates 3apostharvest treatment 3asoil carbon 3asoil fungi 3astakeholders 3aMinnesota1 aScheel, Claus Nordstrøm1 aSchmidt, Jannick1 aGrant, Brian1 aSmith, Ward1 aBentham, Murray J.0 tinternational journal of life cycle assessment.g2020 Oct., v. 25, no. 10 p.1991-2007dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000000330x0948-33497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11367-020-01767-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02067naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001900156245011600175300001600291500001900307500002000326520099800346592002801344650001501372650001501387650001101402650001301413650001701426650001501443650001201458650001101470700001901481773011801500856009001618852000901708655001201717IND60734298820221118023425.0210417e198708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073429882DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.1987.tb00176.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuzuki, Takeo,10aEffects of pruning on the branching habit of morus alba l. and the abscission of the apices of the short shoots  ap. 753-758.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe formation of long shoots and short shoots, growing out from erect one‐year‐old stems sprouted from six‐year‐old pruned stumps of mulberry (Morus alba L. cv. Shin‐ichinose), has been studied. In contrast to the branches of the unpruned trees showing an acrotonic growth habit, where only several terminal buds elongate, the buds of these stems, including the basal buds, burst simultaneously in the spring. A few upper shoots continued to elongate until autumn, forming long shoots, whilst the other shoots (lateral shoots) formed short shoots, the apices of which abscinded until early June. Excision of the long shoots before abscission of the apices of the short shoots took place resulted in continued growth of the short shoots and formation of long shoots in the upper portion of the pruned stem. The results suggest that the dominance of the upper shoots (long shoots) is maintained by a correlative control system acting between the apices of long shoots and short shoots.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMorus alba 3aabscission 3aautumn 3aexcision 3agrowth habit 3amulberries 3apruning 3aspring1 aKOHNO, KIYOSHI0 tnew phytologist.g1987 Aug., v. 106, no. 4 p.753-758dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.1987.tb00176.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01923naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245003000209300001800239520104600257592002801303650001301331650002601344650002401370650001601394773015501410856008301565852000901648655001201657IND60711261220221120110339.0210820e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071126122DNAL7 a10.1007/s11367-020-01810-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeijungs, Reinout1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0724-596210aIs mainstream LCA linear?  ap. 1872-1882.  aPURPOSE: It is frequently mentioned in literature that LCA is linear, without a proof, or even without a clear definition of the criterion for linearity. Here we study the meaning of the term linear, and in relation to that, the question if LCA is indeed linear. METHODS: We explore the different meanings of the term linearity in the context of mathematical models. This leads to a distinction between linear functions, homogeneous functions, homogenous linear functions, bilinear functions, and multilinear functions. Each of them is defined in accessible terms and illustrated with examples. RESULTS: We analyze traditional, matrix-based, LCA, and conclude that LCA is not linear in any of the senses defined. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Despite the negative answer to the research question, there are many respects in which LCA can be regarded to be, at least to some extent, linear. We discuss a few of such cases. We also discuss a few practical implications for practitioners of LCA and for developers of new methods for LCI and LCIA.  aPublisher supplied data 3ajournals 3alife cycle assessment 3amathematical models 3amethodology0 tinternational journal of life cycle assessment.g2020 Oct., v. 25, no. 10 p.1872-1882dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000000330x0948-33497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11367-020-01810-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02002naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245008200167300001400249520105900263592002801322650001101350650001101361650001901372650001401391650001501405700001501420700001901435700001401454700001801468773009701486856008401583852000901667655001201676IND60123172820221121031542.0150325e20140102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012317282DNAL7 a10.1080/2150704X.2013.8728142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Qiu-Yang12aA new mononuclear eddy identification method with simple splitting strategies  ap. 65-72.  aA new mononuclear eddy identification method based on sea level anomaly (SLA) data was developed and described in this study. To solve the multinuclear eddy problem, we employed two strategies to split the eddies into individual eddies: the closest angle and the closest distance strategies. Each strategy produces an eddy with only one SLA extremum. The splitting procedure is based on these strategies. No artificial threshold is needed with these strategies, but a threshold for strategy choice is required. The splitting strategies are adaptable to various identification methods. The examples indicate that the splitting procedure clearly captures the mixing of eddies. When applied to the global ocean, the proposed method obtained similar and more reasonable results. The splitting procedure is linear without any iteration; thus, it is very fast (the time complexity is O (N), where N is the number of multinuclear eddy pixels). In statistics, the proposed method can identify approximately 30–40% more eddies than the multinuclear eddy method.  aPublisher supplied data 3amixing 3aoceans 3aremote sensing 3asea level 3astatistics1 aSun, Liang1 aLiu, Shan-Shan1 aXian, Tao1 aYan, You-Fang0 tRemote sensing letters.g2014 Jan. 2, v. 5, no. 1 p.65-72dTaylor & Francisx2150-70587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2150704X.2013.8728143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03062naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245013200168500001900300520172000319592002802039650001402067650001802081650001502099650002402114650002302138650001402161650001702175650002302192650000902215651001002224653002802234653002302262653002602285653001102311700001202322700001302334700001502347700001802362700001702380700001302397773009802410856008702508852000902595655001202604IND60720561320221121044015.0210219e20210315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072056132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geomorph.2020.1075642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Jianbo14aThe role of a remote tropical cyclone in sediment resuspension over the subaqueous delta front in the Changjiang Estuary, China  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study investigates the sediment resuspension and the resultant morphological changes over the subaqueous delta front in the Changjiang Estuary (CJE). An in-situ observation platform equipped with multi-sensor instruments was deployed in the CJE to measure the currents, waves, and suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) when a typical remote tropical cyclone, Sanba, passed through the waters over 540 km away from the CJE from September 15 to 17 in 2012. In addition, a current-wave-coupled numerical model was employed to simulate the spatial and temporal variations of the waves, currents, and sediment transport. The numerical simulation accurately captures the sharp increases in wave-induced bed shear stress and associated SSC, as indicated in the field measurements during the tropical cyclone period. Remarkable erosional patterns are observed over the subaqueous delta, which highlight the role of the remote tropical cyclone in sediment suspension and short-term morphological changes in the CJE. Moreover, the simulated erosional pattern agrees well with the sediment coarsening area observed between the 2 and 10 m isobaths. Analyses of the wave spectrum suggest that the bed shear stresses induced by the swells prevail over those induced by the wind waves during the tropical cyclone period. In addition, two simulation runs with ideal wind fields were performed to clarify the contribution of the swells propagated from the outer sea to the sediment transport. Overall, this study suggests that the erosion trends of the subaqueous deltas observed in the CJE are largely determined by the waves, and the swells produced by tropical cyclone events can significantly facilitate such a trend.  aPublisher supplied data 3aestuaries 3ageomorphology 3ahurricanes 3amathematical models 3asediment transport 3asediments 3ashear stress 3asuspended sediment 3awind 3aChina 0aRemote tropical cyclone 0aChangjiang Estuary 0aSediment resuspension 0aSwells1 aXu, Fan1 aHe, Qing1 aShen, Jian1 aGuo, Leicheng1 aXie, Weiming1 aZhu, Lei0 tGeomorphology.g2021 Mar. 15, v. 377 p.107564-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12407x0169-555X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2020.1075643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02629naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245008400167520122400251592002801475650002301503650001901526650002101545650002801566650001201594650001001606650001301616650001801629650001401647650002101661650000901682650001401691650001101705650001501716650001201731651001001743653002001753653001501773653001001788700001401798700001901812700001701831700001301848700001601861700001701877700001601894773010701910856008502017852000902102655001202111IND60759659020221117062754.0220207e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075965902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2021.1093022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Zhihui10aPathogenicity and virus shedding ability of fowl adenovirus serotype 4 to ducks  aFowl adenovirus serotype 4 (FAdV-4) is the pathogen causing hepatitis-hydropericardium syndrome (HHS) in broilers. Since June 2015, it has emerged as one of the leading causes of economic losses in the poultry industry in China. Although most studies on FAdV-4 have focused on its pathogenicity to broilers, limited studies have been performed on other natural hosts such as ducks and geese. In this study, we assessed the pathogenicity of FAdV-4 to ducks of different ages through intramuscular injection and found that infected ducks showed severe growth depression. The infected ducks also suffered from extensive organ damage and had histopathological changes in the liver, spleen, and kidney. Although the virus infection caused lymphocyte necrosis of immune organs and the development of the bursa of Fabricius (bursa) was inhibited, the humoral immune response of infected ducks to FAdV-4 remained strong. The infected ducks also had high viral load in tissues and shed virus after the challenge. Overall, our research demonstrates that FAdV-4 can infect ducks and adversely affect the productivity of animals. And the viruses shed by infected ducks can pose a potential risk to the same or other poultry flocks.  aPublisher supplied data 3abursa of Fabricius 3ahistopathology 3ahumoral immunity 3aintramuscular injection 3akidneys 3aliver 3anecrosis 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3apoultry industry 3arisk 3aserotypes 3aspleen 3aviral load 3aviruses 3aChina 0aFowl adenovirus 0aSerotype 4 0aDucks1 aLiu, Meng1 aGao, Zhangshan1 aLi, Mengcong1 aCao, Jie1 aYe, Hongliu1 aSong, Suquan1 aYan, Liping0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2022 Jan., v. 264 p.109302-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2021.1093023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03164naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245009500171300001600266520188200282592002802164650002502192650002502217650001202242650002202254650001502276650002202291650001902313650001202332650002802344651001402372653002802386653002502414653001302439653001402452653002902466700001302495700002602508773011302534856008602647852000902733655001202742IND60566523620221119183457.0180831e20170601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056652362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.03.2102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHwang, Bon-Gang10aGreen business park project management: Barriers and solutions for sustainable development  ap. 209-219.  aGreen Business Parks (GBPs) are getting an increasing interest from both the private and public sectors since GBPs is a way of achieving more sustainable industrial and business development. However, the adoption of GBPs still encounters impediments because there is a lack of proper project management framework for such projects. Therefore, the objectives of this study are to: (1) investigate and assess the barriers hindering the adoption of GBPs; (2) assess the impact of the barriers on project management goals; and (3) propose feasible solutions for overcoming current barriers and thus promoting the adoption of GBPs. To achieve the objectives, 15 barriers and 21 solutions were identified from a comprehensive literature review. Through a questionnaire survey with 40 experts in Singapore and post-survey interviews, the results first revealed that the top three barriers were “perceived higher initial capital costs”, “uncertain trade-off between environmental and financial benefits” and “lack of government support”. Moreover, the client related barriers had the most significant impacts on three project objectives which are cost, schedule and quality. In addition, all barriers had more impact on project cost than project schedule and quality. In addition, “government’s co-funding and incentives for training and technologies”, “policies and regulations for green industrial development” and “collaboration with research institutes and firms to study the benefits of GBPs” were identified as most feasible solutions to overcome the significant barriers. The findings of this study not only bridge the gap between knowledge and practice of the developments of GBPs but also provide useful outcomes about barriers and solutions for practitioners to avoid traps and ultimately achieve the sustainable industrial and business development.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness development 3abusiness enterprises 3aexperts 3aindustrialization 3ainterviews 3aissues and policy 3aquestionnaires 3asurveys 3asustainable development 3aSingapore 0aSustainable development 0aGreen business parks 0aBarriers 0aSolutions 0aProject management goals1 aZhu, Lei1 aTan, Joanne Siow Hwei0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2017 June 01, v. 153 p.209-219dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.03.2103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02556naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001800149245005400167300001600221520143500237592002801672650002701700650002601727650002301753650001801776650001801794650001101812650001201823650001201835650002501847650001401872700002401886700001801910700002401928700002301952773010101975856008502076852000902161655001202170IND4502887920221122031719.0141111e20120430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND450288792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2011.06.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnné, Jozef,10aRecombinant protein production and streptomycetes  ap. 159-167.  aThe biopharmaceutical market has come a long way since 1982, when the first biopharmaceutical product, recombinant human insulin, was launched. Just over 200 biopharma products have already gained approval. The global market for biopharmaceuticals which is currently valued at over US$99 billion has been growing at an impressive compound annual growth rate over the previous years. To produce these biopharmaceuticals and other industrially important heterologous proteins, different prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems are used. All expression systems have some advantages as well as some disadvantages that should be considered in selecting which one to use. Choosing the best one requires evaluating the options – from yield to glycosylation, to proper folding, to economics of scale-up. No host cell from which all the proteins can be universally expressed in large quantities has been found so far. Therefore, it is important to provide a variety of host–vector expression systems in order to increase the opportunities to screen for the most suitable expression conditions or host cell. In this overview, we focus on Streptomyces lividans, a Gram-positive bacterium with a proven excellence in secretion capacity, as host for heterologous protein production. We will discuss its advantages and disadvantages, and how with systems biology approaches strains can be developed to better producing cell factories.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aStreptomyces lividans 3abiopharmaceuticals 3abiotechnology 3aglycosylation 3ahumans 3ainsulin 3amarkets 3arecombinant proteins 3asecretion1 aMaldonado, Bárbara1 aVan Impe, Jan1 aVan Mellaert, Lieve1 aBernaerts, Kristel0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2012 Apr. 30, v. 158, no. 4 p.159-167dElsevier B.V.x0168-16567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2011.06.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02498naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245011500158300001600273520106900289592002801358650002201386650002401408650002701432650001301459650002601472650001001498650000901508650001001517650001701527650001301544651001801557653001501575653002201590653003001612653002601642653002801668700001401696700001701710700002401727700002001751700001801771773015201789856007801941852000902019655001202028IND60522885120221123005631.0160604e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052288512DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-1994-5-6142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGries, G.10aAggregation Pheromone of the African Rhinoceros Beetle, Oryctes monoceros (Olivier) (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae)  ap. 363-366.  aColeoptera, Oryctes monoceros, African Rhinoceros Beetle, Aggregation Pheromone, Ethyl 4-M ethyloctanoate Ethyl 4-m ethyloctanoate is a male-produced aggregation pheromone of the African rhinoc­eros beetle, Oryctes monoceros (Olivier). It was identified by coupled gas chromatographic-electroantennographic detection (GC -EAD) and coupled GC-mass spectrometry (MS) of Porapak Q-trapped male-produced volatiles. Natural and synthetic ethyl 4-m ethyloctanoate elicited comparable antennal responses. In a field experiment (La Me Research Station, Côte d’Ivoire), synthetic ethyl 4-methyloctanoate released at 30 mg/day attracted both male and fem ale Oryctes, whereas the known, non-beetle-produced attractant, ethyl chrysanthemate, did not attract any Oryctes. Upon improvement of trap design and placement, and the identi­fication of synergistic (plant) volatiles, pheromone-based mass trapping may become an alternative and/or additional strategy to manage O. monoceros, one of the most destructive pests of commercial coconut, oil, and date palms in Africa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryctes monoceros 3aPhoenix dactylifera 3aaggregation pheromones 3acoconuts 3afield experimentation 3amales 3aoils 3apests 3aspectroscopy 3atrapping 3aCote d'Ivoire 0aColeoptera 0aOryctes monoceros 0aAfrican Rhinoceros Beetle 0aAggregation Pheromone 0aEthyl 4-Methyloctanoate1 aGries, R.1 aPerez, A.

We synthesized a water-insoluble methacrylate-based copolymer containing oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG) (copolymer 1) and a perfluoroalkylated surfactant (surfactant 1) containing OEG. The dip-coating of copolymer 1 with surfactant 1 resulted in the segregation of surfactant 1 on the top surface of the dip-coated layer due to the high hydrophobicity of its perfluoroalkyl group. OEG moieties of surfactant 1 were accompanied by those of copolymer 1 in its segregation, allowing the OEG moieties of copolymer 1 to be located just below the top surface of the dip-coated layer. The removal of surfactant 1 produced the surface covered by the OEG moieties of the copolymer that exhibited antifouling properties. Using this strategy, we also succeeded in the introduction of carboxy groups on the dip-coated surface and demonstrated that the carboxy groups were available for the immobilization of functional molecules on the surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3aethylene glycol 3ahydrophobicity 3amoieties 3asurfactants1 aKitahata, Shigeru1 aShimomura, Ayane1 aTokuda, Kaya1 aNishino, Takashi1 aMaruyama, Tatsuo0 tLangmuir.g2015 Jan. 13, v. 31, no. 1 p.125-131dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla50437123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03968naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100001800158245011300176300001600289500001900305520254700324592002802871650001302899650002802912650001702940650001002957650001302967650001102980650002102991650000903012650001403021650001503035650001403050650002403064650001603088650001503104650001003119653002303129653002103152653002203173653002103195700002203216700001603238700001703254773010103271856009303372852000903465655001203474IND60700069120221122004840.0201023e20201001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070006912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2020.06.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacmillan, K.10aPerformance and optimization of an ear tag automated activity monitor for estrus prediction in dairy heifers  ap. 197-204.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe objectives of this study were to evaluate the performance of the SCR eSense ear tag automated activity monitor (AAM) to detect estrus behavior in Holstein heifers and to determine the optimal time from estrus alert to artificial insemination (AI) using sex-sorted or conventional semen. In total, 281 heifers were fitted with the AAM once eligible for breeding (>13.5 m of age). For the first AI, estrus was synchronized using 500 μg of cloprostenol (PGF), given 14 d apart, and heifers were given estrus detection patches (Estrotect™) after the second PGF. Heifers were inseminated at randomly attributed times after high activity alert from the AAM system or if the estrus patch had ≥ 50% colour change. Most heifers received sex-sorted semen for the first AI and conventional semen for subsequent inseminations. Pregnancy diagnosis was performed at 30 d post AI and heifers had four opportunities to become pregnant. In a subset of heifers (n = 149), ovaries were scanned every 12 h from the time of AI until ovulation (OV). The system recorded a heat index (measure of estrus strength), maximum activity change, maximum rumination change and duration of high activity. The sensitivity was 91.0%, with a false positive and false negative rate of 8.0%, and the positive predictive value to detect true estrus events was 83.5%. Pregnancy per AI to first AI was 67.6% and 97.9% of heifers become pregnant after four inseminations. Most false positive estrus events had a heat index < 45 and a rumination change < -20, while false negative events had a rumination change ≥ -20. Odds of pregnancy was not associated with any estrus characteristics measured by the system. However, pre-ovulatory follicle diameter had a weak correlation (r < 0.25) with all estrus characteristics. The average (range) interval of onset of high activity, peak activity and end of high activity to OV was 28 h (16–46 h), 22 h (10–40 h) and 16 h (0–36 h), respectively. For conventional semen, each hour increase in interval from activity onset or peak activity to AI reduced the predicted probability of pregnancy by 3.8 and 4.2%, respectively. For sex-sorted semen, the relationship between activity onset or peak activity to AI and predicted probability of pregnancy was quadratic, but not significant. Overall, the SCR eSense ear tag AAM performed well and strategies to identify false positive and false negative estrus events, along with optimization of timing of AI, should further improve performance in Holstein heifers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aartificial insemination 3acloprostenol 3acolor 3aear tags 3aestrus 3aestrus detection 3aheat 3aovulation 3aprediction 3apregnancy 3apregnancy diagnosis 3aprobability 3arumination 3asemen 0aOvulation interval 0aSex-sorted semen 0aFollicle diameter 0aPregnancy per AI1 aGobikrushanth, M.1 aPlastow, G.1 aColazo, M.G.0 tTheriogenology.g2020 Oct. 01, v. 155 p.197-204dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2020.06.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02802naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245010700164300001300271500001400284520138300298592002801681650002401709650000801733650003501741650001201776650002101788650001301809650001801822650001201840650002401852650001701876651001501893653002101908653001401929653002001943653003101963653002301994653002502017653001502042653001502057653001602072700001802088700001902106773009302125856008102218852000902299655001202308IND60698845420221120080127.0210116e20141125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069884542DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.457.68222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWall, Adam R.10aGenetic utility of natural history museum specimens: endangered fairy shrimp (Branchiopoda, Anostraca)  ap. 1-14.  aNAL-light  aWe examined the potential utility of museum specimens as a source for genetic analysis of fairy shrimp. Because of loss of their vernal pool habitat, some fairy shrimp (including Branchinecta sandiegonensis and Branchinecta lynchi) are listed as threatened or endangered in Southern California by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Management of those species requires extensive population genetics studies and the resolution of important genetic complexity (e.g. possible hybridization between endangered and non-endangered species). Regulations mandating deposition of specimens of listed species have resulted in thousands of specimens accessioned into the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County that have been preserved in a variety of solutions. We subsampled those specimens, as well as other Anostraca with known collection and preservation histories, to test their potential for genetic analysis by attempting DNA extraction and amplification for mt16SrDNA. Fixation and preservation in not denatured ethanol had a far greater sequencing success rate than other (and unknown) fixatives and preservatives. To maximize scientific value we recommend field preservation in 95% not denatured ethanol (or, if pure ethanol is unavailable, high-proof drinking spirits, e.g. Everclear™, or 151 proof white rum), followed by storage in 95% not denatured ethanol.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBranchinecta lynchi 3aDNA 3aU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 3aethanol 3agenetic analysis 3ahabitats 3ahybridization 3amuseums 3apopulation genetics 3avernal pools 3aCalifornia 0aMuseum specimens 0aAnostraca 0aBranchinectidae 0aBranchinectasandiegonensis 0aBranchinectalynchi 0aBranchinectalindahli 0aendangered 0athreatened 0avernal pool1 aCampo, Daniel1 aWetzer, Regina0 tZooKeys.g2014 Nov. 25, v. 457 p.1-14dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2141x1313-29707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.457.68223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01992naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245009600168300001600264520109100280592002801371650002001399650001901419650001901438650002901457650001201486650001201498773009901510856008401609852000901693655001201702IND60123173120221122231240.0150325e20140201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012317312DNAL7 a10.1080/2150704X.2014.8808172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aByun, Younggi12aA texture-based fusion scheme to integrate high-resolution satellite SAR and optical images  ap. 103-111.  aImage fusion of different types of satellite images is of widespread interest due to the increasing availability of various spaceborne imaging sensors. In this letter, a new multi-sensor image fusion method is presented, where a texture-based fusion rule is used to address the fusion of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical images. At first, the integration of panchromatic (PAN) and SAR image is achieved in wavelet domain by taking weighted average of the corresponding input pixels. The weights are adaptively decided according to the local spatial autocorrelation characteristics of SAR texture image. This integrated image is fused into the multispectral (MS) image through generalized intensity-hue-saturation (GIHS) image fusion method to obtain the final fused image. To quantitatively evaluate and test the performance of the proposed method, comparisons with some existing fusion methods are carried out in this letter. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method shows better performance than other fusion methods and can get satisfactory fusion results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautocorrelation 3aimage analysis 3aremote sensing 3asynthetic aperture radar 3atexture 3awavelet0 tRemote sensing letters.g2014 Feb. 1, v. 5, no. 2 p.103-111dTaylor & Francisx2150-70587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2150704X.2014.8808173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02326naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245008600157300001800243520136900261592002801630650001401658650001101672650001301683650001301696650001101709700001301720700001401733700002301747700001501770773013101785856007501916852000901991655001202000IND60540947220221118041441.0160820e20140226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054094722DNAL7 a10.1021/ja405499x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xiuyun10aRole of Hydrogen in Graphene Chemical Vapor Deposition Growth on a Copper Surface  ap. 3040-3047.  aSynthesizing bilayer graphene (BLG), which has a band gap, is an important step in graphene application in microelectronics. Experimentally, it was broadly observed that hydrogen plays a crucial role in graphene chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth on a copper surface. Here, by using ab initio calculations, we have revealed a crucial role of hydrogen in graphene CVD growth, terminating the graphene edges. Our study demonstrates the following. (i) At a low hydrogen pressure, the graphene edges are not passivated by H and thus tend to tightly attach to the catalyst surface. As a consequence, the diffusion of active C species into the area beneath the graphene top layer (GTL) is prohibited, and therefore, single-layer graphene growth is favored. (ii) At a high hydrogen pressure, the graphene edges tend to be terminated by H, and therefore, its detachment from the catalyst surface favors the diffusion of active C species into the area beneath the GTL to form the adlayer graphene below the GTL; as a result, the growth of BLG or few-layer graphene (FLG) is preferred. This insightful understanding reveals a crucial role of H in graphene CVD growth and paves a way for the controllable synthesis of BLG or FLG. Besides, this study also provides a reasonable explanation for the hydrogen pressure-dependent graphene CVD growth behaviors on a Cu surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acopper 3agraphene 3ahydrogen 3avapors1 aWang, Lu1 aXin, John1 aYakobson, Boris I.1 aDing, Feng0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2014 Feb. 26, v. 136, no. 8 p.3040-3047dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja405499x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02859naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245011900174300001200293520159200305592002801897650002201925650001901947650001101966650001201977650001601989650001502005650002402020650001502044650001302059650001902072650001202091650000702103650001702110650002502127700001902152700002502171700002602196773012502222856008102347852000902428655001202437IND60440088920221117224801.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044008892DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-015-2494-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHernández-García, H.10aProduction of Volatile Fatty Acids during the Hydrolysis and Acidogenesis of Pistia stratiotes Using Ruminal Fluid  ap. 317.  aAquatic plant biomass has been shown to have a great potential for biogas production. The use of ruminal fluid has been shown to improve the degradation of the lignocellulosic material with its conversion into volatile fatty acids (VFA) during a first phase of hydrolysis–acidogenesis. VFAs are important as the feedstock for methane and hydrogen production in a second phase process within a biorefinery. The objective of this work was to produce a high yield of VFA during a first phase of anaerobic hydrolysis–acidogenesis of Pistia stratiotes biomass assessing the effect of the use of rumen fluid as inoculum and of daily adjustment of pH in batch-operated reactors. One liter anaerobic reactors containing 15 gSV L⁻¹ of P. stratiotes biomass were incubated at 30 ± 2 °C and agitated once a day. The inoculum concentration had no significant effect on the increase in VFA concentration and 20 % (V/V) was used in all treatments. The final average VFA concentration and conversion coefficients from VS to VFA in the inoculated treatment with no pH adjustment (T1) and with pH adjustment (T2) (1817 mgCOD L⁻¹ and 0.1319 mgVFA mgVS⁻¹, respectively) were significantly higher than those found in the treatment with no inoculum (T0). There were no significant differences between T0 and T1 in the VS degradation rate. In contrast, the degradation rate in T2 was significantly higher. Thus, the addition of ruminal fluid promoted the production of VFA, and the pH adjustment had no significant effect on this parameter but did influence the biomass degradation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPistia stratiotes 3aaquatic plants 3abiogas 3abiomass 3abiorefining 3afeedstocks 3ahydrogen production 3ahydrolysis 3ainoculum 3alignocellulose 3amethane 3apH 3arumen fluids 3avolatile fatty acids1 aOlguín, E.

Metal sorption performance of the column packed with Spirogyra granules was assessed under variable operating conditions, such as, different influent metal concentrations, bed heights and flow rates. These conditions greatly influenced the breakthrough time and volume, saturation time and volume, and the ability of the column to attain saturation after reaching the breakthrough. The experimental breakthrough curves obtained under varying experimental conditions were modeled using Bohart–Adams, Wolborska, Thomas, Yoon–Nelson and modified dose–response models. The first two models were valid only in representing the initial part of the breakthrough curves; however, the other three models were good in representing the entire breakthrough curve. The granule-packed column could be successfully used up to 6 and 9 cycles of sorption and desorption for the removal of Cu(II) and Pb(II), respectively. The column could efficiently remove different metals from real industrial effluents, and hence the test biomass (Spirogyra granules) is a good candidate for commercial application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSpirogyra 3abiomass 3aboiling 3acopper 3adesorption 3agranules 3aindustrial effluents 3alead 3amodels 2aAdsorption 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aBiomass 2aBioreactors 2aCopperxisolation & purification 2aIndustrial Wastexanalysis 2aLeadxisolation & purification 2aMetalsxisolation & purification 2aModels, Chemical 2aRheology 2aSolutions 2aSpirogyraxmetabolism 2aWaste Disposal, Fluid 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxisolation & purification 2aWater Purification1 aKumar, Dhananjay1 aGaur, J.P.0 tWater research.g2012 Mar. 1, v. 46, no. 3 p.779-788dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2011.11.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03560naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001500149245014300164300001600307500001500323520216200338592002802500650002002528650002302548650001802571650002302589650001302612650001202625650001302637650001202650650001102662650002102673650002302694650001802717650001402735650002002749650001802769650001802787651001002805653001502815700001902830700002302849700002002872773009202892856008502984852000903069655001203078IND4471181420221120025026.0141112e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447118142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2012.06.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaut, Nani10aSoil acidification by intensified crop production in South Asia results in higher N₂O/(N₂ + N₂O) product ratios of denitrification  ap. 104-112.  a2019-12-06  aAgricultural soils emit significant amounts of N₂O to the atmosphere, and annual emissions are in some proportion to the input of reactive nitrogen to the system. Hence the ongoing intensification of cropping systems in South Asia will result in increased emissions of N₂O. The prospects are potentially worse than those predicted by the increasing doses of N-fertilizers, however. The reason for this is that intensive cropping systems may acidify the soils, which could increase the N₂O/(N₂ + N₂O) product ratio of denitrification due to interference with the expression of the different enzymatic steps in this process (Liu et al., 2010 FEMS Microbiol Ecol 72 407–417). We investigated this phenomenon for agricultural soils in the central mid-hills of Nepal. We sampled soils from fields that had been under intensified cultivation for ≥20 years, and adjacent fields with more traditional cultivation, in areas with permanently drained soils as well as areas with frequent flooding. The characteristic kinetics of NO, N₂O and N₂ production by denitrification in these soils was measured by anoxic incubations after flooding and drainage of the soils with 2 mM NO₃ ⁻, to secure similar NO₃-concentrations for all soils. The results demonstrate that intensification invariably lowered the soil pH and increased the N₂O/(N₂ + N₂O) product ratios of denitrification. This effect of intensification was observed both for incubations with and without C-substrates (glutamic acid) added. The transient accumulation of NO varied grossly between sites, but was not affected by intensification. The results demonstrate convincingly that the intensification has resulted in higher intrinsic propensity of the soils to emit N₂O to the atmosphere, and the correlation with pH suggests that acidification is responsible. This causal relationship is underpinned by emerging evidence that low pH interferes with the assembly of the enzyme N₂O-reductase. We conclude that the ongoing intensification of agriculture in South Asia may result in severely increasing N₂O emissions unless acidification of the soil is counteracted.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrop production 3aagricultural soils 3aacidification 3asoil acidification 3adrainage 3aenzymes 3anitrogen 3asoil pH 3afloods 3acropping systems 3aintensive cropping 3asoil sampling 3aemissions 3adenitrification 3aglutamic acid 3anitrous oxide 3aNepal 0aatmosphere1 aDörsch, Peter1 aSitaula, Bishal K.1 aBakken, Lars R.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2012 Dec., v. 55 p.104-112dElsevier Ltdx0038-07177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2012.06.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03162naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006200150245008000212520172200292592002802014650001702042650001202059650001002071650001602081650001102097650001302108650001802121650000902139650001102148650002002159650001702179650003202196651001102228653001002239653002102249653001702270653002002287653002402307653002902331700003102360700002702391700002802418700002102446700001902467773008802486856008502574852000902659655001202668IND60738550620221120120024.0220124e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073855062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2021.1054392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAntoneli, Valdemir1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5942-833010aSoil and water losses along the cultivation cycle of onion in Irati, Brazil  aOnion is one of the most important vegetables grown in southern Brazil. However, despite its profitability, little is known about its response to soil erosion throughout its productive cycle divided into 5 stages: S1 (germination), S2 (formation of leaves and roots), S3 (bulbification), S4 (snap) and S5 (harvesting). With the aim of providing knowledge in this matter we have analyzed the intra-cycle dynamics of some parameters such as bulk density (BD), porosity, soil penetration resistance (SPR), and soil and water losses. To do that we have assessed these parameters in 40 random points and at different depths in a representative farm of 3 ha located in the municipality of Irati (Paraná, Brazil). BD was quantified by using the core method, porosity after particle density quantification by the volumetric balloon method, and SPR by impact penetrometer. Soil and water losses were estimated after carrying out 30 rainfall simulations (6 per crop stage). The results showed that bulk density increased progressively and continuously from 1.06 to 1.36 g cm⁻³. This greater compaction was also observed in the values of SPR that increased from 2.0 to above 3.0 MPa at the end of the cycle. Regarding soil erosion the highest rates were recorded at S4 when onions are snapped (431.0 g m⁻²). We conclude the occurrence of runoff and soil erosion is a consequence of the increase in soil compaction throughout the cycle provoked by the repeated pass of heavy machinery and workers to apply herbicides and fertilizers. Since soil erosion rates found are relatively high (1437.1 g m⁻² y⁻¹) we suggest the progressive implementation of conservationist practices to guarantee its sustainability.  aPublisher supplied data 3abulk density 3acatenas 3afarms 3agermination 3aonions 3aporosity 3aprofitability 3arain 3arunoff 3asoil compaction 3asoil erosion 3asoil penetration resistance 3aBrazil 0aOnion 0aSoil degradation 0aBulk density 0aSoil resistance 0aWater and soil loss 0aConventional agriculture1 aCaroline de Paula, Enaiale1 aAnésio Bednarz, João1 aRodrigo-Comino, Jesús,1 aCerdà, Artemio,1 aPulido, Manuel0 tCatena.g2021 Sept., v. 204 p.105439-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2021.1054393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02352naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010500169300001600274520124500290592002801535650002701563650001901590650000801609650001201617650002601629650002101655650001901676650001401695650000901709700001701718700001801735700001901753700001401772773009901786856008401885852000901969655001201978IND60123173520221122054522.0150325e20140201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012317352DNAL7 a10.1080/2150704X.2014.8881062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHong, Sungwook10aAnalysis of sea ice surface properties using ASH and Hong approximations in satellite remote sensing  ap. 139-147.  aThe Hong approximation, an approximation between the vertically and horizontally polarized reflectivities of specular surfaces has been useful for estimating the changes and characteristics produced in sea ice surfaces by climate change. Recently, the direct relationship (Azzam relationship) and the analytical (Azzam–Sohn–Hong (ASH)) approximation were derived and validated between two polarized reflectivities. In this study, the small-scale roughness and refractive index over sea ice are estimated using the ASH and Hong approximations with observations from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). The ASH approximation is useful to monitor the properties of ice or snow, because those materials have a small value of the imaginary part of the refractive index (). Meanwhile, the Hong approximation is effective for estimating the melting of sea ice, because the melting of ice or snow indicates the increase in the imaginary part of the refractive index. Consequently, this study suggests that combining ASH and Hong approximations provides an effective procedure for analysing and understanding the melting sea ice surfaces in terms of the small-scale roughness and refractive index.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEarth Observing System 3aclimate change 3aice 3amelting 3amicrowave radiometers 3arefractive index 3aremote sensing 3aroughness 3asnow1 aShin, Inchul1 aByun, Youngho1 aSeo, Hwa-Jeong1 aKim, Yuha0 tRemote sensing letters.g2014 Feb. 1, v. 5, no. 2 p.139-147dTaylor & Francisx2150-70587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2150704X.2014.8881063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01909naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245012100163300001600284520089600300592002801196650001701224650001501241650001101256650001901267651001001286700001901296700001801315700001501333700001601348700001501364773009901379856008401478852000901562655001201571IND60123173620221122063540.0150325e20140201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012317362DNAL7 a10.1080/2150704X.2014.8898622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJia, Kun10aAutomatic land-cover update approach integrating iterative training sample selection and a Markov Random Field model  ap. 148-156.  aLand-cover updating from remote-sensing data is an effective means of obtaining timely land-cover information. An automatic approach integrating iterative training sample selection (ITSS) and a Markov Random Field (MRF) model is proposed in this study to overcome the land-cover update problem when no previous remote-sensing data corresponding to the land-cover data are available. A case study in the Beijing region indicates that ITSS can effectively select reliable training samples based on historical land-cover data and that ITSS with MRF can achieve satisfactory land-cover update results (overall classification accuracy: 83.1%). The MRF model can effectively reduce salt-and-pepper noise and improve overall accuracy by approximately 6%.

To solve this problem, an experiment has been made in this paper to study the extinction effectiveness of a new type of pyrotechnically generated aerosol extinguishing agent in wood crib fire. Differing from the old ones, the new type of pyrotechnically generated aerosol extinguishing agent generates via combustion of aerosol forming agents containing a kind of phosphorus-containing compound named P90x, which is flammable and has been widely used as fire retardants in materials. P90x was added, for the first time, as a reducer into aerosol forming agents to improve the capabilities against the Class A wood-crib fire. Five aerosol forming agents with the different mass ratio of P90x and potassium nitrate were tested for fire extinguishing efficiency. The fire extinguishing efficiency increased as the amount of P90x increases. And the best fire extinguishing efficiency in this experiment was 20 g/m³ for wood-crib fire. This new type of aerosol extinguishing agents can adhere to the surface of burning wood and react with it to extinguish fire efficiently. Therefore, the Class A fire (wood cribs) can be extinguished by pyrotechnically generated aerosol extinguishing agents for the first time from all over the world.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aburning 3acombustion 3aflame retardants 3aphosphorus 3apotassium nitrate 3awood 0aPyrotechnically generated aerosol 0aPhosphorus-containing compound 0aWood crib fire 0aExtinguishing efficiency1 aHan, Zhiyue1 aDu, Zhiming1 aZhao, Linshuang1 aCong, Xiaomin0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2017 June 15, v. 154 p.151-158dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01961naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245014900164300001600313520043900329592002800768650002300796650002600819650002900845650001300874650002200887650001900909650001800928650001000946650001600956650001500972650002300987650002001010650001701030653001501047653001901062653001401081653002801095653002801123700002001151700002101171700002601192700002201218773015201240856007801392852000901470655001201479IND60522885920221122061624.0160604e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052288592DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-1994-7-8042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKobayashi, Akio12aA New Type of Antimicrobial Phenolics Produced by Plant Peroxidase and Its Possible Role in the Chemical Defense Systems against Plant Pathogens  ap. 411-414.  aSyringaldehyde readily reacted in the horse-radish peroxidase (HRPOD) system.

Their use in construction is currently restricted to complex and iconic structures, but the growth potential is large. This paper aims to investigate the environmental opportunities of digital fabrication methods, particularly when applied to complex concrete geometries. A case study of a novel robotic additive process that is applied to a wall structure is evaluated with the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method. The results of the assessment demonstrate that digital fabrication provides environmental benefits when applied to complex structures. The results also confirm that additional complexity is achieved through digital fabrication without additional environmental costs. This study provides a quantitative argument to position digital fabrication at the beginning of a new era, which is often called the Digital Age in many other disciplines.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aconcrete 3aecosystem services 3aenvironmental assessment 3alife cycle assessment 3arobots 0aDigital fabrication 0aLCA 0aComplexity 0aConcrete 0aRobotic construction 0aSustainability1 aMüller, Florian,1 aHack, Norman1 aWangler, Timothy,d1979-1 aHabert, Guillaume0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2017 June 15, v. 154 p.330-340dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03689naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002300169245011900192300001600311500001500327520136300342592002801705650004301733650001601776650002001792650002601812650001601838650001001854650001601864650001301880650000901893650002201902650001401924650001601938650001301954650002801967650002801995650002702023650003002050650003302080650002602113650004502139650001002184650002302194650002202217650004202239650004902281650002302330650002502353650002802378650002402406650000902430650006102439650002402500650003102524650001202555650001602567650001902583651001002602651001002612653001702622700001902639700001802658700001702676700002102693700002402714773008802738856008402826852000902910655001202919IND60088250220221116184258.0141102e20120301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008825022DNAL7 a221696612pmid7 a10.1016/j.watres.2011.11.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSrivastava, Ankita10aDynamics of microcystin production and quantification of potentially toxigenic Microcystis sp. using real-time PCR  ap. 817-827.  a2019-12-06  aCyanobacterial blooms in eutrophied water body are generally composed of various genotypes with or without microcystin-producing genes (mcy gene cluster). Thus there is a need for quantification of potent toxin producing strains. The present study aimed at identifying microcystin variants and its producer strains in Durgakund pond, Varanasi, India, based on quantification of cpcBA-IGS and mcyA (condensation domain) genes using real-time PCR and LC–MS. Increase in microcystin concentrations was correlated with increase in mcyA copy number and the level of pigments (chlorophyll a, phycocyanin and carotenoids). Also, selected environmental factors (water temperature, light irradiance, rainfall, pH, N and P) and the concentration of microcystin variants (MC-LR, -RR and -YR) were also assessed in samples during May 2010 to April 2011 to establish the possible correlation among these parameters. Nutrients favored cyanobacterial bloom but it could not be correlated with the levels of microcystin variants and seemed to be geographically specific. Microcystis sp. dominant in the pond comprised potentially toxigenic cells. The ratio of potentially toxigenic Microcystis sp. to that of total Microcystis sp. ranged from 0% to 14%. Such studies paved the way to identify and quantify the most potent microcystin producer in the tropical aquatic body.  aPublisher supplied data 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aMicrocystis 3alight intensity 3aenvironmental factors 3aphycocyanin 3agenes 3acarotenoids 3agenotype 3arain 3awater temperature 3anutrients 3achlorophyll 3apigments 2aCarotenoidsxmetabolism 2aChlorophyllxmetabolism 2aChromatography, Liquid 2aElectrophoresis, Agar Gel 2aEutrophicationxdrug effects 2aGene Dosagexgenetics 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentrationxdrug effects 2aLight 2aLimit of Detection 2aMass Spectrometry 2aMicrocystinsxbiosynthesisxtoxicity. 2aMicrocystisxcytologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aNitrogenxanalysis 2aPhosphorusxanalysis 2aPhycocyaninxmetabolism 2aPondsxmicrobiology 2aRain 2aReal-Time Polymerase Chain Reactionxmethodsxstandards. 2aReference Standards 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSeasons 2aTemperature 2aToxicity Tests 3aIndia 0aIndia 0acondensation1 aChoi, Gang-Guk1 aAhn, Chi-Yong1 aOh, Hee-Mock1 aRavi, Alok Kumar1 aAsthana, Ravi Kumar0 tWater research.g2012 Mar. 1, v. 46, no. 3 p.817-827dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2011.11.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02243naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245011400158300002000272520112300292592002801415650001101443650002201454650001001476650001601486650001801502650001301520650004401533650001401577650001301591650002001604700002601624700002401650773012401674856007401798852000901872655001201881IND60664151320221121063926.0190910e20121015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066415132DNAL7 a10.1039/c2ra21478d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMadhuprasad, 10aColorimetric receptors for naked eye detection of inorganic fluoride ion in aqueous media using ICT mechanism  ap. 10499-10504.  aA new series of receptors were designed and synthesized based on benzohydrazide for the colorimetric detection of fluoride ion. The receptors L1 and L2 are highly selective towards fluoride ion over other anions. These receptors are able to detect inorganic fluoride such as NaF in aqueous solutions. The presence of two carbonyl groups in the receptor molecule makes the –NH proton highly acidic and hence these receptors are capable of competing with water molecules to bind fluoride ion. The receptors L1 and L2 showed a significant colour change from colourless to yellow in aqueous solutions of NaF with a Δλₘₐₓ of 149 nm and 147 nm respectively. The mechanism involved in the colour change was deprotonation, formation of imidic acid intermediate followed by stabilization of complex through Intramolecular Charge Transfer (ICT). This was further confirmed by ¹H NMR titrations where the formation of imidic acid was observed. The receptor L1 proved itself to be potentially useful for real-life applications by detecting fluoride ion quantitatively in sea water and commercially available mouth wash.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanions 3aaqueous solutions 3acolor 3acolorimetry 3adeprotonation 3amoieties 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3areceptors 3aseawater 3asodium fluoride1 aShetty, A.

Nonetheless, the effects of different salinities on the reproductive success and sex ratio of the species remain unknown. Male sex characters, sex ratio and reproductive success of P. velifera were evaluated by maintaining 160 juveniles (0.078 ± 0.011 g) in four different salinities (0; 12; 24; 36 g/L), with four replicates. The only modification observed in males was the formation of a copulatory organ from the anal fin, which was used to distinguish them from females. Timing of the formation of the male copulatory organ, and the weight and total length of males when it occurred, were recorded. Twenty‐eight fish from each treatment were euthanized after 150 day to examine the gonads and confirm sex. Eight females and four males from each treatment were then kept in their respective salinity treatments for 65 days to examine the effects of salinity on reproduction. Males were kept with females in the different treatments for 15 days, at which point they were removed. Salinity was negatively correlated with male weight and length. Salinity also affected the sex ratio, with the percentages of males and females being 32.5 and 67.5%, and 27.5 and 72.5% in the salinities of 24 and 36 g of salt/L, respectively. Fifty percent of the females kept in freshwater reproduced, while there was no reproduction in the other treatments. The maintenance of P. velifera in freshwater promoted greater reproductive success and precocity, as well as larger males.  aPublisher supplied data  cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior  a305048/2015-5cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico 3aPoecilia 3aanimal reproduction 3aaquatic habitat 3aearly development 3afemales 3afish 3afreshwater 3agonads 3ajuveniles 3amales 3areproductive success 3asalinity 3asex ratio 3asexual maturity1 aCipriano, Filipe1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8333-98831 aLorenzini, João Paulo Silva1 aCipriano, Kauana Santos de Lima1 aGonçalves Junior, Lucas Pedro1 aNakayama, Cintia L.1 aLuz, Ronald Kennedy1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1021-57721 aMiranda Filho, Kleber Campos1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3026-44910 tAquaculture research.g2019 Oct., v. 50, no. 10 p.2932-2937dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53865x1355-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.142473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02120naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245010600174300001600280520092800296592002801224650003001252650001901282650001101301650002101312650001001333650001101343650001301354650001701367653002201384653002201406653001701428700002301445700001701468700002401485700002501509773009501534856008401629852000901713655001201722IND60480048520221120134951.0160125e20141201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048004852DNAL7 a10.1556/AAlim.43.2014.4.142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVazquez-Armenta, F.J.10aAntibrowning and antimicrobial effects of onion essential oil to preserve the quality of cut potatoes  ap. 640-649.  aThis study evaluated the effect of onion essential oil (OEO) (0, 0.5, 2.5, and 5 mg ml<sup>−1</sup>) on microbial growth, browning decay, and sensorial appealing of cut potatoes stored for 15 days at 4 °C.

The higher the added OEO concentration the lower microbial growth of the treated product was, achieving a reduction of 1.27 log CFU g<sup>−1</sup> for the 5 mg ml<sup>−1</sup> treatment. The odour and flavour appealing of cut potatoes were well received by the panelists after 10 days of storage. Therefore, the use of OEO in cut potatoes has a potential as antimicrobial and antibrowning agent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanti-infective properties 3aessential oils 3aflavor 3amicrobial growth 3aodors 3aonions 3apotatoes 3astorage time 0asulphur compounds 0aenzyme inhibition 0afood quality1 aAyala-Zavala, J.F.1 aOlivas, G.I.1 aMolina-Corral, F.J.1 aSilva-Espinoza, B.A.0 tActa alimentaria.g2014 Dec. 1, v. 43, no. 4 p.640-649dAkadémiai Kiadóx0139-30067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FAAlim.43.2014.4.143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02139naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245008800162300001600250520084200266592002801108650002701136650002101163650001401184650001201198650001501210650001501225650001701240650001501257650001301272650001201285650001301297653002001310653002701330653001601357653002601373653002201399700002501421700002001446773015201466856007801618852000901696655001201705IND60522886020221120153737.0160604e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052288602DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-1994-7-8052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Xiangbo10aSubcellular Localization of Quinate: Oxidoreductase from Phaseolus mungo L.

This salt had a melting point (Tₘ) of 55 °C and good thermal stability up to 300 °C. The equimolar mixture had ionic conductivity of 1.3 × 10⁻⁴ S cm⁻¹ at 60 °C. Unequimolar mixing of these components gave rise either to hydroxide ions or proton conductive materials, depending on the mixing ratio. Addition of excess [P₄₄₄₄][OH] to benzimidazole (molar ratio of benzimidazole:[P₄₄₄₄][OH] = 1 : 2) led to good ionic conductivity (1.3 × 10⁻³ S cm⁻¹ at 60 °C); this is attributed not only to [P₄₄₄₄] cations and [BzIm] anions but also hydroxide anions. Mixtures containing excess benzimidazole were expected to be proton conductors. As an example, the mixture with molar ratio benzimidazole : [P₄₄₄₄][OH] of 3 : 2 had ionic conductivity of 4.1 × 10⁻⁴ S cm⁻¹ at 60 °C and a decomposition temperature (Td) above 300 °C. This conductivity was higher than the value expected from the Tg and other physicochemical properties of [P₄₄₄₄][BzIm], suggesting the contribution of proton conduction. Proton conduction was further confirmed by chronoamperometric measurement using electrochemical cells equipped with platinum electrodes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanions 3abenzimidazole 3acations 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aionic liquids 3amelting point 3amixing 3amixing ratio 3aplatinum 3atemperature 3athermal stability1 aOhno, Hiroyuki0 tRSC advances.g2012 Oct. 29, v. 2, no. 30 p.11279-11284dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2ra21482b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03173naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245009400169300001600263500001500279520136100294592002801655650002101683650001801704650001301722650002301735650002701758650001501785650002801800650002601828650001801854650001501872650001501887650001501902650001801917650001601935650002201951650001201973650002001985650001802005650001102023650001502034650001302049651001802062653001402080653001902094653001802113653001802131653001602149653002802165653001702193653001702210653002702227653001602254653001402270700001602284700001702300700001602317773011802333856005102451852000902502655001202511IND50086933520221116151255.0140412e20111201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008693352DNAL7 a10.2989/16085914.2011.6435612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeu-Anoï, N M10aSeasonal distribution of phytoplankton in the Aby lagoon system, Ivory Coast, West Africa  ap. 321-330.  a2019-12-05  aSeasonal variability of phytoplankton species composition, abundance and physical and chemical factors influencing phytoplankton dynamics were investigated in the Aby lagoon system, south-eastern Ivory Coast, covering the main climatic seasons in 2006–2007. Seasonal and spatial variability of nutrient concentrations in the system were influenced by freshwater inflow from the Bia and Tanoé rivers. The decrease in the salinity gradient in Aby Lagoon, which is permanently stratified during the long dry season, increased the bottom inputs of soluble reactive phosphate and soluble reactive silicate which, in combination with good light penetration during the long dry season, enhanced phytoplankton production in the system. During the rainy seasons, water discharges into the system washed phytoplankton biomass out, preventing the development of blooms. Overall, 192 taxa from eight phyla were recorded: Bacillariophyta (32%), Chlorophyta (31%), Cyanobacteria (23%), Euglenophyta (12%), Dinophyta (0.5%), Xanthophyta (0.5%), Chrysophyta (0.5%) and Rhodophyta (0.5%). During the long dry season, Cyanobacteria cells comprised >50% of the phytoplankton abundance. The main phytoplankton taxa responsible for this high abundance were Microcystis aeruginosa, Oscillatoria princeps, Pseudanabaena limnetica, Aphanizomenon sp. 2 and Anabaena planctonica.  aPublisher supplied data 3anutrient content 3aAphanizomenon 3aAnabaena 3aseasonal variation 3aMicrocystis aeruginosa 3aRhodophyta 3aPseudanabaena limnetica 3aOscillatoria princeps 3aXanthophyceae 3awet season 3adry season 3afreshwater 3aphytoplankton 3aChlorophyta 3aspecies diversity 3abiomass 3aBacillariophyta 3aChrysophyceae 3arivers 3aEuglenozoa 3asalinity 3aCote d'Ivoire 0aabundance 0aEuglenophycota 0achoked lagoon 0aChlorophycota 0aXanthophyta 0aenvironmental variables 0ariver inputs 0aRhodophycota 0acommunity distribution 0aChrysophyta 0adiversity1 aOuattara, A1 aKoné, Y J-M1 aGourène, G0 tAfrican journal of aquatic science.g2011 Dec. 1, v. 36, no. 3 p.321-330dTaylor & Francis Groupx1727-93647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2989/16085914.2011.643561  aDNAL 7aarticle02714naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245013000169300001600299520143500315592002801750650001101778650001601789650001201805650001201817650001401829650001101843650001601854650002201870650002201892650000901914650001601923650001401939650001401953650001501967650001401982650001101996700001702007700001702024700001502041700001902056773008802075856008402163852000902247655001202256IND60088250520221116184009.0141102e20120301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008825052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2011.11.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Chunying10aPhotolytic reaction mechanism and impacts of coexisting substances on photodegradation of bisphenol A by Bi₂WO₆ in water  ap. 845-853.  aBi₂WO₆ displayed great photolytic degradation efficiency to bisphenol A (BPA) under simulated solar light irradiation but its reaction mechanism and the impacts of coexisting substances on the degradation remain unclear. In present study, the reaction mechanism was investigated using DMPO spin-trapping ESR spectra and experiments with scavengers of hydroxyl radicals (OH) and holes. The results supported that hole oxidation mainly governed the photodegradation process. As a common humic substance in natural water, humic acid accelerated the degradation of BPA when its concentration was 1mg/L, while the photodegradation was impeded with the increase of humic acid concentration in the range of 5–20mg/L. Almost all anions, including NO₃ ⁻, HCO₃ ⁻, Cl⁻, SO₄ ²⁻ inhibited the degradation of BPA by Bi₂WO₆ and their inhibition effects followed the order of SO₄ ²⁻>Cl⁻>HCO₃ ⁻>NO₃ ⁻. Cations of Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ displayed slight suppressing effect on BPA degradation mainly due to the impact of Cl⁻ coexisting in the solution. However, Cu²⁺ hindered the BPA photodegradation heavily. Fe³⁺ and H₂O₂ affected the photodegradation in a complicated way: they suppressed or promoted the photodegradation depending on their concentrations. This could be the result of competition between photolyitc hole generated by Bi₂WO₆ and OH produced by Fe³⁺ or H₂O₂.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanions 3abisphenol A 3acalcium 3acations 3achlorides 3acopper 3ahumic acids 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydroxyl radicals 3airon 3airradiation 3amagnesium 3aoxidation 3aphotolysis 3apotassium 3asodium1 aZhu, Lingyan1 aWei, Mingcui1 aChen, Peng1 aShan, Guoqiang0 tWater research.g2012 Mar. 1, v. 46, no. 3 p.845-853dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2011.11.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03168naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245012000163520183400283592002802117650001202145650001602157650001102173650001002184650001502194650002002209650001102229650001202240650001402252651001002266653002502276653003102301653003302332653001702365653001902382700001902401700005302420700001402473700001502487700001302502700001402515773008702529856008502616852000902701655001202710IND60738551320221121050017.0210619e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073855132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2021.1054672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Bo10aInsights into the geohazards triggered by the 2017 Ms 6.9 Nyingchi earthquake in the east Himalayan syntaxis, China  aOn 2017-11-18, an Ms 6.9 (Mw 6.4) magnitude earthquake struck the NBTN (Namcha Barwa tectonic node), located in the EHS (east Himalayan syntaxis) on the south Tibetan Plateau, China, with an epicenter at 29.87°N and 95.02°E and a focal depth of approximately 10 km. Multiple remote sensing interpretations and field investigations revealed that at least 1816 landslides and 3 dammed lakes were triggered and formed by the Nyingchi earthquake, and the landslide-affected area was approximately 527 km². Most geohazards are concentrated in the southeast section of the epicenter, and compared to the outer section (503 landslides), the inner section (1313 landslides) exhibits a notable concentration. The total landslide area is 32.7 km² and follows an exponential distribution, namely, Y = 0.023*e[⁻⁽ᴸᵒᵍ⁽ˣ⁾⁻³.⁰⁶⁾^²/⁰.²⁷³⁸]. The estimated landslide volume is (14.096 + 3.023/-1.844)*10⁶ m³. Rock avalanches are the most common failure pattern in the landslide-affected area, and the largest landslide area reaches 3.6*10⁶ m². >60% of the landslides occur at elevations ranging from 2600 to 3800 m and at distances to the river midline ranging from 400 to 2400 m, and this range coincides with the upper-top section of the slope. Landslides occurred most frequently in schist and gneiss (1313 landslides, 72.3%). Among the 3 dammed lakes, two dammed lakes were directly triggered by the Nyingchi event, and one dammed lake was formed by an active debris flow gully, namely, the Sedongpu gully. Moreover, numerous dangerous deposits remain in the main flow stream, and special attention should be given to these deposits. Finally, the AHP (analytic hierarchy process)-CF (certainty factor) method is adopted to establish a landslide susceptibility map for further risk assessment.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatenas 3aearthquakes 3agneiss 3alakes 3alandslides 3arisk assessment 3arivers 3astreams 3atectonics 3aChina 0aCoseismic geohazards 0aMs 6.9 Nyingchi earthquake 0aDistribution characteristics 0aDammed lakes 0aSusceptibility1 aWang, Yunsheng1 aLi, Weile1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3741-88011 aSu, Lijun1 aLu, Jiayan1 aZeng, Lu1 aLi, Xiang0 tCatena.g2021 Oct., v. 205 p.105467-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2021.1054673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03827naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245016600204300001200370500001900382520235900401592002802760596005902788650002202847650001502869650001502884650000802899650001202907650001802919650001202937650002102949650001102970650001102981650001302992650001103005650000703016650001903023650002303042650001503065650001003080700001803090700001603108773014103124856008303265852000903348655001203357IND60700701520221118051136.0200724e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070070152DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-020-04732-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShafīq, M.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4732-033810aAdsorption of Divalent Copper Ions from Synthetic Wastewater Using Layered Double Hydroxides (NiZnFe) and Its Composites with Banana Biochar and Carbon Nanotubes  ap. 346.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe adsorption potential of layered double hydroxides (LDH) of nickle–zinc–iron (NiZnFe) and its composites with single-wall carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and banana biochar (Bb) was investigated for divalent copper (Cu²⁺) removal in a batch system. Field emission scanning electron microscopy and FT-IR spectra confirmed the adsorption of Cu²⁺ onto LDH (NiZnFe) and its composites with Bb (LDH/Bb) and CNTs (LDH/cnt). The optimum equilibrium contact time was determined to be ~ 30 min, with LDH/Bb displaying the maximum uptake and removal efficiency (95%) for an initial Cu²⁺ concentration of 20 mg L⁻¹. Pseudo-second-order kinetic models presented high R² values (1.0) for all adsorbents, indicating good agreement between the theoretical adsorption capacities with experimental values. Multistep adsorption with both the surface and pore diffusion mechanism was suggested as well based on the intraparticle diffusion kinetic model. An optimum pH of 5.0 was considered with an increase in the uptake of Cu²⁺ and its removal efficiency, wherein LDH/Bb presented a greater removal efficiency and higher Cu²⁺ uptake compared with that of LDH (NiZnFe) and LDH/cnt. A gradual increase in Cu²⁺ uptake was observed in association with an increase in adsorbent dose from 0.2 to 0.5 g, with insignificant changes upon further increasing the dose of the adsorbent from 0.5 to 0.9 g. An increase in the initial Cu²⁺ concentrations from 10 to 100 mg L⁻¹ resulted in a decrease in the removal efficiency, whereas Cu²⁺ uptake increased almost linearly in the Cu²⁺ concentration range of 10–60 mg L⁻¹. Results of experimental data fitting using the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models suggest a dominance of monolayer adsorption, although multilayer adsorption appears to occur onto adsorbents with heterogeneous surfaces. Notably, chemisorption was also proposed to occur owing to the values of mean free energy of adsorption falling in the 8–16-kJ mol⁻¹ range, as calculated using the Dubinin–Radushkevich isotherm model. Importantly, the use of the SIP isotherm model indicated LDH/Bb to exhibit higher energy of adsorption and degree of heterogeneity than other two adsorbents.

The major group of components, hydrocarbons, occurs in two distinct classes, which show different distributions on the cuticle of the insects. Unbranched shorter chain compounds (C₂₁ to C₃₁, linear group) dominate on body, head and wings, while longer chain, polymethyl-branched compounds (C₃₅ to C₃₉, branched group) are predominantly found on the antennae. Several other components like 1,3-pentacosadiene and oxygenated aliphatic compounds occur in minor amounts on the cuticle. The reason for this polymorphism is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPieris rapae 3aantennae 3abiochemical polymorphism 3acabbage 3ahead 3ahydrocarbons 3ainsects 3alipids 3awings1 aSchulz, Stefan1 aVan Loon, JoopJ.

We report reproductive traits of Synalpheus apioceros from Bocas del Toro, Panama, based on collections in August 2011. The 46 ovigerous females that were analyzed ranged in size from 3.8 to 7.4 mm in carapace length. Fecundity varied between 8 and 310 embryos and increased with female size. Females invested 18.6 ± 10.3% of their body weight in Embryo production. Embryo volume increased considerably (77.2%) during embryogenesis, likely representing water uptake near the end of incubation period. Compared to Synalpheus species with abbreviated or direct development, Synalpheus apioceros produced substantially smaller embryos; however, Synalpheus apioceros seems to have a prolonged larval phase with at least five zoeal stages, which may explain the combination of relatively small and numerous embryos. We did not find nonviable, minute, chalky embryos, previously reported for Synalpheus apioceros specimens obtained from the northwestern Gulf of Mexico, which supports the hypothesis that the production of this type of embryos may be a physiological response of this warm-water species to the temperature decrease near to its latitudinal range limit.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDecapoda 3abody weight 3aembryogenesis 3afecundity 3afemales 3alarvae 3aphysiological response 3ashrimp 3atemperature 3awater uptake 3aGulf of Mexico 3aPanama 0aCentral America 0aembryo volume 0aincubation period 0areproductive output1 aWehrtmann, Ingo S.1 aFelder, Darryl L.1 aMantelatto, Fernando L.0 tZooKeys.g2014 Nov. 25, v. 457 p.227-238dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2141x1313-29707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.457.64033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01768naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245007200156300002000228520085100248592002801099650001401127650000901141650001301150650002101163650001301184700001701197700001701214700001601231773012401247856007401371852000901445655001201454IND60664151920221121063834.0190910e20121022xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066415192DNAL7 a10.1039/c2ra21486e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTudisca, V.10aIsotopic effect on the aging dynamics of a charged colloidal system  ap. 11111-11116.  aA dynamic light scattering (DLS) investigation of the isotopic H/D substitution on water molecules in aqueous Laponite suspensions is reported for two Laponite weight concentrations (Cw = 1.5% and Cw = 3.0%). Increasing the deuterium percentage results in a slowing down of the dynamics for both concentrations, although the aging behavior of the suspensions is not qualitatively modified by the isotopic substitution. A scaling law for the isotopic effect is found. The relaxation times and the stretching parameters collapse on two distinct master curves, indicating that the two previously found dynamical behaviors of colloidal gels and glasses are preserved. These results may facilitate a large variety of experimental techniques and further theoretical investigations about the role of the solvent in determining the interaction potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeuterium 3agels 3alaponite 3alight scattering 3asolvents1 aRicci, M.

Generally, the elemental concentration significantly differed between species and tissues (p < 0.0001), and a statistical interaction between these two factors was observed (p < 0.0001). In muscle and liver, concentrations of Hg and Se were statistically higher in ruffe than in sichel and European perch. In gills, statistically highest concentrations of Mn, Sr, and Zn were found in sichel, and of Fe in European perch. In gonads, statistically highest concentrations of As were detected in sichel, of Zn in ruffe, and of Mn and Mo in European perch. The highest number of coefficients of partial correlations between fish weight and element levels was found in sichel (11 in total). Of all analyzed elements, Al and B had the highest number of partial correlations in tissues. The levels of Hg exceeded the maximum acceptable concentration (0.5 mg kg⁻¹) in all muscle samples, which can pose a risk for human consumption. Different diet preferences of the investigated fish species resulted in a different accumulation of elements in tissues, and ruffe (as a species that consume mainly benthic macroinvertebrates) accumulated the highest level of Hg, which makes it suitable for monitoring of this element in water bodies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGymnocephalus cernua 3aPelecus cultratus 3aPerca fluviatilis 3aaluminum 3aarsenic 3aboron 3acorrelation 3aecotoxicology 3afish 3afood choices 3agills 3agonads 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3airon 3aliver 3amacroinvertebrates 3amanganese 3amercury 3amolybdenum 3amonitoring 3amuscles 3arisk 3aselenium 3astrontium 3asurface water 3atissues 3azinc 3aDanube River 3aSerbia1 aVišnjić-Jeftić, Ž.1 aSpasić, S.1 aHegediš, A.1 aKrpo-Ćetković, J.1 aLenhardt, M.0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2015 Sept., v. 226, no. 9 p.287-287dSpringer International Publishingx0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-015-2544-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02063naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245008300165300001600248520074200264592002801006650002701034650001201061650001501073650003901088650002701127650001601154650001501170650001001185650004801195653001501243653002101258653002601279700002601305700002601331700001201357700001201369700002101381773015201402856007801554852000901632655001201641IND60522886520221120182731.0160604e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052288652DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-1994-7-8102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakeuchi, Yutaka10aCalmodulin Regulates Nucleotide Hydrolysis Activity of Tissue Transglutaminase  ap. 453-457.  aThe interaction of calmodulin with purified guinea pig liver transglutaminase was studied.

The peak activation was obtained in the presence of a stoichiometric amount of calmodulin. The effect of calmodulin on the classical transglutaminase activity was minimal. Fluorescence spectroscopy demonstrated that the enzyme produced a significant blue shift in the emission peak of dansylated calmodulin.

Serving temperatures that increase complementary purchasing may enhance the firm's bottom line, but could add unnecessary calories to the meal, and thus is of interest to both consumers and managers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aappetite 3abeverages 3acomplementary foods 3afood purchasing 3alaboratory experimentation 3amanagers 3apurchasing 3asatiety 3atemperature 0aComplementary food purchases 0aServing temperature 0aFood well-being 0aFood decision making1 aBlock, Lauren1 aMorrin, Maureen0 tAppetite.g2021 May 01, v. 160 p.105069-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2020.1050693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02291naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006300149245009300212506010400305506007600409520089200485592002801377506003701405650002001442650002501462650001301487650000901500650001301509650001501522653000901537653002001546653002101566653000801587653001901595653001001614653000801624653000801632653000801640653000801648773010801656856008401764852000901848655001201857IND60770317320221207141112.0220517e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077031732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rsase.2022.1007222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaldonado, Leonardo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9400-334610aLighting-up the economic activity of oil-producing regions: A remote sensing application  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis paper explores the relationship between nighttime lights and economic activity and analyzes whether there is a different relationship in oil-producing regions versus non-oil producing regions. Oil regions may differ in how changes in lights intensity relate to variations in economic activity because the oil industry has specific features that may strongly influence institutional, financial, and political subnational frameworks. I harmonize satellite datasets of night lights to construct a panel for eight oil-producing countries with regional data from 1992 to 2019. I find differences in the predictive power of lights by region and confirm how light data could improve economic growth measures. Even in an extreme scenario in which lights have no improvement in measuring true -with no measurement errors-growth in oil regions, they still improve estimates for non-oil areas.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adata collection 3aeconomic development 3aindustry 3aoils 3apolitics 3asatellites 0aDMSP 0aEconomic growth 0aNighttime lights 0aOil 0aRemote sensing 0aVIIRS 0aC80 0aQ35 0aQ40 0aR110 tRemote sensing applications.g2022 Apr., v. 26 p.100722-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23329x2352-93857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsase.2022.1007223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01901naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001700156245013200173300001600305500001900321500002000340520072900360592002801089650001601117650001301133650000901146650001901155650001001174650001501184650001301199650001001212650001101222651002801233700002001261700001701281773011801298856009001416852000901506655001201515IND60734295420221118023550.0210417e198701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073429542DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.1987.tb00118.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBROWN, K.

Karst. were fumigated for 60 d during the summer of 1985 with four different levels of O₃. Visible injury (in the form of severe, uniform brown necrosis and shedding of affected needles) occurred after a frost in November on the older needles of three of the clones which had received over 200 μg m⁻³ of O₃ during the summer, 47 d previously. No visible injury occurred during the fumigation period or on the current (1985) year needles. It is suggested that the results provide preliminary evidence for an enhancement of frost sensitivity by O₃ which may be significant in the current wave of forest decline affecting high‐altitude forests in central Europe.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea abies 3aaltitude 3acold 3aforest decline 3afrost 3afumigation 3anecrosis 3aozone 3asummer 3aCentral European region1 aRoberts, T.

Remote sensing has been widely used for BDA. The availability of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images that are freely accessible could enhance remote sensing applications for building damage classification caused by natural disasters. The accuracy of using the two satellite images for BDA mapping in tropical regions is still uncertain. This research aims to assess Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data fusion performance for BDA mapping following the catastrophic 2018 Lombok Earthquake. Pre- and post-earthquake images of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 were selected, preprocessed, and integrated using the random forest classifier. Three data scenarios were used in this study, i.e., Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and the fusion of both datasets. The results demonstrated that all models showed excellent performance in classifying destroyed buildings compared to severely and moderately damaged buildings. This is due to the medium spatial resolution of the images could not identify the damage level in detail. Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data fusion provided the highest overall accuracy value (62.4%) compared to other single dataset models. According to the feature importance analysis result, GLCM Mean, GLCM Variance, and NIR Band played crucial roles in the damage classification. In conclusion, the fusion of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 can provide the best model for destroyed building mapping. However, severely and moderately building damaged mapping can only be accurately mapped using higher spatial resolution images.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aearthquakes 3amodels 3asatellites 3avariance 3aIndonesia 0a2018 Lombok earthquake 0aBuilding damage assessment 0aData fusion 0aSentinel-1 0aSentinel-2 0aRandom forest1 aWidyatmanti, Wirastuti1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1252-83181 aUmarhadi, Deha Agus0 tRemote sensing applications.g2022 Apr., v. 26 p.100724-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23329x2352-93857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsase.2022.1007243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01873naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245009500158300001800253520065500271592002800926650001600954650001500970650003200985650001201017650001901029650001901048650004401067650002401111651001501135700002301150700001501173700002301188700001601211700002101227773015501248856007501403852000901478655001201487IND60549823720221120163413.0160909e20150626xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054982372DNAL7 a10.1021/np500968t2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrkovic, Tanja10aLAT Transport Inhibitors from Pittosporum venulosum Identified by NMR Fingerprint Analysis  ap. 1215-1220.  a¹H NMR fingerprints were used as the guiding principle for the isolation of minor compounds related to the l-type amino acid transporter inhibitors venulosides A (1) and B (2).

Firstly, RACNs were extracted from roselle dehydrated calyxes. Secondly, SPVA aqueous solution was obtained with a mass rate of 2:1 (starch/PVA). Thirdly, the colorimetric films were fabricated by immobilizing 30, 60 and 120 mg RACNs/100 g starch into SPVA matrix with casting/solvent evaporation method. FTIR spectra of the colorimetric films showed that RACNs were successfully immobilized into the SPVA matrix. X-ray diffraction spectra and SEM micrographs indicated that the crystallinity of PVA was reduced during the film-forming process and the compatibility between starch and PVA was improved, owing to the presence of RACNs. The incorporation of RACNs led to a decrease of water content and tensile strength and an increase of elongation at break of the colorimetric films compared with the SPVA film. The color stability test showed that the colorimetric films were stable at refrigeration temperature and room temperature up to 14 days with relative color changes below than 5%. The colorimetric films with lower content of RACNs were found more sensitive towards ammonia. An application trial was conducted to monitor the freshness of silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) at refrigeration temperature. The colorimetric films presented visible color changes over time due to a variety of basic volatile amines known as total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N). Hence, these colorimetric films can be used to monitor the real-time fish freshness for intelligent packaging.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aHibiscus sabdariffa 3aHypophthalmichthys molitrix 3aX-ray diffraction 3aambient temperature 3aamines 3aammonia 3aanthocyanins 3aaqueous solutions 3acolor 3acolorimetry 3acrystal structure 3aevaporation 3afish 3afreshness 3ahydrocolloids 3amonitoring 3apackaging 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3arefrigeration 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolvents 3astarch 3atensile strength 3atotal volatile basic nitrogen 3awater content 0aColorimetric film 0aFish freshness 0aRoselle anthocyanins 0aStarch 0aPolyvinyl alcohol 0aIntelligent packaging1 aShi, Jiyong1 aXiaobo, Zou,1 aWang, Sheng1 aJiang, Caiping1 aZhang, Junjun1 aHuang, Xiaowei1 aZhang, Wen1 aHolmes, Mel0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2017 Aug., v. 69 p.308-317dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2017.02.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02852naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245017600167300001400343520132300357592002801680650001501708650001401723650001501737650002001752650001301772650000901785650004301794650001601837650001801853650000701871650001901878650002601897650002701923653000901950653000701959653000801966653001001974653000801984653000901992653002802001653003802029653002402067653000902091700001802100700001602118700001902134773007502153856008502228852000902313655001202322IND60581477820221116170734.0171005e20160301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058147782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2015.11.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChai, Weibo10aPreparation of polydopamine-coated magnetic nanoparticles for dispersive solid-phase extraction of water-soluble synthetic colorants in beverage samples with HPLC analysis  ap. 13-20.  aA facile and sensitive dispersive solid-phase extraction (D-SPE) method for the extraction and enrichment of four representative synthetic colorants prior to high performance liquid chromatography analysis was introduced. As highly efficient adsorbents, polydopamine-coated Fe3O4 nanoparticles (Fe3O4@PDA NPs) were prepared by a simple and green procedure. Several factors affecting the extraction efficiency, mainly including the polymerization time of dopamine, pH of the sample solution, the amount of adsorbent, extraction time and the desorption conditions, were systematically studied. Under the optimized conditions, the enrichment factors for the four colorants were both higher than 176. The limits of detection (LODs) for the established d-SPE-HPLC method were found to be 0.20–0.25μgL−1, which were lower than most chromatographic methods previously reported for synthetic colorant analysis. When used for quantitative analysis, wide linearity ranges (1–500μgL−1 for amaranth and Ponceau 4R, and 0.80–500μgL−1 for sunset yellow and allure red) were achieved with good correlation (R2≥0.9995).

In the mixtures of LMP and each polyuronate fraction, changes in the relative viscosity (ηr) of dilute solutions and in rheological properties of gels were examined in the presence of calcium. Different results were indicated between the pectin and the alginate fractions. The addition of the pectin fractions, regardless of its DE, increased ηr of dilute solutions and increased dynamic storage modulus (G′) of gels with showing greater effects at the lower DE. On the contrary, the addition of the alginate fractions, regardless of its M/G ratio, increased the critical threshold concentration of calcium required for the increase in ηr of dilute solutions and decreased G′ of gels with showing greater effects at the lower M/G ratio (i.e. guluronate rich). Based on the results, molecular associations of the mixtures were presented schematically to compare the functions between the pectin and the alginate fractions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalginates 3acalcium 3aesterification 3agelation 3agels 3ahydrocolloids 3amolecular weight 3apectins 3astorage modulus 3aviscosity 0aCalcium binding 0aEgg-box dimer 0aGelation 0aLow-methoxyl pectin 0aLow molecular-weight fractions1 aFunami, Takahiro1 aFang, Yapeng1 aNishinari, Katsuyoshi1 aDraget, Kurt I.1 aPhillips, Glyn O.0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2017 Aug., v. 69 p.318-328dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2016.12.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02289naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010600165300001600271520089600287592002801183650001101211650001501222650001401237650001501251650002001266650003101286650001801317650001001335650001101345650002001356650001901376650002601395650002201421650001801443650002001461700002101481700002001502700002001522700002001542700002001562700002001582773012601602856008201728852000901810655001201819IND60782885820221123031054.0220714e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078288582DNAL7 a10.1134/S10227954220701222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMinina, V.

To search for new biological markers of this pathology, the transcriptome of the blood mononuclear cells from patients and healthy donors (residents of Kemerovo oblast, Russia) was studied using SurePrint G3 Human Gene Expression microarray technology. A total of 288 differentially expressed genes were identified, including 108 up-regulated genes and 180 down-regulated genes. Functional enrichment analysis using the WebGestalt resource and different databases (Gene Ontology, KEGG, and Reactome) indicated changes in the expression profiles of genes involved in the processes of immune response, protein synthesis, cell cycle control, and apoptosis. Analysis of protein–protein interactions using the STRING algorithm made it possible to identify functional clusters of gene products with different expression levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRussia 3aalgorithms 3aapoptosis 3acell cycle 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agene ontology 3agenes 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3alung neoplasms 3amicroarray technology 3aprotein synthesis 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics1 aDruzhinin, V.

To understand the chemical structural transformations and examine the reaction mechanism, GPC and solution-state NMR techniques were performed. Element analysis was also used to quantify the amount of amine groups. The NMR characterization the depolymerized lignins indicated of the depolymerization, demethoxylation, and bond cleavage of linkages occurred during the depolymerization process. Results showed that the depolymerization temperature instead of the addition of capping reagents was the main factor for improving the reactivity of lignin under the given conditions. The Mannich reaction was very selective, primarily occurred at H3,5 and G5 positions, and the H units present a higher chemical reactivity. It is believed that the understanding of the fundamental chemistry of lignin during depolymerization and Mannich reaction process will contribute to the extension of high value-added applications of biorefinery lignin.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiorefining 3adepolymerization 3aethanol 3alignin 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3atemperature 3avalue added 0aBiorefinery technical lignins 0aAlcoholic depolymerization 0aMannich reaction1 aChen, Tian-Ying1 aWang, Hanmin,1 aLi, Han-Yin1 aLiu, Chuan-Fu1 aWen, Jia-Long0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.09.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02697naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100001200160245007100172300001800243520121600261592002801477650002101505650001801526650002101544650002101565650001601586650001601602650001401618650002401632650002201656650001201678650003801690650001101728650002901739650002801768650003501796650002801831650002001859650001401879650001601893650002401909700002201933700001701955700002401972773010501996856008102101852000902182655001202191IND4477018620221121200319.0120502e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447701862DNAL7 a219340092pmid7 a10.3382/ps.2011-016132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Y.10aNatural antibody isotypes as predictors of survival in laying hens  ap. 2263-2274.  aTo identify possible relationships between survival and titers of natural antibody (NAb) isotypes in serum of laying hens, birds from 12 purebred layer lines of 2 commercial breeds, Rhode Island Red (n = 524) and White Leghorn (n = 538), were monitored for survival during one laying period (from 20 until 70 wk of age). Titers of NAb isotype IgM- and IgG-binding keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) in serum were measured at 20, 40, and 65 wk of age, respectively. Overall, the titers of IgM and IgG binding KLH decreased with aging. At the same age, lines within breed showed significantly different titers of isotypes (P < 0.0001). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that NAb isotype IgM and IgG titers at 20 wk of age were associated with survival at 20 to 40 wk of age. In the R breed, odds ratios of 0.56 (P < 0.0001) for IgM and 0.72 (P = 0.02) for IgG were estimated; in the W breed, these were 0.74 (P < 0.01) and 0.99 (P = 0.95) for IgM and IgG, respectively. We conclude that titers of Nab isotypes, especially the IgM-binding KLH at 20 wk of age, are indicative for survival during the laying period. The higher the titers of NAb isotypes, the higher the probability of layers to survive.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhode Island Red 3aWhite Leghorn 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aimmunoglobulin M 3alaying hens 3aprobability 3apurebreds 3aregression analysis 2aAgingximmunology 2aAnimals 2aChickensximmunologyxphysiology. 2aFemale 2aHemocyaninsximmunology. 2aImmunoglobulin Gxblood 2aImmunoglobulin Isotypesxblood 2aImmunoglobulin Mxblood 2aLogistic Models 2aMortality 2aOviposition 2aSpecies Specificity1 aParmentier, H.

This ethnobotanical information was placed in a phylogenetic framework to make informed predictions in the search for new medicines and bioactive compounds. Medicinal plant-use data were mapped onto a molecular phylogeny based on DNA sequences of nuclear and chloroplast markers. Associations of medicinal uses among closely related species occurring in different geographic regions and among diverse cultures were evaluated. The most common medicinal uses for these species are those used to treat skin ailments, gastro-intestinal problems, malaria, and liver issues. The plant species with the most numerous uses is Cochlospermum tinctorium, which occurs primarily in West Africa. Closely related species being used by cultural groups in different geographic regions to treat the same illnesses suggests the presence of bioactive compounds with potential biomedical value, since they may represent independent discoveries of similar medicinally-active compounds. This leads to the speculation that those closely related species not currently being used to treat these ailments may also contain identical or similar medicinally-active compounds and are worthy of laboratory investigations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCochlospermum 3aDNA 3abioactive compounds 3achloroplasts 3aethnobotany 3ageographical distribution 3aliver 3amalaria 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3aprediction 3atraditional medicine 3aWestern Africa1 aWatson, Linda E.,0 tDiversity.g2018 Nov. 15, v. 10, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21675x1424-28187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d100401233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02638naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005500147245011800202300001600320520145400336592002801790596002201818650003901840650001401879650002301893650000901916650002301925650001401948650001401962650001301976650001101989651001002000700002202010700002502032773011702057856008102174852000902255655001202264IND60616498220221122232801.0181017e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061649822DNAL7 a10.1007/s10228-018-0638-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurase, Iki1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5326-155X10aVariation in growth performance of Ryukyu-ayu, Plecoglossus altivelis ryukyuensis, inferred from otolith analysis  ap. 482-487.  aRyukyu-ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis ryukyuensis) is an amphidromous fish species that migrates between the sea and rivers over its one-year life span. Although growth performance during the early marine stage may affect growth in the later riverine stage of this species’ life cycle, no studies have specifically examined this relationship in P. a. ryukyuensis. In the present study, we reconstructed the growth trajectories of P. a. ryukyuensis individuals collected from the Yakugachi River, Amami-Oshima Island, Japan in 2016 (n = 47) throughout their growth period in both the sea and river by using otolith analysis. Using this, we determined the age and body size of individuals at the time of their upstream migration, as well as their growth rates during the marine and riverine stages. Results showed that body size at upstream migration significantly affected body size at the riverine stage, indicating that juveniles with larger body size in the sea had better growth performance in the river. Individuals with higher growth rates during the marine stage tended to enter the river younger and at larger body sizes than those with lower marine growth rates. Our results demonstrated the close linkage between the growth performance in the sea and in rivers of P. a. ryukyuensis. This information will contribute to better understanding variations in growth patterns of this endangered species and potentially aid in its conservation.  aPublisher supplied data  a15K07538cKAKENHI 3aPlecoglossus altivelis ryukyuensis 3abody size 3aendangered species 3afish 3agrowth performance 3ajuveniles 3alongevity 3aotoliths 3arivers 3aJapan1 aKawakami, Tatsuya1 aIguchi, Kei’ichiro0 tIchthyological research.g2018 Nov., v. 65, no. 4 p.482-487dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl4124684x1341-89987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10228-018-0638-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02756naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245009400170300001400264520154700278592002801825650001101853650000901864650001601873650001101889650001701900650001601917650002401933650002201957650002501979650001502004651001102019653000902030653001402039653001602053653001002069653002502079700001802104700002002122773008702142856008402229852000902313655001202322IND60565131720221119142932.0170320e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056513172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2015.10.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrasnov, Helena10aIncrease in dust storm related PM10 concentrations: A time series analysis of 2001–2015  ap. 36-42.  aOver the last decades, changes in dust storms characteristics have been observed in different parts of the world. The changing frequency of dust storms in the southeastern Mediterranean has led to growing concern regarding atmospheric PM10 levels. A classic time series additive model was used in order to describe and evaluate the changes in PM10 concentrations during dust storm days in different cities in Israel, which is located at the margins of the global dust belt. The analysis revealed variations in the number of dust events and PM10 concentrations during 2001–2015. A significant increase in PM10 concentrations was identified since 2009 in the arid city of Beer Sheva, southern Israel. Average PM10 concentrations during dust days before 2009 were 406, 312, and 364 μg m−3 (median 337, 269,302) for Beer Sheva, Rehovot (central Israel) and Modi'in (eastern Israel), respectively. After 2009 the average concentrations in these cities during dust storms were 536, 466, and 428 μg m−3 (median 382, 335, 338), respectively. Regression analysis revealed associations between PM10 variations and seasonality, wind speed, as well as relative humidity. The trends and periodicity are stronger in the southern part of Israel, where higher PM10 concentrations are found. Since 2009 dust events became more extreme with much higher daily and hourly levels. The findings demonstrate that in the arid area variations of dust storms can be quantified easier through PM10 levels over a relatively short time scale of several years.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3adust 3adust storms 3amodels 3aparticulates 3aperiodicity 3aregression analysis 3arelative humidity 3atime series analysis 3awind speed 3aIsrael 0aPM10 0aArid zone 0aDust storms 0aTrend 0aTime series analysis1 aKatra, Itzhak1 aFriger, Michael0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2016 June, v. 213 p.36-42dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2015.10.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02817naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245005800165300001600223520144600239536010801685592002801793650001801821650001701839650002201856650000901878650001601887650001401903650001101917650001301928650001801941650001601959650002501975653000802000653002002008653003502028653001502063653002102078653001202099700002002111700002502131773011402156856008002270852000902350655001202359IND60623882520221122035223.0181129e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062388252DNAL7 a10.1177/08987564166893482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMele, Rocco E.10aDental Implants and Incisor Bridge Placement in a Dog  ap. 249-258.  aVeterinary dentistry has tended to follow the trends and advancements in the human dental field. As for any procedure performed on a patient, whether human or animal, an informed decision is based on the available evidence regarding treatment options. This is certainly true for the more involved treatments in veterinary dentistry which can include the disciplines of endodontics and dental implantology. A number of published case reports have been accepted by the specialty that endodontic therapy is indeed a predictable and a valuable service that can be offered to pet owners. Oral implantology has become an accepted and predictable procedure in the human dental field and can now be offered to pet owners if performed by suitable trained veterinary clinicians. The success rate for endosseous implant osseointegration is very high in humans. Success rates are also very high in animals used for implantology research. Canine studies have shown good bone-to-implant contact of around 73% in osseointegrated endosseous implants based on histological sections. Radiographic and histological findings demonstrate stable alveolar crestal bone levels after loading endosseous implants for up to 12 months in a dog model. This article discusses use of dental implants in the rostral mandible of a companion dog to replace periodontally diseased incisors, their restoration, to return the animal to full dental function and 3-year follow-up.  aFunding The author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or authorship of this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3acase studies 3adental prosthesis 3adogs 3aendodontics 3ahistology 3ahumans 3apatients 3apet ownership 3aradiography 3aveterinary dentistry 0adog 0adental implants 0aveterinary dental implantology 0aendosseous 0aosseointegration 0aincisor1 aCaiafa, Anthony1 aKurtzman, Gregori M.0 tJournal of veterinary dentistry.g, v. 33, no. 4 p.249-258dSAGE PublicationswJournal:26868x2470-40837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/08987564166893483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02733naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245019200171506011700363506007600480520091700556592002801473506003701501650003001538650001401568650000801582650001301590650002501603650002301628650001601651650001301667650001301680650001701693650001301710650000901723650001301732650001401745650001501759653004201774653002401816653002601840653003601866700002601902700002201928700002001950700002001970700001901990773010202009856008302111852000902194655001202203IND60750989120221207055200.0220531e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075098912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.btre.2021.e006752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCantabella, Daniel10aOptimization of a food industry-waste-based medium for the production of the plant growth promoting microorganism Pseudomonas oryzihabitans PGP01 based on agro-food industries by-products  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn this study, three wastes based on potato peels and pulps, tomato seeds and wheat bran were used as basis for the preparation of a cheap medium to produce the bacterium P. oryzihabitans PGP01.

Three boreholes, taken at water depths from 5 to 14m, spanning about the last 1Ma, and a set of modern sediment samples used as modern analogue, were utilized for reconstructing palaeoenvironments and palaeobathymetry. The palaeoenvironmental data were used for assessing tectonic activity of the Carmel Fault, a branch of the Dead Sea transform that bounds the southern side of the bay. Quantitative analyses showed four biofacies: a fresh to brackish wetland environment, and three progressively deepening marine biofacies. Relative water depth ranges were estimated using changes in benthic foraminiferal assemblages, presence or absence of Ammonia sp. 1, and the percentage of planktonic foraminifera.The distribution of the biofacies suggests water depths no deeper than 15m during most interglacial stages, water depths to 15–40m during short transgressive phases of MIS 5.5, 7, 11 and 13, and water depth reaching 40–80m in the earliest transgressive phases (MIS 27? and MIS 29?). The environmental conditions on both sides of the fault were quite similar along the succession. This suggests that the movements of the uplifted and down-faulted blocks have more or less coincided since about 1Ma.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRetaria 3aenvironmental factors 3apaleoecology 3aplankton 3aquantitative analysis 3asediments 3atectonics 3awetlands 3aIsrael 0aBenthic foraminifera 0aQuaternary 0aPalaeobathymetry 0aInner shelf 0aCarmel fault 0aEastern Mediterranean1 aAlmogi-Labin, Ahuva1 aSandler, Amir1 aSivan, Dorit0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2013 Sept. 15, v. 386 p.512-530dElsevier B.V.x0031-01827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2013.06.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03010naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100001600167245006000183300001400243520152700257592002801784650002701812650002901839650002001868650001001888650001101898650001201909650002101921650001201942650001601954650002101970650001801991650002302009650002002032650001102052650002702063650002802090650001602118650003102134650003402165700001802199700002802217700001702245700001602262700001802278700001402296773007902310856008202389852000902471655001202480IND60098905920221116151650.0141105e20110415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009890592DNAL7 a212779572pmid7 a10.1016/j.gene.2010.12.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDarvish, H.10aExceptional human core promoter nucleotide compositions  ap. 79-86.  aThe proximal promoter sequences contain basic motifs for the expression of the downstream genes. We present genome-scale computational analyses of the 120-bp immediate upstream sequences to the +1 transcription start sites (TSSs) of 10,117 human protein-coding genes, and unravel exceptional genes in respect with the core promoter nucleotide composition. Our data reveal that while in 99% of the genes the absolute purine/pyrimidine ratio ranges between 0.2 and 2.5, certain genes show exceptional skew in this balance (e.g. ratios of 82.3 in VWA3A, 61.5 in Sox5, and 24.0 in BRWD3), and consist of islands of purines or pyrimidines. Furthermore, while over 95% of the genes lack more than one short tandem repeat (STR) in their core promoters, certain gene promoters are exceptionally rich in multiple STRs (e.g. eight consecutive STRs in UBE2QL1, and six STRs in GRIA2). We found sequence bias for the majority of those promoters across species, supporting functional roles for them in gene expression. Genes downstream to those promoters were also found to be of ontologic importance (i.e. we were able to track the majority of those genes to the lower species such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Caenorhabditis elegans). The exceptional promoters presented in this study lack the conventional motifs for the TATA, and TATA-less promoters, hence offering novel mechanisms for gene expression. They may also provide potential mechanisms for inter-individual variations in gene expression, and complex traits/disorders.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahumans 3aislands 3apromoter regions 3apurines 3apyrimidines 2aBase Composition 2aBase Sequence 2aConserved Sequence 2aGene Expression 2aHumans 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNucleotides 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic. 2aTranscription Initiation Site1 aNabi, M.

Although the flooding treatments resulted in low redox potentials and high concentrations of reduced iron and manganese in the soil, the growth of C. flacca plants was little affected by flooding. All populations grew equally well on the flooded soils. All populations produced adventitious roots at the soil surface in the flooded treatments; these were absent from plants grown on the freely drained soil. Flooding produced an increase in the manganese concentration of roots and shoots but, although the iron content of roots was markedly increased by flooding, there was no increased transport to the shoots. In view of the absence of detectable phenotypic differentiation between these populations from widely contrasting sites and their unimpaired growth on severely waterlogged soils, it is argued that C. flacca plants have a broad tolerance (phenotypic flexibility) of soil flooding. This may be important in the wide ecological amplitude of this species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarex 3adrainage 3airon 3amanganese 3aphenotype 3asoil1 aDAVIES, M.

CK contains a pair of highly conserved amino acids (H66 and D326) which might play an important role in sustaining the compact structure of CK by linking its N- and C- terminal domains; however the mechanism is still unclear. In this study, spectroscopic, structural modeling and protein folding experiments suggested that D326A, H66P and H66P/D326A mutations led to disruption of the hydrogen bond between those two amino acid residues and form the partially unfolded state which made it easier to be inactivated and unfolded under environmental stresses, and more prone to form insoluble aggregates. The formation of insoluble aggregates would decrease levels of active CKs which may provide clues in CK deficiency disease. Moreover, these results indicated that the degree of synergism had closely relationship to the conformational changes of CK. Thus, our results provided clues for understanding the mechanism of amino acid residues outside the active site in regulating substrate synergism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3aadenosine diphosphate 3aamino acids 3acreatine kinase 3aenergy metabolism 3ahydrogen bonding 3amodels 3amutation 3aphosphocreatine 3aprotein folding 3aspectroscopy 3asynergism 3avertebrates 0aCreatine kinase 0aSubstrate synergism 0aStructural stability1 aWei, Fang1 aZhu, Yuan-Yuan1 aTong, Yu-Xue1 aCao, Jiang1 aZhou, Ping1 aLi, Zhen-Yu1 aZeng, Ling-Yu1 aLi, Feng1 aWang, Xiao-Yun1 aXu, Kai-Lin0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.09.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03835naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006700150245010400217300001600321520218000337592002802517650001502545650002302560650001502583650000902598650001402607650001402621650001102635650001502646650001002661650001402671650001202685650001102697650001302708650002402721650001302745650000902758650001202767650001502779650001402794653001402808653002502822653001202847653001402859653001602873653001702889700001702906700001802923700001602941700002302957700002302980773016003003856008503163852000903248655001203257IND60770318120221118125237.0220517e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077031812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnesp.2022.02.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeñalva-Arigita, Amaya1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5165-534410aDifferences in the use of food textures in oropharyngeal dysphagia according to the place of living  ap. 196-201.  aModifying solid/liquid foods is the main treatment in oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD).

Randomized patients from NDU-database followed throughout 2018 (4 calls-interviews/year). Variables; age, diagnostic, gender, residence type: Home(H)/Nursing Home(NH), thickener manager (patient, family member or caregiver), education, days with commercial thickener (CT), thickener regimen established by Volume/Viscosity test: nectar (N), honey (HY), pudding (P), type of diets; measured by FOIS scale and texture; pureed (PD); soft (SD); mixed (P&S/D); regular (RD), risk foods consumption (RFC), complete diet intake (CI), changes in; diets, intake and RFC. Analysed 204 patients, aged 85 years; (IQR: 78–90), from which 57.8% were women. Residence: 43.6% H/56.4% NH. Days with CT median 380 days (IQR: 153–682). A proper viscosity guideline was indicated in 168 patients: N 37.3%, HY 20.6% and P 24.5%. In 36 patients (17.5%) there were no indications, 75% of them coming from primary care. Despite this, 184 patients (90%) referred a concrete indication; N 35.8%, HY 26% and P 28.4%. The concordance between indicated and referred viscosity was significantly higher at H (Kappa 0.798) compared to NH (Kappa 0.428), p < 0.0001. FOIS: 65.7% followed the total oral diet of a single consistency. Diet textures: PD 66.7%, SD 2.9%, P&S/D 21.1%, RD 9.3%. Difference in PD given in NH 86.1% vs H 41.6%, p < 0.001. Under N viscosity different diet distributions, PD 28.6%H vs 71% NH, p < 0.05. CI in 66.7% with no difference among NH/H. RFC similar but higher consumption of jellies at NH, p < 0.001. According to this study the place of living determines a better approach to OD treatment. Viscosity and diet texture are more restricted in NH with worse compliance of indicated regimens. Increasing variety in diets and reassessment of OD treatment is desirable.  aPublisher supplied data 3acaregivers 3aclinical nutrition 3acompliance 3adiet 3adysphagia 3aeducation 3agender 3aguidelines 3ahoney 3ahospitals 3aliquids 3anectar 3apatients 3aprospective studies 3apuddings 3arisk 3atexture 3athickeners 3aviscosity 0aDysphagia 0aCommercial thickener 0aTexture 0aViscosity 0aPureed diet 0aNursing home1 aLecha, Maria1 aSansano, Anna1 aPrats, Rosa1 aBascuñana, Helena1 aVila, L.q(Lluis),0 tClinical nutrition ESPEN.g2022 Apr., v. 48 p.196-201dElsevier LtdaEuropean Society for Clinical Nutrition and MetabolismwJournal:23538x2405-45777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnesp.2022.02.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03104naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001500188245010500203300001600308500001900324506007600343520158400419592002802003506003702031650002602068650001702094650001602111650002302127650001502150650002402165650001402189650002102203650000902224650001202233650002402245650001702269651001202286651001102298700002202309700001502331700001802346700002002364773013602384856008102520852000902601655001202610IND60650509220221207100214.0190710e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065050922DNAL7 a10.1017/S00218596170007882doi7 aPMC61995472pmcid7 a303696282pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLalić, B.10aSeasonal forecasting of green water components and crop yields of winter wheat in Serbia and Austria  ap. 645-657.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA probabilistic crop forecast based on ensembles of crop model output (CMO) estimates offers a myriad of possible realizations and probabilistic forecasts of green water components (precipitation and evapotranspiration), crop yields and green water footprints (GWFs) on monthly or seasonal scales. The present paper presents part of the results of an ongoing study related to the application of ensemble forecasting concepts for agricultural production. The methodology used to produce the ensemble CMO using the ensemble seasonal weather forecasts as the crop model input meteorological data without the perturbation of initial soil or crop conditions is presented and tested for accuracy, as are its results. The selected case study is for winter wheat growth in Austria and Serbia during the 2006–2014 period modelled with the SIRIUS crop model. The historical seasonal forecasts for a 6-month period (1 March-31 August) were collected for the period 2006–2014 and were assimilated from the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecast and the Meteorological Archival and Retrieval System. The seasonal ensemble forecasting results obtained for winter wheat phenology dynamics, yield and GWF showed a narrow range of estimates. These results indicate that the use of seasonal weather forecasting in agriculture and its applications for probabilistic crop forecasting can optimize field operations (e.g., soil cultivation, plant protection, fertilizing, irrigation) and takes advantage of the predictions of crop development and yield a few weeks or months in advance.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagricultural sciences 3acase studies 3acrop models 3aevapotranspiration 3airrigation 3ameteorological data 3aphenology 3aplant protection 3asoil 3atillage 3aweather forecasting 3awinter wheat 3aAustria 3aSerbia1 aFiranj Sremac, A.1 aDekić, L.1 aEitzinger, J.1 aPeris̆ić, D.,0 tJournal of agricultural science.g2018 July, v. 156, no. 5 p.645-657dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl46135x1469-51467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00218596170007883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03088naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245011200167520184400279592002802123650001302151650001402164650001502178650002102193650001902214650001302233650001202246650001402258650001302272650001702285653002002302653002502322653002002347700001602367700001602383700005702399700002002456773010602476856008702582852000902669655001202678IND60741870120221118053152.0210813e20211005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074187012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1270152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLei, Sihua10aFabrication and chain corrosion blocking mechanism of hydrophobic coating on electrolytic manganese surface  aDue to its unique polyvalence characteristics, electrolytic manganese without passivation treatment will produce obvious chain corrosion reaction, so blocking the chain corrosion reaction is particularly important for electrolytic manganese industry. The SS (sodium stearate) coating used in this work improves the stability of Mn²⁺ by combining with Mn²⁺ on the surface of electrolytic manganese, thus inhibiting the transition of Mn²⁺ to a higher valence state, and realizing the effective blocking of manganese chain corrosion reaction. In addition, the coating has good hydrophobicity and can be used as an effective barrier against corrosive media on the surface of electrolytic manganese. The corrosion resistance of the coating is optimized by studying the influence factors such as SS concentration, immersion time, immersion temperature and drying temperature. The structure, properties and passivation liquid properties of the coating are analyzed by various characterization methods and electrochemical tests. The results show that the SS coating not only has good corrosion resistance and hydrophobicity, but also exhibits good stability, corrosion resistance strength and durability. The corrosion current density is reduced from 3.782 × 10⁻⁴ A/cm² of bare manganese to 1.592 × 10⁻⁷ A/cm². Even compared with chromium salt, SS coating shows better corrosion resistance. In this paper, single component SS passivating agent is used to prepare hydrophobic coating on the surface of electrolytic manganese, without using organic solvent or adding promoting solvent, and the passivation method is simple and easy to operate, which has important practical application value. It is also of great significance to prepare hydrophobic coating on the surface of electrolytic manganese or other metals or alloys.  aPublisher supplied data 3achromium 3acorrosion 3adurability 3aelectrochemistry 3ahydrophobicity 3aindustry 3aliquids 3amanganese 3asolvents 3astearic acid 0aSodium stearate 0aCorrosion resistance 0aChain corrosion1 aWang, Shuai1 aZhong, Hong1 aCao, Zhanfang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2257-25821 aHuang, Xiaoping0 tColloids and surfaces.g2021 Oct. 05, v. 626 p.127015-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1270153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03341naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245012900165506002800294506003200322520168100354592002802035596006602063506003702129650004902166650001902215650001702234650001402251650001702265650001202282650001402294650001402308650001702322650001902339650001002358650002202368650001302390650001402403650001302417650001702430650001002447650001502457650001202472700002002484700002102504700002402525700002002549700002502569773011902594856007702713852000902790655001202799IND60707854020221207112014.0200821e20200807xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070785402DNAL7 a10.3390/genes110809062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIorizzo, Massimo 10aCarrot Anthocyanins Genetics and Genomics: Status and Perspectives to Improve Its Application for the Food Colorant Industry  aResource is Open Access  aMDPI AG License Information  aPurple or black carrots (Daucus carota ssp. sativus var. atrorubens Alef) are characterized by their dark purple- to black-colored roots, owing their appearance to high anthocyanin concentrations. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the use of black carrot anthocyanins as natural food dyes. Black carrot roots contain large quantities of mono-acylated anthocyanins, which impart a measure of heat-, light- and pH-stability, enhancing the color-stability of food products over their shelf-life. The genetic pathway controlling anthocyanin biosynthesis appears well conserved among land plants; however, different variants of anthocyanin-related genes between cultivars results in tissue-specific accumulations of purple pigments. Thus, broad genetic variations of anthocyanin profile, and tissue-specific distributions in carrot tissues and organs, can be observed, and the ratio of acylated to non-acylated anthocyanins varies significantly in the purple carrot germplasm. Additionally, anthocyanins synthesis can also be influenced by a wide range of external factors, such as abiotic stressors and/or chemical elicitors, directly affecting the anthocyanin yield and stability potential in food and beverage applications. In this study, we critically review and discuss the current knowledge on anthocyanin diversity, genetics and the molecular mechanisms controlling anthocyanin accumulation in carrots. We also provide a view of the current knowledge gaps and advancement needs as regards developing and applying innovative molecular tools to improve the yield, product performance and stability of carrot anthocyanin for use as a natural food colorant.  aPublisher supplied data  cEconomic Research Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000091750 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDaucus carota subsp. sativus var. atrorubens 3aabiotic stress 3aanthocyanins 3abeverages 3abiosynthesis 3acarrots 3acultivars 3aelicitors 3aembryophytes 3afood colorants 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3agenomics 3agermplasm 3aindustry 3apH stability 3aroots 3ashelf life 3atissues1 aCuraba, Julien 1 aPottorff, Marti 1 aFerruzzi, Mario G.,1 aSimon, Philipp 1 aCavagnaro, Pablo  F.0 tGenes.g2020 Aug. 07, v. 11, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes110809063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03410naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003400148245012600182300001800308520170200326592002802028596005802056650002702114650002502141650001402166650000902180650002202189650002002211650001602231650001802247650001302265650001502278650001602293650001702309650001202326650001402338650001302352650001502365650001702380650002002397650002302417650002502440700006102465700002202526700003002548700001802578700002202596700002102618773013702639856008302776852000902859655001202868IND60711258520221119154642.0220312e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071125852DNAL7 a10.1007/s00394-019-02133-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConde-Aguilera, José Alberto10aSkeletal muscle proteome of piglets is affected in a muscle-dependent manner by a limiting total sulfur amino acid supply  ap. 2939-2951.  aPURPOSE: A total sulfur amino acid (TSAA) deficient diet can affect the amino acid composition of skeletal muscles. However, it is unknown how the different muscle proteins are affected by the TSAA deficiency. METHODS: The proteomic profiles of the fast-twitch glycolytic longissimus (LM) and the slow-twitch oxidative rhomboideus (RM) muscles were compared in 42-day-old piglets fed either a 28% deficient (TSAA−) or a sufficient (TSAA+) diet in TSAA for 10 days. Differentially regulated proteins were identified and submitted to Gene Ontology Pathways Analysis to identify biological processes affected by TSAA deficiency. RESULTS: A total of 36 proteins in LM and 24 proteins in RM differed in abundance between the two dietary treatments. In both muscles, an increased oxidative energy metabolism was observed in TSAA− piglets. However, a greater mitochondrial oxidation of pyruvate generated from glycolysis was observed in LM of TSAA− piglets, whereas fatty acid β-oxidation and glycogen sparing were favored in RM. This suggests a muscle-specific reorientation of energy metabolism in response to a TSAA− deficiency. In both muscles, the protein abundance and enzyme activity of superoxide dismutase were increased in TSAA− piglets. Other enzymes involved in antioxidant defense, heat shock proteins coping with cellular stress, and annexins involved in the regulation of apoptosis were generally found to be more expressed in the LM of TSAA− piglets, with no or minor changes in RM. CONCLUSIONS: Skeletal muscle proteome in young growing piglets was modulated in a muscle-dependent manner by a deficient TSAA supply, with accentuated changes in fast-twitch glycolytic muscle.  aPublisher supplied data  aRhodimet Research Grant 2010cAdisseo S.A.S.

This study evaluated the effect of LCKD in weight reduction compared to the LCLF diet among Omani obese adults. This prospective cohort study was conducted at the National Diabetes and Endocrine Centre (NDEC), Royal Hospital, Muscat, Oman, between 2015 and 2017. We included 200 (100 in each group) obese patient with Body Mass Index (BMI) more than 30kg/m2, who attended the outpatient department and met the inclusion criteria were enrolled in the study for six months follow-up. Anthropometric, biochemical and clinical data was gathered before starting the diet. Follow-up outcomes included reduction in weight, fat mass and visceral fat, lipid profile and HbA1c. Data were analysed using SPSS-24. The LCKD group showed a significant reduction of 13.0 kg (95% CI: 11.0–15.1) in body weight compared to 4.7 kg (95% CI: 3.4–5.9) in the LCLF group with p-value<0.001. LCKD group showed a significant reduction of 4.0% (95% CI: 3.3–4.7) in fat mass, compared to 1.4% (95% CI: 0.83–1.9) in the LCLF group with p-value<0.001. In addition, LCKD group showed a significant reduction of 2.5L (95% CI: 2.0–2.9, P < 0.001) in visceral fat compared to 1.2L (95% CI: 0.86–1.56) P < 0.001) in the LCLF group with p-value<0.001. Combined with significant reduction in HbA1c with 0.69% (95% CI: 0.5–0.89, P < 0.001) in LCKD and a reduction of 0.74% (95% CI: 0.47–1.2, P < 0.001) in LCLF. Furthermore, this diet has not increased lipid profile with a mean reduction of 0.19 mmol/L (95% CI: 0.003–0.37, P < 0.001) in total cholesterol and mean change of 0.04 mmol/L (95% CI: 0.12–0.21) in LDL level. In addition, it has not increased uric acid with a mean reduction of 20.8 umol/L (95% CI: 4.8–36.7), (P = 0.01). LCKD seems superior to LCLF in weight, fat mass and visceral fat reduction. In addition, this diet does not increase serum cholesterol and uric acid, which encourage the use of this diet in obesity management.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3abody mass index 3acholesterol 3aclinical nutrition 3acohort studies 3adiabetes 3ahospitals 3aketogenic diet 3alipid composition 3alow fat diet 3aobesity 3apatients 3auric acid 3avisceral fat 3aweight loss 3aOman 0aLow carb ketogenic diet 0aLow calorie low fat 0aFat mass 0aVisceral fat 0aMuscle mass 0aObesity1 aAlrawahi, Abdul Hakeem1 aAl Busaidi, Noor1 aAl Githi, Muna Said1 aAl Jabri, Khadija1 aAl Balushi, Fatma1 aRonquillo-Talara, Rhoda1 aAl Balushi, Sajda1 aWaly, Mostafa0 tClinical nutrition ESPEN.g2022 June, v. 49 p.522-528dElsevier LtdaEuropean Society for Clinical Nutrition and MetabolismwJournal:23538x2405-45777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnesp.2022.02.1103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03078naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245009000168520167300258592002801931650001301959650001501972650000801987650002701995650002302022650001302045650001002058650001202068650001902080650000902099650002002108650001602128650001602144653002702160653002502187653001602212653002502228653002402253653002502277700001702302700001502319700001802334700001302352700001702365773010602382856008702488852000902575655001202584IND60741870220221118053652.0210813e20211005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074187022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1270162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiu, Jingqi10aBio-inspired zwitterionic copolymers for antifouling surface and oil-water separation  aInspired by marine mussels, dopamine chemistry was widely used in the field of surface chemistry as an adhesion base for the synthesis of antifouling coatings. Zwitterions have antifouling properties due to their special structures and are widely used in the medical implants, drug delivery, and separation membranes. We combined the catecholic derivative dopamine methacrylamide (DMA) and the zwitterionic monomer 2-methacryloyloxyethylphosphocholine (MPC) to design copolymers with both adhesion property and antifouling property for surface modification. The synthesized P(DMA-co-MPC) copolymers could adsorbed on the substrate surfaces with DMA as anchor by a “grafting to” method. The differences in surface wettability, antifouling property and oil-water separation performance of the copolymer modified surfaces were investigated. It is demonstrated that copolymer-modified substrates have excellent antifouling performance in resistance to protein adsorption and repelling oil attachment, due to its hydrophilic surface in air and the oleophobic surface underwater. Higher MPC content in copolymer would enhance the repulsive force between polymer surface and the colloid probe in water. By using P(DMA-co-MPC)-modified stainless steel mesh and non-woven fabric as separation membranes, n-hexane/water mixture could be successfully separated with an efficiency above 97%. The P(DMA-co-MPC) copolymer modified stainless steel mesh possessed good applicability, sustainable recycling and harsh conditions resistance. Additionally, oil-water separation efficiency would be pronounced by modifying the stainless steel mesh in a basic or salty polymer solution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aadsorption 3aair 3aantifouling activities 3acomposite polymers 3adopamine 3adrugs 3afabrics 3ahydrophilicity 3aoils 3astainless steel 3awettability 3azwitterions 0aBio-inspired copolymer 0aZwitterionic polymer 0aGrafting-to 0aSurface modification 0aAntifouling surface 0aOil-water separation1 aWang, Hanhan1 aChen, Jiao1 aChen, Xueqian1 aHan, Xia1 aLiu, Honglai0 tColloids and surfaces.g2021 Oct. 05, v. 626 p.127016-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1270163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01798naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245009000171300001800261520062600279592002800905650001300933650002500946650001700971650001700988650002501005650001201030650001301042650001301055650002001068700002001088700002401108700002101132700002101153773015501174856008601329852000901415655001201424IND60549824420221120131953.0160909e20150724xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054982442DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jnatprod.5b000552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKinoshita, Kaoru10aBiosynthesis of Panaefluoroline B from the Cultured Mycobiont of Amygdalaria panaeola  ap. 1745-1747.  aPanaefluoroline B (2) is a fluorescent yellowish-green pigment produced by the cultured mycobiont of a lichen, Amygdalaria panaeola. Panaefluoroline B (2) has an isoquinoline skeleton, a C₅ unit, and an amino acid, glycine, in its structure. The biosynthetic pathway of 2 was revealed by feeding experiments using [1-¹³C]-sodium acetate and [1,2-¹³C₂][¹⁵N]-glycine. The analysis of labeling patterns of 2 and its mass spectrum suggested the isoquinoline part is biosynthesized via the acetate–malonate pathway with glycine as the nitrogen source and that the C₅ unit originates from the mevalonate pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3afluorescence 3aglycine (amino acid) 3alichens 3anitrogen 3apigments 3astable isotopes1 aFukumaru, Mirei1 aYamamoto, Yoshikazu1 aKoyama, Kiyotaka1 aTakahashi, Kunio0 tJournal of natural products.g2015 July 24, v. 78, no. 7 p.1745-1747dAmerican Chemical Society and American Society of Pharmacognosyx1520-60257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jnatprod.5b000553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01428naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245007900164300001800243520047600261592002800737650002100765650001800786650001600804650001600820650001100836650000900847700002000856773015500876856008601031852000901117655001201126IND60549824520221120143245.0160909e20150724xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054982452DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jnatprod.5b001002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Dan13aAn Isoflavone from Leiophyllum buxifolium and Its Antiproliferative Effect  ap. 1748-1751.  aA new C-methylisoflavone, isosideroxylin (1), and a known C-methylflavone, sideroxylin (2), were isolated from the EtOAc extract of the leaves of Leiophyllum buxifolium.

Therefore, alternate furrow irrigation can be used as water saving irrigation (WSI) and a controlling measure of groundwater N contamination. The objectives of this investigation were to evaluate the effect of ordinary furrow irrigation (OFI), variable alternate furrow irrigation (VAFI) and fixed alternate furrow irrigation (FAFI) and different N application rates (0, 100, 200, and 300kgha⁻¹) on rapeseed yield and yield quality, drainage water, N leaching, uptake and N use efficiency. Results indicated that in terms of seed yield the VAFI is superior to FAFI and it is equivalent to the full irrigation (OFI). Therefore, VAFI is a water saving irrigation in the study region (25% reduction in water use) even under drought conditions with 175mm of rainfall occurred mostly in winter. Furthermore, based on the seed yield, nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and water use efficiency (WUE), it was concluded that VAFI with 200kgNha⁻¹ is appropriate irrigation and N fertilizer management for rapeseed in the study region. However, based on the seed oil, protein yields, oil yield based WUE and apparent N recovery, VAFI with 300kgNha⁻¹ is best treatment. Leaching during the growing season could be reduced by using VAFI especially under conditions with low rainfall in winter. Only in FAFI, N uptake decreased and soil residual N was increased as compared with OFI and VAFI. Thus, in order to avoid N losses, the amount of N fertilizer should be reduced in proportion to the amount of soil water available for plant water uptake under water saving irrigation (VAFI).  aPublisher supplied data 3adrainage water 3afertilizer rates 3afurrow irrigation 3agroundwater contamination 3agrowing season 3airrigation rates 3airrigation water 3aleaching 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anutrient use efficiency 3aplant available water 3aseed oils 3aseed yield 3asemiarid zones 3awater conservation 3awater uptake 3awater use efficiency1 aTafteh, Arash0 tAgricultural water management.g2012 Sept., v. 112 p.55-62dElsevier B.V.x0378-37747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2012.06.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04095naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245019900163300001500362520214400377592002802521650001202549650002502561650002302586650001502609650001102624650001702635650002102652650001402673650001602687650001902703650002002722650001802742650001402760650001002774650001102784650001402795650002202809650001102831650001302842650001402855650001902869650001202888650001302900650001402913650001402927650002502941650001302966650001602979650001302995650001903008653001903027653001303046653001403059653004103073653002503114653002303139700001903162700002603181700002103207773009103228856008103319852000903400655001203409IND60544778020221120192953.0160901e20150623xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054477802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2015.03.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTolu, Julie10aHigh-throughput characterization of sediment organic matter by pyrolysis–gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and multivariate curve resolution: A promising analytical tool in (paleo)limnology  ap. 93-102.  aMolecular-level chemical information about organic matter (OM) in sediments helps to establish the sources of OM and the prevalent degradation/diagenetic processes, both essential for understanding the cycling of carbon (C) and of the elements associated with OM (toxic trace metals and nutrients) in lake ecosystems. Ideally, analytical methods for characterizing OM should allow high sample throughput, consume small amounts of sample and yield relevant chemical information, which are essential for multidisciplinary, high-temporal resolution and/or large spatial scale investigations. We have developed a high-throughput analytical method based on pyrolysis–gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and automated data processing to characterize sedimentary OM in sediments. Our method consumes 200μg of freeze-dried and ground sediment sample. Pyrolysis was performed at 450°C, which was found to avoid degradation of specific biomarkers (e.g., lignin compounds, fresh carbohydrates/cellulose) compared to 650°C, which is in the range of temperatures commonly applied for environmental samples. The optimization was conducted using the top ten sediment samples of an annually resolved sediment record (containing 16–18% and 1.3–1.9% of total carbon and nitrogen, respectively). Several hundred pyrolytic compound peaks were detected of which over 200 were identified, which represent different classes of organic compounds (i.e., n-alkanes, n-alkenes, 2-ketones, carboxylic acids, carbohydrates, proteins, other N compounds, (methoxy)phenols, (poly)aromatics, chlorophyll and steroids/hopanoids). Technical reproducibility measured as relative standard deviation of the identified peaks in triplicate analyses was 5.5±4.3%, with 90% of the RSD values within 10% and 98% within 15%. Finally, a multivariate calibration model was calculated between the pyrolytic degradation compounds and the sediment depth (i.e., sediment age), which is a function of degradation processes and changes in OM source type. This allowed validation of the Py–GC/MS dataset against fundamental processes involved in OM cycling in aquatic ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkanes 3aanalytical chemistry 3aaquatic ecosystems 3abiomarkers 3acarbon 3acarbon cycle 3acarboxylic acids 3acellulose 3achlorophyll 3achromatography 3adata collection 3afreeze drying 3ahopanoids 3alakes 3alignin 3alimnology 3amass spectrometry 3amodels 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3aorganic matter 3aphenols 3aproteins 3apyrolysis 3asediments 3astatistical analysis 3asteroids 3atemperature 3atoxicity 3atrace elements 0aOrganic matter 0aSediment 0aPyrolysis 0aGas chromatography/mass spectrometry 0aChemometric analyses 0aSub-mg sample mass1 aGerber, Lorenz1 aBoily, Jean-François1 aBindler, Richard0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2015 June 23, v. 880 p.93-102dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2015.03.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02800naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245006700165300001600232520158900248536014901837592002801986650001302014650001202027650004002039650001202079650004302091650002202134650001302156650001902169650001702188650001002205700002202215773011202237856008002349852000902429655001202438IND60625005320221119120537.0181206e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062500532DNAL7 a10.1177/01457217135046282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeade, Lisa T.10aOptimizing Insulin Pump TherapybA Quality Improvement Project  ap. 841-847.  aThe purpose of the study was to assess insulin pump use and provide ongoing education. A quality improvement project using a pump assessment questionnaire was implemented at an endocrinology office in the southeastern United States. The questionnaire was designed to evaluate all aspects of insulin pump therapy, including pump operations, infusion set failure, management of acute complications, and usage of advanced device features. Eighty-nine patients (80% with type 1 diabetes and 20% with type 2 diabetes) completed the questionnaire at the endocrinology practice. A certified diabetes educator reviewed the questions with each patient, identifying deficiencies and training opportunities. The most common areas of deficiency identified after implementation of the assessment form included the following: expired or no basal insulin prescription in the event of pump failure or removal, no mupirocin (Bactroban®, GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina) prescription for suspected site infections, lack of insulin syringe if pump stopped working, failure to check urine ketones, no antiemetic prescription for sick day intervention, using manual bolus instead of bolus calculator, and lack of in-date glucagon kit. Use of a pump assessment questionnaire allows for focused discussion concerning patient behaviors related to pump operations, troubleshooting, and self-management. Incorporating use of a pump assessment questionnaire into routine practice may result in improved patient education and avoidance of adverse events specific to insulin pump therapy.  aNo financial or other support was received for this project and the authors have no financial interest in the products mentioned in the article.  aPublisher supplied data 3aglucagon 3ainsulin 3ainsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aketones 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apatient education 3apatients 3aquestionnaires 3atherapeutics 3aurine1 aRushton, Wanda E.0 tDiabetes educator.g2013 Nov., v. 39, no. 6 p.841-847dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl42983x1554-60637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/01457217135046283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02057naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011000168300001600278520110600294592002801400650001201428650000901440650001701449653002401466653002801490653001301518653002701531653001301558773008201571856008101653852000901734655001201743IND60638284120221122110352.0190428s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063828412DNAL7 a10.1163/22941932-900001962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarker, Jennifer10aDisconnection and Reconnection: Misconceptions and Recommendations Pertaining to Vouchers in Wood Science  ap. 425-437.  aThis paper aims to raise awareness of the importance of plant specimen vouchers in wood anatomy and wood identification in keeping abreast of plant name changes. It reveals the strong possibility that many wood specimens in xylaria are currently misidentified because corresponding plant specimen vouchers have been lost or separated from collections and not revisited. It appeals to the systematic wood anatomy community to reconnect wood specimens in xylaria with their corresponding plant specimen vouchers in order to update nomenclature. More specific recommendations are aimed at the International Association of Wood Anatomists (IAWA) to promote and educate those in the wood community on the importance and value of plant specimen vouchers in wood identification and systematic wood anatomy. Of equal importance is the adoption and promotion of a wood specimen citation system that unambiguously indicates whether research is based upon wood specimens with corresponding plant specimen vouchers and whether these vouchers have been consulted so that the research reflects current nomenclature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aXylaria 3awood 3awood anatomy 0aWood identification 0asystematic wood anatomy 0ataxonomy 0aplant specimen voucher 0aherbaria0 tIAWA journal.g, v. 29, no. 4 p.425-437dBrillwJournal:6290x0928-15417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/22941932-900001963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03704naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245016500171506011700336506007600453520199000529592002802519506003702547650001902584650001202603650001402615650002402629650002802653650001502681650001802696650001902714650002402733650001202757651001302769653002002782653001702802653001502819653001402834653001702848653002402865653001502889653002802904653002302932653001502955653001402970653001302984773009402997856008603091852000903177655001203186IND60709551020221207124134.0220523e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070955102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e047322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAyalew, Tilksew10aExclusive breastfeeding practice and associated factors among first-time mothers in Bahir Dar city, North West Ethiopia: A community based cross sectional study  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBreastfeeding can offer the ideal food for infants. It contains all the necessary nutrients for the growthand development of infants and antibodies that can protect from many childhood illnesses. Understanding the extent of, and barriers to exclusive breastfeeding in Ethiopia is important for learning how to best improve level of exclusive breastfeeding. No single study has been conducted on first-time mothers in the country. . Therefore, this study aimed to assess prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding practice and associated factors among first-time mothers in Bahir Dar city, North West Ethiopia. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from March to April, 2016 among (n = 400) randomly selected first-time mothers in Bahir Dar city, northwest Ethiopia. Data were collected using structured interviewer-administered questionnaire and analyzed using SPSS version20., bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were carried out. Odds ratio with 95% confidence interval was used to measure the strength of association. Statistical significance was declared at P -value <0.05. Prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding practice 24 h before the survey was 57.3% (95%CI: 52.3%–62%). Mothers not being married (aOR = 2.79, 95 %CI: 1.08, 7.17), supported by their husband (aOR = 4.15, 95%CI: 2.13, 6.28), with no breast complication (aOR = 3.66, 95% CI: 2.13, 6.28), who had four or more antenatal care (aOR = 2.51, 95%CI: 1.49, 4.23) were more likely to practice exclusive breastfeeding. A significant proportion of mothers had a low level of exclusive breastfeeding practice that was lower than the national recommended level. Mothers not being married, supported by their husbands, with no breast problems who had four or more antenatal care visits were more likely to practice exclusive breastfeeding. These results suggest that multi-sectorial and multi-disciplinary approaches are needed to increase exclusive breastfeeding in the first-time mothers.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abreast feeding 3abreasts 3achildhood 3aconfidence interval 3across-sectional studies 3aodds ratio 3aprenatal care 3aquestionnaires 3aregression analysis 3asurveys 3aEthiopia 0aQuality of life 0aEpidemiology 0aObstetrics 0aPregnancy 0aPublic heath 0aReproductive system 0aPediatrics 0aExclusive breastfeeding 0aFirst time mothers 0aPrevalence 0aBahir Dar 0aEthiopia0 tHeliyon.g2020 Sept., v. 6, no. 9 p.e04732-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e047323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01222naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245006200166300001600228520023900244592002800483650001400511650001800525650002100543653000700564653000700571653000800578653003300586653002000619653003600639653001600675773009800691856008600789852000900875655001200884IND60610409220221116184201.0181030e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061040922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2018.07.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Ying10aEstimation for the spatial autoregressive threshold model  ap. 172-175.  aThis paper extends the threshold model to the spatial framework, which allows for different spatial lag coefficients for different regimes.

The etched SS wire offers a rough surface structure for subsequent growth of AuNPs in chloroauric acid solution. As a result, the uniform cedar-like AuNPs coating with larger surface area was tightly attached to the etched SS wire substrate. The AuNPs coated etched SS fiber (AuNPs/SS) was examined for SPME of ultraviolet (UV) filters, phthalate esters and aromatic hydrocarbons coupled to high-performance liquid chromatography with UV detection. The fabricated fiber exclusively exhibited excellent extraction efficiency and selectivity for some aromatic hydrocarbons. Influential parameters of extraction and desorption time, temperature, stirring rate and ionic strength were investigated and optimized. The limits of detection ranged from 0.008μgL−1 to 0.037μgL−1. The single fiber repeatability varied from 3.90% to 4.50% and the fiber-to-fiber reproducibility ranged from 5.15% to 6.87%. The recovery of aromatic hydrocarbons in real water samples spiked at 2.0μgL−1 and 20μgL−1 ranged from 94.38% to 106.2% with the relative standard deviations below 6.44%. Furthermore the growth of the cedar-like AuNPs coating can be performed in a highly reproducible manner. This fabricated fiber exhibits good stability and withstands at least 200 extraction and desorption replicates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3aaromatic hydrocarbons 3aatmospheric deposition 3acoatings 3adesorption 3adetection limit 3afilters 3agold 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aionic strength 3amixing 3ananogold 3aphthalates 3asolid phase microextraction 3astainless steel 3astatistical analysis 3asurface area 3atemperature 0aCedar-like Au coating 0aChemical deposition 0aStainless steel wire 0aSolid-phase microextraction 0aAromatic hydrocarbons1 aYang, Yaoxia1 aLi, Yi1 aZhang, Min1 aWang, Xuemei1 aDu, Xinzhen0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2015 May 30, v. 876 p.55-62dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2015.03.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02503naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001100153245013400164300001600298520109800314592002801412650002301440650001401463650002001477650001501497650001401512650002201526650003701548650000901585650001101594650001201605650002001617651001001637653004401647653000901691653002501700653002201725653002801747700001601775700001601791700001801807773012301825856008801948852000902036655001202045IND60582286120221118153517.0201111e20180201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058228612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.08.3162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Bo10aTemporal and spatial variations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in soils from a typical organic sewage irrigation area  ap. 513-520.  aIn the water shortage countries and areas, untreated sewage irrigation led to the extensive organic pollution of farmland soil, which seriously threatened environmental security. In this study, we selected Shenfu irrigation area (SIA) as the study area, and it was the first and largest organic sewage irrigation area in China. We analyzed the temporal and spatial variations in concentrations, risk and sources of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in soil of the SIA. The results show that the PAH concentrations decreased slowly and environmental risk fluctuated after stopping sewage irrigation. However, the correlation and divergence analysis indicate that PAHs in surface soils might be derived from traffic emissions besides sewage irrigation. Based on factor analysis with non-negative constraints, the contribution of irrigation decreased from 92.9% to 59.4%, and contribution of traffic increased from 7.1% to 40.6%. Thus, the superposition of the residual PAHs from sewage irrigation and the new input PAHs from traffic emission should be considered for the pollution control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural soils 3aemissions 3afactor analysis 3airrigation 3apollution 3apollution control 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3arisk 3asewage 3atraffic 3awater shortages 3aChina 0aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) 0aSoil 0aSource apportionment 0aSewage irrigation 0aSuperposition pollution1 aGuo, Shuhai1 aLi, Xiaojun1 aWang, Jianing0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Feb. 01, v. 613-614 p.513-520dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.08.3163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03324naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245006600171506011700237506007600354520143000430592002801860506003701888650000801925650001501933650001501948650001401963650002801977650001402005650001402019650001902033650000902052650001602061650002302077650001302100650002302113650001702136650002702153650002202180650002802202650002802230650002602258653001702284653001702301653002202318653002002340653001502360653002202375653001502397653002302412653000802435653001502443653001402458700001702472700002002489773009402509856008602603852000902689655001202698IND60709551120221207124149.0220523e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070955112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e047332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHansda, Surajit10a9-phenyl acridine photosensitizes A375 cells to UVA radiation  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAcridines are an important class of bioactive molecules having varied uses.

We investigated the effects of ACPH prior to UVA exposure on in vitro DNA through photo-cleavage assay. Effect of such treatment was also studied in cultured A375 melanoma cells. Endpoints studied included morphological changes, evaluation of cellular viability, scratch assay, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, DNA damage, lipid peroxidation, glutathione (GSH) level, autophagy, cell cycle progression, depletion of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨmt), induction of apoptosis and Hoechst dye efflux assay. Our findings indicated that ACPH could sensitize damage to DNA induced by UVA both in vitro and in cells. It could also potentiate cell killing by UVA. It arrested cells in G₂/M phase and induced apoptotic death through mitochondria mediated pathway. This sensitization was through enhancement of intracellular ROS. Our findings also indicated that the stem cells side population was reduced on such treatment. The findings are important as it indicates ACPH as a promising photosensitizer and indicates its possible role in photodynamic therapy.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aabsorbance 3aacridines 3aantineoplastic activity 3aapoptosis 3aautophagy 3acell viability 3adyes 3aglutathione 3alipid peroxidation 3amelanoma 3amembrane potential 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial membrane 3aphotochemotherapy 3aphotosensitizing agents 3areactive oxygen species 3aultraviolet radiation 0aCell biology 0aBiochemistry 0aMolecular biology 0aCancer research 0aToxicology 0a9-phenyl acridine 0aA375 cells 0aPhotosensitization 0aROS 0aDNA damage 0aApoptosis1 aGhosh, Gargi1 aGhosha, Rītā,0 tHeliyon.g2020 Sept., v. 6, no. 9 p.e04733-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e047333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02973naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245015800175300001600333520140600349592002801755650002401783650001101807650002601818650002301844650001101867650002001878650002001898650001501918650002101933650002201954650001401976650002601990650002302016650001002039650001102049650001902060650001002079650001102089651001102100653001502111653002302126653001502149653001902164653002402183700001902207700002302226773010002249856008502349852000902434655001202443IND60515425520221118060625.0160315e20150703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051542552DNAL7 a10.1080/03071375.2015.11121632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBadalamenti, Emilio10aSeasonal effects on mortality rates and resprouting of stems treated with glyphosate in the invasive tree of heaven (Ailanthus altissima (Mill.) Swingle)  ap. 180-195.  aTree of heaven (Ailanthus altissima) is regarded as invasive within urban and natural areas worldwide. Efficient methods to control it are significantly needed if we are to limit its well-known environmental and economic impacts. Up to now the use of herbicides has proven necessary since following mechanical damage, Ailanthus vigorously resprouts. However, the seasonal response of Ailanthus stems, treated with herbicides, has never been assessed. We compared the control efficacy recorded in autumn, winter and summer in an abandoned suburban citrus grove in Sicily, under Mediterranean-climate conditions. Glyphosate was injected within drill holes made in knee-high cut trees. Tree mortality and the resprouting ability of treated stems were significantly affected by the application timing and by diameter class of stems. Mortality was significantly lower in winter treatments within the smaller diameter class. Within the larger diameter class, only autumn treatments showed a notably higher mortality rate and a significantly lower growth of sprouts. Hence, autumn interventions are strongly recommended to effectively treat Ailanthus . Mortality was notably higher in the smaller diameter class. Our results confirm the importance of early intervention to control Ailanthus , also showing that the choice of the season is crucial to obtaining satisfactory control of its resprouting ability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAilanthus altissima 3aCitrus 3aMediterranean climate 3aapplication timing 3aautumn 3acontrol methods 3aeconomic impact 3aglyphosate 3ainvasive species 3amechanical damage 3amortality 3apesticide application 3aseasonal variation 3astems 3asummer 3atree mortality 3atrees 3awinter 3aSicily 0aalien tree 0acontrol techniques 0aherbicides 0astem injection 0aMediterranean basin1 aBarone, Ettore1 aLa Mantia, Tommaso0 tArboricultural journal.g2015 July 3, v. 37, no. 3 p.180-195dTaylor & Francisx2168-10747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03071375.2015.11121633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02882naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245010600168300001800274500000900292520148700301592002801788650002601816650002001842650001201862650001401874650002201888650000901910650001301919650001401932650001101946650002401957651001301981700001901994700001802013700001702031700002502048700001802073700001702091700001702108700002302125700001702148700001802165773012402183856008402307852000902391655001202400IND60663408320221119163934.0191226e200011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066340832DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj2000.9261071x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVincelli, Paul10aImproved Seedling Health, Yield, and Stand Persistence with Alfalfa Resistant to Aphanomyces Root Rot  ap. 1071-1076.  aepub  aAlfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) breeders have made substantial progress in recent years to develop cultivars with resistance to Aphanomyces root rot (ARR, caused by Aphanomyces euteiches), yet data showing the agronomic benefits of this resistance under natural field conditions are limited. Two trials were seeded into naturally infested soils with alfalfa cultivars ranging from susceptible to highly resistant to ARR. The trials provided a test of the hypothesis that ARR-resistant cultivars would provide improved performance. In one test, the combination of high rainfall during the 4 wk following seeding on a soil with a slow percolation rate led to a severe outbreak of ARR, with symptoms typical of a syndrome commonly observed in commercial alfalfa fields in Kentucky. Under these conditions, the ARR-resistant cultivars provided dramatically improved seedling health, yield, and persistence. Cultivars having a resistance (R) or high resistance (HR) rating provided the most consistent performance. In the other test, a near-normal rainfall amount on a deep soil with good internal drainage led to moderate disease pressure. In that case, the ARR-resistant cultivars exhibited a slight improvement in seedling health, but yield trends were not as clear as in the former trial. Based on these findings and previous research, we conclude that the use of cultivars with R or HR ratings to ARR may solve a common stand-establishment problem in spring-seeded alfalfa in Kentucky.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAphanomyces euteiches 3aMedicago sativa 3aalfalfa 3acultivars 3ainternal drainage 3arain 3aroot rot 3aseedlings 3asowing 3astand establishment 3aKentucky1 aHenning, Jimmy1 aHendrick, Tim1 aBrown, Jerry1 aOsborne, Lawrence J.1 aPrewitt, Beth1 aShields, Val1 aSorrell, Don1 aStrohmeier, Kim D.1 aTackett, Ray1 aWyles, Joe W.0 tAgronomy journal.g2000 Nov., v. 92, no. 6 p.1071-1076dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2000.9261071x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02120naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245007700162300001600239520083000255592002801085650004401113650002201157650001301179650004101192650002901233650001201262650004401274650001801318650001401336650001801350650001601368653002201384653002201406653002301428653002801451700001401479773012501493856008301618852000901701655001201710IND60610409520221116184121.0181025e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061040952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2018.07.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavid, E.10aPyrolysis of rapeseed oil cake in a fixed bed reactor to produce bio-oil  ap. 495-502.  aWith increasing environmental issues, production of bio-fuel represents a viable source of renewable energy and constitutes an alternative for the replacement of fossil fuel and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Both selective and non—selective feeding were observed. Selective feeding was intense over a narrow size range (selected particle sizes over 20 times more abundant in the gut than in the water); the actual sizes selected depended on the size frequency distribution offered, associating always with the largest abundant particles. A hypothesis for the mechanism of food size selection is that the animals "scan" the size distribution by capturing particles larger than the previous one ingested more efficiently than those that are smaller; the copepods then "locate" an abundance peak and halt the process just to the right of it.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcartia tonsa 3aanimals 3adigestive system0 tEcology.g1973 July, v. 54, no. 4 p.909-914dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19356883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02596naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245009500170300001600265520132100281536020201602592002801804650002001832650001301852650001701865650002001882650001501902650001601917650001301933650002301946700001901969700002101988700002402009773011202033856008002145852000902225655001202234IND60625005720221119122452.0181206e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062500572DNAL7 a10.1177/01457217135057792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoldman, Matthew L.10aHow Do Peer Coaches Improve Diabetes Care for Low-Income Patients?bA Qualitative Analysis  ap. 800-810.  aThe purpose of the study was to explore the perspectives and roles of peer coaches, who are patients with diabetes trained to provide diabetes self-management support (DSMS) to other patients. A focus group and 17 qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with community-based peer coaches in San Francisco in order to better understand the process by which these coaches engaged with their patients. Transcripts were coded and analyzed using methods based on grounded theory to develop a theoretical model of peer coach roles. Peer coaches play 3 principal roles in providing DSMS: advisor, supporter, and role model. While working with patients, peer coaches had different approaches to setting emotional boundaries and to allocating responsibility for implementing health behavior changes. Peer coaches were more consistent in how they sought resources from providers. Peer coaches also became empowered to better manage their own diabetes. Peer coaches are a highly motivated potential workforce uniquely positioned to teach and empower patients by building trust through shared experiences. The variability in coaching styles suggests an inherent diversity among peer coaches that must be accounted for in future strategies for design, recruitment, training, and oversight of peer coaching programs.  aFinancial support: This work was supported by the American Academy of Family Physicians Foundation [no grant number] and the UC Berkeley–UCSF Joint Medical Program Thesis Grant [no grant number].  aPublisher supplied data 3abehavior change 3adiabetes 3afocus groups 3ahealth behavior 3ainterviews 3alabor force 3apatients 3atheoretical models1 aGhorob, Amireh1 aEyre, Stephen L.1 aBodenheimer, Thomas0 tDiabetes educator.g2013 Nov., v. 39, no. 6 p.800-810dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl42983x1554-60637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/01457217135057793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03315naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005700151245008900208520166700297592002801964650001601992650001602008650004102024650001702065650002302082650004802105650002202153650002102175650001602196650002302212650001202235650001402247650001402261650001502275650001402290653001902304653001402323653001502337653002302352653001402375653002802389653001202417653001202429653001102441653001002452700001802462700001802480700001602498700005902514773009302573856008602666852000902752655001202761IND60709551620221121004030.0210427e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070955162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e047882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMokkala, Kati1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0354-554610aEarly pregnancy serum IGFBP-1 relates to lipid profile in overweight and obese women  aLower level of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (IGFBP-1) has been observed in insulin resistance, while higher level of matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8) has been linked to obesity. The aim here was to study in overweight and obese women, typically manifesting with insulin resistance, whether IGFBP-1 and MMP-8 are related to and reflect systemic low-grade inflammation, metabolism and diet. Fasting serum from overweight and obese pregnant women (n = 100) in early pregnancy were analysed for IGFBP-1, phosphorylated IGFBP-1 (phIGFBP-1) and MMP-8. High-sensitivity CRP and GlycA were used as markers for low grade inflammation. GlycA and lipids were quantified using NMR. IGFBP-1 associated negatively with GlycA, evidenced by higher concentrations in the lowest quartile (median 1.53 (IQR 1.45–1.72)) compared to the highest (1.46 (1.39–1.55)) (P = 0.03). Several lipid metabolites, particularly HDL-cholesterol, correlated inversely with phIGFBP-1 (FDR<0.1). Nutritional status and diet contributed to the levels of IGFBP-1, demonstrated as an inverse correlation with maternal weight (Spearman r = -0.205, P = 0.04) and dietary intake of vitamin A (r = -0.253, P = 0.014) and a direct correlation with dietary intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids (Spearman r = 0.222, P = 0.03). MMP-8 correlated inversely with pyridoxine (r = -0.321, P = 0.002) and potassium (r = -0.220, P = 0.033). Maternal serum IGFBP-1 may contribute to maternal lipid metabolism in overweight and obese women during early pregnancy. These findings may be of importance in identification of metabolic disturbances preceding the adverse metabolic outcomes in pregnancy.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3afood intake 3ahigh density lipoprotein cholesterol 3ainflammation 3ainsulin resistance 3ainsulin-like growth factor binding proteins 3alipid composition 3alipid metabolism 3ametabolites 3anutritional status 3aobesity 3apotassium 3apregnancy 3apyridoxine 3avitamin A 0aWomen's health 0aPregnancy 0aMetabolism 0aMetabolic disorder 0aNutrition 0aObstetrics & gynecology 0aIGFBP-1 0aInsulin 0aLipids 0aMMP-81 aJuhila, Juuso1 aHouttu, Noora1 aSorsa, Timo1 aLaitinen, Kirsi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5245-81180 tHeliyon.g2020 Aug., v. 6, no. 8 p.e04788-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e047883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01915naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245008200175300001600257520078100273592002801054650001001082650001001092650001201102650001501114650001401129650002201143650001001165650001201175651001401187653001401201653001001215653002301225653002301248700002501271773014001296856008401436852000901520655001201529IND60122447320221119220305.0150325e20130801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012244732DNAL7 a10.1080/01650521.2013.8540312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWehncke, Elisabet V.10aCebus nigritus impact the seedling assemblage below their main sleeping sites  ap. 142-146.  aCapuchin monkeys (Cebus nigritus) in Argentina prefer particular sleeping trees they maintain over the years.

Thus, the dominance of plant species dispersed by these primates in the seedling assemblages below sleeping trees confirm the strong weight of C. nigritus and their potential influence in the dynamics of the seedling populations in the forest.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCebus 3afauna 3aforests 3ahome range 3aseedlings 3aspecies diversity 3atrees 3atropics 3aArgentina 0aArgentina 0aCebus 0adefecation pattern 0aseedling diversity1 aDi Bitetti, Mario S.0 tStudies on neotropical fauna and environment.g2013 Aug. 1, v. 48, no. 2 p.142-146dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl28137x1744-51407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01650521.2013.8540313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03751naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100001700162245007400179300001600253500000900269520208800278592002802366650001502394650002302409650002302432650001602455650002202471650001702493650001202510650002102522650001102543650002002554650000902574650001502583650001102598650001802609650003002627650001402657650001202671650001902683650002302702650002502725650002002750650002002770650002602790650001802816650001802834650001302852650002102865650001102886650001702897700001802914773012302932856009703055852000903152655001203161IND60663408520221119164033.0191122e197909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066340852DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1979.00021962007100050013x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBanks, P. A.10aField Evaluations of the Herbicidal Effects of Fluridone on Two Soils  ap. 759-762.  aepub  aThe selective control of perennial weeds in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) with soil applied herbicides has been difficult to achieve with currently available chemicals. Also, the long-term use of the dinitroaniline herbicides in cotton has resulted in a shifting of the weed spectrum to species which are resistant to these herbicides. New herbicides are needed to control these weed problems. The purpose of this study was to evaluate fluridone {l-methyl-3-phenyl-5-[3-trifluoromethyl)phenyl] -4(lH)-pyridinone}, a newly developed soil applied herbicide, for effectiveness in the control of various annual and perennial weeds found in cotton. Fluridone, at several rates, was applied preplant incorporated or preemergence to Miller clay, a fine, mixed thermic vertic Haplustolls, and Lufkin fine sandy loam, a fine montmorillonitic, thermic vertic Albaqualfs, in the springs of 1976, 1977, and 1978 and in the fall of 1977. Weed control evaluations in cotton were made periodically after application. Spring applications of 0.45 kg/ha or higher effectively controlled broadleaf weeds for the growing season. Fluridone at 0.45 and 0.90 kg/ha effectively controlled rhizome johnsongrass [Sorghum halepense (L.) Pers.] 2 of 3 years evaluated. Season-long control of yellow nutsedge (Cyperus esculentus L.) in a sandy loam soil was observed with preplant incorporated and preemergence rates of 0.90 kg/ha. Phytotoxic effects of fluridone residue were noted in a sandy loam soil one year after treatment but these effects were not as evident in the clay soil. Fluridone applied in the fall provided variable weed control the following spring depending upon soil type, weed density, and weed species present. Incorporation of the fall treatments increased the effectiveness of fluridone on annual grasses in the sandy loam soil. These experiments determined that fluridone could effectively control yellow nutsedge, rhizome johnsongrass, and many annual weeds in cotton at rates above 0.45 kg/ha but the residue of this treatment may limit the use of rotational crops the following year.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlbaqualfs 3aCyperus esculentus 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aHaplustolls 3aSorghum halepense 3aannual weeds 3aannuals 3aapplication rate 3aautumn 3abroadleaf weeds 3aclay 3aclay soils 3acotton 3acrop rotation 3adinitroaniline herbicides 3afluridone 3agrasses 3agrowing season 3aherbicide residues 3aherbicide resistance 3amontmorillonite 3aperennial weeds 3apesticide application 3aphytotoxicity 3aplant density 3arhizomes 3asandy loam soils 3aspring 3aweed control1 aMerkle, M.

However, concerns exist about the quality of wood produced following fertilization. The objective of this study was to develop an understanding of wood property changes following fertilization. Wood samples from a study involving four levels of fertilization applied to a thinned mid-rotation loblolly pine plantation located on the lower coastal plain of North Carolina were sampled. The study was laid out in a randomized complete block design involving four blocks and four levels of nitrogen fertilizer: Control-000, 112, 224 and 336 kg/ha, along with 28 kg/ha of phosphorus with all treatments. Thirty-two trees were felled and disks were cut at five heights from each tree. Wood properties including modulus of elasticity, air-dry density and tracheid anatomical properties were measured for each of the three post-fertilization annual growth rings using near infrared (NIR) spectra obtained from the radial face of strips cut from the disks. An analysis of variance was conducted on three-year basal area weighted average stiffness, air-dry density, and tracheid anatomical properties. A decrease in stiffness, air-dry density, tracheid wall thickness, and an increase in tracheid radial diameter were observed for the heaviest fertilizer treatment (336 kg/ha) compared to the control and 112 kg/ha of nitrogen. Microfibril angle (MFA), cell tangential diameter, and tracheid perimeter showed little change. Wood properties of trees receiving fertilizer rates of 112 and 224 kg/ha were not significantly affected.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplantations 3agrowth rings 3atracheids 3aanalysis of variance 3anitrogen 3afertilizer application 3awood 3amodulus of elasticity 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3atrees 3awood properties 3aPinus taeda 3aphosphorus 3astand basal area 3acoastal plains 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aNorth Carolina 0aLoblolly pine 0amid-rotation fertilization 0abasal area 0aNIR spectroscopy1 aJordan, Lewis1 aSchimleck, Laurence R.1 aDaniels, Richard F.1 aClark III, Alexander0 tIAWA journal.g, v. 30, no. 1 p.49-58dBrillwJournal:6290x0928-15417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/22941932-900002023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04013naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245018800169300001400357520246400371592002802835650001302863650003502876650001602911650001102927650002002938650001502958650002202973650003102995650001503026650002503041653003103066653002203097653003403119653002103153653002403174653001803198700002003216700003103236700002003267700001703287700002203304700002503326773009003351856008103441852000903522655001203531IND60544778620221120213912.0160901e20150723xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054477862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2015.03.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeclercq, Amélie10aIntroduction of organic/hydro-organic matrices in inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry and mass spectrometry: A tutorial review. Part I. Theoretical considerations  ap. 33-56.  aDue to their outstanding analytical performances, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) and mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) are widely used for multi-elemental measurements and also for isotopic characterization in the case of ICP-MS. While most studies are carried out in aqueous matrices, applications involving organic/hydro-organic matrices become increasingly widespread. This kind of matrices is introduced in ICP based instruments when classical “matrix removal” approaches such as acid digestion or extraction procedures cannot be implemented. Due to the physico-chemical properties of organic/hydro-organic matrices and their associated effects on instrumentation and analytical performances, their introduction into ICP sources is particularly challenging and has become a full topic. In this framework, numerous theoretical and phenomenological studies of these effects have been performed in the past, mainly by ICP-OES, while recent literature is more focused on applications and associated instrumental developments. This tutorial review, divided in two parts, explores the rich literature related to the introduction of organic/hydro-organic matrices in ICP-OES and ICP-MS. The present Part I, provides theoretical considerations in connection with the physico-chemical properties of organic/hydro-organic matrices, in order to better understand the induced phenomena. This focal point is divided in four chapters highlighting: (i) the impact of organic/hydro-organic matrices from aerosol generation to atomization/excitation/ionization processes; (ii) the production of carbon molecular constituents and their spatial distribution in the plasma with respect to analytes repartition; (iii) the subsequent modifications of plasma fundamental properties; and (iv) the resulting spectroscopic and non spectroscopic interferences. This first part of this tutorial review is addressed either to beginners or to more experienced scientists who are interested in the analysis of organic/hydro-organic matrices by ICP sources and would like to consider the theoretical background of effects induced by such matrices.The second part of this tutorial review will be dedicated to more practical consideration on instrumentation, such as adapted introductions devices, as well as instrumental and operating parameters optimization. The analytical strategies for elemental quantification in such matrices will also be addressed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3aatomization 3acarbon 3ainstrumentation 3aionization 3amass spectrometry 3aphysicochemical properties 3ascientists 3awet digestion method 0aInductively coupled plasma 0aMass spectrometry 0aOptical emission spectrometry 0aOrganic matrices 0aCarbon constituents 0aInterferences1 aNonell, Anthony1 aTodolí Torró, José Luis1 aBresson, Carole1 aVio, Laurent1 aVercouter, Thomas1 aChartier, Frédéric0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2015 July 23, v. 885 p.33-56dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2015.03.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01246naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010400169300001600273520034000289592002800629650002400657650001900681650001300700650001500713650001000728650001100738650001300749773008800762856008500850852000900935655001200944IND60515425920221118060540.0160315e20160102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051542592DNAL7 a10.1080/00063657.2015.11174142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHanane, Saâd10aEffects of orchard type and breeding period on Turtle Dove nest density in irrigated agroecosystems  ap. 141-145.  aCapsule The density of nests of the Turtle Dove Streptopelia turtur in Moroccan irrigated agroecosystems was 68% higher in orange orchards than in olive orchards, and 42% higher in the early breeding period compared to the late period.

The bulls were selected based on their unacceptable semen parameters (poor semen quality and freezability) for comparative analysis with control bulls for assessing uncompensable seminal parameters, namely, detection of sperm chromatin maturity (using acidic aniline blue staining) and fragmentation level (comet assay of sperm nuclear DNA) along with production of 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) (detected by high performance liquid chromatography of 8-OHdG) in cryopreserved semen specimen. The acidic aniline blue assay revealed that neither the fertility groups nor the species/breeds differed significantly, however, for comet assay only the fertility groups differed significantly (P<0.05). High performance liquid chromatography analysis could detect the presence of the adduct (8-OHdG) in semen specimen of only three cattle breeding bulls. The results suggest that weekly collection of semen does not induce immature sperm production in dairy bulls. The cryopreservation of semen induces sperm DNA fragmentation which is comparatively higher in that of bulls with poor semen quality. 8-OHdG was not significantly produced and thereby is not a matter of serious concern for dairy bulls reared under stall-fed condition. It can be concluded that comet assay may be used for quality assessment of the cryopreserved semen samples especially which are to be used for inseminating the elite cows or for assisted reproduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA fragmentation 3aSahiwal 3aaniline 3aassisted reproductive technologies 3abuffaloes 3acattle breeding 3achromatin 3acows 3acryopreservation 3adairy bulls 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3anuclear genome 3asemen 3aspermatozoa1 aGupta, A.K.1 aYadav, B.R.1 aChauhan, I.S.1 aGupta, Aparna1 aMohanty, T.K.1 aRaina, V.S.0 tLivestock science.g2011 Apr., v. 136, no. 2-3 p.114-121dElsevier B.V.x1871-14137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2010.08.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02734naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245018300173300001600356520165200372592002802024650001602052650001902068650002002087650004102107650001102148650001602159700001302175700001802188700001402206773009502220856008402315852000902399655001202408IND60112976620221120081536.0141111e20120706xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011297662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2012.04.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeffroy-Rodier, C.10aGas chromatography–mass spectrometry of hexafluoroacetone derivatives: First time utilization of a gaseous phase derivatizing agent for analysis of extraterrestrial amino acids  ap. 158-166.  aWithin the perspective of the current and next space missions to Mars (MSL 2011 and Exomars 2016–2018), the detection and enantioselective separation of building blocks such as the amino acids are important subjects which are becoming fundamental for the search for traces of life on the surface and subsurface of Mars. In this work, we have developed and optimized a method adapted to space experimentation to derivatize and analyze amino acids, using hexafluoroacetone as the derivatizing agent. The temperature, duration of the derivative transfer to the analyser, and chromatographic separation parameters have been optimized to meet the instrument design constraints imposed on devices for extraterrestrial experiments. The work presented in this rationale has established that hexafluoroacetone, in addition to its intrinsic qualities, such as the production of light-weight derivatives (no racemization) and great resistance to the drastic operating conditions, has indeed facilitated simple and fast derivatization that appears to be suitable for in situ analysis in space. By using hexafluoroacetone as the derivatizing agent, we successfully identified, 21 amino acids including 12 of the 20 proteinic amino acids without stirring or extraction steps. Ten of these derivatized amino acids were enantioselectively separated. The precision and accuracy measurements for the D/L ratio showed that the proposed method was also suitable for the determination of both enantioselective forms of most of the tested amino acids. The limits of detection obtained were lower than the ppb level of organic molecules detected in Martian meteorites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3aderivatization 3adetection limit 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3amixing 3atemperature1 aBuch, A.1 aSternberg, R.1 aPapot, S.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2012 July 6, v. 1245 p.158-166dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2012.04.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03147naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002400166245005900190300001600249520167300265592002801938650002001966650001501986650002402001650001502025650001602040650001002056650001302066650002602079650001402105650001702119653002702136653002302163653002102186653001802207700006202225700006202287700006102349700006102410773014002471856008102611852000902692655001202701IND60651158320221119171737.0190711e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065115832DNAL7 a281039602pmid7 a10.1017/S00296651160029492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO'Donovan, Clare B.10aKnowing your genes: does this impact behaviour change?  ap. 182-191.  aIt is postulated that knowledge of genotype may be more powerful than other types of personalised information in terms of motivating behaviour change. However, there is also a danger that disclosure of genetic risk may promote a fatalistic attitude and demotivate individuals. The original concept of personalised nutrition (PN) focused on genotype-based tailored dietary advice; however, PN can also be delivered based on assessment of dietary intake and phenotypic measures. Whilst dietitians currently provide PN advice based on diet and phenotype, genotype-based PN advice is not so readily available. The aim of this review is to examine the evidence for genotype-based personalised information on motivating behaviour change, and factors which may affect the impact of genotype-based personalised advice. Recent findings in PN will also be discussed, with respect to a large European study, Food4Me, which investigated the impact of varying levels of PN advice on motivating behaviour change. The researchers reported that PN advice resulted in greater dietary changes compared with general healthy eating advice, but no additional benefit was observed for PN advice based on phenotype and genotype information. Within Food4Me, work from our group revealed that knowledge of MTHFR genotype did not significantly improve intakes of dietary folate. In general, evidence is weak with regard to genotype-based PN advice. For future work, studies should test the impact of PN advice developed on a strong nutrigenetic evidence base, ensure an appropriate study design for the research question asked, and incorporate behaviour change techniques into the intervention.  aPublisher supplied data 3abehavior change 3adietitians 3aexperimental design 3afolic acid 3afood intake 3agenes 3agenotype 3ahealthy eating habits 3aphenotype 3arisk factors 0aPersonalised nutrition 0aGenotype knowledge 0aBehaviour change 0aFood4Me study1 aWalsh, Marianne C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6651-24341 aGibney, Michael J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5250-361X1 aBrennan, Lorraine1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7711-74991 aGibney, Eileen R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9465-052X0 tProceedings of the Nutrition Society.g2017 Aug., v. 76, no. 3 p.182-191dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45480x1475-27197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00296651160029493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02722naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245012100164300002000285520151800305592002801823650001301851650001001864650001101874650001401885650001101899650001501910650001301925650001901938650001101957650001301968650001501981650002301996650001502019650002002034650001402054650001802068700002602086773010002112856007902212852000902291655001202300IND60350195420221119210438.0150812e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6035019542DNAL7 a10.1111/1750-3841.129412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShanthilal, J.10aRheology of Rice Flour Dough with Gum Arabic: Small and Large‐Deformation Studies, Sensory Assessment and Modeling  ap. E1735-E1745.  aThe absence of gluten protein makes the rice flour doughs difficult to handle when flattened/sheeted products are to be prepared. The rheological, sensory and microstructural changes in rice flour doughs having gum Arabic (0% to 5%, w/w) and moisture contents (44% to 50%) were studied for improving the dough handling characteristics. Rheological parameters like storage modulus (G′) and complex viscosity (η*) decreased with an increase in moisture content while loss angle (δ) increased. A power‐law type equation was suitable to relate angular frequency (ω) with G′, G″, and η* (0.814 ≤ r ≤ 0.999, P ≤ 0.01). An increase in gum and moisture contents increased δ from 6.9° to 15.5° but decreased the energy required for compression/flattening. The 6‐element spring‐dashpot model was suitable (r ≥ 0.991, P ≤ 0.01) for creep curves. The sensory panel had the opinion that dough with a low to moderate hardness between 3 and 4, and stickiness of ≤3.5 was suitable for the purpose of flattening in relation to the preparation of sheeted/flattened products; the appropriate condition for dough formulation was with the moisture and gum contents of 47.0% to 47.9% and 1.55% to 2.25%, respectively to offer the desirability index between 0.50 and 0.52. The microstructure of the rice flour dough in the absence of gum Arabic appeared to possess loosely bound flour particles. The presence of gum provided a coating on flour particles to yield dough having good cohesive microstructure.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoatings 3adough 3aenergy 3aequations 3agluten 3agum arabic 3ahardness 3amicrostructure 3amodels 3arheology 3arice flour 3asensory evaluation 3astickiness 3astorage modulus 3aviscosity 3awater content1 aBhattacharya, Suvendu0 tJournal of food science.g2015 Aug., v. 80, no. 8 p.E1735-E1745dThe Institutex0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.129413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03910naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245007400174506011700248506007600365520214300441592002802584506003702612650001502649650001402664650001602678650002402694650001702718650002202735650002402757650002702781650001802808650001202826650001802838650002102856650001002877651001102887653001202898653002602910653002502936653001802961653002202979653001903001653002203020653002403042653003103066700002403097700001803121700002803139773009403167856008603261852000903347655001203356IND60709552020221207123602.0220523e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070955202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e048062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSenyanzobe, J.M.V.10aImpact of Pteridium aquilinum on vegetation in Nyungwe Forest, Rwanda  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPteridium aquilinum acts as an important ecological filters in dominated communities. A study to investigate the effects of its dominance in the vegetation of Nyungwe was conducted. Sampling was done in Mubuga and Uwajerome mountains. A total of 53 alternate plots measuring 10 m × 10 m were sampled along a transect at regular interval of 10 m. In each plot, the species were identified and the cover abundance measured subjectively. Plant strategies, succession, biological forms, distribution and conservation status of each species were also determined. Data on species composition and cover abundance were analyzed using MVSP software and Shannon -Weiner index was used to determine diversity of communities. Descriptive statistics were used to assess the characteristics of the species. A total of 141 species belonging to 100 genera and 54 families and distributed in four plant communities were identified. Pteridium aquilinum, Macaranga kilimandischarica, Lycopodium clavatum and Microglossa parvifolia were dominant in communities I, II and III, with average cover of 31%, 6% and 4% respectively. The primary forest was dominated by Pavetta rwandensis and Allophyllus chaunostachys in community IV, with 21% and 10% coverage respectively. Shannon- Weiner and evenness indices were 1.538, 2.925, 3.251 and 2.940 and 0.436, 0.716, 0.791 and 0.768 in communities I, II, III and IV respectively. Species richness were 34, 36, 61 and 46 in communities I, II, III and IV respectively. Ruderal, chamaephytes, secondary, Africa tropical and least concerns plant species predominated in Pteridium vegetation areas with 76% 48%, 69%, 43% and 90% of total species respectively. Competitive, phanerophytes, primary, Afromontane and least concerns plant species dominated in non-dominated area with 54%, 52%, 58%, 40% and 88% of total species respectively. Pteridium aquilinum restricted the growth of trees as exhibited by the presence of few phanerophytes and enhanced the growth of ruderal species, both of which are indicators of disturbed forest. The tree species observed in P. aquilinum cut-areas was Macaranga kilimandischarica.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLycopodium 3aMacaranga 3aMicroglossa 3aPteridium aquilinum 3achamaephytes 3acomputer software 3aconservation status 3adescriptive statistics 3aforest damage 3aforests 3aphanerophytes 3aspecies richness 3atrees 3aRwanda 0aEcology 0aEnvironmental science 0aEvolutionary biology 0aPlant biology 0aSpecies diversity 0aNyungwe forest 0aPlant communities 0aPteridium aquilinum 0aEcological characteristics1 aMulei, Josephine M.1 aBizuru, Elias1 aNsengimuremyi, Concorde0 tHeliyon.g2020 Sept., v. 6, no. 9 p.e04806-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e048063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03555naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001200153245009800165300001600263520196400279592002802243650002902271650001202300650001102312650002002323650002302343650001502366650002502381650001402406650001202420650000902432650002102441650001502462650001102477650001102488650001402499650002502513650001302538651001502551653001202566653002202578653001202600653002502612653001502637700001802652700001902670700002402689700001802713700002202731700001602753773012302769856008802892852000902980655001202989IND60582286820221118153539.0201111e20180201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058228682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.09.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Lei10aRevisiting the biogeochemistry of arsenic in the Baltic Sea: Impact of anthropogenic activity  ap. 557-568.  aWith the increase in anthropogenic environmental disruption, the behavior of arsenic in the Baltic Sea has received more scientific attention because of its complex forms and toxicity, and was re-visited to determine if there have been measurable changes recently. A cruise was conducted in 10–19 May 2011 to investigate the species and distribution of total dissolved inorganic arsenic (TDIAs: [TDIAs]=[As(V)]+[As(III)]) revealing links between the hydrographic dynamics and biological/chemical reactions in the Baltic Sea. In addition, long-term (2002−2010) time-series investigations of particulate arsenic in the Gotland Basin were also conducted in February every year for monitoring purposes. The behavior of TDIAs was non-conservative due to the removal and regeneration processes occurring in the Baltic Sea. Biological scavenging plays a dominant role as sink for TDIAs, with removal amount of 3.1±1.6nmol/L above the pycnocline of the Baltic Sea. Significant regeneration of TDIAs was observed below the pycnocline of the Baltic Sea, which was closely related to hypoxia. The decomposition of organic arsenic and release from the sediment by desorption of As-bearing Fe and Mn oxides were thought to be two major sources for TDIAs regeneration. The median concentration of TDIAs (8.4nmol/L) was much lower than in most marginal seas and oceans, including the near-bottom water around a chemical weapon dumpsite (13.9nmol/L). The hypoxia in the deep water contributed to the increase in As(III) concentrations based on the relationship between As(III)/TDIAs ratio and apparent oxygen utilization. If the difference of As(III) profiles (1981 and 2011) actually represents a long-term increase in As(III) concentrations and a shoaling of the As(III) chemocline, these factors could enhance the toxic effects and extend the residence time of arsenic and, hence, potentially have negative impacts on fisheries and ecosystem health in the Baltic Sea.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aarsenic 3abasins 3abiogeochemistry 3achemical reactions 3adesorption 3aenvironmental health 3afisheries 3ahypoxia 3airon 3amanganese oxides 3amonitoring 3aoceans 3aoxygen 3asediments 3atime series analysis 3atoxicity 3aBaltic Sea 0aArsenic 0aInorganic species 0aHypoxia 0aChemical weapon dump 0aBaltic Sea1 aPohl, Christa1 aRen, Jing-Ling1 aSchulz-Bull, Detlef1 aCao, Xiu-Hong1 aNausch, Günther,1 aZhang, Jing0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Feb. 01, v. 613-614 p.557-568dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.09.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03271naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245012900177300001600306520196000322592002802282650002002310650001402330650002402344650001102368650000902379650002502388651001202413653003502425653002802460653002702488653002602515653002502541653002102566700002602587700002002613700002802633773010502661856008602766852000902852655001202861IND60531666420221120045311.0200427e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053166642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.07.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKossieris, Panagiotis12aA rainfall disaggregation scheme for sub-hourly time scales: Coupling a Bartlett-Lewis based model with adjusting procedures  ap. 980-992.  aMany hydrological applications, such as flood studies, require the use of long rainfall data at fine time scales varying from daily down to 1min time step. However, in the real world there is limited availability of data at sub-hourly scales. To cope with this issue, stochastic disaggregation techniques are typically employed to produce possible, statistically consistent, rainfall events that aggregate up to the field data collected at coarser scales. A methodology for the stochastic disaggregation of rainfall at fine time scales was recently introduced, combining the Bartlett-Lewis process to generate rainfall events along with adjusting procedures to modify the lower-level variables (i.e., hourly) so as to be consistent with the higher-level one (i.e., daily). In the present paper, we extend the aforementioned scheme, initially designed and tested for the disaggregation of daily rainfall into hourly depths, for any sub-hourly time scale. In addition, we take advantage of the recent developments in Poisson-cluster processes incorporating in the methodology a Bartlett-Lewis model variant that introduces dependence between cell intensity and duration in order to capture the variability of rainfall at sub-hourly time scales. The disaggregation scheme is implemented in an R package, named HyetosMinute, to support disaggregation from daily down to 1-min time scale. The applicability of the methodology was assessed on a 5-min rainfall records collected in Bochum, Germany, comparing the performance of the above mentioned model variant against the original Bartlett-Lewis process (non-random with 5 parameters). The analysis shows that the disaggregation process reproduces adequately the most important statistical characteristics of rainfall at wide range of time scales, while the introduction of the model with dependent intensity-duration results in a better performance in terms of skewness, rainfall extremes and dry proportions.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3ahydrology 3ameteorological data 3amodels 3arain 3astatistical analysis 3aGermany 0aRainfall stochastic simulation 0aRainfall disaggregation 0aPoisson-cluster models 0aBartlett-Lewis models 0aAdjusting procedures 0aFine time-scales1 aMakropoulos, Christos1 aOnof, Christian1 aKoutsoyiannis, Demetris0 tJournal of hydrology.g2018 Jan., v. 556 p.980-992dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.07.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03051naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245010100158520193900259592002802198650001302226650002802239650002002267650002202287650001302309650002002322650001102342650001502353650001902368700001902387700002202406700002802428700002002456773012902476856007502605852000902680655001202689IND60791103620221123045041.0220826e20220822xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079110362DNAL7 a10.3390/rs141641072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmed, Imran 10aIoT Enabled Deep Learning Based Framework for Multiple Object Detection in Remote Sensing Images  aAdvanced collaborative and communication technologies play a significant role in intelligent services and applications, including artificial intelligence, Internet of Things (IoT), remote sensing, robotics, future generation wireless, and aerial access networks. These technologies improve connectivity, energy efficiency, and quality of services of various smart city applications, particularly in transportation, monitoring, healthcare, public services, and surveillance. A large amount of data can be obtained by IoT systems and then examined by deep learning methods for various applications, e.g., object detection or recognition. However, it is a challenging and complex task in smart remote monitoring applications (aerial and drone). Nevertheless, it has gained special consideration in recent years and has performed a pivotal role in different control and monitoring applications. This article presents an IoT-enabled smart surveillance solution for multiple object detection through segmentation. In particular, we aim to provide the concept of collaborative drones, deep learning, and IoT for improving surveillance applications in smart cities. We present an artificial intelligence-based system using the deep learning based segmentation model PSPNet (Pyramid Scene Parsing Network) for segmenting multiple objects. We used an aerial drone data set, implemented data augmentation techniques, and leveraged deep transfer learning to boost the system’s performance. We investigate and analyze the performance of the segmentation paradigm with different CNN (Convolution Neural Network) based architectures. The experimental results illustrate that data augmentation enhances the system’s performance by producing good accuracy results of multiple object segmentation.

Inertial motion capture technology enables dynamic measurement of rider kinematics but data extraction is time-consuming. The aim of this study was to develop a software tool to automate the process of extracting biomechanical data from the Xsens™ MVN (MoCap) system to investigate postural changes in riders, comparing static position at halt with dynamic position during the sit phase of rising trot. The software was found to be efficient, reducing data extraction time by 97% when used with a sample of 16 riders. Good correlation was found between hip flexion and pelvic anterior-posterior rotation and between halt and trot but with significantly greater values of hip flexion and pelvic anterior rotation in trot. No riders showed hip flexion >50° at halt but 11 riders (69%) showed hip flexion >50° during the sit phase of rising trot, indicating that dynamic assessment is important when considering rider postural faults that may put them at risk of back injury.  aPublisher supplied data 0ahip flexion 0ahorse rider 0ainertial sensor 0amotion capture 0apelvic rotation1 aBondi, A.1 aPigott, T.M.C.1 aSmith, G.1 aMcDonald, S.0 tComparative exercise physiology.g2018 June 6, v. 14, no. 2 p.99-110dWageningen Academic PublisherswJournal:J000000061x1755-25597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3920/CEP1700233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02593naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245013600164300001600300520143300316592002801749650002101777650001401798650000901812650002901821650002601850650001401876650002201890650002301912651001401935651001901949651001101968700002001979700001801999773011802017856007502135852000902210655001202219IND60129749520221122064034.0151126e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012974952DNAL7 a10.1645/GE-2950.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBraicovich, Paola E.10aGeographical Patterns of Parasite Infracommunities in the Rough Scad, Trachurus lathami Nichols, in the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean  ap. 768-777.  aWe assessed temporal variability in parasite infections of rough scad (Trachurus lathami) in 3 samples from Miramar (MI) in 2008, separated by periods of 1 mo, and 2 samples from Villa Gesell (VG), 1 each in 2008 and 2009 (Buenos Aires Province, Argentina), respectively. A sample was also obtained from Cabo Frio (CF) (Brazil) in 2009 to compare differences in parasite communities between fish from this locality and each Argentinean locality. All rough scad were parasitized by at least 1 of 27 parasite species. Similarity-based multivariate analysis revealed significant differences between localities, but temporal homogeneity in each Argentinean locality. Overall, prevalence and abundance of parasite species were most similar between samples from MI and VG, while the greatest differences occurred between samples from MI and CF. A canonical analysis of principal coordinates showed significant differences among samples. Grillotia carvajalregorum was the most important species in determining the position of Argentinean samples, especially those from MI, while Ectenurus virgulus, Raphidascaris sp., and Hysterothylacium sp. were the most important species related to fish from CF. The parasite assemblage of T. lathami showed a notable temporal persistence within the same locality and a high variability at the spatial scale, suggesting the existence of 3 independent stocks of T. lathami in South Atlantic waters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHysterothylacium 3aTrachurus 3afish 3amultidimensional scaling 3amultivariate analysis 3aparasites 3aspatial variation 3atemporal variation 3aArgentina 3aAtlantic Ocean 3aBrazil1 aLuque, José L.1 aTimi, Juan T.0 tJournal of parasitology.g2012 Aug., v. 98, no. 4 p.768-777dAmerican Society of Parasitologistsx0022-33957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1645%2FGE-2950.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02571naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245017500154300002000329520130300349592002801652650001601680650001101696650001501707650002101722650001201743650001201755650001801767650002301785650001501808650002201823650001801845700002101863700001801884700001701902700001801919700001701937773012401954856007402078852000902152655001202161IND60640895920221119183007.0190505e20160621xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064089592DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra12041e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Ning10aComparative study of melting points of 3,4-bis(3-nitrofurazan-4-yl)furoxan (DNTF)/1,3,3-trinitroazetidine (TNAZ) eutectic compositions using molecular dynamic simulations  ap. 59141-59149.  a3,4-Bis(3-nitrofurazan-4-yl)furoxan (DNTF) and 1,3,3-trinitroazetidine (TNAZ) have been widely investigated as important candidate components in melt cast explosives. This paper presents a study of melting point prediction of DNTF/TNAZ eutectic compositions using a molecular dynamics simulations method. The melting points were determined according to the variation of various parameters including specific volume, free volume, diffusion coefficient, specific heat capacity and non-bonded energy, and good agreements were observed from the comparison between calculated values and prevenient experimental data. The binding energies (Ebᵢₙd) and radial distribution functions (RDFs) were also performed to explore the interactions between DNTF and TNAZ molecules, and results reveal that a weak hydrogen bond from H of TNAZ and O of DNTF vanishes from solid to liquid phase. The detonation performances of DNTF/TNAZ eutectic were also discussed by comparing with other common castable explosives. Results show that the high performance and low melting point make the mixture DNTF/TNAZ (4/6) a good candidate for melt cast explosives. In general, it is worth noting that molecular dynamics simulations provide a useful tool to understand the thermal properties of energetic eutectic compositions.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiffusivity 3aenergy 3aexplosives 3ahydrogen bonding 3aliquids 3amelting 3amelting point 3amolecular dynamics 3aprediction 3asimulation models 3aspecific heat1 aZeman, Svatopluk1 aShu, Yuan-jie1 aWu, Zong-kai1 aWang, Bo-zhou1 aYin, Shi-wei0 tRSC advances.g2016 June 21, v. 6, no. 64 p.59141-59149dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra12041e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03507naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010300169300001800272520225100290592002802541650001102569650001902580650001802599650001202617650000802629650001502637650001102652650001502663650002302678650001402701650001102715650001202726650001002738653001102748653001102759653001202770653001302782653001602795653001402811700002102825773010802846856008602954852000903040655001203049IND60531666520221121032151.0190318e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053166652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.07.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFox, James F.10aImpact of landscape disturbance on the quality of terrestrial sediment carbon in temperate streams  ap. 1030-1042.  aRecent studies have shown the super saturation of fluvial networks with respect to carbon dioxide, and the concept that the high carbon dioxide is at least partially the result of turnover of sediment organic carbon that ranges in age from years to millennia. Currently, there is a need for more highly resolved studies at stream and river scales that enable estimates of terrestrial carbon turnover within fluvial networks. Our objective was to develop a new isotope-based metric to estimate the quality of sediment organic carbon delivered to temperate streams and to use the new metric to estimate carbon quality across landscape disturbance gradients. Carbon quality is defined to be consistent with in-stream turnover and our metric is used to measure the labile or recalcitrant nature of the terrestrial-derived carbon within streams. Our hypothesis was that intensively-disturbed landscapes would tend to produce low quality carbon because deep, recalcitrant soil carbon would be eroded and transported to the fluvial system while moderately disturbed or undisturbed landscapes would tend to produce higher quality carbon from well-developed surface soils and litter. The hypothesis was tested by applying the new carbon quality metric to 15 temperate streams with a wide range of landscape disturbance levels. We find that our hypothesis premised on an indirect relationship between the extent of landscape disturbance and the quality of sediment carbon in streams holds true for moderate and high disturbances but not for un-disturbed forests. We explain the results based on the connectivity, or dis-connectivity, between terrestrial carbon sources and pathways for sediment transport. While pathways are typically un-limited for disturbed landscapes, the un-disturbed forests have dis-connectivity between labile carbon of the forest floor and the stream corridor. Only in the case when trees fell into the stream corridor due to severe ice storms did the quality of sediment carbon increase in the streams. We argue that as scientists continue to estimate the in-stream turnover of terrestrially-derived carbon in fluvial carbon budgets, the assumption of pathway connectivity between carbon sources to the stream should be justified.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aforest litter 3aforests 3aice 3alandscapes 3arivers 3ascientists 3asediment transport 3asediments 3astorms 3astreams 3atrees 0aCarbon 0aStream 0aFluvial 0aSediment 0aDisturbance 0aLandscape1 aFord, William I.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2016 Sept., v. 540 p.1030-1042dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.07.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02813naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245011000172300001300282520133300295592002801628650002301656650002701679650001501706650002101721650002301742650001601765650000901781650002601790650001001816650001301826650001201839650001301851650000901864650001101873651001001884651001601894653001401910653002301924653001501947653001801962653001301980653001201993700002002005700002002025700002102045773011002066856008502176961001302261852000902274655001202283IND60541558720221119232348.0190318e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054155872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2014.04.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAccinelli, Cesare10aAflatoxin contamination of corn under different agro-environmental conditions and biocontrol applications  ap. 9-14.  aBiological control of the fungus Aspergillus flavus has been shown to be effective in reducing aflatoxin contamination in corn. This study compared field application of a bioplastic-based formulation for delivering atoxigenic A. flavus isolates in Northern Italy and the Mississippi Delta.Due to an extremely hot and dry summer at the Italy site in 2012, aflatoxin contamination was approximately seven times higher than in 2011. In 2011, and 2012, application of bioplastic granules inoculated with the atoxigenic isolate A. flavus NRRL 30797 at 15 and 30 kg ha−1 resulted in a reduction of aflatoxin contamination by 67.2 ± 4.1% and 94.8 ± 5.3%, respectively. The higher application rate was also effective when soil abundance of A. flavus was artificially increased by applying contaminated corn residues. At the Mississippi site, summer 2012 was also hot and dry, with high levels of aflatoxin contamination. In fields planted with non-Bt or Bt hybrids, application of biocontrol granules inoculated with A. flavus NRRL 30797 or NRRL 21882 at 30 kg ha−1 reduced aflatoxin contamination to up to 89.6%.

Changes in lake levels and the juxtaposition of vegetation and open water greatly influence biota that use coastal wetlands. Several regional studies have shown that changes in vegetation and lake levels lead to predictable changes in the composition of coastal wetland bird communities. We report new findings of wetland bird community changes at a broader scale, covering the entire Great Lakes basin. Our results indicate that water extent and interspersion increased in coastal wetlands across the Great Lakes between low (2013) and high (2018) lake-level years, although variation in the magnitude of change occurred within and among lakes. Increases in water extent and interspersion resulted in a general increase in marsh-obligate and marsh-facultative bird species richness. Species like American bittern (Botaurus lentiginosus), common gallinule (Gallinula galeata), American coot (Fulica americana), sora (Porzana carolina), Virginia rail (Rallus limicola), and pied-billed grebe (Podilymbus podiceps) were significantly more abundant during high water years. Lakes Huron and Michigan showed the greatest increase in water extent and interspersion among the five Great Lakes while Lake Michigan showed the greatest increase in marsh-obligate bird species richness. These results reinforce the idea that effective management, restoration, and assessment of wetlands must account for fluctuations in lake levels. Although high lake levels generally provide the most favorable conditions for wetland bird species, variation in lake levels and bird species assemblages create ecosystems that are both spatially and temporally dynamic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBotaurus lentiginosus 3aFulica americana 3aGallinula 3aPodiceps 3aPodilymbus 3aRallus limicola 3abasins 3abirds 3alakes 3amarshes 3aresearch 3aspecies richness 3avegetation 3aLake Michigan 3aMichigan 0aGreat Lakes coastal wetlands 0aWater extent 0aInterspersion 0aRemote sensing1 aHowe, Robert W.1 aTozer, Douglas C.1 aGnass Giese, Erin E.1 aWolf, Amy T.1 aNiemi, Gerald J.1 aGehring, Thomas M.1 aGrabas, Greg P.1 aNorment, Christopher J.0 tJournal of Great Lakes research.g2021 Apr., v. 47, no. 2 p.534-545dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2035x0380-13307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2021.01.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03499naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245010200170520194200272592002802214650002002242650001102262650001102273650001502284650001302299650001002312650001202322650001402334650001102348650001302359650001502372650001102387650002402398650001502422650002002437650001202457650001302469650002902482650002002511650001002531653001102541653002002552653002602572653004902598653001002647653001402657700001402671700001902685700001602704700001902720773009802739856008702837852000902924655001202933IND60721910220221119180432.0211106e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072191022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plantsci.2020.1108032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCui, Qingqing10aStage-specific events in tomato graft formation and the regulatory effects of auxin and cytokinin  aGrafting is widely used worldwide because of its obvious advantages, especially in solanaceous vegetable crops. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying graft formation are unknown. In this study, internode tissues from above and below the graft junction were harvested, and we performed weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to describe the temporal and spatial transcriptional dynamics that occur during graft formation in tomato. The wounding stress response involved in JA, ETH, and oxylipins mainly occurred at 1 h after grafting (HAG). From 3 to 12 HAG, the biological processes of snRNA and snoRNA modification and the gibberellin-mediated signaling pathway functioned both above and below the graft junction. However, auxin transport and signaling, DNA replication, and xylem and phloem pattern formation were restricted to the scion, whereas the cytokinin-activated signaling pathway and the cellular response to sucrose starvation was restricted to the rootstock. At 24−72 HAG, cell division occurred above the graft junction, and photosynthesis-related pathways were activated below the graft junction. The levels of auxin and cytokinin reached their maxima above and below the graft junction at 12 HAG, respectively. Exogenous application of certain concentrations of IAA and 6-BA will promote xylem and phloem transport capacity. The current work has analyzed the stage-specific events and hub genes during the developmental progression of tomato grafting. We found that auxin and cytokinin levels respond to grafting, above and below the graft junction, respectively, to promote the formation of xylem and phloem patterning. In addition, the accumulation of auxin above the graft junction induced cells to prepare for mitosis and promoted the formation of callus. In short, our work provides an important reference for theoretical research and production application of tomato grafting in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA replication 3aauxins 3acallus 3acytokinins 3adynamics 3agenes 3amitosis 3aoxylipins 3aphloem 3aresearch 3arootstocks 3ascions 3asignal transduction 3astarvation 3astress response 3asucrose 3atomatoes 3atranscription (genetics) 3avegetable crops 3axylem 0aTomato 0aGraft formation 0aRNA-seq transcriptome 0aWeighted gene co-expression network analysis 0aAuxin 0aCytokinin1 aXie, Lulu1 aDong, Chunjuan1 aGao, Lihong1 aShang, Qingmao0 tPlant science.g2021 Mar., v. 304 p.110803-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38764x0168-94527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2020.1108033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03451naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245012600166300001600292520162600308592002801934650002401962650002201986650002702008650002302035650001602058650002002074650002202094650001602116650001502132650001102147650002302158650002102181650001302202650001502215650001502230650001002245650002002255650001702275650001302292650002302305650001002328650001602338651001902354653002502373653002502398653001302423653002002436653001102456700002202467700002202489700006502511700002302576700002102599773012502620856008302745852000902828655001202837IND60525481120221120060627.0190318e20160816xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052548112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2016.06.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHorák, Jakub10aAgricultural landscapes with prevailing grasslands can mitigate the population densities of a tree-damaging alien species  ap. 177-183.  aAlien organisms can seriously damage plants that are important to humans. Because such pests are often managed at the site scale, our understanding of how factors on broader spatial scales affect their numbers remains poor.To understand how factors relevant to larger spatial scales affect alien numbers, we used the horse-chestnut leaf miner (Cameraria ohridella) as a model organism. We studied how its site-based population density was related to six kinds of land use in independent landscapes (ranging from 2 to 64km2) that surrounded each study site in the Czech Republic. For each landscape, we quantified the area occupied by coniferous forests, deciduous forests, crop fields, grasslands, parks and urban areas, and linear vegetation. Data were collected from 30 sites in 2002 and from 35 different sites in 2014.The abundance of alien pest was most closely associated with the landscape occupied by grassland. This relationship was negative, and its strength increased with spatial scale in 2002 but decreased in 2014. Grassland area was negatively correlated with crop field area, and we infer that grasslands help to control alien pest abundance while crop fields should have the opposite effect.We suggest that increasing the percentage of the landscape patches planted with grassland is one of the possibilities that could help control alien and perhaps other pests of trees. Furthermore, increasing the area of grasslands might hinder the spread of invasive organisms and facilitate pest management. Moreover, landscape-based management might be directly or indirectly influenced by agricultural subsidies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCameraria ohridella 3aagricultural land 3aagricultural subsidies 3aconiferous forests 3acorrelation 3adata collection 3adeciduous forests 3afield crops 3agrasslands 3ahumans 3aintroduced species 3ainvasive species 3aland use 3alandscapes 3aleafminers 3aparks 3apest management 3aplant damage 3aplanting 3apopulation density 3atrees 3aurban areas 3aCzech Republic 0aBiological invasions 0aLandscape management 0aLand use 0aPest management 0aSpread1 aHoluša, Jaroslav1 aNováková, Petra1 aLukášová, Karolina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9347-51491 aLoskotová, Tereza1 aRomportl, Dušan0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2016 Aug. 16, v. 230 p.177-183dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2016.06.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03277naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245011200164300001800276520173600294592002802030650002002058650002202078650001102100650001702111650002002128650001502148650002502163650002402188650001402212650001002226650001602236650001102252650002102263650001702284651001002301653002102311653002402332653001002356653002002366653002002386700001702406700001502423700001802438700001902456700001802475700001702493700002202510773010802532856008602640852000902726655001202735IND60531666620221121032116.0190318e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053166662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.07.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXue, Jie12aA decision-making framework to model environmental flow requirements in oasis areas using Bayesian networks  ap. 1209-1222.  aThe competition for water resources between agricultural and natural oasis ecosystems has become an increasingly serious problem in oasis areas worldwide. Recently, the intensive extension of oasis farmland has led to excessive exploitation of water discharge, and consequently has resulted in a lack of water supply in natural oasis. To coordinate the conflicts, this paper provides a decision-making framework for modeling environmental flows in oasis areas using Bayesian networks (BNs). Three components are included in the framework: (1) assessment of agricultural economic loss due to meeting environmental flow requirements; (2) decision-making analysis using BNs; and (3) environmental flow decision-making under different water management scenarios. The decision-making criterion is determined based on intersection point analysis between the probability of large-level total agro-economic loss and the ratio of total to maximum agro-economic output by satisfying environmental flows. An application in the Qira oasis area of the Tarim Basin, Northwest China indicates that BNs can model environmental flow decision-making associated with agricultural economic loss effectively, as a powerful tool to coordinate water-use conflicts. In the case study, the environmental flow requirement is determined as 50.24%, 49.71% and 48.73% of the natural river flow in wet, normal and dry years, respectively. Without further agricultural economic loss, 1.93%, 0.66% and 0.43% of more river discharge can be allocated to eco-environmental water demands under the combined strategy in wet, normal and dry years, respectively. This work provides a valuable reference for environmental flow decision-making in any oasis area worldwide.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aagricultural land 3abasins 3acase studies 3adecision making 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental models 3afinancial economics 3ahydrology 3aoases 3aprobability 3arivers 3awater management 3awater supply 3aChina 0aBayesian network 0aEnvironmental flows 0aOasis 0aDecision-making 0aNorthwest China1 aGui, Dongwei1 aZhao, Ying1 aLei, Jiaqiang1 aZeng, Fanjiang1 aFeng, Xinlong1 aMao, Donglei1 aShareef, Muhammad0 tJournal of hydrology.g2016 Sept., v. 540 p.1209-1222dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.07.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01619naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245013400158300002000292520056400312592002800876650001200904650002100916650002300937650001200960650001800972650001400990650001701004700001801021700001901039700001601058773012401074856007401198852000901272655001201281IND60640896120221119183439.0190505e20160726xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064089612DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra12046f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReddy, C.

A clear understanding of the genetics of NMS at the molecular level and the identification of linked molecular markers will greatly facilitate breeding for this trait. P21 is an inbred line carrying the single gene Ms₁₁ controlling NMS, and NMS801 and NMS373 are two inbred lines with the NMS gene Ms₁₀ The objectives of this study were to (i) identify molecular markers linked with the Ms₁₀ and the Ms₁₁ NMS genes, and (ii) place these genes on the genetic map of sunflower. Three F₂ and a BC₁F₁ mapping populations developed from crosses between the male-sterile (MS) lines P21, NMS801, and NMS373, and male-fertile (MF) (wild-type) lines were scored for fertility/sterility. The NMS801 and NMS373 populations segregated for Ms₁₀ and T, a tightly linked anthocyanin pigment locus. The P21 populations segregated for Ms₁₁ These populations were then genotyped with restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), simple sequence repeat or microsatellite (SSR), and insertion–deletion polymorphism (INDEL) markers, and four genetic maps comprising 14 to 17 linkage groups (LGs) were constructed for each population. The Ms₁₀ and T genes mapped to LG 11, while the Ms₁₁ gene mapped to LG 8. Four SSR markers (ORS697, ORS1214, ORS686, and CRT162) and the phenotypic marker locus T cosegregated and were tightly linked to Ms₁₀ at a genetic distance of less than 1 cM. The Ms₁₁ gene locus was flanked by the SSR markers MS925 and ORS536 at genetic distances of 3.8 and 4.1 cM, respectively. The availability of tightly linked polymerase chain reaction based markers and the location of NMS genes on the sunflower genetic map will be useful for marker-assisted selection (MAS) in sunflower breeding programs and provides a basis for the physical mapping and positional cloning of these genes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelianthus annuus 3aanthocyanins 3abreeding programs 3achromosome mapping 3acrossing 3agenes 3agenetic distance 3agenetic markers 3agenotyping 3ainbred lines 3alinkage groups 3aloci 3amale sterility 3amarker-assisted selection 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amolecular cloning 3aphenotype 3aplant breeding 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism1 aBerry, Simon T.1 aVelasco, Leonardo1 aFernández-Martínez, José M.1 aGandhi, Sonali1 aFreeman, Carrie1 aHeesacker, Adam1 aKnapp, Steven J.1 aLeon, Alberto J.0 tCrop science.g2005 Sept., v. 45, no. 5 p.1851-1857dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2004.06843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02493naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245015900156300001600315520115800331592002801489650002301517650002201540650001101562650001001573650001101583650003301594650001701627650001401644650003001658650001801688650001001706651001001716700001701726700001901743700001501762700001601777700001601793700001801809700001801827773011801845856007501963852000902038655001202047IND60129749820221122064017.0151126e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012974982DNAL7 a10.1645/GE-2974.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShu, Fan-Fan10aCharacterization of Fasciola Samples by ITS of rDNA Sequences Revealed the Existence of Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica in Yunnan Province, China  ap. 889-890.  aOn mainland China, liver flukes of Fasciola spp. (Digenea: Fasciolidae) can cause serious acute and chronic morbidity in numerous species of mammals such as sheep, goats, cattle, and humans. The objective of the present study was to examine the taxonomic identity of Fasciola species in Yunnan province by sequences of the first and second internal transcribed spacers (ITS-1 and ITS-2) of nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA). The ITS rDNA was amplified from 10 samples representing Fasciola species in cattle from 2 geographical locations in Yunnan Province, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the products were sequenced directly. The lengths of the ITS-1 and ITS-2 sequences were 422 and 361–362 base pairs, respectively, for all samples sequenced. Using ITS sequences, 2 Fasciola species were revealed, namely Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica. This is the first demonstration of F. gigantica in cattle in Yunnan Province, China using a molecular approach; our findings have implications for studying the population genetic characterization of the Chinese Fasciola species and for the prevention and control of Fasciola spp. in this province.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFasciola gigantica 3aFasciola hepatica 3acattle 3agoats 3ahumans 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aliver flukes 3amorbidity 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal DNA 3asheep 3aChina1 aLv, Rui-Qing1 aZhang, Yi-Fang1 aDuan, Gang1 aWu, Ding-Yu1 aLi, Bi-Feng1 aYang, Jian-Fa1 aZou, Feng-Cai0 tJournal of parasitology.g2012 Aug., v. 98, no. 4 p.889-890dAmerican Society of Parasitologistsx0022-33957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1645%2FGE-2974.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03590naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010400166300001400270520211000284592002802394650005702422650002002479650001202499650002402511650002102535650001002556650002002566650001202586650001502598650001402613650001402627650001502641650001602656650001902672650001602691650001902707650001202726653002302738653001702761653001302778653002402791653002602815653001602841700001902857773011702876856008202993852000903075655001203084IND60531666820221120045208.0190318e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053166682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jip.2016.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShikano, Ikkei10aAltered nutrient intake by baculovirus-challenged insects: Self-medication or compensatory feeding?  ap. 25-33.  aInfection by parasites can alter the feeding behaviour of hosts. Some animals seek out substances that can therapeutically clear infections (self-medication), some may seek out resources to recoup resources lost while fighting off infection (compensatory feeding) and others may be manipulated to ingest substances that benefit parasite fitness (parasite manipulation of host). Recent studies have indicated that pathogen-challenged insects can self-medicate by increasing their protein intake relative to carbohydrate, which is thought to act by boosting the insect’s immune response. However, increased protein intake could also be due to compensatory feeding or pathogen manipulation of the host, and a rigorous examination of all four of the testable predictions, which is necessary for verifying self-medication behaviour, has not been conducted. The therapeutic behaviour must (1) only be employed by infected individuals and (2) alleviate the potential fitness loss of the infected individual. (3) If an uninfected individual engages in the behaviour, they suffer a decrease in fitness, and lastly, (4) the parasite cannot benefit from the behaviour. In response to baculovirus-challenge (AcMNPV) at 24°C, the cabbage looper, Trichoplusia ni, increased proportional protein intake, by increasing protein intake rather than decreasing carbohydrate intake. Increased protein intake did not benefit virus fitness, but it also did not increase the probability of host survival. Increased proportional protein intake did not occur in response to TnSNPV-challenge at 24°C or in response to AcMNPV-challenge at a higher temperature (32°C), indicating that the virus-induced change in nutrient intake depends on virus identity and temperature. Since virus-challenged T. ni did not show the typical costs associated with infection, the altered nutrient intake is likely to be a compensatory response. Understanding the motivation behind pathogen-induced changes in feeding behaviour could have significant implications for determining its importance for species interactions at multiple trophic levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAutographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus 3aTrichoplusia ni 3aanimals 3acarbohydrate intake 3afeeding behavior 3ahosts 3aimmune response 3ainsects 3amotivation 3aparasites 3apathogens 3aprediction 3aprobability 3aprotein intake 3atemperature 3atrophic levels 3aviruses 0aCosts of infection 0aFood quality 0aForaging 0aNutritional ecology 0aSpecialist-generalist 0aTemperature1 aCory, Jenny S.0 tJournal of invertebrate pathology.g2016 Sept., v. 139 p.25-33dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45771x0022-20117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2016.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01486naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245014900155300002000304520035200324592002800676650001300704650001800717650001900735650001900754650001700773650002100790700001900811700001300830700002000843700001900863700001500882700002000897773012400917856007401041852000901115655001201124IND60640896420221119183140.0190505e20160630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064089642DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra12053a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiu, Jinan10aSynthesis and hydrogenation of anatase TiO₂ microspheres composed of porous single crystals for significantly improved photocatalytic activity  ap. 62907-62910.  aAnatase microspheres composed of porous single crystals were successfully synthesized via a facile route without preseeding treatment and then further modified using a surface hydrogenation process.

Cities call for innovative approaches integrating climate protection with urban attractiveness and waterfront endeavors. There is a lack of studies targeting policy processes for coastal protection, including the choice of adaptation strategies and impediments for implementation. Sweden is an interesting case due to the decentralized character of coastal adaptation. Consequently, this paper aims to analyze the status of and conditions for large-scale multifunctional coastal protection by means of qualitative analyses of policy documents and interviews with frontline practitioners in four Swedish coastal cities: Malmö, Gothenburg, Helsingborg and Landskrona. The analysis documents a predominant focus on envisioning/planning for coastal protection rather than implementation of adaptation measures. While waterfront development functions as a window of opportunity in the more populous cities it also risks creating fragmentation and social imbalances in coastal protection between cities and their various coastal areas. Key implementation determinants emphasize formal institutional aspects, where politics and political decision-making need to set the necessary terms ensuring implementation. Current public-private and national-local distribution of responsibilities, stepwise planning and limited funding-mechanisms create uncertainties in system robustness and coherency. The consequences of a system for coastal protection heavily reliant on decentralized action needs to be properly considered by adaptation policy-makers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3acoastal zone management 3adecision making 3aissues and policy 3apolitics 3aSweden 0aWaterfront climate adaptation 0aCoastal protection 0aUrban experimentation 0aMultifunctionality 0aImplementation determinants 0aInstitutional structures1 aHjerpe, Mattias1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5500-33000 tOcean & coastal management.g2021 Sept. 01, v. 210 p.105732-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11975x0964-56917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.1057323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03217naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024003400125040001800159100001800177245009200195506007600287506003100363520174300394592002802137596004702165596002602212596000802238596003502246596002402281596004302305506003702348650000802385650001802393650001102411650001402422650001902436650001902455650002702474650001402501651002302515700002102538700002202559773009102581856007802672852000902750655001202759IND60736795120221207102343.0220901e20190816xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073679512DNAL7 a10.1093/jhered/esz0242doi7 a10.1093/jhered/esz0242chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuinn, Cate B10aNoninvasive Sampling Reveals Short-Term Genetic Rescue in an Insular Red Fox Population  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aGenetic factors in the decline of small populations are extremely difficult to study in nature. We leveraged a natural experiment to investigate evidence of inbreeding depression and genetic rescue in a remnant population of subalpine-specialized Sierra Nevada red foxes (Vulpes vulpes necator) using noninvasive genetic monitoring during 2010–2017. Only 7 individuals were detected in the first 2 years. These individuals assigned genetically to the historical population and exhibited genetic hallmarks of inbreeding and no evidence of reproduction. Two years into the study, we detected 2 first-generation immigrant males from a recently expanding population of red foxes in the Great Basin Desert. Through annual resampling of individuals (634 red fox DNA samples, 41 individuals) and molecular reconstruction of pedigrees, we documented 1–3 litters/year for 5 years, all descended directly or indirectly from matings involving immigrant foxes. The observed heterozygosity and allelic richness of the population nearly doubled in 2 years. Abundance increased, indicative of a rapidly expanding population. Throughout the study, adult survival was high. Restoration of gene flow apparently improved the demographic trajectory of this population in the short term. Whether these benefits continue in the longer term could depend on numerous factors, such as maintenance of any locally adapted alleles. This study highlights the value of noninvasive genetic monitoring to assess rapidly shifting conditions in small populations. Uncertainties about the longer-term trajectory of this population underscore the need to continue monitoring and to research potential for both negative and positive aspects of continued genetic infusion.  aPublisher supplied data  cCalifornia Department of Fish and Wildlife  cNational Park Service  cNSF  cU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service  cU.S. Forest Service  cUC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aVulpes vulpes 3aadults 3agene flow 3agenetic rescue 3aheterozygosity 3ainheritance (genetics) 3amountains 3aGreat Basin Desert1 aAlden, Preston B1 aSacks, Benjamin N0 tJournal of Heredity.dOxford University Press (OUP)wJournal:jnl46534x0022-15037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jhered/esz0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03111naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245011100160520188700271592002802158650001102186650001502197650001202212650002002224650001602244650002102260650001902281650001502300650001002315651001402325700001602339700001602355700001502371700001602386700001702402700001602419700002002435700002102455773012902476856007502605852000902680655001202689IND60791104220221121085041.0220826e20220822xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079110422DNAL7 a10.3390/rs141641132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Pengcheng 10aFast Tree Detection and Counting on UAVs for Sequential Aerial Images with Generating Orthophoto Mosaicing  aIndividual tree counting (ITC) is a popular topic in the remote sensing application field. The number and planting density of trees are significant for estimating the yield and for futher planing, etc. Although existing studies have already achieved great performance on tree detection with satellite imagery, the quality is often negatively affected by clouds and heavy fog, which limits the application of high-frequency inventory. Nowadays, with ultra high spatial resolution and convenient usage, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become promising tools for obtaining statistics from plantations. However, for large scale areas, a UAV cannot capture the whole region of interest in one photo session. In this paper, a real-time orthophoto mosaicing-based tree counting framework is proposed to detect trees using sequential aerial images, which is very effective for fast detection of large areas. Firstly, to guarantee the speed and accuracy, a multi-planar assumption constrained graph optimization algorithm is proposed to estimate the camera pose and generate orthophoto mosaicing simultaneously. Secondly, to avoid time-consuming box or mask annotations, a point supervised method is designed for tree counting task, which greatly speeds up the entire workflow. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by performing extensive experiments on oil-palm and acacia trees. To avoid the delay between data acquisition and processing, the proposed framework algorithm is embedded into the UAV for completing tree counting tasks, which also reduces the quantity of data transmission from the UAV system to the ground station. We evaluate the proposed pipeline using sequential UAV images captured in Indonesia. The proposed pipeline achieves an F1-score of 98.2% for acacia tree detection and 96.3% for oil-palm tree detection with online orthophoto mosaicing generation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcacia 3aalgorithms 3acameras 3adata collection 3ainventories 3aorthophotography 3aremote sensing 3astatistics 3atrees 3aIndonesia1 aMa, Cunbao 1 aChen, Jian 1 aChen, Lin 1 aBu, Shuhui 1 aXu, Shibiao 1 aZhao, Yong 1 aZhang, Chenhua 1 aHagino, Tatsuya 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Aug. 22, v. 14, no. 16dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs141641133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01951naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245013100168300001600299520077700315592002801092650001701120650001301137650002501150650001201175650002301187650001101210651002201221653002401243653002501267653002201292653002101314700002001335700002301355773010501378856008501483852000901568655001201577IND60566942620221119034438.0170415e20170519xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056694262DNAL7 a10.1080/10454446.2015.10480192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMugera, Amin10aConsumer Preference and Willingness to Pay for a Local Label Attribute in Western Australian Fresh and Processed Food Products  ap. 452-472.  aThis study investigates Western Australia’s consumer attitudes toward and preferences for locally produced food products signified by a state-funded campaign logo, Buy West Eat Best (BWEB).

They are fabricated on a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) flexible polymer film using a transfer process on the scale of 11 mm × 11 mm. Because of the oxidation of copper, Cu-nanomesh electrodes have very low electrical conductivity. In order to solve this problem, we fabricated an electrode using a Cu/Au-bilayer. With the bilayer, we obtained a high transmittance and electric properties at wavelengths of 400–800 nm. Moreover, by controlling the pressure process, we obtained the transferred and embedded metal electrodes. We found that both the optical transmittance and the electrical conductivity of the embedded metal electrode were preserved after 50 000 bending cycles. Consequently, embedded Cu/Au-nanomesh electrodes have good mechanical strength and electrical properties appropriate for flexible transparent electrodes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acopper 3acopper nanoparticles 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrodes 3afilms (materials) 3agold 3aindium tin oxide 3aoxidation 3apolyethylene terephthalates 3astrength (mechanics) 3atransmittance 3awavelengths1 aKim, Yang Doo1 aChoi, Hak-Jong1 aSung, Young Hoon1 aLee, Heon0 tRSC advances.g2016 Sept. 28, v. 6, no. 95 p.92970-92974dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra12054g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02894naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245013600155300001600291520192100307592002802228653001702256653001202273653001402285653001702299653001902316700001402335700001702349773014302366856007402509852000902583655001202592IND60681639420221122045158.0200226e20180606xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068163942DNAL7 a10.3920/CEP1700342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, L.J.12aA retrospective case control study to investigate race level risk factors associated with horse falls in Irish point-to-point races  ap. 127-134.  aHorseracing as a high-risk sport can pose a significant risk to equine welfare. To date no epidemiological reviews of fall risk in horseracing have investigated the risks specific to point-to-point (PTP) racing. This study aimed to identify the main race level risk factors associated with horse falls in Irish PTP and to compare these to published findings for hurdle and steeplechase racing. The study used a retrospective case-control design. Relevant variables were identified and information was collated for all PTP races in the 2013/14 and 2014/15 seasons. Race-level variables were analysed through univariable analysis to inform multivariable model building. A final multivariable logistic regression model was refined, using fall/no fall as the dependent variable, through a backward stepwise process with variables retained if likelihood ratio test P-values were <0.05. During the study period 1,358 PTP races were recorded, 727 races (54%) included at least one horse fall. The fall frequency noted during the current study was 88/1000 starts. Race category impacted the odds of a fall occurring with all categories of maiden races having increased odds of falls compared to open races. Maiden races for 6 year olds and 6 and 7 year olds had the greatest chance of falling with 6.9 times increased odds. The chance of a race containing a fall increased 38% for each additional runner and was reduced by 25% for every horse that pulled up during the race. Using a larger data set could enable further sub-models to be developed. In the current study some of the variables had a low number of cases and/or controls which limited the analysis. Retrospective analysis of fall risk exposed some risk factors that have been previously identified in hurdle and steeplechase racing. The variables identified could inform future research and interventions aimed at improving horse and jockey safety whilst racing.  aPublisher supplied data 0ajumps racing 0awelfare 0afall risk 0aThoroughbred 0aamateur racing1 aTabor, G.1 aWilliams, J.0 tComparative exercise physiology.g2018 June 6, v. 14, no. 2 p.127-134dWageningen Academic PublisherswJournal:J000000061x1755-25597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3920/CEP1700343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02432naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024004200133040001800175100002400193245009100217300001600308520103900324592002801363596004501391596004501436650002601481650001801507650002501525650002001550650001001570650001601580650001201596651001801608653001801626653002001644653002001664653002501684653002601709700002601735700002201761773012001783856008601903852000901989655001201998IND60566942720221119032612.0170415e20170519xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056694272DNAL7 a10.1080/10454446.2015.10480222doi7 a10.1080/10454446.2015.10480222chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLillywhite, Jay M.,10aDoes Processing Level Affect Vegetable Region of Production Certification Preferences?  ap. 473-488.  aWhile a number of U.S. agricultural industries have implemented a region of production (ROP) certification, little research has focused on ROP valuation associated with both whole and processed forms of a food product. Understanding consumer preferences toward certified products sold in multiple forms is critical to the success of a new certification program in an industry that sells products at multiple levels of processing. This study examines preferences for a possible ROP-certified vegetable across two product forms: fresh and processed. Discrete choice analysis was conducted using data collected from an online panel survey of 553 U.S. food consumers. A chile pepper product’s ROP was deemed important by participants, although the ROP certifier appears to matter less than other potential certifications (e.g., safety, quality). Differences in the importance of ROP between product forms suggest a single certification can have disparate effects on consumer preferences for different forms of a ROP-certified vegetable.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199 3aagricultural industry 3acertification 3aconsumer preferences 3adata collection 3afoods 3ahot peppers 3asurveys 3aUnited States 0aChile peppers 0adiscrete choice 0afood processing 0aregion of production 0avalue-added marketing1 aSimonsen, Jennifer E.1 aSkaggs, Rhonda K.0 tJournal of food products marketing.g2017 May 19, v. 23, no. 4 p.473-488dRoutledgewJournal:27428x1540-41027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10454446.2015.10480223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01534naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245004400160300001600204520065700220592002800877650001300905650001200918650001400930650002000944650001400964650001000978650001400988650001601002773011801018856007501136852000901211655001201220IND60129750320221119035032.0151126e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012975032DNAL7 a10.1645/GE-3017.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLester, R.

This was particularly well shown by juveniles of Anisakis 1 from different fish species.

Przwewalski's horses (Equus Przwewalskii) and Mongolian domestic horses (Equus callabus) are sometimes found cohabiting in the same environment during the mating season. As such, we examined the hypothesis that interspecies differences are reflected in the acoustic morphology of vocalizations produced by two closely related species.We analyzed the acoustic structure of courtship nickers and agonistic squeals produced by Przwewalski's and Mongolian domestic stallions. Our acoustic analyses indicated that agonistic squeals produced by Przwewalski's stallions were significantly higher in source-related acoustic parameters and in the frequency of maximal energy than those produced by Mongolian domestic stallions. In addition to species differences, we found context-related differences in Przwewalski's stallion vocalizations. Courtship nickers were significantly lower in fundamental frequencies than agonistic squeals.Our findings suggest that acoustic differences between nickers and squeals could reflect underlying motivational states in Przwewalski's horses. Interspecies differences in acoustic structure however, are restricted to agonistic squeals. From an evolutionary standpoint, the lack of interspecies differences in courtship vocalizations suggest that similar factors influence the evolution of courtship calls whereas the differences found in agonistic vocalizations indicate that different factors modulate the evolution of agonistic calls.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEquus 3aacoustic properties 3abreeding season 3acourtship 3adivergent evolution 3aenergy 3ahabitats 3ainterspecific variation 3astallions 3avocalization 0aPrzwewalski's horse 0aMongolian native horse 0aVocalizations 0aCourtship context 0aAgonistic context1 aCaudullo, Eugenia1 aChan, Winnie Y.1 aBandi, Namkhai1 aPanzera, Michele0 tApplied animal behaviour science.g2016 Jan., v. 174 p.70-75dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35407x0168-15917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2015.10.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03010naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002200155245012500177500001900302520160400321592002801925650001701953650001201970650002301982650001702005650002502022650001502047650002002062650001502082650002302097650002302120650001102143650001602154650001502170650001702185651001402202653002202216653001902238653001602257700002202273700001502295700002102310773011002331856009002441852000902531655001202540IND60721910920221119180557.0210408e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072191092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landurbplan.2020.1040222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLonsdorf, Eric V.10aAssessing urban ecosystem services provided by green infrastructure: Golf courses in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWith more than half the world’s population living in urban areas, most of people’s potential to receive ecosystem service benefits occurs in cities. However a straightforward, replicable approach to quantifying multiple urban ecosystem services has yet to emerge, so urban planning decisions often overlook the value nature could provide people. Urbanization is likely to increase development pressure on many forms of green spaces across cities, particularly for golf courses that represent a substantial part of urban areas in the United States. Here, we developed a replicable process to assess how the supply of three urban ecosystem services (urban cooling, stormwater nutrient retention, and pollinator abundance) change with alternative land uses, using golf course development in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area in Minnesota, USA as a case study. We developed a replicable framework to assess changes in urban ecosystem services and found that green infrastructure provided by golf courses provide an intermediate amount of services compared to five other land use options. Combining land cover with land use zoning data to parameterize existing ecosystem service models for urban use is an important advancement. Our study describes how to combine land use with land cover and provides insights for urban planners interested in exploring public consequences of land cover and land use changes in cities. The approach we’ve developed can be applied to land use change scenarios in other cities with comparable data and help integrate the value of nature into urban planning.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acooling 3aecosystem services 3agolf courses 3agreen infrastructure 3aland cover 3aland use change 3alandscapes 3ametropolitan areas 3anutrient retention 3apeople 3apollinators 3astormwater 3aurbanization 3aMinnesota 0aUrban heat island 0aUrban planning 0aPollination1 aNootenboom, Chris1 aJanke, Ben1 aHorgan, Brian P.0 tLandscape and urban planning.g2021 Apr., v. 208 p.104022-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12405x0169-20467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2020.1040223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02022naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245013700163300001600300520096300316592002801279650001401307650001501321650000901336650002901345650001601374650001101390650001701401651001501418700003201433700001701465773011801482856007501600852000901675655001201684IND60129750520221119034819.0151126e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012975052DNAL7 a10.1645/GE-3036.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurreson, Eugene M.12aA New Species of Marine Leech (Hirudinida: Piscicolidae) from Giant Kelpfish, Heterostichus rostratus Girard, In Southern California  ap. 788-790.  aCollections of giant kelpfish at inner Cabrillo Beach, San Pedro, California revealed the presence of an undescribed species of Heptacyclus, described here as Heptacyclus cabrilloi n. sp.

The objectives of this study were to (i) investigate genetic diversity in CIMMYT subtropical, tropical midaltitude and highland inbreds with simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, (ii) identify appropriate testers for the development of new inbred lines, (iii) compare this sample to U.S. and European elite maize lines and CIMMYT tropical lowland inbreds, and (iv) use the marker and pedigree information as a guide to understanding the heterotic relationship among the CIMMYT maize lines (CMLs) and their potential practical use in maize breeding programs worldwide. Inbreds included in the study were assayed with 79 SSR markers. The CIMMYT inbred lines originated from 35 mostly broad-based populations and pools with mixed origins. A total of 566 alleles were scored, (averaging 7.2 and ranging from 2 to 16 alleles per locus). The modified Roger's distance (MRD) between pairs of inbreds averaged 0.78, with a range of 0.45 to 0.93. Unweighted paired group method using arithmetic averages (UPGMA) cluster analysis revealed no clear clustering. This reflects a mixed composition of CIMMYT subtropical, tropical midaltitude and highland maize populations and pools, and indicates that large amounts of variation have been incorporated into CIMMYT germplasm. Temperate heterotic groups were separated based on the markers, and nontemperate CIMMYT maize was genetically distinct from temperate lines. Discrete clusters were difficult to identify within and often between megaenvironments.

This paper proposes a multi-aperture multispectral imaging system based on notch filters that overcomes this limitation by allowing light from most of the spectrum to pass through. Based on this imaging principle, a prototype multi-aperture multispectral imaging system comprising notch filters was built and demonstrated. Further, a dictionary learning- and total variation-based spectral super-resolution algorithm was developed to reconstruct spectral images. The simulation results obtained using public multispectral datasets showed that, compared to the dictionary learning-based spectral super-resolution algorithm, the proposed algorithm reconstructed the spectral information with a higher accuracy and removed noise, and the verification experiments confirmed the performance efficiency of the prototype system. The experimental results showed that the proposed imaging system can capture images with high spatial and spectral resolutions under low illumination conditions. The proposed algorithm improved the spectral resolution of the acquired data from 9 to 31 bands, and the average peak signal-to-noise ratio remained above 43 dB, which is 13 dB higher than those of the state-of-the-art coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging methods. Simultaneously, the frame rate of the imaging system was up to 5000 frames/s under natural daylight.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3adata collection 3alighting 3aprototypes 3asignal-to-noise ratio 3asolar radiation 3aspectral analysis1 aLin, Peng 1 aChow, Alexander,1 aZhou, Bin 1 aWu, Xianyu 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Aug. 22, v. 14, no. 16dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs141641153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01796naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245017000162300001600332520066500348592002801013650001201041650001301053650001301066650001401079650002001093650001201113650001601125650000901141650001201150651002501162700002501187700002001212773011801232856007501350852000901425655001201434IND60129750620221119034927.0151126e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012975062DNAL7 a10.1645/GE-3040.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBursey, Charles R.10aHelminths of Cnemidophorus ruthveni (Squamata: Teiidae) from Bonaire, Netherlands Antilles, with Description of A New Species of Alaeuris (Nematoda: Pharyngodonidae)  ap. 795-800.  aAlaeuris rinconensis n. sp.

The magnitude of startle response can be modulated by external and internal variables and can be a useful tool to study the sensory-motor integration in animals. Different stimuli have been used to induce startle in horses, which makes it difficult to compare the responses to these different approaches. The present study uses ultra-short-term heart rate variability (HRV) analysis to characterize the cardiac autonomic modulation, reactivity assessment and blood cortisol measurements to describe the behavioural and endocrine responses to a simple, easy to replicate, effective and safe method of startle (an umbrella is abruptly opened near the horse). The ultra-short-term (64s) heart rate (HR) series were interpolated (4Hz) and divided into 256 points segments then the spectra calculated (Fast Fourier Transform). The spectra were then integrated into low (LF; 0.01–0.07Hz; Index of Cardiac Sympathetic Modulation) and high (HF; 0.07–0.50Hz; Index of Cardiac Parasympathetic Modulation) frequency bands. Following the startle test, the HR (p=0.0101), the power of the LF band of the cardiac interval spectrum (p=0.0002) and the LF/HF ratio (p=0.0066) were found to be higher, whereas the power of the HF band of the cardiac interval spectrum was found to be lower (p=0.0002). Also, the horses showed a noticeable escape response, with latency of reaction varying from 0.28 to 1.28s, duration of reaction ranging from 1.52 to 7.92s and escape distance covered varying from 3.43 to 9.97m. However, the endocrine measurements failed to reveal significant changes in the cortisol levels after the startle test. We conclude that the startle test used in the current study was effective to produce changes in behavioural parameters and cardiac autonomic modulation of the horses and can therefore be an appropriate tool for neurobiological studies. Furthermore, the use of ultra-short segments (64 s) for HRV analysis appears to be effective and promising for the detection of mental stress in horses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3aanimal behavior 3abehavior change 3acortisol 3aheart rate 3ahorses 3ahumans 3amodels 3apsychological stress 0aHorses 0aStartle response 0aUmbrella-opening 0aAutonomic response 0aCortisol 0aReactivity 0aBehaviour 0aCardiac interval variability 0aACTH 0aASR 0aFFT 0aHF 0aHR 0aHRV 0aLF 0aPSD 0aVLF1 aDias, Daniel Penteado Martins1 aTrigo, Pablo Ignacio1 aAlmeida, Norma Aparecida dos Santos1 aAlmeida, Fernando Queiroz de1 aMedeiros, Magda Alves de1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7902-419X0 tApplied animal behaviour science.g2016 Jan., v. 174 p.76-82dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35407x0168-15917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2015.10.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03100naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005800149245008100207500001900288520176900307592002802076650001902104650001502123650001002138650001302148650001102161650001902172650001402191650002402205650001202229653002002241653001202261653002402273700007102297700006402368700006502432773011202497856008402609852000902693655001202702IND60721911120221119180515.0210423e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072191112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jplph.2020.1533362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKeller, Isabel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4989-174310aImproved resource allocation and stabilization of yield under abiotic stress  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSugars are the main building blocks for carbohydrate storage, but also serve as signaling molecules and protective compounds during abiotic stress responses. Accordingly, sugar transport proteins fulfill multiple roles as they mediate long distance sugar allocation, but also shape the subcellular and tissue-specific carbohydrate profiles by balancing the levels of these molecules in various compartments. Accordingly, transporter activity represents a target by classical or directed breeding approaches, to either, directly increase phloem loading or to increase sink strength in crop species. The relative subcellular distribution of sugars is critical for molecular signaling affecting yield-relevant processes like photosynthesis, onset of flowering and stress responses, while controlled long-distance sugar transport directly impacts development and productivity of plants. However, long-distance transport is prone to become unbalanced upon adverse environmental conditions. Therefore, we highlight the influence of stress stimuli on sucrose transport in the phloem and include the role of stress induced cellular carbohydrate sinks, like raffinose or fructans, which possess important roles to build up tolerance against challenging environmental conditions. In addition, we report on recent breeding approaches that resulted in altered source and sink capacities, leading to increased phloem sucrose shuttling in crops. Finally, we present strategies integrating the need of cellular stress-protection into the general picture of long-distance transport under abiotic stress, and point to possible approaches improving plant performance and resource allocation under adverse environmental conditions, leading to stabilized or even increased crop yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabiotic stress 3acrop yield 3acrops 3afructans 3aphloem 3aphotosynthesis 3araffinose 3aresource allocation 3asucrose 0aSugar transport 0aFructan 0aPlant biotechnology1 aRodrigues, Cristina Martins1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4849-15371 aNeuhaus, H.

Fifty-six 24-month-old Australian Brahman bulls were electroejaculated and samples were examined to determine the percentage of morphologically normal sperm (PNS24) and the seminal plasma protein composition was identified and quantified by 2-D gel electrophoresis. The total integrated optical density of 152 seminal plasma protein spots (SPPs) across all gels was determined using the PDQuest software version 8.0 (Bio Rad, USA). Using a single regression mixed model with the density of individual spots as a covariate for PNS24, 17 SPPs were significantly associated with PNS24 (p<0.05). A multiple regression analyses of these SPPs, using three models; non-parametric Tree Model, Generalized Additive Model, and a step-wise selection method were conducted, and 6 SPPs could be used to predict PNS24; four SPPs had positive and two had negative association with PNS24. Together these spots explained 35% of the phenotypic variation in PNS24. Using mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF and TripleToF-MS) the SPPs with positive relationship contained mainly apolipoprotein A-I (1310), protein DJ-1 and glutathione peroxidase 3 (2308), phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (6402) and apolipoprotein A-I and secretoglobin family 1D member (8008). The SPPs inversely associated with PNS24 were clusterin/seminal plasma protein A3 (1411) and epididymal secretory protein E1 (8108). This is the first comprehensive report on the association between seminal plasma protein composition in Bos indicus Brahman bulls and sperm morphology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrahman 3aabsorbance 3aapolipoprotein A-I 3abulls 3acomputer software 3aepididymis 3agels 3aglutathione peroxidase 3amass spectrometry 3aphenotypic variation 3aphosphoglycerate kinase 3aprotein composition 3aregression analysis 3aseminal plasma proteins 3aspermatozoa 3astatistical models 3atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis 3azebu 3aUnited States 0aSeminal plasma proteomics 0aSperm morphology 0aBrahman cattle1 aRego, J.P.A.1 aCrisp, J.M.1 aMoura, A.A.1 aNouwens, A.S.1 aLi, Y.1 aVenus, B.1 aBurns, B.M.1 aMcGowan, M.R.0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2015 Nov., v. 162 p.20-30dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11636x0378-43207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2015.09.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01805naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002700146245013300173300002000306520072100326592002801047650001201075650002101087650002501108650001701133650001801150650001101168650001101179700001901190700002101209700001701230773012901247856008201376852000901458655001201467IND60566943020221119034616.0170416e20160825xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056694302DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b029702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcia-Pintos, Delfina10aHydrodeoxygenation of Phenol to Benzene and Cyclohexane on Rh(111) and Rh(211) Surfaces: Insights from Density Functional Theory  ap. 18529-18537.  aHerein we describe the C–O cleavage of phenol and cyclohexanol over Rh(111) and Rh(211) surfaces using density functional theory calculations. Our analysis is complemented by a microkinetic model of the reactions, which indicates that the C–O bond cleavage of cyclohexanol is easier than that of phenol and that Rh(211) is more active than Rh(111) for both reactions. This indicates that phenol will react mainly following a pathway of initial hydrogenation to cyclohexanol followed by hydrodeoxygenation to cyclohexane. We show that there is a general relationship between the transition state and the final state of both C–O cleavage reactions, and that this relationship is the same for Rh(111) and Rh(211).  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzene 3achemical bonding 3acleavage (chemistry) 3acyclohexanes 3ahydrogenation 3amodels 3aphenol1 aVoss, Johannes1 aJensen, Anker D.1 aStudt, Felix0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2016 Aug. 25, v. 120, no. 33 p.18529-18537dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.6b029703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02619naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024003300124040001800157100002100175245009700196506007600293506003100369520126100400592002801661596002601689596004701715596000901762506003701771650002601808650001401834650003101848650001101879650001701890651000901907700002001916700001901936700001601955700001901971700001601990773010502006856007702111852000902188655001202197IND60736795620221207101841.0220901e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073679562DNAL7 a10.1093/jipm/pmaa0102doi7 a10.1093/jipm/pmaa0102chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMueller, Daren S10aUsing Design Interventions to Develop Communication Solutions for Integrated Pest Management  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aIowa State University’s (ISU) Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program partnered with the ISU College of Design (COD) to use Design Thinking and other practical design methodologies and theories to identify and develop approaches to address IPM extension and communication issues. ISU IPM met with agriculture industry, program colleagues, and ISU COD faculty to discuss IPM-related needs in agriculture and to determine the program’s primary challenges. ISU COD faculty developed a two-semester course for undergraduate students, allocating various resources to solve these challenges. Undergraduates in the course, as the primary agents and problem solvers, developed various strategies the IPM program and its colleagues could implement. A model of interdisciplinary collaboration was developed, where design and science may function as equal partners in a design education setting. In our collaboration, the partners bought into a design-led process-based methodology that began with identifying IPM communication needs. This project resulted in unique design interventions to communicate IPM to stakeholders and the public, as well as created a model for interdisciplinary cooperation that can be exported to fields outside of agriculture and IPM.  aPublisher supplied data  cIowa State University  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture  cUSDA0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagricultural industry 3aeducation 3aintegrated pest management 3amodels 3astakeholders 3aIowa1 aStewart, Austin1 aClifford, Ryan1 aIles, Laura1 aSisson, Adam J1 aStaker, Jay0 tJournal of Integrated Pest Management.dOxford University Press (OUP)wJournal:2278x2155-74707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jipm/pmaa0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03549naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245013300168520201000301592002802311650001302339650001302352650002802365650001602393650002402409650001102433650001502444650002402459650001502483650001402498650002402512650001602536650001102552653001602563653002002579653001302599653002302612653000802635653001802643653001502661653002202676653002902698700002002727700002102747700005502768700002102823773009402844856008402938852000903022655001203031IND60721911220221119180528.0210423e20210501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072191122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2020.1050682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoth, Katie A.10aAssociations between parental perception of- and concern about-child weight and use of specific food-related parenting practices  aLittle is known about the association between parental perception of their child's weight as well as parent's current and future concerns regarding their child's weight and a broad range of food-related parenting practices. This study used the first wave of cross-sectional data from the longitudinal Family Matters study to examine the relationships between parental perception of child weight status, parent concern for child's current and future weight and parent use of different types of food-related practices. Parent/child dyads (n = 150) were recruited from primary care clinics. Multiple regression models were fit to examine cross-sectional relationships between parental perception and concern for their child's weight and food-related parenting practices (food restriction, pressure-to-eat, food control, food monitoring, nutrition education, and parent modeling). Parents who perceived their child to be underweight had lower scores for food restriction than parents who perceived their child to be overweight. Parents who reported concern about their child's current weight reported higher scores for food restriction and monitoring than parents who were not currently concerned. Parents who reported concern about their child's future weight status reported higher scores for pressure-to-eat and monitoring than parents who were not at all concerned about their child's future weight status. The relationship between parental perception of child's current weight status and parent use of food restriction, pressure-to-eat, and overall food control was modified by child sex. Overall, results suggest that parent's perceptions of and concerns about their child's current and future weight status were correlated with their feeding approaches. Health care providers may want to consider providing anticipatory guidance for parents that have concerns about their child's weight by teaching them about positive, evidence-based ways they can engage in healthy food-related parenting practices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aappetite 3achildren 3across-sectional studies 3afood safety 3ahealth care workers 3amodels 3amonitoring 3anutrition education 3aoverweight 3aparenting 3aregression analysis 3aunderweight 3aweight 0aRestriction 0aPressure-to-eat 0aModeling 0aChild food control 0aBMI 0aWeight status 0aOverweight 0aChildhood obesity 0aParent feeding behaviors1 aMohamed, Nabila1 aTrofholz, Amanda1 aTate, Allan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6039-28681 aBerge, Jerica M.0 tAppetite.g2021 May 01, v. 160 p.105068-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2020.1050683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02987naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002300155245011800178300001400296520167700310592002801987650002002015650002202035650000902057650001902066650002402085650001902109650001602128650001402144653000702158653001402165653001702179700002102196700001502217700006302232700005802295700001502353773011002368856009002478852000902568655001202577IND60532558120221123032829.0190405e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053255812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2015.09.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMata-Campuzano, M.10aMotility of liquid stored ram spermatozoa is altered by dilution rate independent of seminal plasma concentration  ap. 31-36.  aThe fertility after use of liquid stored ram semen following cervical AI rapidly decreases if semen is stored beyond 12h. The dilution of seminal plasma is often cited as a key contributor to the diminished motility and fertility of ram spermatozoa subjected to liquid preservation. Two experiments were conducted to assess the effect of spermatozoa concentration (i.e. dilution rate) and percentage of seminal plasma on the motility and viability of liquid stored ram spermatozoa. In Experiment 1, semen was diluted to one of seven concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 1.4×109spermatozoa/ml with milk and assessed for motility after 3 or 24h of storage at 15°C. In Experiment 2, semen was collected and washed to remove seminal plasma before re-dilution to 0.2–1.4×109spermatozoa/ml with milk containing 0%, 20% or 40% (final v/v ratio) seminal plasma and assessed for viability and motility after 3 or 24h of storage at 15°C. Whereas motility was not affected by spermatozoa concentration after 3h of storage, the proportion of progressive spermatozoa decreased after 24h of storage when spermatozoa concentration was greater than 1.0×109spermatozoa/ml. The duration of preservation and the spermatozoa concentration affected spermatozoa motility but had no impact on spermatozoa viability. This negative effect of greater spermatozoa concentrations on motility was independent of the presence and the concentration of seminal plasma. The seminal plasma at both concentrations (20% and 40%) had a protective effect on spermatozoa motility after 24h of storage. These findings have the potential to improve the efficiency of cervical AI with liquid stored ram semen.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aprotective effect 3arams 3aseminal plasma 3asperm concentration 3asperm motility 3aspermatozoa 3aviability 0aAI 0aRam semen 0aPreservation1 aSoleilhavoup, C.1 aTsikis, G.1 aMartinez-Pastor, F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2987-43021 ade Graaf, S.P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0870-42191 aDruart, X.0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2015 Nov., v. 162 p.31-36dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11636x0378-43207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2015.09.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03319naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245009500168300001600263500001500279520184600294592002802140650001702168650001202185650001702197650001802214650001802232650001002250650001702260650000902277650002302286650001502309650002202324650001702346650002602363650001002389650002002399650001102419650001302430650002502443653002502468653002302493653001702516653001402533653001502547653001402562700002002576773009902596856008502695852000902780655001202789IND60541559620221119232421.0190318e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054155962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2014.05.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeszka, Beata10aEffects of soil disinfection on health status, growth and yield of strawberry stock plants  ap. 113-119.  a2019-12-06  aTwo strawberry nursery field trials comparing soil disinfection with different fumigants (metam sodium, dazomet, chloropicrin, chloropicrin +1,3D) and a steaming system exploiting the exothermic reaction between steam and CaO (Bioflash System™) were conducted in 2010–2012 to evaluate the effect of treatments on Verticillium dahliae Kleb. inhabiting the soil, and on plant health, growth and yield of strawberry daughter plants. Chemical fumigants and the Bioflash System™ decreased the number of V. dahliae colonies in the soil, which corresponded to reduced incidence of Verticillium wilt (efficacy about 80%). The use of chemical fumigants had a positive impact on the size of the mother plants. The surface area covered by plants grown on the treated plots was 1.1–1.7 times larger than plants grown on non-fumigated control plots. The number of runners, as well as daughter plants, produced from plants grown on plots treated with all chemical fumigants was significantly higher than in the non-fumigated control or in the plots treated with the Bioflash System™. The disinfection treatments significantly increased the yield of marketable daughter plants, approximately 1.5–3 times higher in comparison to plants grown on control plots. Steam disinfection with the Bioflash System™ was the least effective treatment in this respect. The differences in marketable plants yield among the chemical fumigants significantly affected the net marginal return and the return on investment of the crop. In this respect, the steam disinfection was economically efficient only in one season. The efficacy in controlling Verticillium wilt even with low doses of metam sodium and dazomet and their influence on yield and quality of daughter plants is confirming the feasibility of these fumigants for strawberry nursery management.  aPublisher supplied data 3astrawberries 3adazomet 3asurface area 3acalcium oxide 3ahealth status 3asteam 3achloropicrin 3asoil 3anursery management 3acrop yield 3aVerticillium wilt 3adisinfection 3afield experimentation 3ametam 3aheat production 3asodium 3asteaming 3aVerticillium dahliae 0aSoil-borne pathogens 0aChemical fumigants 0aActive steam 0aNurseries 0aStrawberry 0afumigants1 aMalusà, Eligio0 tCrop protection.g2014 Sept., v. 63 p.113-119dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2014.05.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02456naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245011900166300002000285520140900305592002801714650001201742650001301754650002101767650000901788650001201797650002201809650002301831700003201854700001601886773013801902856008102040852000902121655001202130IND60566943220210913000000.0210913e20160725xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056694322DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b034562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoftager, Simon12aA Density Functional Theory Study of the Ionic and Electronic Transport Mechanisms in LiFeBO₃ Battery Electrodes  ap. 18355-18364.  aLithium iron borate is an attractive cathode material for Li-ion batteries due to its high specific capacity and low-cost, earth-abundant constituents. However, experiments have observed poor electrochemical performance due to the formation of an intermediate phase, that is, LiₓFeBO₃, which leads to large overvoltages at the beginning of charge. Using a convex-hull analysis, based on Hubbard-corrected density functional theory (DFT+U), we identify this intermediate phase as Li₀.₅FeBO₃. Moreover, we show by means of the nudged elastic band (NEB) method, that the origin of these adverse electrochemical effects can be explained by an intrinsically low Li-ion and electron/hole-polaron mobility in Li₀.₅FeBO₃ due to high activation barriers for both the ionic and electronic transport. These studies include the effects of the experimentally reported commensurate modulation. We have also investigated the Li-ion/hole diffusion through the interface between Li₀.₅FeBO₃ and LiFeBO₃, which is found not to result in additional kinetic limitations from Li diffusion across the intraparticle interfaces. These findings suggest that the experimentally observed diminished performance associated with the formation of intermediate phases is linked to the intrinsically poor properties of the Li₀.₅FeBO₃ phase rather than to the presence of interfaces between different phases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aborates 3acathodes 3aelectrochemistry 3airon 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3aphysical chemistry1 aGarcía-Lastra, Juan María1 aVegge, Tejs0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2016 July 25, v. 120, no. 33 p.18355-18364dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b034563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02731naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245011300167300001800280520120200298592002801500650004401528650001201572650001001584650001601594650001901610650002901629650002101658650001801679650003901697650001901736650002101755650002501776650001501801653002001816653002201836653001801858653003201876653001501908700001701923700001701940700001501957700001601972700001601988773013902004856008502143852000902228655001202237IND60580612120221122045001.0170923e20171102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058061212DNAL7 a10.1080/10942912.2016.12470962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Yanjun10aFunctionality of milk protein concentrate 80 with emulsifying salts and its applications in analogue cheeses  ap. 2594-2607.  aMilk protein concentrate 80 (MPC80) was prepared with different emulsifying salts (ES). The effects on particle size (D50), solubility, and surface hydrophobicity (H ₀) of MPC80 were then observed after production. The molecular weight and secondary structure of MPC80 protein were also investigated through sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometry. Particle size (D50) was reduced from 31.37 to 20.67 μm following the addition of sodium phosphate (SPS). The solubility of MPC80 fortified with sodium citrate salt (SCS), SPS, and sodium pyrophosphate (SPP) was improved by 80.32, 78.23, and 55.80%, respectively. The SDS-PAGE pattern showed no significant difference between the control and single-ES-fortified samples, but major protein bands (α ₛ-CN, β-CN, κ-CN, BSA, and β-LG) had a stronger intensity than binary-ES-fortified MPC80. The FTIR results showed that the β-sheet content of ES-fortified MPC80 was relatively higher than that in the control. Compared with analogue cheeses made by MPC80 with and without ES, SCS–SPP (92:8)-modified MPC80 presented a better fluid mass and homogeneous colour.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3acheeses 3acolor 3aemulsifying 3ahydrophobicity 3amilk protein concentrate 3amolecular weight 3aparticle size 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3asodium citrate 3asodium phosphate 3asodium pyrophosphate 3asolubility 0aAnalogue cheese 0aEmulsifying salts 0aFunctionality 0aMilk protein concentrate 80 0aSolubility1 aLiu, Zhenmin1 aLi, Hongjuan1 aLi, Siming1 aMo, Beihong1 aLv, Jiaping0 tInternational journal of food properties.g2017 Nov. 2, v. 20, no. 11 p.2594-2607dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl56717x1094-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10942912.2016.12470963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03163naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245009800165300001600263520163500279592002801914596006901942596005702011650001102068650002002079650001002099650002202109650001902131650003302150650001502183650001402198650001802212650001602230651001002246651000902256651001202265700001302277700001602290700002402306700001302330700001902343700002002362700002002382700006002402773011602462856008202578852000902660655001202669IND60749142920221116155814.0210828e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074914292DNAL7 a10.1007/s11418-021-01512-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSone, Mikako10aGenetic diversity of Amomum xanthioides and its related species from Southeast Asia and China  ap. 798-812.  aAmomum Semen, the seed mass of Amomum xanthioides, has been imported from Southeast Asia and China and used for the treatment of gastric and intestinal disorders. A. xanthioides has been treated as a synonym of A. villosum var. xanthioides. Furthermore, A. villosum var. villosum, A. villosum var. xanthioides, or A. longiligulare have been described as the botanical origin of Amomi Fructus, which is a similar crude drug in Chinese Pharmacopoeia. Under these circumstances, the botanical origin of Amomum Semen was changed to A. villosum var. xanthioides, A. villosum var. villosum, or A. longiligulare in Supplement II to the 17th edition of the Japanese Pharmacopoeia. To develop an objective identification method for Amomum Semen and to confirm the phylogenetic relationship among Amomum taxa, the nucleotide sequences of the nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer region and chloroplast DNA partial matK-trnK and trnH-psbA intergenic spacer regions were determined in specimens collected from Southeast Asia and China, including those from the type localities of each taxon. Six taxa were divided into four groups. A. xanthioides from Myanmar belonging to group 1 was discriminated from A. villosum var. xanthioides from China of group 2. A. villosum and its varieties were divided into two groups: group 2 included those from China, and group 3 consisted of A. villosum from Laos. A. longiligulare from China and Laos and A. uliginosum from Laos belonged to group 3 and group 4, respectively. These findings illustrate the phylogenetic basis for the need for taxonomical reorganization among the Amomum species.  aPublisher supplied data  aJP20ak0101046cJapan Agency for Medical Research and Development  a15H05268cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science 3aAmomum 3achloroplast DNA 3adrugs 3agenetic variation 3aintergenic DNA 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aintestines 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal DNA 3aseed weight 3aChina 3aLaos 3aMyanmar1 aZhu, Shu1 aCheng, Xiao1 aKetphanh, Sounthone1 aSwe, Swe1 aTun, Than Lwin1 aKawano, Noriaki1 aKawahara, Nobuo1 aKomatsu, Katsuko1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0833-71990 tNatural medicines.g2021 Sept., v. 75, no. 4 p.798-812dSpringer SingaporewJournal:jnl4059015x1340-34437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11418-021-01512-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02701naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245007800154300001600232520181900248592002802067653001602095653001102111653001602122653001402138653001902152700001402171773014302185856007402328852000902402655001202411IND60681640220221120143848.0200226e20180606xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068164022DNAL7 a10.3920/CEP1800092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavies, E.14aThe psychological responses of amateur riders to their horses’ injuries  ap. 135-142.  aEquestrian sport is considered a high-risk environment for equine injury. Due to the close bond between horse and rider, it could be theorised that riders may be impacted psychologically by their horses’ injuries, as seen in athletic pairs and with companion animal ownership. The extensive time commitment and responsibility of care within equestrian sport means that horse riders’ day-to-day life is impacted in a way not seen in other sporting or leisure environments, thus providing a unique opportunity to investigate the psychological responses of riders to their horse’s injury. The aims of this study were to investigate the psychological responses that amateur riders experienced when their horses were injured. 308 amateur horse riders (16 male and 292 female, median age 25-30 category) completed the Psychological Response to Sport Injury Inventory (19-item) (PRSII) and questions regarding demographics, investment in equestrian sport, the horse’s injury and the length of rehabilitation. Devastation was significantly affected by the weekly time investment of riders (H(3)=8.255, P=0.041) and the length of ownership prior to the injury (H(2)=7.690, P=0.021). ‘Devastation’, ‘feeling cheated’, ‘restlessness’ and ‘isolation’ were all significantly affected by the length of rehabilitation for the horse (H(7)=70.825, P=0.000, H(7)=37.799, P=0.000, H(7)=37.799, P=0.004, and H(7)=27.486, P=0.000, respectively). These findings suggest that amateur horse riders are at risk of psychological distress when their horse becomes injured. Whilst the industry has developed strategies to support owners following euthanasia which are already in place, psychological support following horse injury may be necessary to buffer psychological ‘devastation’ within amateur horse owners.  aPublisher supplied data 0ahorse-owner 0ainjury 0adevastation 0aisolation 0arehabilitation1 aJames, S.0 tComparative exercise physiology.g2018 June 6, v. 14, no. 2 p.135-142dWageningen Academic PublisherswJournal:J000000061x1755-25597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3920/CEP1800093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03374naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245008000164300001800244500000900262520200500271592002802276650002202304650002002326650002202346650002602368650002602394650001402420650001302434650001602447650001102463650002102474650001602495650002202511650000902533650001702542651001002559651001102569651002302580700002502603700001502628700001702643700001902660773012302679856008102802852000902883655001202892IND60665271020221118084007.0191228e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066527102DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2004.04432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHanson, B. D.10aPollen-Mediated Gene Flow from Blue Aleurone Wheat to Other Wheat Cultivars  ap. 1610-1617.  aepub  aCross-pollination among wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars historically has not been a major concern for wheat producers. However, with the introduction of genetically engineered wheat, there may be a need to ensure genetic purity, which will require knowledge of the frequency and distance that pollen-mediated gene flow can occur in wheat. This information will be necessary to develop (i) isolation distances that maintain predictable degrees of genetic purity in seed wheat production and (ii) practices to manage pollen-mediated gene flow in commercial wheat production. Field experiments were conducted from 2000 to 2003 at five locations in Oregon, Idaho, and Washington to determine the potential for pollen-mediated gene flow among winter wheat cultivars. Each experiment was designed as a Nelder wheel with 16 equally spaced rays extending away from a central pollen source of blue aleurone wheat. Each ray was 46 m long and contained two rows each of an early- and late-flowering soft white wheat cultivar. Seed samples were collected at 1.8-m intervals along each ray and examined for blue seed, which indicated successful hybridization with the pollen source. Although blue seed was found in some samples at all five locations, most samples (98%) contained no blue seed. Pollen-mediated gene flow generally was in the direction of the prevailing wind and tended to occur more often at the sites with lower temperature and higher humidity during pollination. The maximum distance that gene flow was detected was 42 m from the pollen source and the maximum outcrossing in an individual sample was 0.45%. At four locations, no outcrossing was detected beyond 30 m from the pollen source; however, at one site, 13% of the blue seed was found between 30 and 42 m. Pollen-mediated gene flow potential may differ for other wheat cultivars and environmental conditions. Depending on the required genetic purity standards for wheat seed, an isolation distance of 45 m or more may be required.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3acrop production 3across pollination 3aenvironmental factors 3afield experimentation 3agene flow 3ahumidity 3aoutcrossing 3apollen 3asoft white wheat 3atemperature 3atransgenic plants 3awind 3awinter wheat 3aIdaho 3aOregon 3aWashington (state)1 aMallory-Smith, C.

Previous studies on the host range of the CyHV-3 found that fish species other than koi and common carp are fully resistant to natural virus exposure. Recently, CyHV-3 was detected in goldfish (Carassius auratus auratus) that were in contact with CyHV-3 infected koi. In the present study, a specific RT-PCR product was amplified from the viral thymidine kinase gene in gills, intestine and brain tissues of CyHV-3 infected goldfish. This implied that CyHV-3 replicated in these goldfish. Also, in the presence of a stress factor such as temperature fluctuation, the CyHV-3 infected goldfish transmitted the virus to cohabitated naïve SPF common carp. CyHV-3 DNA was detected in the cohabitated naïve carp tissues by PCR. The results of this study demonstrate that goldfish is a carrier for CyHV-3, permit virus propagation, and disseminate the virus to susceptible carp causing the disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarassius auratus 3aCyprinid herpesvirus 3 3aCyprinus carpio 3aDNA 3abrain 3afish production 3agenes 3agills 3agoldfish 3ahost range 3aintestines 3akoi 3apolymerase chain reaction 3atemperature 3athymidine kinase 3aviruses 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCarpsxvirology 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Viralxgenetics 2aElectrophoresis, Agar Gelxveterinary 2aFish Diseasesxtransmissionxvirology. 2aGoldfishxvirology 2aHerpesviridaexgeneticsxpathogenicity. 2aHerpesviridae Infectionsxtransmissionxveterinaryxvirology. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aRNA, Viralxgenetics 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reactionxveterinary1 aSoliman, Hatem0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2011 June, v. 90, no. 3 p.536-539dElsevier India Pvt Ltd.x0034-52887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2010.07.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04786naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001900191245011300210300001800323506007600341520243400417592002802851506003702879650001202916650002402928650002002952650001902972650001402991650002703005650002503032650002503057650002103082650003503103650002703138650002003165650003603185650002303221650001303244650001303257650001503270650001703285650001303302650001503315650002003330650002403350650000903374650001403383650001903397650002603416650002003442651001503462653002703477653003003504653002103534653003203555653001803587653002003605700003403625700002103659700001803680700002103698700003103719700001903750700005803769773010703827856008503934852000904019655001204028IND60610406720221207134157.0181207e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061040672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2018.07.0272doi7 aPMC66385512pmcid7 a300758612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Hongtai10aInvestigation of association between environmental and socioeconomic factors and preterm birth in California  ap. 1066-1078.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPreterm birth (PTB),22PTB: preterm birth defined as birth at gestational age <37 weeks, is a major public health concern. Infants born prematurely, comprising of about 10% of the US newborns, have elevated risks of neonatal mortality and a wide array of health problems. Although numerous clinical, genetic, environmental and socioeconomic factors have been implicated in PTB, very few studies investigate the impacts of multiple pollutants and social factors on PTB using large scale datasets.To evaluate association between environmental and socioeconomic factors and PTB in California.We linked the birth cohort file maintained by the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development from 2009 to 2012 years across 1.8 million births and the CalEnviroScreen 3.0 dataset from California Communities Environmental Health Screening Tool at the census tract level for 56 California counties. CalEnviroScreen contains 7 exposure and 5 environmental effects variables that constitute the Pollution Burden variable, and 5 socioeconomic variables. We evaluated relationships between environmental exposures and the risk of PTB using hierarchical clustering analyses and GIS-based visualization. We also used logistic regression to evaluate the relationship between specific pollutant and exposure indicators and PTB, accounted for socio-demographic determinants such as maternal race/ethnicity, maternal age, maternal education and payment of delivery costs.There exists geographic variability in PTB for groups of counties with similar environmental and social exposure profiles. We found an association between Pollution Burden, particulate matter ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5), and Drinking Water Scores and PTB (adjusted odds ratios were 1.03 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.01, 1.04), 1.03 (95% CI: 1.02,1.04), and 1.04 (95% CI: 1.03,1.05), respectively). Additional findings suggest that certain drinking water contaminants such as arsenic and nitrate are associated with PTB in California.CalEnviroScreen data combined with birth records offer great opportunity for revealing novel exposures and evaluating cumulative exposures related to PTB by providing useful environmental and social information.

R.10aData analysis workflow for the detection of canine vector-borne pathogens using 16 S rRNA Next-Generation Sequencing  ap. 262.  aBACKGROUND: Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) impact both human and veterinary medicine and pose special public health challenges. The main bacterial vector-borne pathogens (VBPs) of importance in veterinary medicine include Anaplasma spp., Bartonella spp., Ehrlichia spp., and Spotted Fever Group Rickettsia. Taxon-targeted PCR assays are the current gold standard for VBP diagnostics but limitations on the detection of genetically diverse organisms support a novel approach for broader detection of VBPs. We present a methodology for genetic characterization of VBPs using Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) and computational approaches. A major advantage of NGS is the ability to detect multiple organisms present in the same clinical sample in an unsupervised (i.e. non-targeted) and semi-quantitative way. The Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) presented here combines industry-standard microbiome analysis tools with our ad-hoc bioinformatic scripts to form a complete analysis pipeline accessible to veterinary scientists and freely available for download and use at https://github.com/eltonjrv/microbiome.westernu/tree/SOP . RESULTS: We tested and validated our SOP by mimicking single, double, and triple infections in genomic canine DNA using serial dilutions of plasmids containing the entire 16 S rRNA gene sequence of (A) phagocytophilum, (B) v. berkhoffii, and E. canis. NGS with broad-range 16 S rRNA primers followed by our bioinformatics SOP was capable of detecting these pathogens in biological replicates of different dilutions. These results illustrate the ability of NGS to detect and genetically characterize multi-infections with different amounts of pathogens in a single sample. CONCLUSIONS: Bloodborne microbiomics & metagenomics approaches may help expand the molecular diagnostic toolbox in veterinary and human medicine. In this paper, we present both in vitro and in silico detailed protocols that can be combined into a single workflow that may provide a significant improvement in VBP diagnostics and also facilitate future applications of microbiome research in veterinary medicine.  aPublisher supplied data  a02292 and 02528cAmerican Kennel Club Canine Health Foundation 3aAnaplasma 3aBartonella 3aRickettsia 3abioinformatics 3acomputer simulation 3adiagnostic techniques 3adogs 3afever 3ahumans 3amedicine 3ametagenomics 3amicrobiome 3anucleotide sequences 3aplasmids 3apublic health 3aveterinary medicine1 aRoy, Chayan1 aGeiger, Joseph A.1 aOney, Kristina M.1 aKoo, Melody1 aRen, Songyang1 aOakley, Brian B.1 aDiniz, Pedro Paulo V.

Separation performance of a heating ramp in temperature-programmed gas chromatography  ap. 148-160.  aMetrics of separation performance described in Part 1 of this series were applied here to theoretical evaluation of performance of a heating ramp in temperature-programmed GC. As in Part 1, the dependence of the separation (Δs) of two arbitrarily spaced peaks (the number of σ-slots between them) on operational parameters of GC analysis was treated here as the main building block for construction of other performance metrics. Simple expressions describing Δs of two peaks eluting during isobaric linear heating ramp and dependence of Δs on the heating rate, on column efficiency and on the peak spacing were derived. The use of dimensionless heating rate and other dimensionless operational parameters made these expressions universally suitable for different column dimensions, heating rates, carrier gas types, flow rates, etc. The use of dimensionless parameters also made it possible to express Δs as a simple function of the earlier introduced chromatographically meaningful characteristic parameters of thermodynamics of solute–column interactions. The expressions for Δs developed here, together with the ones described in Part 1 were used for theoretical prediction of total separation capacity (sc), total peak capacity (nc), and total number of resolved peaks in temperature-programmed analysis controlled by a balanced temperature program consisting of a linear heating ramp preceded by specially designed balanced temperature plateau. A numerical example of these parameters for a particular column, heating rate, carrier gas, and its flow rate is also provided. It has been shown that nc obtainable in temperature-programmed analysis is 2–3 times larger than that obtainable in equally long isothermal analysis using the same column and gas. Comparison of this improvement with potentially more than an order of magnitude larger peak capacity of GC×GC has been discussed. Also described are the speed of analysis (the number of σ-slots per unit of time), and other characteristics of the separation performance of a heating ramp. In many respects, metric Δs is similar to the widely known metric of resolution (Rₛ). Advantages of Δs over Rₛ as a metric of the separation performance, as well as the advantages of other metrics utilized here over their widely known counterparts are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3agas chromatography 3aheat 3aprediction 3atemperature0 tJournal of chromatography.g2012 June 29, v. 1244 p.148-160dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2012.04.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03257naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245012100159300001800280520179800298592002802096650004402124650002202168650001702190650002002207650001402227650001402241650002202255650002002277650000902297650003802306650001602344650001002360650001102370650004402381650000902425650000702434650001202441650001602453650001402469650001602483650001502499650001802514700002302532700002102555700002002576773008602596856004802682852000902730655001202739IND50066320820221118090214.0130511e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006632082DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-013-9889-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Bin10aStability and solution concentration enhancement of resveratrol by solid dispersion in cellulose derivative matrices  ap. 1249-1260.  aResveratrol is a highly biologically active phytoalexin, found in many plant materials that are common elements of the human diet, such as grapes, nuts, and red wine. The therapeutic or disease preventative potential of this natural polyphenolic antioxidant has been limited in part due to its poor aqueous solubility and low oral bioavailability. We hypothesized that solid dispersion of resveratrol (Res) in cellulose derivative matrices might afford amorphous dispersions, from which supersaturated Res solutions would be produced in the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract, resulting in higher Res bioavailability. We carried out structure–property studies employing cellulose esters with a range of physical characteristics but possessing features suitable for use in amorphous solid dispersions: carboxymethylcellulose acetate butyrate (CMCAB), hydroxypropylmethylcellulose acetate succinate (HPMCAS) and cellulose acetate adipate propionate (CAAdP). The cellulose derivative results were compared with those of a negative control, pure crystalline Res, and a positive control, Res/poly(vinylpyrrolidinone) (PVP). Solid dispersions were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRPD), modulated differential scanning calorimetry (MDSC), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) of solid dispersions. HPMCAS and PVP solid dispersions afforded faster and more complete Res release at pH 6.8; however Res is also released from PVP matrices at pH 1.2. The carboxyl-containing cellulose derivatives release Res to only a small extent at pH 1.2. This combination of solution and solid phase stabilization against crystallization, and pH-triggered drug release makes these cellulose esters attractive candidates for Res bioavailability enhancement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aantioxidants 3abioavailability 3abutyrates 3acellulose 3acellulose acetate 3acrystallization 3adiet 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3adispersions 3adrugs 3agrapes 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3anuts 3apH 3apowders 3apropionates 3ared wines 3aresveratrol 3asolubility 3asuccinic acid1 aWegiel, Lindsay A.1 aTaylor, Lynne S.1 aEdgar, Kevin J.0 tCellulose.g2013 June, v. 20, no. 3 p.1249-1260dSpringer-Verlagx0969-02397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-013-9889-3  aDNAL 7aarticle02724naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001200150245021200162300001600374520150000390592002801890650002301918650002301941650002001964650002101984650004102005650001502046650002502061650001502086650002502101700001902126700001502145700001302160773009602173856008402269852000902353655001202362IND60112974220221123043626.0141111e20120629xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011297422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2012.04.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLai, Bo10aComprehensive analysis of the toxic and refractory pollutants in acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene resin manufacturing wastewater by gas chromatography spectrometry with a mass or flame ionization detector  ap. 161-167.  aAcrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene (ABS) resin manufacturing wastewater is a complicated, toxic and refractory industrial wastewater. Comprehensive and accurate analysis of the typical pollutants in ABS resin manufacturing wastewater is critical to develop cost-effective wastewater treatment technologies. In this paper, a comprehensively qualitative analysis combined with three complementary methods has been developed for the detection of typical pollutants in ABS resin manufacturing wastewater from three production sections, and thirty-seven compounds had been detected and further confirmed by this analysis method with standards. Simultaneous chromatographic separation and quantification of seven representative pollutants, including three mononuclear aromatics, three acrylonitrile dimers and one acrylonitrile derivative, were achieved by GC–FID system. The detection limits of this method for seven representative pollutants were in the range of 0.007–0.89mg/L. The within-day and between-day precisions of this method were less than 6.5% (RSD, n=6). The recoveries of the representative pollutants reached 90–120%. The ABS resin manufacturing wastewater from E zone was successfully determined by this method, with two mononuclear aromatics and three acrylonitrile dimers accounting for 57.73% and 40.63% of the selected seven compounds, respectively. These results reveal that the removal of mononuclear aromatics and acrylonitrile dimers is a key to treat this wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaromatic compounds 3acost effectiveness 3adetection limit 3aflame ionization 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3apollutants 3aqualitative analysis 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment1 aZhou, Baoying,1 aYang, Ping1 aWang, Ke0 tJournal of chromatography.g2012 June 29, v. 1244 p.161-167dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2012.04.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03267naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100002000187245015800207300001600365506007600381520159200457592002802049506003702077650002002114650000902134650002002143650001302163650000902176650001602185650001502201650002502216650004302241650002302284650001802307650001202325650001602337651001302353700002002366700002102386700002102407700002202428700002202450700002002472700002002492700002402512773011202536856008002648852000902728655001202737IND60625003520221207083703.0181206e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062500352DNAL7 a10.1177/01457217134914382doi7 aPMC39127442pmcid7 a237497742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIslam, Nadia S.10aEvaluation of a Community Health Worker Pilot Intervention to Improve Diabetes Management in Bangladeshi Immigrants With Type 2 Diabetes in New York City  ap. 478-493.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe purpose of this study is to explore the impact and feasibility of a pilot Community Health Worker (CHW) intervention to improve diabetes management among Bangladeshi-American individuals with type 2 diabetes living in New York City. Participants were recruited at clinic- and community-based venues. The intervention consisted of 6 monthly, CHW-facilitated group sessions on topics related to management of diabetes. Surveys were collected at baseline and follow-up time points. Study outcomes included clinical, behavioral, and satisfaction measures for participants, as well as qualitative measures from CHWs. Improvements were seen in diabetes knowledge, exercise and diet to control diabetes, frequency of checking feet, medication compliance, and self-efficacy of health and physical activity from baseline to 12 months. Additionally, there were decreases in A1C, weight, and body mass index. Program evaluation revealed a high acceptability of the intervention, and qualitative findings indicated that CHWs helped overcome barriers and facilitated program outcomes through communal concordance, trust, and leadership. The intervention demonstrated high acceptability and suggested efficacy in improving diabetes management outcomes among Bangladeshi immigrants in an urban setting. The US Bangladeshi population will continue to increase, and given the high rates of diabetes, as well as linguistic and economic barriers faced by this community, effective and culturally tailored health interventions are needed to overcome barriers and provide support for diabetes management.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abody mass index 3adiet 3adisease control 3aexercise 3afeet 3aimmigration 3aleadership 3amedication adherence 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aprogram evaluation 3aself-efficacy 3asurveys 3aurban areas 3aNew York1 aWyatt, Laura C.1 aPatel, Shilpa D.1 aShapiro, Ephraim1 aTandon, S.

The initial contents of total unsaturated fatty acid, total tocopherol (TToc), and carbonyl value (CV0) in 10 oils were distributed in the range of 83.49%–95.28%, 16.40–236.05 mg/100 g, and 2.36–6.30 μmol/g, respectively. During frying, the CV of 10 oils increased linearly with heating time at different rates. The effects of intrinsic factors (unsaturated fatty acid and tocopherol) on the CV increase were revealed by using multiple regression analysis. The results indicated that polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) and γ-tocopherol had the greatest effects on the CV increase, respectively. Based on these results, the ratio of the initial content of PUFA to that of TToc was selected as a prediction index and a prediction model, CVt=[4.37(PUFATToc)2−5.64(PUFATToc)+3.36]t+CV0, was established. Using this model, the CV of edible oil during frying at 180 °C can be predicted from the initial composition of the oil, or the frying life of edible oil can be inferred according to the maximum allowable CV (50 μmol/g) stipulated by regulations.  aPublisher supplied data 3afrying 3afrying oil 3agamma-tocopherol 3aheat 3aintrinsic factors 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 0aCommercial edible oil 0aPolyunsaturated fatty acid 0aTocopherol 0aCarbonyl value 0aPrediction model1 aWang, Shuo1 aMasui, Eitaro1 aTamogami, Shigeru1 aChen, Jieyu1 aZhang, Han0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2019 Sept. 18, dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2019.1086603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01813naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245006300163300001600226520064300242592002800885650000800913650001600921650001000937650001100947650000900958650001600967650005200983650001201035650002901047653002001076653001801096653001101114700001901125700002201144700001801166700003101184773010101215856007801316852000901394655001201403IND60549252220221118111220.0160909e20160802xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054925222DNAL7 a10.1515/aoas-2015-00802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZąbek, Tomasz14aThe Relevance of Methylation Profiles of Equine ITGAL Gene  ap. 711-720.  aOne of epigenetic features of mammalian genomes is methylation of DNA.

Don. Histochemistry demonstrated that pectin was located in the compound middle lamella (CML) of the maturing tracheid cell wall, in addition to the pit membranes and the CML of the ray cell walls. Immunogold labeling showed differential distribution of the pectin epitopes within the CML of the maturing cell walls. Moreover, in the xylem, the JIM5 and JIM7 epitopes were found to be restricted to distinct tissues. Neither epitope occurred in the secondary walls of the xylem cells. These patterns of epitope expression were not maintained in the mature cell. These results represent the first demonstration of restricted spatial patterns of distribution of these epitopes in the xylem tissue of radiata pine and are consistent with results from other coniferous gymnosperms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus radiata 3acell walls 3aconfocal microscopy 3adyes 3aelectron microscopy 3aepitopes 3ahistochemistry 3alight microscopy 3amonoclonal antibodies 3apectins 3apolymers 3awood anatomy 3axylem 0aCambium 0acell wall 0apectin 0awood quality1 aGerrard, Juliet A.1 aButterfield, Brian G.1 aJackson, Sandra L.0 tIAWA journal.g, v. 29, no. 2 p.115-127dBrillwJournal:6290x0928-15417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/22941932-900001733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02784naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245007900168300001600247520162600263592002801889650002601917650001901943650002101962650002201983650002202005650001302027651001802040653002602058653002002084653001902104653002602123653002402149653001902173773012502192856008402317852000902401655001202410IND60122444620221119220436.0150325e20131201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012244462DNAL7 a10.1080/1943815X.2013.8643162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoff, Michele10aNavigating US greenways: US political reflections in An Inconvenient Truth  ap. 219-233.  aEnvironmental discourses resonate with certain intrinsic values over others and shape environmental behaviours. Political ideology offers a powerful values-based heuristic for evaluating environmental messaging. The USA is a major global producer of greenhouse gases and the greatest industrialized nation holdout to political reform. A deeper understanding of the specific political-ideological forces at play in the US environmental debate can yield greater understanding of domestic ideology-based tensions and international US intractability by offering insight to the evolution of the US environmental movement and its political supporters and adversaries at home. Understanding what occurs within the US mindset in environmental discussions can help representatives of other nations frame more effective arguments and lead to policy reform. A textual analysis of a US environmental artefact deemed key to raising US global warming awareness, the documentary An Inconvenient Truth (2006), reveals that US politician/creator Al Gore simultaneously appeals to each of the three disparate – and conflicting – US political ideologies (liberalism, traditionalist conservatism, and individualist conservatism). The result is a transcendence of global warming from its entrenched liberal identity to moral identity, beyond political ideology, making it more comfortably accessible by members of multiple political ideologies rather than just liberals. Understanding the inherent US political-ideological dynamics of global warming can help the progress of this movement by informing framing of policy-shaping arguments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental science 3aglobal warming 3agreenhouse gases 3aindustrialization 3aissues and policy 3apolitics 3aUnited States 0aAn Inconvenient Truth 0aUS conservatism 0aglobal warming 0aUS political ideology 0aUS political values 0apolicy framing0 tJournal of integrative environmental sciences.g2013 Dec. 1, v. 10, no. 3-4 p.219-233dTaylor & Francisx1943-81687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1943815X.2013.8643163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01490naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100001600162245005400178300001600232500000900248520058300257592002800840650001300868650001200881650001100893650002100904650002200925650001300947773012200960856009701082852000901179655001201188IND60663406020221119164127.0191122e197001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066340602DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1970.00021962006200010041x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbel, G.

The selectivity nanosensor was based on the fluorescence “turn off–on” mode, which possessed high sensitivity features. The original strong fluorescence intensity of CuInS2 QDs was quenched by sodium hexametaphosphate (NaPO3)6. The high efficiency of the quenching was caused by the non-covalent binding of positively charged CuInS2 QDs to the negatively charged (NaPO3)6 through electrostatic interactions, aggregating to form a CuInS2 QDs/(NaPO3)6 complex. Adding acid phosphatase caused intense fluorescence of CuInS2 QDs/(NaPO3)6 to be recovered, and this was because of enzymolysis. (NaPO3)6 was hydrolyzed into small fragments and the high negative charge density decreased, which would weaken the strong electrostatic interactions. As a result, the quenched fluorescence “turned on”. Under the optimum conditions, there was a good linear relationship between I/I0 (I and I0 were the fluorescence intensity of CuInS2 QDs/(NaPO3)6 system in the presence and absence of acid phosphatase, respectively) and acid phosphatase concentration in the range of 75–1500nUmL−1 with the detection limit of 9.02nUmL−1. The proposed nanosensor had been utilized to detect and accurately quantify acid phosphatase in human serum samples with satisfactory results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid phosphatase 3aanalytical chemistry 3ablood serum 3adetection limit 3aelectrostatic interactions 3afluorescence 3ahumans 3arapid methods 3asodium 0aFluorescence “turn off–on” nanosensor 0aAggregation-caused quenching and enzymolysis 0aAcid phosphatase 0a(NaPO3)6 0aCuInS2 QDs1 aLin, Zihan1 aLiu, Linlin1 aSu, Xingguang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3053-46120 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2015 May 30, v. 876 p.83-90dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2015.03.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03990naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245010100167300001400268500001500282520210900297592002802406650001902434650000902453650002402462650002602486650001002512650001602522650001602538650001302554650001602567650001402583650001102597650001402608650001902622650001802641650001402659650001002673650001202683650001202695650002302707650001302730650002402743650001202767650002102779650002302800651001002823653001102833653001802844653003402862653002202896653003802918653001602956700001502972700001502987700001703002700001603019700001703035700001603052700001703068773012503085856008503210852000903295655001203304IND60515423620221118060613.0160315e20151218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051542362DNAL7 a10.1080/1943815X.2015.11183882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQin, Xiaobo10aEffect of rice cultivars on yield-scaled methane emissions in a double rice field in South China  ap. 47-66.  a2019-12-06  aRice cultivar is the most influential factor affecting methane emissions from double rice fields. A two-year field experiment was conducted at Huizhou, Guangdong province, South China, to identify from among nine cultivars those cultivars with high-yield potential and lower yield-scaled methane emissions (YSMEs). Methane emissions were measured using the static chamber – gas chromatograph method. Results indicate that the cultivars Qihuazhan (QH), Yexianzhan 8 (YX8) and Yue’erzhan (YE) provide higher rice grain yield (8.69%) with lower YSME (30.27%) compared to the other six cultivars (Yexianzhan 6, Yuejingsimiao, Hefengzhan, Huangsizhan, Huangruanzhan and Huangxiuzhan) (p < 0.05). In particular, QH has the highest yield potential (6777 kg ha ⁻¹) and lowest methane emission intensity (0.36 kg kg ⁻¹ yield) capacity. Methane emissions from the double rice field was found to be significantly (p < 0.05) and positively correlated with tiller number, culm biomass and soil organic matter, dissolved soil organic carbon and total carbon content, but negatively correlated (p < 0.05) with rice harvest index (HI), and root and panicle biomass, suggesting that organic source strength provides the substrate of methane production while the oxidation potential in the rhizosphere and the methane transport capacity of rice roots and culm dominate the emissions of methane from soil to the atmosphere. Multivariate decision regression tree (DRT) analysis showed a significant class difference between QH, YX8 and YE with the other six cultivars. These three cultivars are suitable for promotion of low carbon agriculture in South China. DRT analysis also successfully illustrated a potential way to identify rice varieties for low YSME by decisive parameters of tiller number (<15), HI (>0.43) and nitrogen assimilation of leaves (<40). These findings suggest that optimization of rice cultivars may represent an effective way to address both food demand and climate change concerns by improving rice yields while simultaneously minimizing the impact of climate change per unit yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3ainflorescences 3arice 3asoil organic carbon 3afield experimentation 3aroots 3acorrelation 3arhizosphere 3asoil air 3agrain yield 3aoxidation 3aleaves 3acultivars 3aclimate change 3aharvest index 3aemissions 3aculms 3apaddies 3abiomass 3amethane production 3anitrogen 3aregression analysis 3amethane 3aemissions factor 3agas chromatography 3aChina 0acarbon 0arice cultivar 0ayield-scaled methane emission 0aDouble rice field 0adecision regression tree analysis 0aSouth China1 aLi, Yu’e1 aWang, Hong1 aLi, Jianling1 aWan, Yunfan1 aGao, Qingzhu1 aLiao, Yulin1 aFan, Meirong0 tJournal of integrative environmental sciences.g2015 Dec. 18, v. 12, no. sup1 p.47-66dTaylor & Francisx1943-81687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1943815X.2015.11183883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03143naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245011900169300001400288520154800302592002801850650001801878650001201896650002901908650002601937650001901963650001201982650002701994650001502021650001102036650002202047650001002069650002502079650001102104650002102115650001502136650001602151650001302167650002002180651001002200653002802210653002702238653002002265653001702285653002902302700001702331700001802348700002102366773012102387856008402508852000902592655001202601IND60122444820221119220146.0150325e20140102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012244482DNAL7 a10.1080/1943815X.2014.8834132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Shunshun10aEnvironmental implications of rural policies in China: a multi-agent model at the level of agricultural households  ap. 17-37.  aWe analyzed the socioeconomic and environmental changes in rural China from the perspective of agricultural households and developed a multi-agent agricultural household model for rural environmental management (MAREM). The MAREM model consists of four submodules: the agricultural household production module, the consumption module, the labor supply module, and the environmental assessment module. In the model, virtual agricultural households exist in a hypothetical village. Farmers follow a self-adaptive approach to learn and understand policy variations, in order to make relevant decisions. The model has been validated through simulation of actual trends (the based-on-reality scenario). On the basis of this scenario, we further analyzed possible future trends in rural environmental pollution in China. Our results reflect that China may enter a period of farmer income stagnation accompanied by a rapid deterioration in rural environmental quality. Ammonia emission from livestock production may become the primary agricultural source of air pollution, and eutrophication is calculated to be the major water pollution issue for the long term. Synthetic fertilizer application is projected to be the dominant source of total nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in aquatic system (contributing to about 64% and 46% of the total discharge, respectively). Our study shows that MAREM is an effective tool to analyze the interactions between agricultural households' behavior and environmental consequences under specific policies in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3aammonia 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental quality 3aeutrophication 3afarmers 3afertilizer application 3ahouseholds 3aincome 3aissues and policy 3alabor 3alivestock production 3amodels 3anitrogen content 3aphosphorus 3arural areas 3avillages 3awater pollution 3aChina 0amulti-agent based model 0aagricultural household 0adecision-making 0arural policy 0aenvironmental management1 aQu, Hongjuan1 aLuan, Shengji1 aKroeze, Carolien0 tJournal of integrative environmental sciences.g2014 Jan. 2, v. 11, no. 1 p.17-37dTaylor & Francisx1943-81687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1943815X.2014.8834133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01903naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001900137245011000156300001600266520084300282592002801125650001301153650001601166650001601182650002301198650001201221650001001233650001001243650000901253650001301262650001401275650000901289650001101298650001401309700001901323773009501342856007101437852000901508655001201517IND60518567120221118220729.0160418e197305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051856712DNAL7 a10.2307/19353462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanger, Jon E.12aA Comparison of the Abundance and Diversity of Fossil Pigments in Wetland Peats and Woodland Humus Layers  ap. 605-611.  aThe abundance and diversity of fossil pigments (chloraphyll derivatives and carotenoids) in woodland humus layers and in circumneutral to moderately acid swamp peats are shown to increase with degree of soil waterlogging. The swamp peats are distinctly richer in pigments than are the highly acid peats from a Sphagnum bog, especially as regards carotenoids. However, the bog and swamp peats exhibit equal pigment diversity. Although the semi—aquatic swamp peats are richer and more diverse in fossil pigments than terrestrial humus layers, they are much poorer and much less diverse than profundal lake sediments. A combination of low pigment concentrations, moderate pigment diversity, and high ratios of chlorophyll derivatives to carotenoids has shown utility as an indicator of swamp invasion in the course of lacustrine evolution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSphagnum 3acarotenoids 3achlorophyll 3aflooded conditions 3afossils 3ahumus 3alakes 3apeat 3apigments 3asediments 3asoil 3aswamps 3awoodlands1 aGorham, Eville0 tEcology.g1973 May, v. 54, no. 3 p.605-611dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19353463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01991naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100001600162245008100178300001600259500000900275520097200284592002801256650002901284650001601313650001301329650001501342650001301357650000901370650002101379650001101400650001301411773012301424856009701547852000901644655001201653IND60663406220221119164146.0191122e196909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066340622DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1969.00021962006100050010x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHinson, K.,10aAlternatives to Seed-packet Inoculation of Soybeans with Rhizobium japonicum  ap. 683-685.  aepub  aThis study tested two methods for inoculating soybean (Glycine max L.

Nodulation was essentially equal at placement depths of 4 and 6.5 cm. Plantings made 15 days after application had 80% as many nodules as those made 1 day after application. In the second method, 100 kg/ha of inoculated soybeans were sown with a grain drill and grown for 6 weeks to pre-inoculate fields. Nodulation in subsequent plots, without further inoculation, was good when plants from the grain drill seeding averaged five or more nodules each before they were disked under. When plants from the grain drill seeding averaged 2.5 nodules each, temporary symptoms of nitrogen deficiency developed in subsequent plots.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBradyrhizobium japonicum 3aGlycine max 3anitrogen 3anodulation 3aplanting 3asand 3aseed inoculation 3asowing 3asoybeans0 tAgronomy journal.g1969 Sept., v. 61, no. 5 p.683-685dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj1969.00021962006100050010x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01972naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245008000167300001600247520070600263592002800969650002000997650001801017650002301035650001801058650002201076650003301098650001701131650001801148651001801166653001301184653003501197653001901232653001501251653002101266653001901287700001801306700002101324700002101345773008201366856008101448852000901529655001201538IND60638282320221119001635.0190428s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063828232DNAL7 a10.1163/22941932-900001762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEom, Young Geun10aWall Sculpturing in Vessel Elements of Juglans Species of the United States  ap. 153-160.  aWall sculpturing in the vessel elements of some Juglans species of the United States, four black walnuts (J. major, J. nigra, J. microcarpa (= J. rupestris), and J. californica) and one butternut (J. cinerea), was investigated through light and scanning electron microscopy.

Farmers are the hardest hit as they have to continuously respond to climatic variations. In order to understand farmers' perceptions of climate change and its impacts, and to identify adaptation needs, focus group discussions and semi-structured questionnaire surveys were carried out at the end of the south-west monsoon season in 2012 (Kharif cropping season in India). This helped to gather their immediate responses soon after the poor performance of south-west monsoon 2012. Khariff cultivation is locally known as ‘Kuruvai’ and is always under the influence of the south-west monsoon rainfall. Farmers' have perceived climate variability, and identified increasing temperature, delayed onset, intermittent dry spells and decreasing soil moisture as the critical factors affecting their cultivation. Some of them have started to adapt to these changes by cultivating only short-duration crops such as pulses, vegetables and flowers especially jasmine, but there is also a trend to put more land under fallow and abandoning the major cereal production. This study reveals that the farmers' perceptions are in accordance with the real trends analysis done on meteorological variables using Mann–Kendall test and Sens's slope estimator test, but not exactly matches with rainfall. Farmers have indicated their specific adaptation needs, a number of which could be incorporated into site-specific adaption strategies and policies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarid zones 3aclimate change 3afallow 3afarmers 3aflowers 3aissues and policy 3alivelihood 3amonsoon season 3aquestionnaires 3arain 3asoil water 3asurveys 3atemperature 3avegetables 3aIndia 0aclimate change 0aperceptions 0aagricultural adaptation 0aclimate variability 0adroughts impacts 0aautonomous adaptation1 aA, Ramachandran0 tJournal of integrative environmental sciences.g2016 Jan. 2, v. 13, no. 1 p.1-18dTaylor & Francisx1943-81687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1943815X.2015.10620313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03201naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245021000169300001400379520162900393592002802022650001902050650001902069650001602088650001802104650001302122650002202135650001702157650001702174650002702191650002102218650001202239650001302251650002402264650001202288653001902300653003702319653001802356653002702374653001902401700001902420700002002439700001802459700001702477773011902494856008502613852000902698655001202707IND60582284520221118152001.0190318e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058228452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pestbp.2017.09.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHirata, Koichi14aThe R81T mutation in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor of Aphis gossypii is associated with neonicotinoid insecticide resistance with differential effects for cyano- and nitro-substituted neonicotinoids  ap. 57-65.  aThe cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii Glover, is one of the most agriculturally important insect pests. Neonicotinoid insecticides and sulfoxaflor have generally shown excellent control of A. gossypii, but these aphids have recently developed resistance against neonicotinoid insecticides. We previously characterized a field-collected A. gossypii Kushima clone that showed higher resistance to nitro-substituted neonicotinoids, such as imidacloprid, than to cyano-substituted neonicotinoids, such as acetamiprid. This Kushima clone harbors the R81T mutation in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) β1 subunit; this mutation is the source of neonicotinoid insecticide resistance. In the present study, electrophysiological analyses and molecular modeling were employed to investigate the differential effects of the R81T mutation on cyano- and nitro-substituted neonicotinoids and sulfoxaflor. We isolated full-length coding sequences of A. gossypii nAChR α1, α2, and β1 subunits. When co-expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes with chicken β2 nAChR, A. gossypii α1 evoked inward currents in a concentration-dependent manner in response to acetylcholine (ACh) and showed sensitivity to neonicotinoid and sulfoxaflor. Additionally, the chicken β2 T77R+E79V (equivalent double mutant of R81T) mutation resulted in a lower effect to cyano-substituted neonicotinoids and sulfoxaflor than to nitro-substituted neonicotinoids. Electrophysiological data and nAChR homology modeling analysis suggested that the Kushima clone exhibited different levels of resistance to cyano- and nitro-substituted neonicotinoid insecticides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAphis gossypii 3aXenopus laevis 3aacetamiprid 3aacetylcholine 3achickens 3aelectrophysiology 3aimidacloprid 3ainsect pests 3ainsecticide resistance 3amolecular models 3amutants 3amutation 3anicotinic receptors 3aoocytes 0aAphis gossypii 0aNicotinic acetylcholine receptor 0aNeonicotinoid 0aInsecticide resistance 0anAChR modeling1 aJouraku, Akiya1 aKuwazaki, Seigo1 aKanazawa, Jun1 aIwasa, Takao0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2017 Nov., v. 143 p.57-65dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl1414x0048-35757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pestbp.2017.09.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03747naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245013000163300001600293520244100309592002802750650004102778650001502819650001502834650001302849650002402862650002002886650001502906650002402921650001102945650001102956650000902967650001302976650001502989651001703004700001703021700001903038700001203057700001603069700001703085773010803102856008203210852000903292655001203301IND60746358320221118062827.0220630e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074635832DNAL7 a10.1007/s40333-021-0066-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJi, Huiping10aAdaptability of machine learning methods and hydrological models to discharge simulations in data-sparse glaciated watersheds  ap. 549-567.  aThe accurate simulation and prediction of runoff in alpine glaciated watersheds is of increasing importance for the comprehensive management and utilization of water resources. In this study, long short-term memory (LSTM), a state-of-the-art artificial neural network algorithm, is applied to simulate the daily discharge of two data-sparse glaciated watersheds in the Tianshan Mountains in Central Asia. Two other classic machine learning methods, namely extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and support vector regression (SVR), along with a distributed hydrological model (Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and an extended SWAT model (SWAT_Glacier) are also employed for comparison. This paper aims to provide an efficient and reliable method for simulating discharge in glaciated alpine regions that have insufficient observed meteorological data. The two typical basins in this study are the main tributaries (the Kumaric and Toxkan rivers) of the Aksu River in the south Tianshan Mountains, which are dominated by snow and glacier meltwater and precipitation. Our comparative analysis indicates that simulations from the LSTM shows the best agreement with the observations. The performance metrics Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NS) and correlation coefficient (R²) of LSTM are higher than 0.90 in both the training and testing periods in the Kumaric River Basin, and NS and R² are also higher than 0.70 in the Toxkan River Basin. Compared to classic machine learning algorithms, LSTM shows significant advantages over most evaluating indices. XGBoost also has high NS value in the training period, but is prone to overfitting the discharge. Compared with the widely used hydrological models, LSTM has advantages in predicting accuracy, despite having fewer data inputs. Moreover, LSTM only requires meteorological data rather than physical characteristics of underlying data. As an extension of SWAT, the SWAT_Glacier model shows good adaptability in discharge simulation, outperforming the original SWAT model, but at the cost of increasing the complexity of the model. Compared with the oftentimes complex semi-distributed physical hydrological models, the LSTM method not only eliminates the tedious calibration process of hydrological parameters, but also significantly reduces the calculation time and costs. Overall, LSTM shows immense promise in dealing with scarce meteorological data in glaciated catchments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3aalgorithms 3aarid lands 3aglaciers 3ameteorological data 3aneural networks 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3arivers 3arunoff 3asnow 3asnowmelt 3awatersheds 3aCentral Asia1 aChen, Yaning1 aFang, Gonghuan1 aLi, Zhi1 aDuan, Weili1 aZhang, Qifei0 tJournal of Arid Land.g2021 June, v. 13, no. 6 p.549-567dScience PresswJournal:21602x1674-67677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40333-021-0066-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02434naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001200150245020500162300001600367520096700383592002801350650001201378650001401390650001101404650001901415650001601434650001501450650001901465650000901484650001101493650002901504653004901533653002401582653002101606653002501627653002901652700001701681700001201698700001301710700001301723700001601736700002101752773009701773856008501870852000901955655001201964IND60698617220221118192647.0201230e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069861722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2020.05.1472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Yu10aCu/Ni composite electrodes for increased anodic coulombic efficiency and electrode operation time in a thermally regenerative ammonia-based battery for converting low-grade waste heat into electricity  ap. 162-171.  aA Cu/Ni composite electrode is proposed for increasing the anodic coulombic efficiency and electrode operation time in thermally regenerative ammonia batteries (TRABs) used for converting low-grade waste heat into electrical power. The performance of a TRAB employing a Cu/Ni composite electrode (TRAB-Cu/Ni) is comparably studied, and the effects of the electroplating conditions are investigated. In comparison to the TRAB-Cu system, TRAB-Cu/Ni achieves similar maximum power (6.5 mW), but increased anodic coulombic efficiency (94%) and a significantly extended electrode operation time (>55 h). During electroplating, the structure of the composite electrode is influenced by the electroplating time and the concentrations of HEDP and Cu²⁺ in the electroplating baths. Optimal electroplating conditions for achieving maximum power (electroplating time of 60 min, HEDP concentration of 0.48 M, and Cu²⁺ concentration of 0.06 M) are also identified.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3abatteries 3acopper 3aelectric power 3aelectricity 3aelectrodes 3aelectroplating 3aheat 3anickel 3arenewable energy sources 0aThermally regenerative ammonia-based battery 0aComposite electrode 0aPower generation 0aCoulombic efficiency 0aElectrode operation time1 aZhang, Liang1 aLi, Jun1 aFu, Qian1 aZhu, Xun1 aLiao, Qiang1 aZhang, Yongsheng0 tRenewable energy.g2020 Oct., v. 159 p.162-171dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2020.05.1473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02810naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006100146245019600207300001800403520152700421592002801948650001901976650002201995650001902017650001802036650001402054650002102068653001502089700002002104700002002124700002402144700001902168700002302187773014802210856008102358852000902439655001202448IND60787768320221119234401.0220810e20220728xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078776832DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.2c027762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBakhite, Etify A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3994-562910aPyridine Derivatives as Insecticides.

The canals were found within fusiform rays in both phloem and xylem. The ducts were closed in the cambial zone, but opened at widely differing distances from the cambium among individual radial resin canals, ranging from 120 to 340 μm on the phloem side and from 260 to 640 μm on the xylem side. Further, the ducts were not open continuously on both sides. The average number of radial resin canals in the tangential plane was 0.76/mm². In the cambial zone, central cells of fusiform rays which might develop into epithelial cells later, were smaller and more deeply stained than the surrounding ray initial cells, allowing them to be identified at the initial stage. Two or more radial resin canals situated nearby each other were connected through an axial resin canal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus densiflora 3acambium 3aepithelial cells 3aphloem 3aresin canals 3axylem 0aResin canal 0aepithelial cell 0aintercellular space 0anetwork structure 0apine wood nematode1 aFujii, Tomoyuki1 aAbe, Hisashi1 aFujiwara, Takeshi1 aFujita, Minoru1 aTakabe, Keiji0 tIAWA journal.g, v. 29, no. 2 p.179-187dBrillwJournal:6290x0928-15417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/22941932-900001783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03129naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245010000164300001800264520137600282592002801658596008601686596006001772596006401832596004901896650002301945650004401968650002802012650001602040650003702056650001302093650001502106650001902121650001902140650001102159650001502170650002002185650002402205650001102229650003702240653001402277653000902291653001302300653001202313700006002325773014802385856008102533852000902614655001202623IND60787768420221119234518.0220810e20220727xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078776842DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.2c027832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpain, Olivia10aDetailed Characterization of the Cell Wall Structure and Composition of Nordic Green Microalgae  ap. 9711-9721.  aGreen microalgae are attractive to food, pharmaceutical, and biofuel industries due to the promising and diverse properties of their intracellular components. In current biotechnological applications, however, clear bottlenecks are the cell disruption and cell harvesting steps. Challenges in both of these processes are directly linked to the properties of the microalgal cell wall. The aim of this study was to explore the cell wall compositions and morphologies of four Nordic microalgal strains (Chlorella vulgaris (13-1), Scenedesmus sp. (B2-2), Haematococcus pluvialis, and Coelastrella sp. (3-4)) and their changes in relation to logarithmic and stationary growth phases. Transmission electron microscopy imaging enabled us to visualize the cell walls and to observe structural elements such as spines, microfibrillar hairs, or layers. Using cryogenic X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, we quantified lipid, protein, and polysaccharide content of the outer surface of the microalgal cell wall in cultures. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy highlighted changes between growth phases within the polysaccharide and protein fractions of the cell wall. Very prominent differences were observed in sugar and protein composition of the Scenedesmus sp. (B2-2) cell wall compared to the cell walls of the other three Nordic strains using trimethylsilyl derivatization.  aPublisher supplied data  a2019-00492cSvenska Forskningsr?det Formasdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001862  a82845cNordForskdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004785  aNAcUme?

Data were collected from 148 Korean immigrant adults who are “at risk” for T2DM as defined by having family history of T2DM in first-degree relatives, body mass index greater than 23, or history of gestational diabetes in women. Participants completed questionnaires and underwent biological measures. Negative emotions included feeling nervous, hopeless, restless, anxious, and stressed as well as depressive symptoms. High percentages of participants had T2DM risk factors including overweight, greater than normal waist to hip ratio, and blood glucose readings that are indicative of T2DM. Feeling stressed was the most commonly reported negative emotion (66%), followed by feeling anxious (51%), restless (38%), nervous (30%), and hopeless (13%). Experience of negative emotions was significantly related to behavioral risk factors; higher levels of experiencing negative emotions were related to increased soda intake and a decreased likelihood of doing at least 10 minutes of moderate exercise. Stress and anxiety were each negatively related to moderate exercise, and depressive symptoms were negatively related to both moderate and vigorous exercise. No significant relationship was found between negative emotions and biological risk factors. Findings suggest that negative emotions, individually and taken together, may be related to T2DM risk behaviors in high-risk Korean immigrants. Behavioral interventions to prevent T2DM in this population should consider assessing and addressing negative emotions.  aThis study was supported by a grant from the National Center for Research Resources and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, National Institute of Health, through Grant UL1 TR000153 and 8KL2 TR000147 (Dr Choi).  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3aanxiety 3ablood glucose 3abody mass index 3aexercise 3agestational diabetes 3aimmigration 3amental depression 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aoverweight 3aquestionnaires 3arisk behavior 3arisk factors 3awaist-to-hip ratio 3awomen1 aRush, Elizabeth B.1 aHenry, Shayna L.0 tDiabetes educator.g2013 Sept., v. 39, no. 5 p.679-688dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl42983x1554-60637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/01457217134925663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03002naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245014300168300001600311520150800327592002801835650001201863650002101875650001501896650001201911650001701923650001101940650001601951650001401967650002301981650001002004650002002014650001502034650000902049651001102058653002402069653002102093653001702114653001602131653002102147700002502168700002202193700001902215700002302234700002802257700002702285773008202312856008102394852000902475655001202484IND60638282620221119001925.0190428s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063828262DNAL7 a10.1163/22941932-900001792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLisi, Claudio S.10aTree-Ring Formation, Radial Increment Periodicity, and Phenology of Tree Species from a Seasonal Semi-Deciduous Forest in Southeast Brazil  ap. 189-207.  aMany tropical tree species produce growth rings in response to seasonal environmental factors that influence the activity of the vascular cambium. We applied the following methods to analyze the annual nature of treering formation of 24 tree species from a seasonal semi-deciduous forest of southeast Brazil: describing wood anatomy and phenology, counting tree rings after cambium markings, and using permanent dendrometer bands. After 7 years of systematic observations and measurements, we found the following: the trees lost their leaves during the dry season and grew new leaves at the end of the same season; trunk increment dynamics corresponded to seasonal changes in precipitation, with higher increment (active period) during the rainy season (October–April) and lower increment (dormant period) during the dry season (May–September); the number of tree rings formed after injuries to the cambium coincided with the number of years since the extraction of the wood samples. As a result of these observations, it was concluded that most study trees formed one growth ring per year. This suggests that tree species from the seasonal semi-deciduous forests of Brazil have an annual cycle of wood formation. Therefore, these trees have potential for use in future studies of tree age and radial growth rates, as well as to infer ecological and regional climatic conditions. These future studies can provide important information for the management and conservation of these endangered forests.  aPublisher supplied data 3acambium 3aclimatic factors 3adry season 3aforests 3agrowth rings 3aleaves 3aperiodicity 3aphenology 3aseasonal variation 3atrees 3atropical plants 3awet season 3awood 3aBrazil 0aTropical tree rings 0acambium activity 0awood anatomy 0adendrometer 0adendrochronology1 aTomazello Fo, Mário1 aBotosso, Paulo C.1 aRoig, Fidel A.1 aMaria, Vivian R.B.1 aFerreira-Fedele, Lígia1 aVoigt, Alessandra R.A.0 tIAWA journal.g, v. 29, no. 2 p.189-207dBrillwJournal:6290x0928-15417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/22941932-900001793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04017naa a2200961 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005600150245016700206300001600373520151900389592002801908650001401936650001601950650001301966650002601979650003102005650002002036650000902056650001002065650001002075650001302085650002802098650002302126650002202149650001402171650002102185650002102206650001902227650001302246650002002259650001402279650002802293650001302321650001302334653001802347653002102365653002402386653002802410653002002438653002702458653000802485653000702493653000802500653001002508653000802518653000802526653000802534653000802542653000802550653001102558653000702569653000802576653000802584653000802592653000702600653000702607653000902614653000802623653000802631653000802639653000802647653000702655653000902662653000902671653000902680653000802689653000802697700001602705700001902721700001802740700001702758700001702775700001602792700002002808773012102828856008502949852000903034655001203043IND60582284820221118153442.0190318e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058228482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pestbp.2017.09.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Dongjin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4222-185110aInteractions between salicylic acid and antioxidant enzymes tilting the balance of H2O2 from photorespiration in non-target crops under halosulfuron-methyl stress  ap. 214-223.  aHalosulfuron-methyl (HSM) is a safe, selective and effective sulfonylurea herbicide (SU) for the control of sedge and broadleaf weeds in sugarcane, corn, tomato, and other crops. The primary site of action is acetolactate synthase (ALS), a key enzyme of branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) synthesis. In addition to ALS inhibition, BCAAs deficiencies and oxidative damage may be involved in toxic effects of SUs. However, secondary targets of HSM relevant to plant physiological responses are unclear. In the present study, comparative growth inhibition and peroxidization injury between sensitive and tolerance crops were observed at biochemical and physiological levels suggesting involvement of H2O2, ethylene, salicylic acid (SA) in the oxidative stress responses to HSM. HSM caused accumulation of H2O2, stimulated photorespiration and consequent accumulation of SA that worsened the peroxidization injury to the sensitive C3 plant soybean (Glycine max). The growth inhibition at low concentrations of HSM could be lessened by supplementary BCAAs, reactive oxygen species scavengers or ethylene inducers, whereas the oxidation damage at high concentrations of HSM could not be reversed and ultimately lead to plant death. H2O2 at a low level stimulated the antioxidase system including glutathione S-transferase activities in the HSM-tolerant C4 maize (Zea mays), which contributes to HSM tolerance. H2O2 plays an important role on HSM stress responses in both HSM-sensitive and HSM-tolerant soybean and maize.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC3 plants 3aGlycine max 3aZea mays 3aacetolactate synthase 3abranched chain amino acids 3abroadleaf weeds 3acorn 3acrops 3adeath 3aethylene 3aglutathione transferase 3agrowth retardation 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stress 3aphotorespiration 3asalicylic acid 3asoybeans 3astress response 3asugarcane 3asulfonylurea herbicides 3atomatoes 3atoxicity 0aPhytotoxicity 0aSecondary target 0aHalosulfuron-methyl 0aReactive oxygen species 0aNon-target crop 0aSulfonylurea herbicide 0aHSM 0aSU 0aALS 0aBCAAs 0aROS 0aMDA 0aCAT 0aSOD 0aGST 0aACCase 0aSA 0aPCD 0aGLO 0aSAR 0aVE 0aVC 0aHPLC 0aDAT 0aOH- 0aO2- 0aNBT 0aGC 0aIC10 0aIC50 0aPCIB 0aGly 0aSer1 aLi, Qing X.1 aLin, Zhangxing1 aChen, Zhaojie1 aTang, Wenwei1 aPan, Canping1 aTan, Huihua1 aZeng, Dongqiang0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2017 Nov., v. 143 p.214-223dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl1414x0048-35757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pestbp.2017.09.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04025naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003300135040001800168100001900186245016700205300001200372506007600384520192800460592002802388506003702416650001602453650001102469650001002480650002202490650001202512650002502524650001302549650001302562650002002575650001002595650001502605650001902620650001502639650004402654650002502698650001102723650001102734650002502745650000902770650004602779650009702825650008802922650001203010650007403022651002003096700002103116700002003137700002003157700001803177773016103195856004603356852000903402655001203411IND50061407420221207134622.0140121e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006140742DNAL7 a229891492pmid7 aPMC35153402pmcid7 a10.1186/1479-5868-9-1142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDudley, Dean A10aChanges in physical activity levels, lesson context, and teacher interaction during physical education in culturally and linguistically diverse Australian schools  ap. 660.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Recent data show that only 15% of Australian adolescents participate in adequate amounts of physical activity (PA) and those students from Asian and Middle-Eastern backgrounds in Grades 6–12 are significantly less active than their English-speaking background peers. Schools have recently been recognised as the most widely used and cost-effective setting for promoting PA among youth and one domain within schools where PA can occur regularly for all youth, regardless of cultural background or socio-economic status, is during physical education (PE). METHODS: This study describes changes in physical activity (PA), lesson context and teacher interaction in physical education over the first two years in culturally and linguistically diverse secondary schools. Grade 7 PE classes in six schools were randomly observed using systematic direct observation (n = 81) and then followed up over the same period (n = 51) twelve months later. RESULTS: There was no significant decline in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) during PE (MD = −4.8%; p = .777), but a significant decline and medium negative effect in time spent in vigorous physical activity (VPA) (MD = −7.9%; p = .009) during PE was observed. Significant declines and large negative effects over time in percentage of PE time spent in management (MD = −8.8%; p < .001) and the number of observations where teachers promoted PA (MD = −20.7%; p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The decline of VPA and teacher promotion of PA in culturally and linguistically diverse schools is of concern. Given the declines in VPA and the increases in time spent in game play, further research is needed to ascertain whether PE instruction could be improved by focussing on skill instruction and fitness in a games-based PE instruction model. Further research for increasing teacher promotion of PA during PE is needed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadolescents 3amodels 3apeers 3aphysical activity 3aschools 3asocioeconomic status 3astudents 3ateachers 3atime management 3ayouth 2aAdolescent 2aCohort Studies 2aCurriculum 2aEthnicityxstatistics & numerical data. 2aExercisexphysiology 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aLongitudinal Studies 2aMale 2aObesityxethnologyxprevention & control. 2aPhysical Education and Trainingxorganization & administrationxstatistics & numerical data. 2aSchool Health Servicesxorganization & administrationxstatistics & numerical data. 2aSchools 2aTeachingxorganization & administrationxstatistics & numerical data. 0aNew South Wales1 aOkely, Anthony D1 aPearson, Philip1 aCotton, Wayne G1 aCaputi, Peter0 tinternational journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity.g2012 Dec., v. 9, no. 1 p.660-660dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:jnl4350546x1479-58687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1479-5868-9-114  aDNAL 7aarticle01503naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245002800170300001400198520044200212592002800654650001100682650002000693650001000713650001200723650001300735650000900748653000700757653000800764653000800772653000800780653001600788653002100804653002600825653002200851653001700873653001100890773009700901856008600998852000901084655001201093IND60610407720221120121101.0190718e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061040772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2018.05.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoedecke, Jann10aContagious loan default  ap. 14-18.  aApplying survival analysis to a large loan-level dataset for regulatory purposes on group loans provided by Mexican banks, I find that ex-post credit risk is subject to substantial geographic spillover effects.

Highly intensive, climate-exposed, arable farming systems like the Veenkoloniën in the north of the Netherlands are particularly vulnerable to many of these challenges. Just in the past twenty years, the Veenkoloniën has lost half of its small and medium sized family farms specialised in cultivating starch potatoes. While starch potato production continues to be stable as the remaining farms are increasing the size of their operation, local stakeholders are concerned that the farming system in the Veenkoloniën is endangered. In this paper we investigate this issue by using a system dynamics simulation model to explore what the potential structures are that could threaten the long term future of starch potato production and to identify leverage points that can enhance the resilience of the system. Our analysis shows that, so far, farmers’ active engagement in a processing cooperative has been an important element to their resilience to cope with economic and environmental challenges. In practice, the cooperative has been able to act as a buffer and stabilise prices for farmers in the region by implementing strategies that increase the value of their products, open new markets and increase starch potato production.  aPublisher supplied data 3apotatoes 3asimulation models 3astakeholders 3astarch 3aNetherlands 0aSystem dynamics 0aResearch analysis 0aFarming systems1 aSchütz, L1 aPaas, W1 aReidsma, P1 aKopainsky, B0 tEcological modelling.g2022 Feb., v. 464 p.109848-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl6191x0304-38007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2021.1098483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01527naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245013200164300001400296520057400310592002800884650001500912650001400927650001400941650001700955650001100972650001500983650001500998651001101013700002101024773009901045856004801144852000901192655001201201IND4477263920221116141403.0120727e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447726392DNAL7 a10.1134/S10674136120100432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDanilov, P.

Most proteins rely on conformational flexibility to some degree. Are regions that convey conformational flexibility conserved over evolutionary time? Can changes in conformational flexibility alter protein function? Here, the evolutionary dynamics of structurally ordered and disordered (flexible) regions are investigated genome-wide in flaviviruses, revealing that the amount and location of structural disorder fluctuates highly among related proteins. Some regions are prone to shift between structured and flexible states. Increased evolutionary dynamics of structural disorder is observed for some lineages but not in others. Lineage-specific transitions of this kind could alter the conformational ensemble accessible to the same protein in different species, causing a functional change, even if the predominant function remains conserved. Thus, rapid evolutionary dynamics of structural disorder is a potential driving force for phenotypic divergence among flaviviruses.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFlaviviridae 3aphenotypic variation 3aprotein structure 3aproteins 0aconformational flexibility 0acomparative genomics 0astructural disorder 0aflavivirus 0adivergence1 aMacDonald, Madolyn L.1 aMasterson, Patrick1 aUversky, Vladimir N.1 aSiltberg-Liberles, Jessica0 tGenome biology and evolution.g2013, v. 5, no. 3 p.504-513dOxford University Press7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evt0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02861naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002100181245008600202300001600288506007600304520157700380592002801957506003701985650002102022650001602043650001402059650001002073650001302083650001302096653001202109653001402121653001302135653001402148700002002162700002302182700002402205700002102229773009402250856007402344852000902418655001202427IND60117791420221207111548.0141126s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011779142DNAL7 a10.1093/gbe/evt0272doi7 aPMC36223052pmcid7 a234310032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGalardini, Marco10aReplicon-Dependent Bacterial Genome Evolution: The Case of Sinorhizobium meliloti  ap. 542-558.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMany bacterial species, such as the alphaproteobacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti, are characterized by open pangenomes and contain multipartite genomes consisting of a chromosome and other large-sized replicons, such as chromids, megaplasmids, and plasmids. The evolutionary forces in both functional and structural aspects that shape the pangenome of species with multipartite genomes are still poorly understood. Therefore, we sequenced the genomes of 10 new S. meliloti strains, analyzed with four publicly available additional genomic sequences. Results indicated that the three main replicons present in these strains (a chromosome, a chromid, and a megaplasmid) partly show replicon-specific behaviors related to strain differentiation. In particular, the pSymB chromid was shown to be a hot spot for positively selected genes, and, unexpectedly, genes resident in the pSymB chromid were also found to be more widespread in distant taxa than those located in the other replicons. Moreover, through the exploitation of a DNA proximity network, a series of conserved “DNA backbones” were found to shape the evolution of the genome structure, with the rest of the genome experiencing rearrangements. The presented data allow depicting a scenario where the pSymB chromid has a distinctive role in intraspecies differentiation and in evolution through positive selection, whereas the pSymA megaplasmid mostly contributes to structural fluidity and to the emergence of new functions, indicating a specific evolutionary role for each replicon in the pangenome evolution.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEnsifer meliloti 3achromosomes 3aevolution 3agenes 3aplasmids 3areplicon 0achromid 0apangenome 0abacteria 0aselection1 aPini, Francesco1 aBazzicalupo, Marco1 aBiondi, Emanuele G.1 aMengoni, Alessio0 tGenome biology and evolution.g2013, v. 5, no. 3 p.542-558dOxford University Press7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evt0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02696naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245010000165500002200265520171200287592002801999653002602027653001902053653001602072653002302088700001902111700002102130700001802151773013402169856008202303852000902385655001202394IND60565886620221119072412.0170412s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056588662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.serj.2017.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, I-Chun12aA streamlined risk screening method for managing reutilization of abandoned factories in Taiwan  aPre-press version  aAn integrated management strategy that considers the competing relationships between land values and associated risks in the process of land-use conversion is needed to assess and manage the reutilization of brownfields. However, the often large number of individual brownfields renders it difficult to conduct a completed risk assessment for all sites, and a streamlined risk screening method would facilitate prioritization of the redevelopment of those factories. This methodology takes into account the spatial heterogeneity of contaminated lands and produces risk mapping that compiles complex risk-related information. Using abandoned factories in Taiwan as a case study, the method considers 40 points (50% accumulated probability) as the threshold of acceptable risk. Emergency risk should be over 90% of accumulated probability. For the sustainability of brownfield reutilization in Taiwan, this research uses a risk matrix to identify the low, middle, and high risk for brownfield reutilization. It can indicate zones with a high risk level or low economic incentive as areas of concern for future decision making. In Taiwan, high-risk sites with high incentive account for only 21.3% of the sites. In contrast, the sites with the lowest incentive and low risk account for 57.6% of the sites. To avoid failure in the brownfield market, three strategies are suggested: (1) flexible land management with urban planning is a feasible option for protecting the receptor's health; (2) the government could provide the tool or brownfield funds to reduce the uncertainty of investment risk; and (3) risk monitoring and management can reduce the possible pitfalls associated with brownfield reutilization.  aPublisher supplied data 0aSpatial heterogeneity 0aScreening maps 0aRisk matrix 0aEconomic incentive1 aLau, Chi-Chung1 aYen, Chieh-Cheng1 aMa, Hwong-Wen0 tSustainable Environment Research.g2017, dElsevier B.V.aChinese Institute of Environmental Engineering, Taiwanx2468-20397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.serj.2017.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03208naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011100168300001600279520179100295592002802086650001402114650001502128650002402143650000902167650000902176650001102185650001902196650001602215650001402231650001902245650001702264650001302281653001002294653000802304653001002312653002502322700002202347700002002369700001902389700002302408773022802431856008202659852000902741655001202750IND60561458720221119042851.0190412e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056145872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaa.2016.03.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCerasoli, Ilaria12aA novel approach for regional anaesthesia of the auricular region in horses: an anatomic and imaging study  ap. 656-664.  aTo investigate the anatomy of the ear innervation in horses and develop a new approach for the block of the internal and external pinna and acoustic meatus.Prospective, descriptive, cadaveric study.A total of 25 heads and necks from horse cadavers.Phase I: anatomical dissection and dye deposition on 19 heads. With the head positioned in lateral recumbency, 10 mL methylene blue (1:1 sterile water) for the internal auricular and 2 mL for the great auricular nerve block were injected in 21 ears (seven left, 10 right and two bilaterally). The anatomy of all the ears (bilaterally) and the accuracy of dye deposition (successful nerve staining defined as > 2 cm) was assessed following dissection. Occurrence of intraparotid, intravascular, or intraneural injection was recorded. Phase II: the same technique and volumes were applied, bilaterally, using a lidocaine 2%:iohexol solution mixture (3:1) in six different cadavers. Computed tomography was performed and the needle position and spread of the mixture evaluated and recorded.Phase I: Inter- and intraindividual differences were found in the anatomy of the great auricular nerve, but not in the internal and lateral auricular nerve branches and the caudal auricular nerve. No auriculotemporal nerve was found. Nerve staining was successful in 95% of the cases for the great auricular nerve, 85% of the cases for the internal auricular nerve, and 100% of the cases for the lateral auricular branch and caudal auricular nerve. Failure was observed in horses with abundant periauricular fat. No intravascular, intraparotid or intraneural injections occurred. Phase II: A 100% success rate was recorded from computed tomography images.The described approach seems suitable for blockade of the sensory innervation of the equine ear.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3aanesthesia 3acomputed tomography 3aears 3ahead 3ahorses 3aimage analysis 3ainnervation 3alidocaine 3amethylene blue 3anerve tissue 3astaining 0ablock 0aear 0ahorse 0aregional anaesthesia1 aCornillie, Pieter1 aGasthuys, Frank1 aGielen, Ingrid1 aSchauvliege, Stijn0 tVeterinary anaesthesia and analgesia.g2017 May, v. 44, no. 3 p.656-664dElsevier LtdaAssociation of Veterinary Anaesthetists and American College of Veterinary Anesthesia and AnalgesiawJournal:jnl3774066x1467-29877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaa.2016.03.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03048naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006400140245009000204500001900294500002000313520178700333592002802120650001502148650002802163650002302191650001302214650001002227650001102237650001502248650001502263650002402278650001002302650001602312700001902328700002402347700006002371773013602431856007402567852000902641655001202650IND60708979020221122125647.0200902e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070897902DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpe.134732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVidyarthi, Sriram K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8318-133110aPrediction of size and mass of pistachio kernels using random Forest machine learning  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe size and mass of the pistachio kernels are important parameters in pistachio industry worldwide, which are generally associated with pistachio classification and consumer's approval. In this study, we proposed a technique that accurately measures the size and mass of raw pistachio kernels simultaneously using image processing and machine‐learning ensemble. An image‐processing algorithm applying recursive method was used to detect a pistachio kernel from an image and estimate its size based on the pixels occupied. The number of pixels representing a pistachio kernel was used as its digital impression to estimate its size and mass. We employed Random Forest (RF) model to predict the mass of the individual pistachio kernels based on the patterns derived from the pistachio pixels in the image. The mean measured length (18.002 mm) of 100 pistachio kernels were close to the RF predicted length (18.608 mm). Similar close correlation for individual measured pistachio kernel mass and predicted mass was noticed having a bootstrapped residual of 0.036 ± 0.004 g with a class interval of 0.0358–0.0362 at 95% confidence level. Compared to the regression model, bootstrapping and uncertainty quantification showed a good prediction accuracy and robustness of the RF model. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The size of pistachio kernels is a crucial factor in defining pistachio grades commercially. Current pistachio grading in industry is still performed manually, which is tedious, time consuming, labor intensive and subject to human error and inconsistency. The developed machine learning algorithm based on Random Forest combined with image processing in this study can be a very useful tool in pistachio industry for rapid classification of pistachio worldwide.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aartificial intelligence 3aforestry equipment 3aindustry 3alabor 3amodels 3apistachios 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3aseeds 3auncertainty1 aTiwari, Rakhee1 aSingh, Samrendra K.1 aXiao, Hong‐Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6035-46770 tJournal of food process engineering.g2020 Sept., v. 43, no. 9 p.e13473-dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl8651x0145-88767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpe.134733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01754naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245007500169300001800244520026000262536021800522592002800740596002300768650001500791650001200806650001900818650001500837650001300852650002200865653003100887653001800918653001900936653002000955700001700975700001400992700001801006700001901024700001801043700001601061700001201077773012501089856008501214852000901299655001201308IND60747238920221119010923.0210812e20210803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074723892DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2019.16863662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xingxing10aSix new anthraquinone glycosides from Lasianthus acuminatissimus Merr.  ap. 2535-2543.  aSix new anthraquinones named lasianthuoside F (1), G (2), H (3), I (4), J (5), K (6) were isolated from an acetone extract of the root of Lasianthus acuminatissimus.

In this work, the effect of resveratrol on thermal, thermo-oxidative, and photo-oxidative degradation of polylactide is reported in the frame of developing fully biobased polymer formulations. Characterization of PLA films by thermal methods and photo-oxidative treatments demonstrated that resveratrol catalyzed high temperature transesterification reactions under inert atmosphere, whereas it efficiently inhibited the exothermal oxidative reactions of the polymer backbone. Low-temperature photochemical degradation experiments on PLA films allowed elucidating the stabilization mechanisms of the phenolic additive. Resveratrol is capable of slowing the oxidative chain reaction of PLA through a peroxyl radicals scavenging mechanism, while it has little effect on the direct photolytical cleavage of the ester bonds. Moreover, direct resveratrol oxidation as well as the reaction between the phenol and photo-oxidized polymer species yield secondary photoproducts, which are also able to protect PLA against photo-oxidation likely due to the UV screening effect of the formed chromophores. Resveratrol is thus proposed as an eco-friendly and biocompatible additive for a sustainable approach to the stabilization of PLA films in packaging and other applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantioxidant activity 3acardiovascular diseases 3afree radicals 3apackaging 3aphotooxidation 3apolylactic acid 3apolyphenols 3aresveratrol 3ascreening 3atemperature 3atransesterification 0aPolylactide 0aBiodegradable materials 0aBioplastics 0aResveratrol 0aPhotochemical stability 0aAntioxidants1 aGamez-Meza, Nohemi1 aMedina-Juàrez, Luis Àngel1 aSoto-Valdez, Herlinda1 aCerruti, Pierfrancesco0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2014 June 02, v. 2, no. 6 p.1534-1542dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/sc50023373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03031naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245011200174300001800286520154200304592002801846650001901874650001201893650001401905650001601919650001601935650001601951650001501967650001701982650002201999650001302021650001302034650001402047650001802061650001802079650001002097650000902107650001002116653002102126653002202147653001202169653001702181653000902198653001002207700002002217700002502237700001902262773012602281856008502407852000902492655001202501IND60629604320221119091223.0190131e20181214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062960432DNAL7 a10.1080/01904167.2018.15099942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdnan Mazhar, Syed10aImpact of urea and farm yard manure on nitrate concentration in soil profile and productivity of wheat crop  ap. 2683-2691.  aDuring the last century, concerns about nitrate presence in the groundwater have tremendously increased worldwide, mainly because of its detrimental consequences on environment and human health. There are different factors contributing their past in nitrate pollution, farm manure is given due consideration. Knowing above facts, a field study was performed to check the effect of different farm yard manure (FYM) levels with urea on nitrate distribution in the soil profile and yield of wheat crop. The experiment was set out in a randomized complete block design, consisted of application of nitrogen at 125 kg ha⁻¹ from urea, 80 kg ha⁻¹ of N from urea +10 tons FYM ha⁻¹ and 20 tons FYM ha⁻¹ with three replications. Wheat (cultivar S7ehar-2006) was sown as test crop. Soil samples were examined to measure the nitrate concentration from four different depths (0–25, 25–50, 50–75, and 75–100 cm) after harvesting. Results showed that the straw yield, total biomass, spike length, and number of grains per spike and 1000-grain weight were significantly influenced by fertilizer strategies. All manure treatments significantly affected the infiltration rate and concentration of nitrate at different depths of the soil profile. Farm yard manure showed greater nitrate concentration up to 50 cm depth as compared to alone urea and combined application, while at the depth of 100 cm, combined application of urea and FYM showed a minimum concentration of nitrates than alone application of either urea or FYM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal manures 3abiomass 3acultivars 3afertilizers 3agrain yield 3agroundwater 3aharvesting 3ahuman health 3ainfiltration rate 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3apollution 3asoil profiles 3asoil sampling 3astraw 3aurea 3awheat 0afarm yard manure 0ainfiltration rate 0anitrate 0aproductivity 0aurea 0awheat1 aNawaz, Muhammad1 aK̲h̲ān, Shahbāz,1 aIrshad, Sohail0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2018 Dec. 14, v. 41, no. 20 p.2683-2691dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl43215x1532-40877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01904167.2018.15099943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03497naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245014300169300001600312520158700328592002801915650001701943650001801960650001901978650001301997650002102010650001702031650002002048650003102068650001002099650002802109650001702137650001902154650001402173650001802187650002102205650004302226650005202269650001102321650001002332653001002342653000902352653001802361653001702379653001902396700001802415700001602433700002802449700001502477700001802492700001602510700002702526700002002553700001902573700001602592700001502608700001802623773011402641856008302755852000902838655001202847IND60694885320221120065550.0201025e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069488532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2020.05.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJahejo, Ali Raza10aRecombinant glutathione-S-transferase A3 protein regulates the angiogenesis-related genes of erythrocytes in thiram induced tibial lesions  ap. 244-253.  aTibial dyschondroplasia (TD) is a skeletal deformity disease in broilers that occurs when vascularization in the growth plate (GP) is below normal. Although, blood vessels have been reported to contribute significantly in bone formation. Therefore, in the current study, we have examined the mRNA expression of angiogenesis-related genes in erythrocytes of thiram induced TD chickens by qRT-PCR and performed histopathological analysis to determine regulatory effect of recombinant Glutathione-S-Transferase A3 (rGSTA3) protein in response to the destructive effect of thiram following the injection of rGSTA3 protein.Histopathology results suggested that, blood vessels of GPs were damaged in thiram induced TD chicken group (D), it also affected the area and density of blood vessels. In the 20 and 50 μg·kg⁻¹ of rGSTA3 protein-administered groups, E and F vessels appeared to be normal and improved on day 6 and 15. Furthermore, qRT-PCR results showed that rGSTA3 protein significantly (P < .05) up-regulated the expression of the most important angiogenesis-related integrin family genes ITGA2, ITGA5, ITGB2, ITGB3, ITGAV. The expression level of other genes including TBXA2R, FYN, IQGAP2, IL1R1, GIT1, RAP1B, RPL17, RAC2, MAML3, PTPN11, VAV1, PTCH1, NCOR2, CLU and ITGB3 up-regulated on dosage of rGSTA3 protein.In conclusion, angiogenesis is destroyed in thiram induced TD broilers, and rGSTA3 protein injection improved the vascularization of GPs by upregulating the angiogenesis related genes most importantly integrin family genes ITGAV, ITGA2, ITGB2, ITGB3, ITGA5.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangiogenesis 3ablood vessels 3abone formation 3achickens 3adyschondroplasia 3aerythrocytes 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aglutathione transferase 3agrowth plate 3ahistopathology 3aintegrins 3amessenger RNA 3apoultry diseases 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3athiram 3atibia 0aAvian 0aBone 0aBlood vessels 0aErythrocytes 0arGSTA3 protein1 aRajput, Nasir1 aKashif, Jam1 aKalhoro, Dildar Hussain1 aNiu, Sheng1 aQiao, Meng-li1 aZhang, Ding1 aQadir, Muhammad Farhan1 aMangi, Raza Ali1 aKhan, Afrasyab1 aAhsan, Anam1 aKhan, Ajab1 aTian, Wen-xia0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2020 Aug., v. 131 p.244-253dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45491x0034-52887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2020.05.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02769naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245015100178300001600329520157900345592002801924650001501952650001301967650002201980650001502002650002002017650001502037650002102052653001702073653001602090653001602106653002002122653001402142653001902156653001402175773013402189856005102323852000902374655001202383IND50076246320221117205157.0140410e20120215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007624632DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2012.6440042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiao, Shujie Miao Yunfa10aDistribution of Inorganic and Organic Phosphorus Fractions in Two Phosphorus-Deficient Soils as Affected by Crop Species and Nitrogen Applications  ap. 631-644.  aIt is desirable to know the distribution of phosphorus (P) fractions in soil so that plants may use P efficiently. Here we report the dynamics of inorganic and organic P in P-deficient black and rice soil cropped by soybean, white lupin, and maize supplied with nitrogen (N) inputs by N fixation and urea fertilizer. Inorganic P fractions of the three cropped soils could be ranked as O-P (organic phosphorus) > Al-P (aluminum phosphorus) > Fe-P (iron phosphorus) > Ca₁₀-P (calcium-10 phosphorus) > Ca₈-P (calcium-8 phosphorus) > Ca₂-P (calcium-2 phosphorus), irrespective of soil type. The potential of various inorganic P fractions to plant nutrition differed between soybean and white lupin. The percentage of total P present as inorganic P was affected by crop, soil type, and N source. In black soil, the change of organic P fraction induced by N fixation was larger than by urea application. The moderately labile organic P (MLOP) concentration was not affected significantly by soil type and crop species, and it was probably the main P source to the inorganic P fraction because the correlation between the two pools was high (r = 0.945; P < 0.05). Crop species differed in their uptake of inorganic and organic P from soil. Though P fraction concentrations varied between black soil and rice soil, their response to crop species and N source was similar. The amounts of P removed from soil were affected by N source. The right choice of crop species and the application a suitable N source may increase crop yield and P uptake by plant in P-deficient soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrop yield 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fixation 3aphosphorus 3aplant nutrition 3arice soils 3aurea fertilizers 0aCrop species 0afertilizers 0ainorganic P 0anitrogen source 0aorganic P 0asoil fertility 0asoil type0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2012 Feb. 15, v. 43, no. 4 p.631-644dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-24167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2012.644004  aDNAL 7aarticle03403naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006100140245014000201500001900341500002000360520165800380592002802038596006202066596006002128650002002188650001902208650001802227650001802245650002202263650001702285650002002302650001602322650001702338650002002355650002102375650002002396650000902416650001002425650001602435700006202451700005902513700006902572700006102641773013602702856007402838852000902912655001202921IND60708979320221122161528.0200902e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070897932DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpe.134542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArıcı, Muhammet1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4126-200X10aTaro flour usage in wheat flour bread and gluten‐free bread: Evaluation of rheological, technological and some nutritional properties  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn the present study, the use of taro flour was investigated for the production wheat flour bread (WFB) and gluten‐free bread (GFB). In both types of breads, the substitution level of taro flour was 3.15%, 6.30%, 12.50%, 18.70%, and 25.00%. The results of the study showed that the storage modulus (G′) value was higher than the loss modulus (G″) value in all the bread doughs. Addition of taro flour to wheat flour and gluten‐free doughs increased the G′ and G″ values and had strengthening effect on dough structure. Specific volumes of bread samples were ranged from 1.97 to 2.54 ml/g for WFB, from 1.61 to 2.20 ml/g for GFB. Higher resistant starch content was observed in GFB samples than WFB. Dietary fiber content increased significantly as taro flour addition was increased in both formulations (p < .05). Acceptable sensorial properties were achieved with the substitution level of 12.50% for WFB and 18.70% for GFB. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Bread has been considered as a central component of human diet for thousands of years. Improving the nutritional quality of bread types without causing quality losses is a major challenge. Moreover, the variety of gluten‐free bread needs to be increased in order to provide healthy diet for coeliac disease patients. This study aimed to explore alternative bread formulation by using taro flour. The results showed that taro flour is a contributing ingredient in terms of technological and nutritional properties of both wheat and gluten‐free bread. The use of taro flour in bread can provide insights into alternative approaches to extend the bread types to the bakery industry.  aPublisher supplied data  a1140391cTürkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu  cScientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey 3abakery industry 3aceliac disease 3adietary fiber 3afiber content 3agluten-free bread 3ahealthy diet 3ahuman nutrition 3aingredients 3aloss modulus 3anutritive value 3aresistant starch 3astorage modulus 3ataro 3awheat 3awheat flour1 aÖzülkü, Görkem1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0495-56671 aKahraman, Burcu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7553-49501 aYıldırım, Ruşen Metin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5125-11041 aToker, Ömer Said1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7304-20710 tJournal of food process engineering.g2020 Sept., v. 43, no. 9 p.e13454-dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl8651x0145-88767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpe.134543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02274naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245007800174500001400252520129900266592002801565650001601593650002001609650001101629650001501640650002401655650001901679650001301698700002401711773013301735856008301868852000901951655001201960IND60707755820221120152116.0200821e20200811xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070775582DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture100803482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Marcelo Chan Fu10aSoybean Yield Estimation and Its Components: A Linear Regression Approach  aNAL-light  aSoybean yield estimation is either based on yield monitors or agro-meteorological and satellite imagery data, but they present several limiting factors regarding on-farm decision level. Aware that machine learning approaches have been largely applied to estimate soybean yield and the availability of data regarding soybean yield and its components (number of grains (NG) and thousand grains weight (TGW)), there is an opportunity to study their relationships. The objective was to explore the relationships between soybean yield and its components, generate equations to estimate yield and evaluate its prediction accuracy. The training dataset was composed of soybean yield and its components’ data from 2010 to 2019. Linear regression models based on NG, TGW and yield were fitted on the training dataset and applied to a validation dataset composed of 58 on-field collected samples. It was found that globally TGW and NG presented weak (r = 0.50) and strong (r = 0.92) linear relationships with yield, respectively. In addition to that, applying the fitted models to the validation dataset, model based on NG presented the highest accuracy, coefficient of determination (R²) of 0.70, mean absolute error (MAE) of 639.99 kg ha⁻¹ and root mean squared error (RMSE) of 726.67 kg ha⁻¹.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3adata collection 3amodels 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3aremote sensing 3asoybeans1 aMolin, José Paulo,0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2020 Aug. 11, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture100803483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03071naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003800135040001800173100002200191245007800213300001800291520148000309592002801789650001601817650001301833650001601846650001901862650001901881650001501900650003101915650002001946650002701966650002201993650002402015650004302039650003302082650002402115650002102139650002302160650003202183700001902215700001702234700001602251700002502267700001802292700002302310773009202333856008402425990002302509852000902532655001202541IND60087506020221121212913.0141102e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008750602DNAL7 a239330482pmid7 aPMC38393512pmcid7 a10.1016/j.actbio.2013.07.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKolluru, Pavan V.10aStrong and tough mineralized PLGA nanofibers for tendon-to-bone scaffolds  ap. 9442-9450.  aEngineering complex tissues such as the tendon-to-bone insertion sites require a strong and tough biomimetic material system that incorporates both mineralized and unmineralized tissues with different strengths and stiffnesses. However, increasing strength without degrading toughness is a fundamental challenge in materials science. Here, we demonstrate a promising nanofibrous polymer–hydroxyapatite system, in which, a continuous fibrous network must function as a scaffold for both mineralized and unmineralized tissues. It is shown that the high toughness of this material system could be maintained without compromising on the strength with the addition of hydroxyapatite mineral. Individual electrospun poly (lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanofibers demonstrated outstanding strain-hardening behavior and ductility when stretched uniaxially, even in the presence of surface mineralization. This highly desirable hardening behavior which results in simultaneous nanofiber strengthening and toughening was shown to depend on the initial cross-sectional morphology of the PLGA nanofibers. For pristine PLGA nanofibers, it was shown that ellipsoidal cross-sections provide the largest increase in fiber strength by almost 200% compared to bulk PLGA. This exceptional strength accompanied by 100% elongation was shown to be retained for thin and strongly bonded conformal mineral coatings, which were preserved on the nanofiber surface even for such very large extensions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomimetics 3acoatings 3aengineering 3ahydroxyapatite 3amineralization 3ananofibers 2aBone and Bonesxphysiology 2aElastic Modulus 2aLactic Acidxchemistry 2aMaterials Testing 2aMineralsxchemistry 2aNanofibersxchemistryxultrastructure. 2aPolyglycolic Acidxchemistry 2aTendonsxphysiology 2aTensile Strength 2aTissue Engineering 2aTissue Scaffoldsxchemistry1 aLipner, Justin1 aLiu, Wenying1 aXia, Younan1 aThomopoulos, Stavros1 aGenin, Guy M.1 aChasiotis, Ioannis0 tActa biomaterialia.g2013 Dec., v. 9, no. 12 p.9442-9450dElsevier Ltdx1742-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2013.07.0423Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03526naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245015900170300001600329520190200345592002802247650001102275650001502286650001502301650001602316650001902332650001902351650000902370650001502379650002002394650001702414650001302431650001402444653001902458653000802477653001702485653001102502653003302513700002602546700002402572700001802596700001802614700003002632700001902662700002002681773022802701856008202929852000903011655001203020IND60561459020221119042944.0190412e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056145902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaa.2016.04.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRestitutti, Flavia10aPlasma concentration and cardiovascular effects of intramuscular medetomidine combined with three doses of the peripheral alpha2-antagonist MK-467 in dogs  ap. 417-426.  aWe investigated the plasma concentrations and cardiovascular effects of intramuscularly (IM) administered medetomidine, administered alone or with three different doses of MK-467.Prospective, randomized, open, crossover trial.Eight purpose-bred healthy Beagle dogs.Each dog was administered four treatments: medetomidine 20 μg kg–1 IM alone or mixed in the same syringe with MK-467 (200 μg kg–1, 400 μg kg–1 or 600 μg kg–1). Instrumentation was performed under standardized anaesthesia. The dogs were allowed to recover before measurement of baseline values. Composite sedation scores, cardiovascular variables, i.e., heart rate (HR), cardiac output (CO), mean arterial and central venous blood pressures (MAP and CVP) and arterial blood gases were recorded at baseline and for 60 minutes after treatment. Drug concentrations in venous plasma were analysed. Generalized linear mixed models for repeated measures with post hoc Bonferroni correction were used with statistical significance level set at α=0.05.All treatments initially demonstrated the effects of medetomidine: HR and CO decreased and CVP increased. MAP transiently increased and then significantly decreased from baseline with the two highest MK-467 doses. The cardiovascular effects of medetomidine disappeared more rapidly with MK-467 than with medetomidine alone. With medetomidine alone, sedation scores remained high until the end of the 60 minute follow-up. Maximum concentrations of medetomidine were more rapidly achieved and were higher with MK-467.Initial haemodynamic effects of medetomidine were not prevented by MK-467, but these effects were attenuated and their duration shortened by MK-467, independently of dose. Absorption of medetomidine was accelerated by MK-467, when administered concomitantly IM, resulting in faster sedation; addition of MK-467 shortened the sedative effect of medetomidine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeagle 3aabsorption 3aanesthesia 3ablood gases 3ablood pressure 3acardiac output 3adogs 3aheart rate 3ainstrumentation 3amedetomidine 3asedation 3asedatives 0aalpha2-agonist 0adog 0amedetomidine 0aMK-467 0aperipheral alpha2-antagonist1 aKaartinen, M.

The problem is so large that prioritizing solutions to effect meaningful change may seem overwhelming to the public and policy makers. Marine megafauna are known to mistakenly eat anthropogenic debris and die from consequent gastrointestinal blockages, perforations and malnutrition, as well as suffer sublethal impacts. We collated information on which specific items were ingested and responsible for causing death across 80 marine species, including cetaceans, pinnipeds, sea turtles, and seabirds. We evaluated which items were responsible for the highest mortality, and which, if reduced by policy responses or other means, could result in the largest reduction in debris mortality. A limited number of consumer items were shown to be responsible for most megafauna deaths. Flexible plastic is responsible for the largest proportion of debris deaths, primarily due to gastric obstructions. Disproportionately lethal items included plastic bags/sheets/packaging, rope/fishing nets, fishing tackle and balloons/latex. Smaller items, including “microplastics,” though abundant, were seldom implicated in mortality. We provide suggestions to directly curb debris deaths of marine megafauna by prioritizing policies that would reduce or eliminate the input of disproportionately hazardous items into the marine system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinnipedia 3adeath 3afauna 3agastrointestinal system 3aissues and policy 3alatex 3amalnutrition 3amortality 3aplastics 3apollution1 aSchuyler, Qamar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2473-43111 aWilcox, Chris1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5983-657X1 aHardesty, Britta Denise1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1948-50980 tConservation letters.g2021 Mar., v. 14, no. 2 p.e12781-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:J000000138x1755-263X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/conl.127813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02849naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002900139245013800168300001800306520140800324592002801732650002201760650002101782650004401803650002901847650002001876650001301896650001201909650001301921650001901934650001801953650003301971650002502004653001802029653003402047653002002081653001102101700002502112700002902137700002502166773013002191856007302321852000902394655001202403IND60530528520221117225747.0160721e20140707xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053052852DNAL7 a10.1021/sc500044p2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMusico, Yvonne
Ligaya F.10aSurface Modification of Membrane Filters Using Graphene and Graphene Oxide-Based Nanomaterials for Bacterial Inactivation and Removal  ap. 1559-1565.  aSurfaces of commercially available membrane filters were modified by the dispersion of poly(N-vinylcarbazole) (PVK), graphene (G), poly(N-vinylcarbazole)-graphene (PVK-G), graphene oxide (GO), and poly(N-vinylcarbazole)-graphene oxide (PVK-GO) in order to impart antibacterial properties. The successful coatings of the membranes were demonstrated through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Investigations carried out on the surface-modified membrane filters using Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis showed that the presence of graphene-based nanomaterials significantly improved the antibacterial properties of the membrane filters. One of the mechanisms for this improved antimicrobial property of the filter was attributed to the production of reactive oxygen species by the nanomaterials. Among the nanomaterials used in this study, the PVK-GO-modified membrane filter exhibited the best removal of B. subtilis and E. coli with 4 and 3 log removals, respectively. The different levels of E. coli and B. subtilis removals were attributed to the differences in their cell structures and composition. This study has demonstrated that the use of graphene-based nanomaterials to modify the surfaces of membrane filters is an effective method of imparting antibacterial properties that can find useful application in water and wastewater treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aEscherichia coli 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aantibacterial properties 3acell structures 3acoatings 3afilters 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3ananomaterials 3ascanning electron microscopy 3awastewater treatment 0aAntibacterial 0aGraphene-based nanocomposites 0aMembrane filter 0aPVK-GO1 aSantos, Catherine M.1 aDalida, Maria Lourdes P.1 aRodrigues, Debora F.0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2014 July 07, v. 2, no. 7 p.1559-1565dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/sc500044p3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03381naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245016300163300001400326520210600340592002802446650001602474650001802490650001502508650001602523650001802539650001302557650001502570650001102585650001302596650002102609650002502630650002302655650001502678650001102693650001702704700002402721700002502745773009902770856008102869852000902950655001202959IND4467549920221116141440.0141110e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446754992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eja.2010.11.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoltra, Jordi10aCereal yield and quality as affected by nitrogen availability in organic and conventional arable crop rotations: A combined modeling and experimental approach  ap. 83-95.  aThe effects of nitrogen (N) availability related to fertilizer type, catch crop management, and rotation composition on cereal yield and grain N were investigated in four organic and one conventional cropping systems in Denmark using the FASSET model. The four-year rotation studied was: spring barleyâ(faba bean or grass-clover)âpotatoâwinter wheat. Experiments were done at three locations representative of the different soil types and climatic conditions in Denmark. The three organic systems that included faba bean as the N fixing crop comprised a system with manure (stored pig slurry) and undersowing catch crops (OF+C+M), a system with manure but without undersowing catch crops (OFâC+M), and a system without manure and with catch crops (OF+CâM). A grass-clover green manure was used as N fixing crop in the other organic system with catch crops (OG+C+M). Cuttings of grass-clover were removed from the plots and an equivalent amount of total-N in pig slurry was applied to the cropping system. The conventional rotation included mineral fertilizer and catch crops (CF+C+F), although only non-legume catch crops were used. Measurements of cereal dry matter (DM) at harvest and of grain N contents were done in all plots. On average the FASSET model was able to predict the yield and grain N of cereals with a reasonable accuracy for the range of cropping systems and soil types studied, having a particularly good performance on winter wheat. Cereal yields were better on the more loamy soil. DM yield and grain N content were mainly influenced by the type and amount of fertilizer-N at all three locations. Although a catch crop benefit in terms of yield and grain N was observed in most of the cases, a limited N availability affected the cereal production in the four organic systems. Scenario analyses conducted with the FASSET model indicated the possibility of increasing N fertilization without significantly affecting N leaching if there is an adequate catch crop management. This would also improve yields of cereal production of organic farming in Denmark.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatch crops 3acrop rotation 3afaba beans 3agrain yield 3agreen manures 3aleaching 3aloam soils 3amodels 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aorganic production 3apig manure 3aspring 3awinter wheat1 aLÃ¦gdsmand, Mette1 aOlesen, JÃ¸rgen E.0 tEuropean journal of agronomy.g2011 Feb., v. 34, no. 2 p.83-95dElsevier B.V.x1161-03017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2010.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03489naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245010800170300001600278520187700294592002802171650001102199650001502210650001602225650000902241650001602250650001402266650001202280650000902292650001302301650001402314650001102328650002502339653003302364653001402397653002102411653004002432653003402472700003202506700001802538700002002556700002002576700002802596700002202624700001702646773022902663856008202892852000902974655001202983IND60561459120221119042719.0190412e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056145912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaa.2016.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoquette, Amélie10aComparison of lidocaine and lidocaine–epinephrine for the paravertebral brachial plexus block in dogs  ap. 317-328.  aTo compare the motor and sensory block efficacy and duration of a modified paravertebral brachial plexus block (PBPB) after administration of lidocaine alone (LI) or combined with epinephrine (LE).Prospective, randomized, blinded, crossover study.A total of eight healthy female Beagle dogs.Under general anesthesia, modified PBPB was performed on the left thoracic limb using neurostimulation and/or ultrasound guidance to administer lidocaine (2 mg kg–1; 0.2 mL kg–1) either alone (treatment LI, n = 10) or with epinephrine (1:100,000; treatment LE, n = 9). Sensory block was evaluated through reaction to a painful mechanical stimulus applied at five sites on the limb. Motor block effect was evaluated according to visual gait assessments and thoracic limb vertical force measurements under dynamic and static conditions. Data were analyzed using repeated-measures generalized estimating equations. All statistical tests were performed two-sided at the α = 0.05 significance threshold.The duration of sensory block did not differ significantly between treatments. Visible gait impairment was more persistent in LE than in LI (118 ± 63 minutes for LI and 163 ± 23 minutes for LE; mean ± standard deviation) (p = 0.027). At nadir value, dynamic peak vertical force was lower in LE than in LI (p = 0.007). For both dynamic and static evaluations, the nadir and the return to baseline force were delayed in LE (return to normal at 180–200 minutes) when compared with LI (130–140 minutes) (p < 0.005).The addition of epinephrine to lidocaine prolonged the duration and increased the intensity of the regional block, as verified by visual gait assessment and kinetic analysis. No significant difference was noted between treatments regarding sensory blockade. Kinetic analysis could be useful to evaluate regional anesthetic effect in dogs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeagle 3aanesthesia 3aanesthetics 3adogs 3aepinephrine 3aequations 3afemales 3agait 3akinetics 3alidocaine 3aplexus 3astatistical analysis 0aforce platform gait analysis 0alidocaine 0aneurostimulation 0aparavertebral brachial plexus block 0aultrasound-guided nerve block1 adel Castillo, Jérôme R.E.1 aMoreau, Maxim1 aGuillot, Martin1 aAlexander, Kate1 aKona-Boun, Jean-Jacques1 aGauvin, Dominique1 aTroncy, Eric0 tVeterinary anaesthesia and analgesia.g2017 Mar., v. 44, no. 2 p.317-328dElsevier LtdaAssociation of Veterinary Anaesthetists and American College of Veterinary Anesthesia and AnalgesiawJournal:jnl3774066x1467-29877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaa.2016.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02619naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245017400167520135500341592002801696650001601724650001501740650002001755650001501775650002101790650000901811650001501820650000901835650002101844653002201865653003301887653001801920653001801938653002001956700001901976700001701995773011402012856008602126852000902212655001202221IND60758401120221119151248.0220531e20220315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075840112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1278012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Hsin-Yi10aBioaccumulation and depuration of TiO2 nanoparticles by zebrafish through dietary exposure: Size- and number concentration-resolved analysis using single-particle ICP-MS  aThe bioaccumulation and depuration of TiO₂ nanoparticles (TiO₂NPs) by zebrafish via the dietary exposure following the OECD Test Guideline 305 (OECD TG305) was evaluated using particle size- and number concentration-resolved analysis based on single-particle ICP-MS (spICP-MS). We found that using enzymatic digestion without H₂O₂ or excessive heating can recover 84.0 ± 4.0% and 94.5 ± 3.5% of TiO₂NP mass and number concentrations from fish tissue, respectively, without altering the size distribution of parent TiO₂NPs. OECD TG305 can allow for the evaluation of bioaccumulation and depuration of TiO₂NPs by fish based on the particle mass and number dose metrics. The toxicokinetic modeling can reasonably describe the mass- and number-based measurement data with the derived absorption efficiency α at ~0.2, depuration rate at ~0.5 d⁻¹, and kinetic biomagnification factor (BMFₖ) at ~0.007 comparable with available data. The mass concentration- and number concentration-based bioaccumulation metrics including body burdens are correlated for TiO₂NPs that remained nano-sized in vivo and exhibited marginal physicochemical alterations upon uptake by fish.

For many base modifications in tRNAs, the functional significance is not well understood, and the enzymes performing the modification reactions are unknown. Here, we have studied members of a family of putative nucleotide deaminases in the model plant Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ). We show that two Arabidopsis genes encoding homologs of yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) tRNA adenosine deaminases catalyze adenosine-to-inosine editing in position 34 of several cytosolic tRNA species. The encoded proteins (AtTAD2 and AtTAD3, for tRNA-specific adenosine deaminase) localize to the nucleus and interact with each other in planta in bimolecular fluorescence complementation and coimmunoprecipitation assays. Both AtTAD2 and AtTAD3 are encoded by essential genes whose knockout is lethal and leads to arrested embryo development at the globular stage. Knockdown mutants for AtTAD2 and AtTAD3 display reduced growth and inefficient editing from adenosine to inosine in six nucleus-encoded tRNA species. Moreover, upon comparison of DNA and complementary DNA sequences, we discovered cytidine-to-uridine RNA editing in position 32 of two nucleus-encoded serine tRNAs, tRNA-serine(AGA) and tRNA-serine(GCT). This adds a unique type of RNA editing to the modifications occurring in nuclear genome-encoded RNAs in plants.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3aenzymes 3atransfer RNA1 aKarcher, Daniel1 aBock, Ralph0 tPlant physiology.g2014 Dec., v. 166, no. 4 p.1985-1997dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.114.2504983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02881naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001900138245010900157300001600266500002000282520152200302592002801824596010501852650001501957650003401972650001602006650001702022650001502039650002202054650002002076650001302096650004402109700001402153700001702167700001702184700005202201700001402253773012202267856007302389852000902462655001202471IND60786025820221119013809.0220802e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078602582DNAL7 a10.1002/pca.31502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Chenrui10aRapid classification and identification of chemical components of Astragali radix by UPLC‐Q‐TOF‐MS  ap. 943-960.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aINTRODUCTION: Pharmacological studies indicate that Astragalus (AR) has various bioactivities, including anticancer, antiaging, anti‐inflammatory, antiviral, and antioxidant activities. Flavonoids, saponins, amino acids, and polysaccharides are the main active components in AR. However, its complex chemical compositions bring certain difficulties to the analysis of this traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Therefore, there is an urgent need to establish a method for rapid classification and identification of the chemical constituents in AR. OBJECTIVE: To establish a method for rapid classification and identification of the main components of flavonoids, saponins, and amino acids in AR. METHODS: The samples were analysed with ultra‐high‐performance liquid chromatography time‐of‐flight quadrupole mass spectrometry (UPLC‐Q‐TOF‐MS) and data post‐processing techniques. Firstly, fragmentation information was obtained in the positive and negative ion modes. Then, to realize the rapid classification and identification of AR components, the characteristic fragmentations (CFs) and neutral losses (NLs) were compared with information described in the literature. RESULTS: A total of 45 chemical constituents were successfully screened out, including 22 flavonoids, 13 saponins, and 10 amino acids. CONCLUSION: The established method realised the efficient classification and identification of flavonoids, saponins, and amino acid compounds in AR, which provided a basis for further study on AR.  aPublisher supplied data  a2020YJYO224cNingbo Institute of Life and Health Industry, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences 3aAstragalus 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aamino acids 3aantioxidants 3aflavonoids 3amass spectrometry 3apolysaccharides 3asaponins 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography1 aYao, Yaqi1 aDing, Haoran1 aLi, Xiaomeng1 aLi, Yubo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0455-09691 aCai, Ting0 tPhytochemical analysis.g2022 Aug., v. 33, no. 6 p.943-960dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl58272x0958-03447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pca.31503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02078naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245010700169300001600276520105900292592002801351650001901379650001901398650001601417650001401433650001401447650003101461650001101492650001501503650001101518650001801529773009801547856008601645852000901731655001201740IND60096659820221118020153.0141104e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009665982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2013.05.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlahmer, Ali10aInfluence of using emulsified diesel fuel on the performance and pollutants emitted from diesel engine  ap. 361-369.  aThis manuscript investigates the effect of emulsified diesel fuel on the engine performance and on the main pollutant emissions for a water-cooled, four stroke, four cylinders, and direct injection diesel engine. Emulsified diesel fuels with water content of range 0–30% by volume were used. The experiments were conducted in the speed range from 1000 to 3000rpm. It was found that, in general, the using emulsified fuel improves the engine performance and reduces emissions. While the brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) has a minimum value at 5% water content and 2000rpm. The torque (T), the break mean effective pressure (BMEP) and thermal efficiency (ηₜₕ) are found to have maximum values under these conditions. The emission CO₂ was found to increase with engine speed and to decrease with water content. NOₓ produced from emulsified fuel is significantly less than that produced from pure diesel under the same conditions. And as the percentage of water content in the emulsion increases, the emitted amount of oxygen also increases.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3adiesel engines 3adiesel fuel 3aemissions 3aemulsions 3aenergy use and consumption 3aoxygen 3apollutants 3atorque 3awater content0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2013 Sept., v. 73 p.361-369dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2013.05.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03251naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002000138245012200158300001600280500002000296520181800316592002802134596009202162596005902254650002202313650002702335650001902362650001702381650001602398650001702414650002102431650001902452651001002471700001902481700001802500700006202518700005702580773012202637856007302759852000902832655001202841IND60786026020221119013957.0220802e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078602602DNAL7 a10.1002/pca.31522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCui, Zhi‐Ying10aAnticoagulant activity analysis and origin identification of Panax notoginseng using HPLC and ATR‐FTIR spectroscopy  ap. 971-981.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aINTRODUCTION: Panax notoginseng is one of the traditional precious and bulk‐traded medicinal materials in China. Its anticoagulant activity is related to its saponin composition. However, the correlation between saponins and anticoagulant activities in P. notoginseng from different origins and identification of the origins have been rarely reported. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to analyze the correlation of components and activities of P. notoginseng from different origins and develop a rapid P. notoginseng origin identification method. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pharmacological experiments, HPLC, and ATR‐FTIR spectroscopy (variable selection) combined with chemometrics methods of P. notoginseng main roots from four different origins (359 individuals) in Yunnan Province were conducted. RESULTS: The pharmacological experiments and HPLC showed that the saponin content of P. notoginseng main roots was not significantly different. It was the highest in main roots from Wenshan Prefecture (9.86%). The coagulation time was prolonged to observe the strongest effect (4.99 s), and the anticoagulant activity was positively correlated with the contents of the three saponins. The content of ginsenoside Rg₁ had the greatest influence on the anticoagulant effect. The results of spectroscopy combined with chemometrics show that the variable selection method could extract a small number of variables containing valid information and improve the performance of the model. The variable importance in projection has the best ability to identify the origins of P. notoginseng; the accuracy of the training set and the test set was 0.975 and 0.984, respectively. CONCLUSION: This method is a powerful analytical tool for the activity analysis and identification of Chinese medicinal materials from different origins.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018FF001(‐004)cKey Project for Yunnan Provincial Traditional Chinese Medicine Joint  a81460581cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aPanax notoginseng 3aanticoagulant activity 3aanticoagulants 3achemometrics 3acoagulation 3aginsenosides 3amodel validation 3aphytochemicals 3aChina1 aLiu, Chun‐Lu1 aLi, Dan‐Dan1 aWang, Yuan‐Zhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5376-757X1 aXu, Fu‐Rong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9588-94440 tPhytochemical analysis.g2022 Aug., v. 33, no. 6 p.971-981dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl58272x0958-03447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pca.31523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03470naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001800138245012100156300001600277500002000293520173200313592002802045596009502073596012902168596012702297650003102424650003802455650001202493650001602505650002102521650001902542650001302561650001702574650001602591650001402607700001902621700002002640700005302660700001402713700002102727700006002748773012202808856007302930852000903003655001203012IND60786026120221119014031.0220802e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078602612DNAL7 a10.1002/pca.31442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMu, Li‐Ting10aStudy on the technology of efficient extraction of eleutheroside E from Acanthopanax senticosus by green solvent DES  ap. 879-885.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOBJECTIVES: Acanthopanax senticosus (Rupr. & Maxim.) Harms is a medicinal and edible plant which is clinically used for the recovery and treatment of cardiovascular and central diseases. As a characteristic active pharmaceutical ingredient of Acanthopanax senticosus, eleutheroside E is the core of the therapeutic effect. Organic solvent extraction has low selectivity, low extraction rate, difficulty in separation and purification and safety risks. The purpose of this study was to extract the effective component of Acanthopanax senticosus with a new green solvent. METHODS: In this article, two kinds of deep eutectic solvents (DESs) (DES‐1 and DES‐2) were synthesised by heating and stirring methods. Eleutheroside E was extracted by ultrasonic extraction with two kinds of DES as extractants and quantitatively analysed by Orbitrap‐tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). RESULTS: The main results showed that the initial polarity of the DES was similar to that of 60 to 80% ethanol and hydrogen bond donors were the main factors affecting the polarity of DES. In the test, the viscosity of DES was higher than that of ethanol, and even the addition of a small amount of water (10%) caused intermolecular hydrogen bond disruption and redistribution of the solvent, resulting in a significant decrease in solvent viscosity. The solvents in the test group were stable after standing at 5°C in the dark for 100 days. The extraction rate of eleutheroside E by DES solvent was 5‐6 times higher than that by ethanol. DES‐1 and DES‐2 can efficiently extract eleutheroside E. CONCLUSION: This study developed a new method for the application of the green extraction of eleutheroside E with certain practical significance.  aPublisher supplied data  a2020‐KYYWF‐0243cHeilongjiang Provincial Higher Education Fundamental Research Project  akfkt2021‐02cKey Laboratory of New Drug Development and Pharmacodynamic Toxicological Evaluation in Heilongjiang Province.  aJDXKTD‐2019005cSpecially Discipliane Construction Project of the North Medicine and Functional Food, Jiamusi University 3aEleutherococcus senticosus 3aactive pharmaceutical ingredients 3aethanol 3afood plants 3ahydrogen bonding 3aphytochemicals 3asolvents 3atherapeutics 3aultrasonics 3aviscosity1 aZhang, Qi‐Di1 aSun, Shi‐Yuan1 aLiu, Bing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3288-71151 aZhang, Yu1 aZhang, Xin‐Ran1 aSun, Chang‐Hai1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4331-38430 tPhytochemical analysis.g2022 Aug., v. 33, no. 6 p.879-885dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl58272x0958-03447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pca.31443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03509naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002400184245015100208300001800359506007600377520012400453520187100577592002802448506003702476650002402513650001802537650001302555650001602568650002402584700002302608700002102631700002102652700002202673700002702695700001802722700002402740700002402764700002002788700004202808773011502850856007702965852000903042655001203051IND60172065620221207125016.0150602e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017206562DNAL7 a10.1104/pp.114.2508112doi7 aPMC42568642pmcid7 a253678582pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPellizzaro, Anthoni14aThe Nitrate Transporter MtNPF6.8 (MtNRT1.3) Transports Abscisic Acid and Mediates Nitrate Regulation of Primary Root Growth in Medicago truncatula  ap. 2152-2165.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA nitrate transporter transports ABA and regulates primary root growth via an ABA-dependent nitrate signaling pathway .  aElongation of the primary root during postgermination of Medicago truncatula seedlings is a multigenic trait that is responsive to exogenous nitrate. A quantitative genetic approach suggested the involvement of the nitrate transporter MtNPF6.8 (for Medicago truncatula NITRATE TRANSPORTER1/PEPTIDE TRANSPORTER Family6.8) in the inhibition of primary root elongation by high exogenous nitrate. In this study, the inhibitory effect of nitrate on primary root elongation, via inhibition of elongation of root cortical cells, was abolished in npf6.8 knockdown lines. Accordingly, we propose that MtNPF6.8 mediates nitrate inhibitory effects on primary root growth in M. truncatula . p MtNPF6.8 : GUS promoter-reporter gene fusion in Agrobacterium rhizogenes -generated transgenic roots showed the expression of MtNPF6.8 in the pericycle region of primary roots and lateral roots, and in lateral root primordia and tips. MtNPF6.8 expression was insensitive to auxin and was stimulated by abscisic acid (ABA), which restored the inhibitory effect of nitrate in npf6.8 knockdown lines. It is then proposed that ABA acts downstream of MtNPF6.8 in this nitrate signaling pathway. Furthermore, MtNPF6.8 was shown to transport ABA in Xenopus spp. oocytes, suggesting an additional role of MtNPF6.8 in ABA root-to-shoot translocation. ¹⁵NO ₃⁻-influx experiments showed that only the inducible component of the low-affinity transport system was affected in npf6.8 knockdown lines. This indicates that MtNPF6.8 is a major contributor to the inducible component of the low-affinity transport system. The short-term induction by nitrate of the expression of Nitrate Reductase1 ( NR1 ) and NR2 (genes that encode two nitrate reductase isoforms) was greatly reduced in the npf6.8 knockdown lines, supporting a role of MtNPF6.8 in the primary nitrate response in M. truncatula .  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMedicago truncatula 3aabscisic acid 3anitrates 3aroot growth 3asignal transduction1 aClochard, Thibault1 aCukier, Caroline1 aBourdin, Céline1 aJuchaux, Marjorie1 aMontrichard, Francoise1 aThany, Steeve1 aRaymond, Valéérie1 aPlanchet, Elisabeth1 aLimami, Anis M.1 aMorééère-Le Paven, Marie-Christine0 tPlant physiology.g2014 Dec., v. 166, no. 4 p.2152-2165dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.114.2508113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03077naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245011500168520150300283592002801786650004401814650002301858650002201881650003701903650002601940650001301966650001301979650004101992650001302033650001902046650001402065650000902079650001802088650001402106650001502120650003302135650003702168653002002205653002502225653002302250653001502273700001602288700001702304700001602321700001802337773011902355856008802474852000902562655001202571IND60679612120221120230113.0211114e20200325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067961212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1363082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Qianyu10aMechanism and impact of synthesis conditions on the one-step green synthesis of hybrid RGO@Fe/Pd nanoparticles  aWhile a one-step green synthesis of a hybrid material composed of reduced graphene oxide and bimetallic Fe/Pd nanoparticles (RGO@Fe/Pd NPs) was previously successfully reported and evaluated for the removal of organic contaminants, the relationship between the formation of RGO@Fe/Pd and the resulting reactivity was unclear. In this paper the impact of the specific synthetic conditions on the reactivity of RGO@Fe/Pd was investigated in order to enhance the removal efficiency of antibiotics such as rifampicin. The hybrid material (RGO@Fe/Pd) successfully removed 96.1% of rifampicin compared to only 63.5 and 81.0% for Fe nanoparticles and RGO, respectively. The best synthetic conditions for the formation of RGO@Fe/Pd included GO/Fe = 1:1 and Fe/Pd = 100: 5. In addition, GC–MS and FTIR were used to identify the main reducing biomolecules in the green tea extract responsible for the one-step synthesis of RGO@Fe/Pd as Catechol, Caffeine, 1,3,5-Benzenetriol. The morphology, size and surface composition of RGO@Fe/Pd was characterized by Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-Ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). These advanced characterization techniques suggested that during synthesis GO was initially converted to RGO, and thereafter Fe/Pd NPs (10–50 nm) were dispersed on RGO. Finally, a plausible formation mechanism for the one-step synthesis of the hybrid material was proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3abiochemical compounds 3acaffeine 3acatechol 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3agreen tea 3airon 3ananoparticles 3apalladium 3arifampicin 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aGreen synthesis 0aHybrid RGO@Fe/Pd NPs 0aOne-step synthesis 0aRifampicin1 aLi, Wenpeng1 aWeng, Xiulan1 aOwens, Gary1 aChen, Zuliang0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Mar. 25, v. 710 p.136308-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1363083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02544naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245007600162520137900238592002801617650001901645650002001664650003001684650001001714650002201724650002201746650003501768650002701803650001701830650000901847650002501856650001301881700001801894700002301912700001801935773011901953856007702072852000902149655001202158IND60729281720221117223330.0210228e20210211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072928172DNAL7 a10.3390/genes120202582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarimi, Karim 10aPopulation Genomics of American Mink Using Whole Genome Sequencing Data  aCharacterizing the genetic structure and population history can facilitate the development of genomic breeding strategies for the American mink. In this study, we used the whole genome sequences of 100 mink from the Canadian Centre for Fur Animal Research (CCFAR) at the Dalhousie Faculty of Agriculture (Truro, NS, Canada) and Millbank Fur Farm (Rockwood, ON, Canada) to investigate their population structure, genetic diversity and linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicated that the variation among color-types was significant (p < 0.001) and accounted for 18% of the total variation. The admixture analysis revealed that assuming three ancestral populations (K = 3) provided the lowest cross-validation error (0.49). The effective population size (Ne) at five generations ago was estimated to be 99 and 50 for CCFAR and Millbank Fur Farm, respectively. The LD patterns revealed that the average r² reduced to <0.2 at genomic distances of >20 kb and >100 kb in CCFAR and Millbank Fur Farm suggesting that the density of 120,000 and 24,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) would provide the adequate accuracy of genomic evaluation in these populations, respectively. These results indicated that accounting for admixture is critical for designing the SNP panels for genotype-phenotype association studies of American mink.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNeovison vison 3aanimal research 3aeffective population size 3afarms 3agenetic structure 3agenetic variation 3agenotype-phenotype correlation 3alinkage disequilibrium 3ametagenomics 3amink 3apopulation structure 3avariance1 aNgoc Do, Duy 1 aSargolzaei, Mehdi 1 aMiar, Younes 0 tGenes.g2021 Feb. 11, v. 12, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes120202583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03469naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245018200158300001600340520192600356592002802282650002502310650001502335650001602350650001902366650001302385650001702398650001102415650001502426650001302441650001102454650001202465653003802477653002302515653001602538653003702554653002702591653001602618700001502634700002402649700002602673773022902699856007402928852000903002655001203011IND60568147620221121073029.0190412e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056814762DNAL7 a10.1111/vaa.123902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHopster, Klaus10aControlled mechanical ventilation with constant positive end-expiratory pressure and alveolar recruitment manoeuvres during anaesthesia in laterally or dorsally recumbent horses  ap. 121-126.  aTo compare the effects of controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) and constant positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and interposed recruitment manoeuvres (RMs) with those of CMV without PEEP on gas exchange during general anaesthesia and the early recovery period.Prospective, randomized clinical trial.A total of 48 Warmblood horses undergoing elective surgery in lateral (Lat) (n = 24) or dorsal (Dors) (n = 24) recumbency.Premedication (romifidine), induction (diazepam and ketamine) and maintenance (isoflurane in oxygen) were identical in all horses. Groups Lat- CMV and Dors-CMV (each n = 12) were ventilated using CMV. Groups Lat-RM and Dors-RM (each n = 12) were ventilated using CMV with constant PEEP (10 cmH2O) and intermittent RMs (three consecutive breaths with peak inspiratory pressure of 60 cmH2O, 80 cmH2O and 60 cmH2O, respectively). RMs were applied as required to maintain PaO2 at > 400 mmHg (> 53.3 kPa). Dobutamine was given to maintain mean arterial blood pressure at > 60 mmHg. Physiological parameters were recorded every 10 minutes. Arterial blood gases were measured intra- and postoperatively. Statistical analyses were conducted using analyses of variance (anova),t tests and the Mann–Whitney U-test.Horses in Dors-RM had higher PaO2 values [478 ± 35 mmHg (63.7 ± 4.6 kPa)] than horses in Dors-CMV [324 ± 45 mmHg (43.2 ± 6 kPa)] during anaesthesia and the early recovery period. There were no differences between horses in groups Lat-CMV and Lat-RM. Other measured parameters did not differ between groups.Ventilation with CMV, constant PEEP and interposed RM provided improved arterial oxygenation in horses in dorsal recumbency that lasted into the early recovery period, but had no benefit in horses in lateral recumbency. This mode of ventilation may provide a clinically practicable method of improving oxygenation in anaesthetized horses, especially in dorsal recumbency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of variance 3aanesthesia 3ablood gases 3ablood pressure 3adiazepam 3agas exchange 3ahorses 3aisoflurane 3aketamine 3aoxygen 3asurgery 0acontrolled mechanical ventilation 0aequine anaesthesia 0aoxygenation 0apositive end-expiratory pressure 0arecruitment manoeuvres 0aventilation1 aRohn, Karl1 aOhnesorge, Bernhard1 aKästner, Sabine B.R.0 tVeterinary anaesthesia and analgesia.g2017 Jan., v. 44, no. 1 p.121-126dElsevier LtdaAssociation of Veterinary Anaesthetists and American College of Veterinary Anesthesia and AnalgesiawJournal:jnl3774066x1467-29877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vaa.123903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03423naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245012000172520156600292592002801858650001101886650002501897650001401922650001501936650001701951650001901968650003501987650002002022650001202042650001302054650001502067650001402082650002702096650001102123650002202134650001802156650002002174651000902194653003502203653002602238653001902264653002402283653001302307700002302320700002002343700002302363700002102386700002602407700001902433700002302452700001802475700002102493700002802514700002102542700001802563773011902581856008802700852000902788655001202797IND60679612320221120230005.0200824e20200420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067961232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1363172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, Rena R.10aPilot study of global endocrine disrupting activity in Iowa public drinking water utilities using cell-based assays  aSome anthropogenic substances in drinking water are known or suspected endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), but EDCs are not routinely measured. We conducted a pilot study of 10 public drinking water utilities in Iowa, where common contaminants (e.g., pesticides) are suspected EDCs. Raw (untreated) and finished (treated) drinking water samples were collected in spring and fall and concentrated using solid phase extraction. We assessed multiple endocrine disrupting activities using novel mammalian cell-based assays that express nuclear steroid receptors (aryl hydrocarbon [AhR], androgenic [AR], thyroid [TR], estrogenic [ER] and glucocorticoid [GR]). We quantified each receptor's activation relative to negative controls and compared activity by season and utility/sample characteristics. Among 62 samples, 69% had AhR, 52% AR, 3% TR, 2% ER, and 0% GR activity. AhR and AR activities were detected more frequently in spring (p =0 .002 and < 0.001, respectively). AR activity was more common in samples of raw water (p =0 .02) and from surface water utilities (p =0 .05), especially in fall (p =0 .03). Multivariable analyses suggested spring season, surface water, and nitrate and disinfection byproduct concentrations as determinants of bioactivity. Our results demonstrate that AR and AhR activities are commonly found in Iowa drinking water, and that their detection varies by season and utility/sample characteristics. Screening EDCs with cell-based bioassays holds promise for characterizing population exposure to diverse EDCs mixtures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautumn 3abioactive properties 3abioassays 3abyproducts 3adisinfection 3adrinking water 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3aglucocorticoids 3amammals 3anitrates 3apesticides 3ascreening 3asolid phase extraction 3aspring 3asteroid receptors 3asurface water 3awater utilities 3aIowa 0aEndocrine disrupting compounds 0aPublic water supplies 0aDrinking water 0aBiological activity 0aHormones1 aStavreva, Diana A.1 aWeyer, Peter J.1 aVarticovski, Lyuba1 aInoue-Choi, Maki1 aMedgyesi, Danielle N.1 aChavis, Nicole1 aGraubard, Barry I.1 aCain, Terence1 aWichman, Michael1 aBeane Freeman, Laura E.1 aHager, Gordon L.1 aWard, Mary H.0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Apr. 20, v. 714 p.136317-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1363173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02027naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012300168300001400291520102100305592002801326653002701354653002301381653002701404653001701431653000901448700002201457700001601479773013801495856008301633852000901716655001201725IND60126604620221120233631.0151107e200002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012660462DNAL7 a10.1603/0022-0493-93.1.142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlinia, Faramarz10aHeritability of Tolerance to the Cry1Ab Toxin of Bacillus thuringiensis in Chilo suppressalis (Lepidoptera: Crambidae)  ap. 14-17.  aHeritability of Chilo suppressalis (Walker) tolerance to the Cry1Ab toxin of Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner was estimated using a half-sibling design. Artificial diet with and without Cry1Ab was infested with progenies of 20 males, each mated with 2 females, and mortality was scored 5 d after infestation. The progeny of each female was reared and scored separately. Mean mortality of the 20 families on the Cry1Ab diet was 46.5%. The effects of both male parent and of female parent within male parent were significant. Heritability was estimated to be 0.52, suggesting that a high proportion of phenotypic variation was because of genetic differences. Mortality on the Cry1Ab diet was not correlated with mortality on control diet, indicating that differences among families in tolerance to Cry1Ab were not attributable to differences in general fitness. Our results indicate that ““high dose”” Bt rice plants may be particularly important for Cry1Ab resistance management in C. suppressalis populations.  aPublisher supplied data 0aBacillus thuringiensis 0aChilo suppressalis 0ainsecticide resistance 0aheritability 0arice1 aCohen, Michael B.1 aGould, Fred0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2000 Feb., v. 93, no. 1 p.14-17dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603%2F0022-0493-93.1.143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02963naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006300139245010400202300001800306500002000324520106300344592002801407596008001435650001901515650001901534650001901553650001101572650001401583650002301597650001401620650001301634650001201647650001601659700005701675700001701732700006001749700006601809700002501875700001901900700006101919700002101980700002902001700002202030700002202052700002102074700007102095700005902166773012502225856007402350852000902424655001202433IND60786026420221119014124.0220802e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078602642DNAL7 a10.1111/gcb.163122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWåhlström, Iréne1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8735-268X10aProjected climate change impact on a coastal sea—As significant as all current pressures combined  ap. 5310-5319.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aClimate change influences the ocean's physical and biogeochemical conditions, causing additional pressures on marine environments and ecosystems, now and in the future. Such changes occur in environments that already today suffer under pressures from, for example, eutrophication, pollution, shipping, and more. We demonstrate how to implement climate change into regional marine spatial planning by introducing data of future temperature, salinity, and sea ice cover from regional ocean climate model projections to an existing cumulative impact model. This makes it possible to assess climate change impact in relation to pre‐existing cumulative impact from current human activities. Results indicate that end‐of‐century projected climate change alone is a threat of the same magnitude as the combination of all current pressures to the marine environment. These findings give marine planners and policymakers forewarning on how future climate change may impact marine ecosystems, across space, emission scenarios, and in relation to other pressures.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017‐01949cSwedish Research Council for sustainable development (Formas) 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3aeutrophication 3ahumans 3aice cover 3amarine environment 3apollution 3asalinity 3asea ice 3atemperature1 aHammar, Linus1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6823-85041 aHume, Duncan1 aJónas Pálsson,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3134-46021 aAlmroth‐Rosell, Elin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4052-045X1 aDieterich, Christian1 aArneborg, Lars1 aGröger, Matthias1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9927-51641 aMattsson, Martin1 aZillén Snowball, Lovisa1 aKagesten, Gustav,1 aTörnqvist, Oscar1 aBreviere, Emilie1 aBrunnabend, Sandra‐Esther1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7837-58201 aJonsson, Per R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1793-54730 tGlobal change biology.g2022 Sept., v. 28, no. 17 p.5310-5319dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57021x1354-10137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.163123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02784naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245009700169300001400266520170100280592002801981650001502009650002002024650001102044650001302055650001102068650001502079650002402094650002102118650002002139650001102159650001102170700001902181700001902200773009602219856008602315852000902401655001202410IND60096660420221120122211.0141104e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009666042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2013.04.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIsmail, M.S.10aAnalysis and evaluation of various aspects of solar radiation in the Palestinian territories  ap. 57-68.  aThis paper aims to evaluate the different models used to analyze different aspects of solar radiation in the Palestinian territories. Calculations of the optimized tilt and surface azimuth angles on monthly, seasonal and yearly basis were conducted, with the genetic algorithm being used for this purpose. Different PV tracking methods were also evaluated, taking into account the annual energy production. The different models used to calculate hourly global solar radiation from the daily data were tested in order to facilitate the selection of the most suitable model in the context of Palestine. The calibration of coefficients for the different regression models that were used for estimating the global solar radiation based on sunshine hours was also performed during the course of this work. These coefficients were calculated using both MATLAB’s fitting tool and genetic algorithm. Linear, quadratic and linear–algorithmic regression models displayed almost identical results. Each has a distinctive predominant feature, especially in the context of statistical indicators. They were calculated using both the monthly average daily data and the daily data sets. With regards to the PV panel angles’ optimization, it was found that the yearly optimum tilt angle (32.8°) is adjacent to the latitude of the location (31.8°), while the surface azimuth angle is 16°. It was also found that changing the tilt angle of the PV panels quarterly (optimized on seasonally basis) increases energy yield by 3.4% when compared with fixing this tilt angle at yearly optimized value. It was also discovered that changing the surface azimuth angle is more effective during winters than summers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3adata collection 3aenergy 3alatitude 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aregression analysis 3asolar collectors 3asolar radiation 3asummer 3awinter1 aMoghavvemi, M.1 aMahlia, T.M.I.0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2013 Sept., v. 73 p.57-68dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2013.04.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03982naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006300139245009900202300001800301500002000319520218300339592002802522596003102550596003502581596002102616650001502637650001002652650001202662650001202674650001102686650003302697650002902730650001302759650001302772650002602785650001302811650001502824650001802839650002002857650002502877650001202902650001202914650001202926700006102938700002202999700006703021700001603088700005603104700006003160773012503220856007403345852000903419655001203428IND60786026520221119013653.0220802e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078602652DNAL7 a10.1111/gcb.162792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJyväsjärvi, Jussi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3886-702410aDark matters: Contrasting responses of stream biofilm to browning and loss of riparian shading  ap. 5159-5171.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aConcentrations of terrestrial‐derived dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in freshwater ecosystems have increased consistently, causing freshwater browning. The mechanisms behind browning are complex, but in forestry‐intensive regions browning is accelerated by land drainage. Forestry actions in streamside riparian forests alter canopy shading, which together with browning is expected to exert a complex and largely unpredictable control over key ecosystem functions. We conducted a stream mesocosm experiment with three levels of browning (ambient vs. moderate vs. high, with 2.7 and 5.5‐fold increase, respectively, in absorbance) crossed with two levels of riparian shading (70% light reduction vs. open canopy) to explore the individual and combined effects of browning and loss of shading on the quantity (algal biomass) and nutritional quality (polyunsaturated fatty acid and sterol content) of the periphytic biofilm. We also conducted a field survey of differently colored (4.7 to 26.2 mg DOC L⁻¹) streams to provide a ‘reality check’ for our experimental findings. Browning reduced greatly the algal biomass, suppressed the availability of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and sterols, but increased the availability of terrestrial‐derived long‐chain saturated fatty acids (LSAFA). In contrast, loss of shading increased primary productivity, which resulted in elevated sterol and EPA contents of the biofilm. The field survey largely repeated the same pattern: biofilm nutritional quality decreased significantly with increasing DOC, as indicated particularly by a decrease of the ω‐3:ω‐6 ratio and increase in LSAFA content. Algal biomass, in contrast, was mainly controlled by dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) concentration, while DOC concentration was of minor importance. The ongoing browning process is inducing a dramatic reduction in the nutritional quality of the stream biofilm. Such degradation of the major high‐quality food source available for stream consumers may reduce the trophic transfer efficiency in stream ecosystems, potentially extending across the stream‐forest ecotone.  aPublisher supplied data  a318230cAcademy of Finland  cERA‐NET Water JPI Waterworks  a82263cNordForsk 3aabsorbance 3aalgae 3abiofilm 3abiomass 3acanopy 3adissolved inorganic nitrogen 3adissolved organic carbon 3adrainage 3aecotones 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3aforestry 3afreshwater 3aglobal change 3anutritive value 3aprimary productivity 3asterols 3astreams 3asurveys1 aRajakallio, Maria1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1747-70781 aBrüsecke, Joanna1 aHuttunen, Kaisa‐Leena1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0488-12741 aHuusko, Ari1 aMuotka, Timo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2268-56831 aTaipale, Sami J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7510-73370 tGlobal change biology.g2022 Sept., v. 28, no. 17 p.5159-5171dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57021x1354-10137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.162793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01750naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006200149245018100211300001800392500001900410520035900429592002800788650001600816650001200832650003600844650002300880650001100903650002800914650001200942700005700954700007101011700002901082700006401111773012101175856008301296852000901379655001201388IND60702372220221120134742.0200717e20200707xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070237222DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.0c015332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGurram, Ravi Kumar1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4772-401712aA Sequential Activation of Alkyne and C–H Bonds for the Tandem Cyclization and Annulation of Alkynols and Maleimides through Cooperative Sc(III) and Cp*-Free Co(II) Catalysis  ap. 5326-5330.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  a[4 + 2] oxidative Diels–Alder reaction of readily available alkynols with maleimide is achieved for the rapid access of pthalimide-fused multicyclic compounds.

In 1960–1961, human‐ignited wildfires occurred during an extremely dry summer that killed many A. cupressoides stands on the high plateau in the center of Tasmania. That fire year, coupled with subsequent regeneration failure, caused a loss of ca. 10% of the geographic extent of this endemic Tasmanian forest type. To provide historical context for these large‐scale fire events, we (i) collected dendroecological, floristic, and structural data, (ii) documented the postfire survival and regeneration of A. cupressoides and co‐occurring understory species, and (iii) assessed postfire understory plant community composition and flammability. We found that fire frequency did not vary following the arrival of European settlers, and that A. cupressoides populations were able to persist under a regime of low‐to‐mid severity fires prior to the 1960 fires. Our data indicate that the 1960 fires were (i) of greater severity than previous fires, (ii) herbivory by native marsupials may limit seedling survival in both burned and unburned A. cupressoides stands, and (iii) the loss of A. cupressoides populations is largely irreversible given the relatively high fuel loads of postfire vegetation communities that are dominated by resprouting shrubs. We suggest that the feedback between regeneration failure and increased flammability will be further exacerbated by a warmer and drier climate causing A. cupressoides to contract to the most fire‐proof landscape settings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMetatheria 3abotanical composition 3aclimate 3aconifers 3aflammability 3aforest types 3afuel loading 3aherbivores 3alandscapes 3aplant communities 3aplateaus 3aseedlings 3ashrubs 3asummer 3atemperate forests 3aunderstory 3awildfires 3aTasmania1 aWood, Sam W.1 aVeblen, Thomas T.1 aBowman, David M.J.S.0 tGlobal change biology.g2015 Jan., v. 21, no. 1 p.445-458dBlackwell Sciencex1354-10137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.126743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02611naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245009400169300001400263520147300277592002801750650001501778650001101793650002401804650002101828650002301849650002501872651001001897653001801907653003101925653002001956653001901976700001901995700001702014773011402031856008302145852000902228655001202237IND60526269820221120192851.0190403e20160101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052626982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2015.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCórcoles, J.I.10aPumping station regulation in on-demand irrigation networks using strategic control nodes  ap. 48-56.  aThe development of tools focused on the management of branched irrigation networks is important for the efficient use of water and energy resources. The objective of this paper is to develop and validate a methodology and an Optimum Regulation of Pumping Stations (ORPS) tool to estimate the pressure head at all the nodes of an irrigation network based on the pressure head at a few strategic nodes of the network that are used for pumping station control. Once the pressure head at all nodes in the network is estimated, the pressure head at the pumping station can be adjusted to supply the exact pressure necessary to ensure the minimum pressure in the most restrictive of the open nodes of the network. This paper is based on the generation of demand scenarios, which aim to represent a whole range of discharges and not only the design discharge. The tool developed with this methodology has been applied in two on-demand irrigation networks with manometric regulation located in Castilla—La Mancha region (Spain). Moreover, in the analyzed irrigation networks, the use of three strategic nodes estimated the pressure of the reminder hydrants highly accurately. Thus, increasing the number of control points would not improve the accuracy of the estimates and would increase the complexity of the automation system. Using the proposed methodology, energy savings of nearly 3–5% were obtained relative to the average energy consumed for manometric regulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomation 3aenergy 3aenergy conservation 3aenergy resources 3airrigation systems 3awater use efficiency 3aSpain 0aPumps control 0aPumping station efficiency 0aStrategic nodes 0aEnergy savings1 aTarjuelo, J.M.1 aMoreno, M.A.0 tAgricultural water management.g2016 Jan. 01, v. 163 p.48-56dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2015.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02657naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245008700167520141700254592002801671650002501699650001801724650001601742650001101758650002901769700003301798700003101831700003001862700002401892700001901916700002301935700003401958700002501992700002402017700002502041773011902066856007702185852000902262655001202271IND60729282120221117223326.0210228e20210211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072928212DNAL7 a10.3390/genes120202622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPepłońska, Beata 10aCommon Myelin Regulatory Factor Gene Variants Predisposing to Excellence in Sports  aIn all sport disciplines, excellent coordination of movements is crucial for achieving mastery. The ability to learn new motor skills quickly and effectively is dependent on efficient myelination which varies between individuals. It has been suggested that these differences may play a role in athletic performance. The process of myelination is under transcriptional control by Myelin Regulatory Factor (MYRF) as well as other transcription factors (SOX10 and OLIG2). We analyze a panel of 28 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located within the frequencies of common variants of MYRF, SOX10 and OLIG2 genes in professional athletes compared to non-athletes. No significant differences were detected after correction for multiple testing by false discovery rate (FDR) for any of the models tested. However, some deviations from the expected distribution was found for seven SNPs (rs174528, rs139884, rs149435516 and rs2238001, rs7943728, rs61747222, and rs198459). The MYRF alleles rs7943728 and rs61747222 showed a correlation with the level of sport achievement among the athletes. Even though the athletes did not differ from the non-athlete controls in the distribution of most SNPs analyzed, some interesting differences of several variants were noted. Presented results indicate that genetic variants of MYRF and SOX10 could be genetic factors weakly predisposing for successful athletic performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aathletic performance 3amyelin sheath 3amyelination 3asports 3atranscription (genetics)1 aPiestrzynska-Kajtoch, Agata 1 aHumińska-Lisowska, Kinga 1 aAdamczyk, Jakub  Grzegorz1 aSiewierski, Marcin 1 aGurgul, Artur 1 aFornal, Agnieszka 1 aMichałowska-Sawczyn, Monika 1 aŻekanowski, Cezary 1 aCięszczyk, Paweł 1 aBerdyński, Mariusz 0 tGenes.g2021 Feb. 11, v. 12, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes120202623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03188naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245009700158300001400255520172900269592002801998650001702026650001002043650001602053650001902069650001202088650001902100650001502119650001502134650001502149650001102164650001402175650001302189650001102202650000702213650002602220650001402246653002302260653001702283653000902300653001002309653002702319700001802346700002002364773022702384856007402611852000902685655001202694IND60568147820221121100727.0190412e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056814782DNAL7 a10.1111/vaa.123922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBardell, David10aEvaluation of a new handheld point-of-care blood gas analyser using 100 equine blood samples  ap. 77-85.  aTo determine whether the Enterprise point-of-care blood analysis system (EPOC) produces results in agreement with two other blood gas analysers in regular clinical use (i-STAT and Radiometer ABL77) and to investigate the precision of the new machine when used with equine whole blood.Prospective, randomized, non-blinded, comparative laboratory analyser study.Horses admitted to a university teaching hospital requiring arterial or venous blood gas analysis as part of their routine clinical management.One hundred equine blood samples were run immediately, consecutively and in randomized order on three blood gas analysers. Results of variables common to all three analysers were tested for agreement and compared with guidelines used in human medicine. These require 80% of results from the test analyser to fall within a defined range or percentage of results from the comparator devices to achieve acceptability. Additionally, 21 samples were run twice in quick succession on the EPOC analyser to investigate precision.Agreement targets were not met for haematocrit, haemoglobin and base excess for either i-STAT or ABL77 analysers. EPOC precision targets were not met for partial pressure of carbon dioxide, ionized calcium, haematocrit and haemoglobin. Overall comparative performance of the EPOC was good to excellent for pH, oxygen tension, potassium, bicarbonate and oxygen saturation of haemoglobin, but marginal to poor for other parameters.The EPOC may be useful in performing analysis of equine whole blood, but trend analysis of carbon dioxide tension, ionized calcium, haematocrit and haemoglobin should be interpreted with caution. The EPOC should not be used interchangeably with other blood gas analysers.  aPublisher supplied data 3abicarbonates 3ablood 3ablood gases 3ablood sampling 3acalcium 3acarbon dioxide 3aguidelines 3ahematocrit 3ahemoglobin 3ahorses 3ahospitals 3amedicine 3aoxygen 3apH 3apoint-of-care systems 3apotassium 0ablood gas analysis 0aelectrolytes 0aEPOC 0ahorse 0apoint-of-care analyser1 aWest, Eleanor1 aMark Senior, J.0 tVeterinary anaesthesia and analgesia.g2017 Jan., v. 44, no. 1 p.77-85dElsevier LtdaAssociation of Veterinary Anaesthetists and American College of Veterinary Anesthesia and AnalgesiawJournal:jnl3774066x1467-29877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vaa.123923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01415naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001400149245010000163300001800263500001900281520032200300592002800622650001300650650001400663650002300677650003000700700001700730700001500747700005600762700005800818773012100876856008300997852000901080655001201089IND60702372320221120125943.0200717e20200630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070237232DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.0c015812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Dawei10aAsymmetric Synthesis of Axially Chiral Anilides via Organocatalytic Atroposelective N-Acylation  ap. 5331-5336.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA highly atroposelective N-acylation reaction of aniline-derived sulfonamides has been developed with chiral isothiourea as the catalyst.

The annotation system is based on the Mammography Annotation Ontology (MAO) where the BI-RADS score reasoning works. However, ontologies are based on crisp logic and they cannot handle uncertainty. Consequently, we propose a Bayesian-based approach to model uncertainty in mammography ontology and make reasoning possible using BI-RADS scores with SQWRL (Semantic Query-enhanced Web Rule Language). First, we give general information about our system and present details of mammography annotation ontology, its main concepts and relationships. Then, we express uncertainty in mammography and present approaches to handle uncertainty issues. System is evaluated with a manually annotated dataset DEMS (Dokuz Eylul University Mammography Set) and DDSM (Digital Database for Screening Mammography). We give the result of experimentations in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, precision and uncertainty level measures.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3adigital database 3aimage analysis 3amodel uncertainty 3amodels 3ascreening 3aworld wide web1 aAlpkoçak, Adil,1 aBalci, Pinar0 tComputers in Biology and Medicine.g2013 May 1, v. 43, no. 4 p.301-311dElsevier Ltdx0010-48257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2013.01.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03122naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006500150245008300215520143300298592002801731650002101759650002401780650001501804650002501819650002301844650000901867650001901876650002001895650001501915650001001930650001201940650001701952650002201969650001901991650001602010653003902026653002702065653002502092653001702117700003302134700005802167700005802225700001902283700002002302700001602322700006002338773011202398856008502510852000902595655001202604IND60730097720221119033625.0210619e20210601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073009772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2021.1192272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaggay, Irish Valerie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8359-812110aThermostable antifouling zwitterionic vapor-induced phase separation membranes  aBiofouling resistance of membranes is generally evaluated in normal conditions of temperature. Yet, some membranes can undergo heat treatments either before use (sterilization for biomedical use) or during operation (when temperature gradient is the driving force to the separation), which can impair the anti-biofouling material. Here, we prepared zwitterionic polyvinylidene fluoride membranes by the vapor-induced phase separation (VIPS) process, using a copolymer made of styrene units and zwitterionized 4-vinylpyridine. Membranes were fully characterized by a variety of physicochemical analyses to demonstrate the formation of bi-continuous structure and the presence of the zwitterionic copolymer on the surface of the membrane. Then, anti-biofouling properties were studied at ambient temperature using Escherichia coli bacteria, whole blood, platelet rich plasma and bovine serum albumin, before moving onto their assessment at higher temperature (60 °C) or after a steam sterilization of the membranes. Results demonstrated that anti-biofouling properties were sustained despite the heat treatment, while some common zwitterionic anti-biofouling materials (sulfobetaine methacrylate) is known to fail in similar conditions. Hence, the present membranes can be applied in a large variety of domains where bi-continuous microfiltration anti-biofouling membranes are needed and undergo heat exposure or heat treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aambient temperature 3abiofouling 3abovine serum albumin 3acomposite polymers 3aheat 3aheat treatment 3amicrofiltration 3aseparation 3asteam 3astyrene 3asulfobetaine 3athermal stability 3athermoplastics 3azwitterions 0aThermostable biofouling resistance 0aZwitterionic copolymer 0aIn-situ modification 0aVIPS process1 aSuba, Maria Charisma Anne M.1 aAini, Hana Nur1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3392-94331 aWu, Chien-Jung1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5609-60511 aTang, Shuo-Hsi1 aAquino, Ruth B.1 aChang, Yung1 aVenault, Antoine1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0383-695X0 tJournal of membrane science.g2021 June 01, v. 627 p.119227-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2021.1192273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03080naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245016600173506002800339520169800367592002802065506003702093650003402130650002202164650002402186650002302210650001602233650001702249650001702266650000902283650002602292650001402318653001002332653002202342653001802364653002302382700001202405700002602417773011802443856008802561852000902649655001202658IND60774247820221207064301.0171211e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077424782DNAL7 a10.14692/jfi.13.2.59%E2%80%93662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuliani, Fitria10aGalur Isogenik Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae Hasil Penyinaran Ultraviolet dan Potensinya Sebagai Penginduksi Resistensi Padi terhadap Penyakit Hawar Daun Bakteri  aResource is Open Access  a<p>Bacterial leaf blight (BLB) caused by <em>Xanthomonas oryzae</em> pv. <em>oryzae</em> is an important rice disease and may cause 50% plant damage. One approach to manage this disease is using isogenic non-pathogenic strain that can induce plant resistance. This study was conducted to obtain isogenic strains of <em>X. oryzae</em> pv. <em>oryzae</em> through ultraviolet irradiation and evaluate ability of the isolates in inducing plant resistance. Bacteria <em>X. oryzae</em> pv. <em>oryzae</em> were exposed to UV for 3, 5, 10 and 15 min. A total of 99 colonies obtained were selected through pathogenicity tests, followed by confirmation using XOR-F and XOR-R2 primers. As much as 16 isogenic strain isolates were obtained with the ability to produce exopolysaccharides (EPS) ranges between 1.4–9.8 mg mL<sup>-1</sup> compared to wild-type 6.0 mg mL<sup>-1</sup>. Five isogenic strains isolates (M313, M57, M101, M1513 and M1515) caused virulence reduction of 92.8–98.6%. Application of those five isogenic isolates prolonged incubation period of <em>X. oryzae</em> pv. <em>Oryzae</em>, i.e. 6.6–5.4 days compared to the wild-type i.e. 4.8 days after inoculation. Suppression of disease progression was also observed with AUDPC value 615.0-827.5, which was lower than those caused by wild-type and control, i.e. 863.3 and 682.5, respectively. Application of isogenic strain isolates did not affect plant growth but it increased plant productivity. Isogenic strain M101 was the best isolate with an incubation period of 5.7 days after inoculation, having the lowest AUDPC value (615.0), and yielded dry weight of 100 grains higher (2.8 g) than those of the wild-type (2.0 g). </p>  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aXanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae 3aavirulent strains 3adisease progression 3aexopolysaccharides 3aleaf blight 3aplant damage 3aplant growth 3arice 3aultraviolet radiation 3avirulence 0aAUDPC 0aincubation period 0apathogenicity 0aresistance inducer1 aGiyanto1 aMutaqin, Kikin Hamzah0 tJurnal Fitopatologi.g2017 July, v. 13, no. 2dPerhimpunan Fitopatologi IndonesiawJournal:27732x2339-24797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.14692/jfi.13.2.59%E2%80%93663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01520naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245011600167300001800283500001900301520037900320592002800699650001600727650001200743650002500755650002900780650001100809650001400820650000900834700001700843700001700860700001300877700005500890773012100945856008301066852000901149655001201158IND60702372620221120121133.0200717e20200626xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070237262DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.0c015922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Youxiang10aMerger of C–F and C–N Bond Cleavage in Cross-Electrophile Coupling for the Synthesis of gem-Difluoroalkenes  ap. 5347-5352.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHerein we successfully applied Katritzky salts as the alkyl electrophile in the reductive allylic defluorinative cross-coupling reaction with α-trifluoromethyl alkenes.

One hour after discontinuation of desflurane, cats were administered dexmedetomidine (25 μg kg–1), MK-467 (600 μg kg–1), or dexmedetomidine (25 μg kg–1) and MK-467 (600 μg kg–1). All treatments were administered IV as a bolus. Cardiovascular variables were measured prior to drug administration and for 8 hours thereafter. Only data from the dexmedetomidine and dexmedetomidine–MK-467 treatments were analyzed.Dexmedetomidine produced significant decreases in heart rate, cardiac index and right ventricular stroke work index, and significant increases in arterial blood pressure, central venous pressure, pulmonary artery pressure and systemic vascular resistance index. Dexmedetomidine combined with MK-467 resulted in significant but transient decrease in blood pressure and right ventricular stroke work index.Following IV co-administration, MK-467 effectively attenuated dexmedetomidine-induced cardiovascular effects in cats. The drug combination resulted in transient reduction in arterial blood pressure, without causing hypotension.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3ablood pressure 3acarotid arteries 3acatheters 3acats 3adexmedetomidine 3aheart rate 3ahypotension 3ainstrumentation 3aintravenous injection 3aoxygen 3apulmonary artery 0aantagonist 0acardiovascular 0acat 0adexmedetomidine1 aHonkavaara, Juhana1 aIlkiw, Jan E.0 tVeterinary anaesthesia and analgesia.g2017 Jan., v. 44, no. 1 p.52-62dElsevier LtdaAssociation of Veterinary Anaesthetists and American College of Veterinary Anesthesia and AnalgesiawJournal:jnl3774066x1467-29877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vaa.123973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01282naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002400153245007600177300001400253506002800267520026200295592002800557506003700585650001100622650001200633650001200645700003000657700003600687773016000723856008800883852000900971655001200980IND60774247920221207064309.0170815e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077424792DNAL7 a10.21498/2518-1017.6.2007.660202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aЛацко, Т.

Experimental climate change studies from single sites cannot discern whether an observed response is site‐dependent or generalizable. To deconvolve site‐specific vs. regional climatic controls, we examined soil respiration for 18 months along a 520 km climate gradient in three Pacific Northwest, USA prairies that represents increasingly severe Mediterranean conditions from north to south. At each site we implemented a fully factorial combination of 2.5–3 °C warming and 20% added precipitation intensity. The response of soil respiration to warming was driven primarily by the latitudinal climate gradient and not site‐specific factors. Warming increased respiration at all sites during months when soil moisture was not limiting. However, these gains were offset by reductions in respiration during seasonal transitions and summer drought due to lengthened periods of soil moisture limitation. The degree of this offset varied along the north–south climate gradient such that in 2011 warming increased cumulative annual soil respiration 28.6% in the northern site, 13.5% in the central site, and not at all in the southern site. Precipitation also stimulated soil respiration more frequently in the south, consistent with an increased duration of moisture limitation. The best predictors of soil respiration in nonlinear models were the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), antecedent soil moisture, and temperature but these models provided biased results at high and low soil respiration. NDVI was an effective integrator of climate and site differences in plant productivity in terms of their combined effects on soil respiration. Our results suggest that soil moisture limitation can offset the effect of warming on soil respiration, and that greater growing‐season moisture limitation would constrain cumulative annual responses to warming.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMediterranean climate 3aair temperature 3aatmospheric precipitation 3aenvironmental models 3aglobal warming 3anonlinear models 3aprairie soils 3aprairies 3asoil respiration 3asoil water 3asoil-atmosphere interactions 3asoil-plant-atmosphere interactions 3aNorthwestern United States 3aPacific States1 aJohnson, Bart R.1 aPfeifer‐Meister, Laurel1 aBridgham, Scott D.0 tGlobal change biology.g2015 Jan., v. 21, no. 1 p.487-500dBlackwell Sciencex1354-10137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.127323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03486naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003500150245013700185520166400322592002801986650002002014650002102034650001102055650001202066650001902078650001902097650002202116650001202138650000902150650001402159650001202173650003002185650001302215650001702228650001302245650001802258650001202276650001702288650002402305650001602329653002202345653000902367653001902376653001602395653001102411653001902422653001402441700002402455700001702479700002202496700002202518700001802540700002902558700001902587700001902606700002402625773010502649856008502754852000902839655001202848IND60679612920221120221026.0200419e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067961292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pocean.2019.1022572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ados Santos Schmidt, Thassya C.10aEnvironmental stressors may cause unpredicted, notably lagged life-history responses in adults of the planktivorous Atlantic herring  aHere we challenge traditional views on the direction of change in teleost body condition and reproductive traits in response to abiotic and biotic factors by studying the data-rich, planktivorous Norwegian spring-spawning herring (NSSH), a member of the abundant Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) stock complex. To test potential influential factors, we focused on the last twenty years, i.e. a period with ocean warming, a transient but significant drop in zooplankton biomass, and accelerating interspecific competition resulting from primarily Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus) entering these high-latitude waters in large quantities, “the new mackerel era” in the Nordic Seas. Adult NSSH concurrently allocated relatively less to growth in length than weight resulting in higher body condition. Growth likely decreased in warmer waters under stiff prey competition to support reproductive costs. Condition and reproductive responses were not only immediate but were also lagged by three seasons, corresponding to the period when new oocytes are produced. Furthermore, fecundity increased in warmer waters while egg size dropped. Hence, fine-tuned trade-off mechanisms were apparent and varied. We demonstrate that evaluations of reproductive trade-offs based on pooled data are misleading; poor- and good-condition NSSH followed different reproductive trajectories. These findings emphasize difficult-to-predict trends in life-history traits should be tracked longitudinally by the individuals and their aggregate cohort, as they are linked to complex overarching environmental phenomena, like ecosystem carrying capacity and climate fluctuations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClupea harengus 3aScomber scombrus 3aadults 3abiomass 3abiotic factors 3abody condition 3acarrying capacity 3aclimate 3aeggs 3afecundity 3aherring 3ainterspecific competition 3alatitude 3alife history 3amackerel 3aocean warming 3aoocytes 3aplanktivores 3areproductive traits 3azooplankton 0aEnergy allocation 0aPrey 0aClimate change 0aCompetition 0aGrowth 0aBody condition 0aFecundity1 aDevine, Jennifer A.1 aSlotte, Aril1 aClaireaux, Marion1 aJohannessen, Arne1 aEnberg, Katja1 aÓskarsson, Gudmundur J.1 aKennedy, James1 aKurita, Yutaka1 aKjesbu, Olav Sigurd0 tProgress in oceanography.g2020 Feb., v. 181 p.102257-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11761x0079-66117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2019.1022573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02488naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245008300166500001900249520135000268592002801618650002101646650002601667650002301693650002101716650001801737650003001755650002901785650001501814650001701829700002701846700001901873700002501892773012101917856007902038852000902117655001202126IND60735088420221120205508.0210423e20210413xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073508842DNAL7 a10.3390/biology100403222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKwoji, Iliya  D.10aMulti-Strain Probiotics: Synergy among Isolates Enhances Biological Activities  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe use of probiotics for health benefits is becoming popular because of the quest for safer products with protective and therapeutic effects against diseases and infectious agents. The emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance among pathogens had prompted restrictions over the non-therapeutic use of antibiotics for prophylaxis and growth promotion, especially in animal husbandry. While single-strain probiotics are beneficial to health, multi-strain probiotics might be more helpful because of synergy and additive effects among the individual isolates. This article documents the mechanisms by which multi-strain probiotics exert their effects in managing infectious and non-infectious diseases, inhibiting antibiotic-resistant pathogens and health improvement. The administration of multi-strain probiotics was revealed to effectively alleviate bowel tract conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome, inhibition of pathogens and modulation of the immune system and gut microbiota. Finally, while most of the current research focuses on comparing the effects of multi-strain and single-strain probiotics, there is a dearth of information on the molecular mechanisms of synergy among multi-strain probiotics isolates. This forms a basis for future research in the development of multi-strain probiotics for enhanced health benefits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal husbandry 3aantibiotic resistance 3adisease prevention 3agrowth promotion 3aimmune system 3aintestinal microorganisms 3airritable bowel syndrome 3aprobiotics 3atherapeutics1 aAiyegoro, Olayinka  A.1 aOkpeku, Moses 1 aAdeleke, Matthew  A.0 tBiology.g2021 Apr. 13, v. 10, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology100403223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01966naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001900154245007500173300001600248520074600264592002801010650004201038650005301080650001101133650001501144650001701159650001301176650001801189650001301207650001701220650001301237650002301250650001901273651001801292700003101310773010701341856008801448990002301536852000901559655001201568IND60096160620221118014528.0141104e20130601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009616062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compbiomed.2013.02.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYi, Chun-wŏn,10aResults on mining NHANES data: A case study in evidence-based medicine  ap. 493-503.  aThe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), administered annually by the National Center for Health Statistics, is designed to assess the general health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States.

Treatments consisted of all combinations of 2 rates of halofenozid with H. marelatus nematodes Imidacloprid was used as a standard. Percentage larval mortality was evaluated at 7, 14, and 21 d after treatment. No deleterious effects were observed. The nematode treatments generally produced significantly greater larval mortality relative to both chemical treatments. Twenty-one days after treatment, both rates of nematodes resulted in 100% mortality, whereas insecticide treatments did not surpass 60% mortality. No synergism was detected in any of the combination treatments. There were no significant differences in nematode reproduction in larvae exposed to halofenozide and nematodes versus larvae exposed to only nematodes.  aPublisher supplied data 0aPopillia japonica 0aHeterorhabditis marelatus 0ahalofenozide 0aimidacloprid 0abiological control1 aWinkler, H.

However, the crosstalk between different types of immune cells in the spleen has been poorly understood. In this work, an in vitro strategy is carried out to obtain and characterize mononuclear splenocytes from rainbow trout, using biomarkers associated with lymphocytes (CD4 and IgM) and antigen-presenting cells (CD83 and MHC II). Using these splenocytes, co-cultures of 24 and 48 h are used to determine the gene expression of master transcriptional factors that coordinate the polarization of T cells (t-bet, gata3, and foxp3). The results show a proportional upregulation of foxp3 (compared to t-bet and gata3) in co-cultures (at 24 h) of IFNγ-induced splenocytes with and without stimulation of Piscirickettsia salmonis proteins. In addition, foxp3 upregulation was established in co-cultures with IFNγ-induced cells and in cells only stimulated previously with P. salmonis proteins at 48 h of co-culture. These results show a potential communication between antigen-presenting-like cells and lymphocyte in the spleen, which could be induced towards a Treg phenotype.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGATA transcription factors 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aPiscirickettsia salmonis 3aantigens 3abiomarkers 3acoculture 3afish 3agene expression 3aimmune response 3aphenotype 3aspleen 3asplenocytes 3atranscription (genetics)1 aNombela, Ivan 1 aOrtega-Villaizán, María  Del Mar1 aImarai, Mónica 1 aSchmitt, Paulina 1 aMercado, Luis 0 tBiology.g2021 Apr. 13, v. 10, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology100403243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01718naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001300149245013700162300001800299520058800317592002800905650002300933650001500956650001600971650001300987650001301000650002201013700001501035700001301050700001801063700001801081700005601099773012101155856008301276852000901359655001201368IND60621257320190204000000.0181116e20181031xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062125732DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.8b031242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiao, Ge10aComplete Decoration of the Indolyl Residue in cyclo-l-Trp-l-Trp with Geranyl Moieties by Using Engineered Dimethylallyl Transferases  ap. 7201-7205.  aMutation of the gatekeeping residues for prenyl donor selectivity in six dimethylallyl transferases significantly increased their activities toward geranyl diphosphate. Forty-two geranylated derivatives were obtained from 15 cyclic dipeptides by using the engineered enzymes. Taking cyclo-l-Trp-l-Trp as an example, the geranyl moiety can be attached to all seven possible positions of the indole nucleus.

Total saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated acids and the relationships between them, such as oleic/linoleic and linoleic/linolenic, were calculated. The predominant FAs in the fat of chestnuts were linoleic acid (43.4 ± 4.1% of total FA), oleic acid (30.5 ± 4.8% of total FA), palmitic acid (14.7 ± 1.7% of total FA), and linolenic acid (6.76 ± 2.02% of total FA). These FA represent ≥ 90% of the total FA in all the varieties investigated. Considerable differences were observed in many FA and in their relationships according to the variety. The influence of the production zone only significantly affected the content of arachidic acid. Correlations between oleic acid with linoleic (r = −0.743) and linolenic (r = −0.593) acids were observed thereby indicating metabolic relationships between them.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCastanea 3achestnuts 3afatty acid composition 3afruits 3alinoleic acid 3alinolenic acid 3aoleic acid 3apalmitic acid 3aSpain 0aCastanea sativa 0afatty acids 0atotal lipids 0aCG-FID 0aCastanea sativa 0aácidos grasos 0agrasa total 0aCG-FID1 aRodríguez Galdón, B.1 aDíaz Romero, C.1 aRodríguez Rodríguez, E.0 tCyTA: journal of food.g2011 May 1, v. 9, no. 1 p.77-81dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000065x1947-63457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19476331003686858  aDNAL 7aarticle01692naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006800149245016700217300001800384520056300402592002800965650001400993650002301007650002001030650002001050650001201070700002701082700006801109773012101177856008301298852000901381655001201390IND60621257420190204000000.0181116e20181026xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062125742DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.8b031262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTalero, Alexánder Garay1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9734-826X10aCoupling of Sulfoxonium Ylides with Arynes: A Direct Synthesis of Pro-Chiral Aryl Ketosulfoxonium Ylides and Its Application in the Preparation of α-Aryl Ketones  ap. 7206-7211.  aA general, mild, and versatile synthesis of the challenging α-aryl-β-ketosulfoxonium ylides has been developed for the first time, substituting traditional methods starting from diazo compounds.

The transmittance of nanofluids over solar spectrum (250–2500nm) was measured by the UV–Vis–NIR spectrophotometer based on integrating sphere principle. The factors influencing transmittance of nanofluids, such as particle size, mass fraction and optical path were investigated. The extinction coefficients measured experimentally were compared with the theoretical calculation value. Meanwhile, the photothermal properties of nanofluids were also investigated. The experimental results show that the transmittance of Cu–H₂O nanofluids is much less than that of deionized water, and decreases with increasing nanoparticle size, mass fraction and optical depth. The highest temperature of Cu–H₂O nanofluids (0.1wt.%) can increased up to 25.3% compared with deionized water. The good absorption ability of Cu–H₂O nanofluids for solar energy indicates that it is suitable for direct absorption solar thermal energy systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aenergy 3ananoparticles 3aparticle size 3asolar energy 3atemperature 3atransmittance1 aWang, Shuangfeng1 aZeng, Shequan1 aZheng, Zhaozhi0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2013 Sept., v. 73 p.150-157dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2013.04.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03070naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245014500163300001600308520169500324592002802019650001502047650002802062650002802090650002402118650001302142650002002155650001902175650003202194650001202226651001002238653002502248653002302273653002002296653002602316653001602342700002102358700002002379700002202399773012402421852000902545856008202554655001202636IND4426296320221116141408.0200513e20091001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442629632DNAL7 a10.1007/s10310-009-0136-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiya, Hisashi10aIndividual growing conditions that affect diameter increment of tree saplings after selection harvesting in a mixed forest in northern Japan  ap. 302-310.  aWe analyzed temporal patterns in diameter growth of saplings following selection harvesting in an uneven-aged mixed stand dominated by Abies sachalinensis, Acer mono, Quercus crispula, and Betula ermanii in Hokkaido, northern Japan. We examined interspecific differences in growth responses to local growing conditions including harvesting intensity, crowding, stem size, and past duration of the small growth period. Consistent with expectations based on shade tolerance of the species, the age at which the individual reached a diameter at breast height (DBH) of 12.5 cm was highest for A. sachalinensis and lowest for B. ermanii. The interspecific growth differences between saplings that had or had not experienced local harvesting increased gradually for A. sachalinensis and B. ermanii, but peaked at around 4–6 years after harvesting for Q. crispula. Generalized linear mixed model analysis clearly suggested that individual growth conditions required to enhance diameter growth of saplings differed considerably among species. For Q. crispula and B. ermanii, local harvesting intensity was most strongly and positively associated with diameter growth rate, whereas for A. sachalinensis and A. mono, stem size had the strongest negative effect. Abies sachalinensis saplings responded more to surrounding harvesting when they were relatively small, whereas A. mono showed a weak opposite response. The duration of the small growth period before harvesting had negative effect for A. sachalinensis, but not for the other species. Our study indicated that the influence of selection harvesting on growth of shade-tolerant species depends upon pre- and post-harvest growing conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aharvesting 3ainterspecific variation 3aAcer pictum subsp. mono 3aAbies sachalinensis 3asaplings 3ashade tolerance 3aBetula ermanii 3atree and stand measurements 3aforests 3aJapan 0aAnnual ring analysis 0aCanopy disturbance 0aDiameter growth 0aSingle-tree selection 0aSuppression1 aYoshida, Toshiya1 aNoguchi, Mahoko1 aNakamura, Futoshi0 tJournal of forest research.g2009 Oct. 1, v. 14, no. 5 p.302-310dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl3870061x1610-74037nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10310-009-0136-63Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02343naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003100148245011400179300001600293520097500309592002801284596007801312650001301390650001201403650001501415650001601430650001701446650001701463650001401480650002201494650001201516650001201528650001401540650000901554650001501563650002501578650001301603700006901616773014401685856008301829852000901912655001201921IND60767396620221117223950.0220216e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076739662DNAL7 a10.1007/s00128-021-03387-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcía, Mariano González10aBehavior of the Uptake of Ibuprofen in Five Varieties of Horticultural Crops Irrigated with Regenerated Water  ap. 253-259.  aThe current use of regenerated water in agriculture has led to the emergence of new forms of pollutants, such as pharmaceutical compounds (PCs) which are not fully eliminated in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Therefore, if the effluents of such WWTPs are to be used for agricultural irrigation, the presence of PCs must be analysed and their concentrations determined. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the uptake of ibuprofen (IBP) in horticultural crops irrigated with WWTP effluents and its subsequent effect on human health due to their incorporation into the food chain. The study involved five varieties of crops (lettuce, parsley, cabbage, zucchini and broccoli) grown in a greenhouse and irrigated with WWTP effluent water, in which IBP was analysed. Of the varieties of regenerated water-irrigated horticultural crops, only the leaves of mini-romaine lettuce presented detectable levels of IBP, but without meaning any risk to human health.  aPublisher supplied data  aNEREUS COST Action ES1403ceuropean cooperation in science and technology 3abroccoli 3acabbage 3afood chain 3agreenhouses 3ahorticulture 3ahuman health 3aibuprofen 3airrigated farming 3alettuce 3aparsley 3apollution 3arisk 3atoxicology 3awastewater treatment 3azucchini1 aFernández-López, Carmen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2868-02310 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2022 Feb., v. 108, no. 2 p.253-259dSpringer USwJournal:jnl46145x0007-48617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-021-03387-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02435naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245011800170300001600288520127500304592002801579650001001607650003501617650001501652650001201667650001701679650003701696650001201733650001301745653001001758653001201768653001701780653001401797653002001811653001501831773011101846856008301957852000902040655001202049IND60634252420221120154756.0190606e20190603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063425242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molp.2019.02.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBassel, George W.10aMulticellular Systems Biology: Quantifying Cellular Patterning and Function in Plant Organs Using Network Science  ap. 731-742.  aOrgan function is at least partially shaped and constrained by the organization of their constituent cells. Extensive investigation has revealed mechanisms explaining how these patterns are generated, with less being known about their functional relevance. In this paper, a methodology to discretize and quantitatively analyze cellular patterning is described. By performing global organ-scale cellular interaction mapping, the organization of cells can be extracted and analyzed using network science. This provides a means to take the developmental analysis of cellular organization in complex organisms beyond qualitative descriptions and provides data-driven approaches to inferring cellular function. The bridging of a structure–function relationship in hypocotyl epidermal cell patterning through global topological analysis provides support for this approach. The analysis of cellular topologies from patterning mutants further enables the contribution of gene activity toward the organizational properties of tissues to be linked, bridging molecular and tissue scales. This systems-based approach to investigate multicellular complexity paves the way to uncovering the principles of complex organ design and achieving predictive genotype–phenotype mapping.  aPublisher supplied data 3agenes 3agenotype-phenotype correlation 3ahypocotyls 3amutants 3aplant organs 3astructure-activity relationships 3atissues 3atopology 0aorgan 0anetwork 0aconnectivity 0atransport 0atissue topology 0aconnectome0 tMolecular plant.g2019 June 03, v. 12, no. 6 p.731-742dElsevier Inc.wJournal:J000001387x1674-20527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molp.2019.02.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03873naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006500139245009300204300001600297520202600313592002802339650001902367650001602386650002002402650002102422650003202443650001802475650002002493650002102513650002002534650002102554650002702575650001502602650001202617650002002629650001902649650002102668650001302689650002202702650001002724650000902734650001502743650001702758653002802775653001202803653002602815653001502841653002102856700001802877700002102895700001902916700002102935700001802956700002402974700002502998700002303023773010603046856007403152852000903226655001203235IND60694882920221120134018.0210209e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069488292DNAL7 a10.3382/ps/pez5252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Grande, Annatachja1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8828-108610aDietary zinc source impacts intestinal morphology and oxidative stress in young broilers  ap. 441-453.  aZinc is an essential nutritional trace element for all forms of life as it plays an important role in numerous biological processes. In poultry, zinc is provided by in-feed supplementation, mainly as zinc oxide or zinc sulfate. Alternatively zinc can be supplemented as organic sources, which are characterized by using an organic ligand that may be an amino acid, peptide, or protein to bind zinc and have a higher bioavailability than inorganic zinc sources. There are limited number of studies directly comparing the effects of inorganic vs. organic zinc sources on performance and intestinal health in broilers. Therefore, a digestibility and a performance study were conducted to evaluate and compare the effect of an amino acid-complexed zinc source vs. an inorganic zinc source on intestinal health. The experiment consisted of 2 treatments: either a zinc amino acid complex or zinc sulfate was added to a wheat–rye based diet at 60 ppm Zn, with 10 replicates (34 broilers per pen) per treatment. Effects on performance, intestinal morphology, microbiota composition, and oxidative stress were measured. Supplementing zinc amino acid complexes improved the zinc digestibility coefficient as compared to supplementation with zinc sulfate. Broilers supplemented with zinc amino acid complexes had a significantly lower feed conversion ratio in the starter phase compared to birds supplemented with zinc sulfate. A significantly higher villus length was observed in broilers supplemented with zinc amino acid complexes at days 10 and 28. Supplementation with zinc amino acid complexes resulted in a decreased abundance of several genera belonging to the phylum of Proteobacteria. Plasma malondialdehyde levels and glutathione peroxidase activity showed an improved oxidative status in broilers supplemented with zinc amino acid complexes. In conclusion, zinc supplied in feed as amino acid complex is more readily absorbed, potentially conferring a protective effect on villus epithelial cells in the starter phase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProteobacteria 3aamino acids 3abioavailability 3abroiler chickens 3adietary mineral supplements 3adigestibility 3aenzyme activity 3aepithelial cells 3afeed conversion 3afeed supplements 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aintestines 3aligands 3amalondialdehyde 3amicroorganisms 3aoxidative stress 3apeptides 3aprotective effect 3avilli 3azinc 3azinc oxide 3azinc sulfate 0azinc amino acid complex 0abroiler 0aintestinal morphology 0amicrobiota 0aoxidative stress1 aLeleu, Saskia1 aDelezie, Evelyne1 aRapp, Christof1 aDe Smet, Stefaan1 aGoossens, Evy1 aHaesebrouck, Freddy1 aVan Immerseel, Filip1 aDucatelle, Richard0 tPoultry science.g2020 Jan., v. 99, no. 1 p.441-453dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps/pez5253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03862naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245009800164300001600262500001500278520195000293592002802243650001102271650001802282650002502300650001502325650001702340650001402357650001102371650002102382650001902403650001402422650001402436650001602450650001502466650001402481650002302495650001102518650001002529650002102539650001202560650001602572650001202588650001802600650002102618650001502639650001002654650001202664650001302676650001202689650002202701650001602723650001302739653001802752653001002770653001902780700001502799700002702814700001702841700001502858700001502873700001402888700001502902700001602917773013502933856005103068852000903119655001203128IND50076243020221117204633.0140410e20120101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007624302DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2012.6414632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVarga, P.10aAdaptive Nutrient Supply and Soil Cultivation Methods in the Upper Zone of Hillside Vineyards  ap. 334-340.  a2019-12-05  aSomló-hill is Hungary's smallest wine district; however, it produces some of the best white wines. Viticulture dates back about 2000 years in the district, and the climate is balanced. Former volcanic activity was an important factor in the development of the brown forest soils (Cambisols). Experiments were conducted in 2006–2008 in vineyards located in the upper zone (above 200 m sea level) of Somló-hill for studying the most adaptive and environmentally friendly soil cultivation and nutrient-supply methods. The following treatments were applied in four replicates: (soil cultivation experiment) SC₁, natural grass cover; SC₂, mechanical soil cultivation; and SC₃, organic mulch (crop residues), and (nutrient supply experiment) NS₁, unfertilized control, NS₂, nitrogen (N) fertilizer (NH₄NO₃) 50 kg ha⁻¹; and NS₃, farmyard manure (34 tons ha⁻¹). Main chemical soil characteristics were determined in the 0- to 30-cm and 31- to 60-cm soil layers at blossoming and grape ripening. Yield parameters (kg per m², soluble solids g per 100 g juice, and titratable acidity, g L⁻¹) were assessed at harvest. The experimental results suggested that covering the soil with crop residues resulted in the greatest yields, explained by the more favorable soil water conditions. Differences in yield parameters were significant in 2 of 3 years. Soil mineral N content also showed significant differences among treatments. Increased N requirement of crop residues and natural crop cover were suggested. Results of the experiments showed that both ammonium nitrate and farmyard manure resulted in increased grape yield compared to the unfertilized control. Maintaining adequate soil moisture levels (containing basalt debris with low humus content and shallow fertile layer with poor water management) and soil organic matter content is of great importance because other nutrients may be ensured by the weathering of basalt.  aPublisher supplied data 3agrapes 3asoil minerals 3atotal soluble solids 3acrop yield 3aforest soils 3anutrients 3ajuices 3anitrogen content 3aanimal manures 3asea level 3avineyards 3aviticulture 3aweathering 3aCambisols 3atitratable acidity 3abasalt 3ahills 3aammonium nitrate 3aclimate 3awhite wines 3agrasses 3acrop residues 3awater management 3asoil water 3ahumus 3amulches 3anitrogen 3atillage 3avolcanic activity 3afertilizers 3aripening 0aSoil moisture 0ayield 0asoluble solids1 aMájer, J.1 aJahnke, G.

However, one major drawback is the difficulty of removing all remnants of loose powder from the printed scaffolds, the so-called depowdering step. In this study, a new design approach was proposed to solve this problem. Specifically, the design of the printed scaffolds consisted of a cage with windows large enough to enable depowdering while still trapping loose fillers placed inside the cage. To demonstrate the potential of this new approach, two filler geometries were used: sandglass and cheese segment. The distance between the fillers was varied and they were either glued to the cage or free to move after successful depowdering. Depowdering efficiency was quantified by microstructural morphometry. The results showed that the use of mobile fillers significantly improved depowdering. Based on this study, large 3DP scaffolds can be realized, which might be a step towards a broader clinical use of 3D printed CaP scaffolds.  aPublisher supplied data 3abone substitutes 3acalcium phosphates 3amorphometry 3apowders 3aprinters 2aBone Substitutesxpharmacology 2aCalcium Phosphatesxpharmacology 2aComputer-Aided Design 2aEquipment Design 2aOrgan Size 2aPowders 2aPrinting 2aStress, Mechanical 2aTissue Engineeringxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aTissue Scaffolds 2aX-Ray Diffraction 2aX-Ray Microtomography1 aBohner, M.1 aDoebelin, N.1 aHofmann, S.1 aMuller, R.,0 tActa biomaterialia.g2013 Nov., v. 9, no. 11 p.9149-9158dElsevier Ltdx1742-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2013.07.0193Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02513naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245009700169300001600266520093000282592002801212596008301240650002301323650001501346650002501361650001901386650002401405650001501429650001001444650002001454650001701474650001801491650002301509650001001532650001301542650001501555650001801570650002101588650001401609650001501623650001801638700002101656700003701677700006901714773014401783856008301927852000902010655001202019IND60767396720221117223956.0220216e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076739672DNAL7 a10.1007/s00128-021-03397-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBezerra, Vanessa10aAcute Exposure to Biogenic Nanosilver Produced from Fusarium oxysporum in a Neotropical Fish  ap. 331-336.  aBiogenic nanosilver (bNAg) has emerged as a potentially less toxic alternative to synthetic nanosilver. However, no studies have evaluated its effects on a fish species from the Neotropical region. Thus, our aim was to evaluate the effects of a bNAg on the Neotropical fish Prochilodus lineatus. For this purpose, after 24 h of exposure to 100 µg L⁻¹ of bNAg, blood samples were collected to evaluate hematological, genotoxic, and plasma parameters. Gills and liver were sampled to evaluate biomarkers of oxidative stress and brain samples were used to assess neurotoxicity. The fish presented hyperglycemia, an increased number of erythrocytes, a reduction in antioxidant enzyme activity in both tissues evaluated, and a decrease in lipid peroxidation in the gills. We concluded that P. lineatus is a sensitive species to this nanoparticle, since it presented alterations in several biomarkers after an acute exposure.  aPublisher supplied data  a420764/2016-0cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico 3aFusarium oxysporum 3aNeotropics 3aProchilodus lineatus 3aacute exposure 3aantioxidant enzymes 3abiomarkers 3abrain 3aenzyme activity 3aerythrocytes 3ahyperglycemia 3alipid peroxidation 3aliver 3amutagens 3ananosilver 3aneurotoxicity 3aoxidative stress 3apollution 3atoxicology 3atropical fish1 aRisso, Wagner E.1 aMartinez, Claudia Bueno dos Reis1 aSimonato, Juliana Delatim1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1623-14900 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2022 Feb., v. 108, no. 2 p.331-336dSpringer USwJournal:jnl46145x0007-48617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-021-03397-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03910naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245013600169300001600305520253400321592002802855650001202883650002502895650001102920650001402931650001902945650002202964653002302986653002703009653002603036653002403062653002803086653004903114700001503163700001903178700002003197700001503217700002103232773014203253856008403395852000903479655001203488IND60561456320221122091739.0190411e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056145632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ppees.2017.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBergholz, Kolja10aEnvironmental heterogeneity drives fine-scale species assembly and functional diversity of annual plants in a semi-arid environment  ap. 138-146.  aSpatial environmental heterogeneity is considered a fundamental factor for the maintenance of plant species richness. However, it still remains unclear whether heterogeneity may also facilitate coexistence at fine grain sizes or whether other processes, like mass effects and source sink dynamics due to dispersal, control species composition and diversity at these scales. In this study, we used two complimentary analyses to identify the role of heterogeneity within 15m×15m plots for the coexistence of species-rich annual communities in a semi-arid environment along a steep precipitation gradient. Specifically, we: (a) analyzed the effect of environmental heterogeneity on species, functional and phylogenetic diversity within microsites (alpha diversity, 0.06m2 and 1m2), across microsites (beta diversity), and diversity at the entire plot (gamma diversity); (b) further we used two null models to detect non-random trait and phylogenetic patterns in order to infer assembly processes, i.e. whether co-occurring species tend to share similar traits (trait convergence) or dissimilar traits (trait divergence). In general, our results showed that heterogeneity had a positive effect on community diversity. Specifically, for alpha diversity, the effect was significant for functional diversity, and not significant for either species or phylogenetic diversities. For beta diversity, all three measures of community diversity (species, functional, and phylogenetic) increased significantly, as they also did for gamma diversity, where functional measures were again stronger than for species or phylogenetic measures. In addition, the null model approach consistently detected trait convergence, indicating that species with similar traits tended to co-occur and had high abundances in a given microsite. While null model analysis across the phylogeny partly supported these trait findings, showing phylogenetic underdispersion at the 1m2 grain size, surprisingly when species abundances in microsites were analyzed they were more evenly distributed across the phylogenetic tress than expected (phylogenetic overdispersion). In conclusion, our results provide compelling support that environmental heterogeneity at a relatively fine scale is an important factor for species co-existence as it positively affects diversity as well as influences species assembly. Our study underlines the need for trait-based approaches conducted at fine grain sizes in order to better understand species coexistence and community assembly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannuals 3afunctional diversity 3amodels 3aphylogeny 3asemiarid zones 3aspecies diversity 0aCommunity assembly 0aPlant functional trait 0aHabitat heterogeneity 0aLimiting similarity 0aEnvironmental filtering 0aHeterogeneity species diversity relationship1 aMay, Felix1 aGiladi, Itamar1 aRistow, Michael1 aZiv, Yaron1 aJeltsch, Florian0 tPerspectives in plant ecology, evolution and systematics.g2017 Feb., v. 24 p.138-146dElsevier GmbHwJournal:J000000130x1433-83197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ppees.2017.01.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03812naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245022200155300001600377520209000393592002802483650002502511650001702536650001202553650000902565650001002574650001902584650002402603650001302627650002002640650002702660650002002687650001502707650002902722650002502751650001002776650000902786650001702795653000902812653002702821653002702848653002402875700001302899700001302912700001302925700001302938700001402951700001502965700006102980700001603041773010603057856007403163852000903237655001203246IND60694883020221120133926.0210209e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069488302DNAL7 a10.3382/ps/pez5302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Y.N.10aEstimation of dietary zinc requirement for laying duck breeders: effects on productive and reproductive performance, egg quality, tibial characteristics, plasma biochemical and antioxidant indices, and zinc deposition  ap. 454-462.  aThis study evaluated the effects of different dietary zinc (Zn) levels on productive and reproductive performance, egg quality, tibial characteristics, plasma biochemical and antioxidant indices, and zinc deposition in laying duck breeders. A total of 504 Longyan duck breeders aged 21 wk were randomly allocated to 6 treatments and fed a basal diet (Zn, 27.7 mg/kg) or that basal diet supplemented with Zn (as ZnSO₄·H₂ O) at 10, 20, 40, 80, or 160 mg Zn per kg of feed for 20 wk. Each group had 6 replicates of 14 ducks each. Dietary Zn supplementation affected (P < 0.05) the egg production, FCR, and shell thickness of laying duck breeders from 21 to 40 wk, and there was a quadratic (P < 0.05) effect between them. Dietary Zn supplementation affected (P < 0.05) and quadratically (P < 0.001) increased the breaking strength, density, and dry defatted weight of tibias. Alkaline phosphatase, calcium, phosphorus, total superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and malondialdehyde (MDA) activities or content in plasma were affected (P < 0.05), and quadratically (P < 0.01) changed by dietary Zn levels. Dietary Zn supplementation affected (P < 0.01) and increased the Zn deposition in egg yolk (linear, P < 0.05; quadratic, P < 0.001) and tibia (linear, P < 0.05). The dietary Zn requirements, in mg/kg for a basal diet containing 27.7 mg/kg Zn, for Longyan duck breeders from 21 to 40 wk of age were estimated to be 65.4 for optimizing egg production, 68.6 for FCR, 102 for hatchling BW, 94.7 for eggshell thickness, 77.2 for tibial breaking strength, 81.4 for tibial density, 78.9 for tibial dry defatted weight, 69.5 for plasma GSH-Px activity, 72.4 for plasma MDA content, and 94.6 for Zn content in tibia. Overall, dietary Zn supplementation, up to 160 mg/kg feed, affected the productive performance, eggshell thickness, tibial characteristics, plasma antioxidant status, and Zn deposition of layer duck breeders. Supplementing this basal diet (27.7 mg/kg Zn) with 70 to 80 mg/kg additional Zn was adequate for laying duck breeders during the laying period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aantioxidants 3acalcium 3adiet 3aducks 3aegg production 3aegg shell thickness 3aegg yolk 3aenzyme activity 3aglutathione peroxidase 3amalondialdehyde 3aphosphorus 3areproductive performance 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atibia 3azinc 3azinc sulfate 0azinc 0aproductive performance 0atibial characteristics 0alaying duck breeder1 aWang, S.1 aLi, K.C.1 aRuan, D.1 aChen, W.1 aXia, W.G.1 aWang, S.L.1 aAbouelezz, K.F.M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6141-10951 aZheng, C.T.0 tPoultry science.g2020 Jan., v. 99, no. 1 p.454-462dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps/pez5303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02566naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245012900157300001800286520127800304592002801582650004401610650002201654650002801676650001301704650001901717650002701736650001801763650002101781650002201802650001301824653001801837653002701855653001301882653001501895653001501910700002001925773012901945856007302074852000902147655001202156IND60530525620221117225647.0160721e20140505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053052562DNAL7 a10.1021/sc500165d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThakur, Suman10aUltratough, Ductile, Castor Oil-Based, Hyperbranched, Polyurethane Nanocomposite Using Functionalized Reduced Graphene Oxide  ap. 1195-1202.  aWe reported on an ultratough, ductile, castor oil-based, hyperbranched, polyurethane (HPU) nanocomposite using functionalized reduced graphene oxide (f-RGO) as a reactive chain extender as well as a nano-reinforcing material. The functionalization of phytoextract-reduced graphene oxide (RGO) was achieved by reacting with 2,4/2,6-toluene diisocyanate, followed by reacting with 1,4-butanediol. Functionalization (hydroxyl group-terminated urethane linkage) in f-RGO was confirmed by FTIR and XRD studies. The obtained nanocomposite demonstrated tremendous enhancements of tensile strength (525%), modulus (42 folds), and toughness (18 folds) after incorporation of 2 wt % of f-RGO in HPU. Most surprisingly, elongation at break of the nanocomposites was enhanced from 710% to a maximum of 1656%. On other hand, the HPU nanocomposite with RGO was unable to demonstrate improved properties similar to those of HPU/f-RGO nanocomposites. The HPU/f-RGO nanocomposite also demonstrated good thermal stability and excellent electrical conductivity with an enhancement of almost 10 orders of magnitude at 2 wt % f-RGO. The effective and promising technique presented here paves the way to graphene-based polymer nanocomposites with excellent performance and novel functionalities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aelectrical conductivity 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3apolymer nanocomposites 3apolyurethanes 3atensile strength 3athermal stability 3aurethane 0aHyperbranched 0aReduced graphene oxide 0aBiobased 0aUltratough 0aConductive1 aKarak, Niranjan0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2014 May 05, v. 2, no. 5 p.1195-1202dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/sc500165d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02368naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245010500165300001600270520094100286592002801227650001101255650001501266650002401281650000901305650001701314650001101331650001901342650001601361650001601377653002201393653003101415653002301446653002601469653001801495700002001513700005701533700001901590700001501609700001701624700005201641773012501693856008301818852000901901655001201910IND60674802920221118033751.0200228e20200215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067480292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2019.10.0872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Shouhui10aNon-zero-crossing current-voltage hysteresis behavior induced by capacitive effects in bio-memristor  ap. 565-571.  aCapacitive devices have drawn a beautiful application scene in electronic device systems ranging from touch sensors, energy storages and multifunction transistors, but serving as memristive term is still blank. Sweet potato peel (SPP) as function layer was employed to develop the memristive device with Ag/SPP/F-doped SnO₂ (FTO) structure. A current-voltage (I-V) hysteresis, which is characterized by a typical capacitive behavior, is impressively observed in the developed device. Nonvolatile data storage is feasible using the non-zero-crossing I-V hysteresis because the resistance states can be well maintained. Charge transfer at the Ag/SPP and SPP/FTO interfaces, and the interplay between Ag⁺ ions and charges are responsible for this non-zero-crossing I-V hysteresis behaviors. This work possibly gives an insight into the data storage in terms of a new conception electronic device based on environment-friendly material.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3ahysteresis 3ainformation storage 3aions 3apotato peels 3asilver 3asweet potatoes 3atin dioxide 3atransistors 0aNon-zero-crossing 0aCurrent-voltage hysteresis 0aCapacitive effects 0aBio-electronic device 0aBio-memristor1 aZhou, Guangdong1 aYuan, Weiyong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5840-509X1 aMao, Shuangsuo1 aYang, Feng1 aFu, Guoqiang1 aSun, Bai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5840-509X0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2020 Feb. 15, v. 560 p.565-571dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2019.10.0873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02710naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245018600158300001800344520128500362592002801647650002101675650001301696650001301709650001101722650001301733650001901746653003601765653002901801653001801830653002601848653002901874653001901903653003201922653001801954653001201972700001901984700001702003700002002020700001302040773012902053856007302182852000902255655001202264IND60530525720221117225712.0160721e20140505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053052572DNAL7 a10.1021/sc500170d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xue-Bing12aA Three-Component Catalyst-Free Approach to Regioselective Synthesis of Dual Highly Functionalized Fused Pyrrole Derivatives in Water–Ethanol Media: Thermodynamics versus Kinetics  ap. 1155-1163.  aA three-component catalyst-free protocol for the regioselective synthesis of dual highly functionalized fused pyrroles has been developed from a cascade [3 + 2] cyclization of heterocyclic ketene aminals (HKAs) 1 with arylglyoxal monohydrates 2 and cyclohexane-1,3-diones 3 in water–ethanol media. The kinetically controlled products 4 could be synthesized within 1 h but would irreversibly transform to thermodynamically controlled products 5 over an additional 5 h. At the same time, the transformative synthesis of 5a from 4a by controlling the oxygen or nitrogen proved the proposed mechanism. Furthermore, the DFT calculation also corroborated that the stability of products 5 are a 100,000 times more thermodynamically stable than products 4. Finally, the origin of the greater stability of 5 could be explained by the reduced density gradient (RDG) analysis, which hinted that the crucial factors are the formation of a new intramolecular hydrogen bond and the release of the steric effect of the crowded rings. In conclusion, this novel synthetic strategy offers an alternative method using thermodynamic or kinetic control for regioselective construction of biologically meaningful fused pyrrole architectures from a concise, rapid, and environmentally friendly vision.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydrogen bonding 3akinetics 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3apyrroles 3athermodynamics 0aGreen and sustainable chemistry 0aMulticomponent reactions 0aCatalyst-free 0aWater−ethanol media 0aRegioselective synthesis 0aFused pyrroles 0aHeterocyclic ketene aminals 0aThermodynamic 0aKinetic1 aLiu, Zhi-Cheng1 aYang, Li-Fen1 aYan, Sheng-Jiao1 aLin, Jun0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2014 May 05, v. 2, no. 5 p.1155-1163dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/sc500170d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03308naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245012200173300001600295520185800311592002802169650001902197650001902216650001802235650001202253650002002265650002302285650000902308650001402317650002902331650001702360650001102377650001402388650002002402650001702422650001802439650002802457653003902485653002902524653002902553653002202582700002102604773011802625856008602743852000902829655001202838IND60629602020221119091322.0190606e20190201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062960202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.10.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrodny, Jarosław10aAnalysis of the diversity in emissions of selected gaseous and particulate pollutants in the European Union countries  ap. 582-595.  aThe article presents the analysis results of the grouping of the European Union countries with regard to emission levels of gaseous pollutants (NH3, NMVOCs, SOx, NOx) and particulate air pollutants (PM10 and PM2.5) which are one of the most dangerous type of pollution for human health. Their long-lasting effects on the human body may negatively affect health and life expectancy. The analysis was based on the taxonomic method of grouping data using the K-means method which is a non-hierarchical method. The analysis used the data published by Eurostat. Organizing countries into categories of emissions of gaseous and dust pollutants to the atmosphere was conducted for four cases: the total level of emission, the level of emissions related to the GDP, the area, and per capita. The Euclidean distance was a measure of the distance between Member States. The obtained results indicate that, depending on the adopted criterion, there is a significant change in the composition of individual clusters. This confirms the assumptions of the Authors who claimed that in order to develop a more comprehensive analysis and assessment of the state of atmospheric pollution in EU countries it is necessary to include additional criteria, other than only the total emission of a given pollution. The objective of the research was to indicate that the analysis of emissions of selected type of pollution, and at the same time most threatening to human health, does not fully reflect the actual state of the problem when presented only in terms of the emitted amount. It is therefore appropriate for EU institutions to take more account of the differences between the individual countries in terms of the criteria presented in the paper, during the decision-making process concerning the sustainable development policy in the field of environmental protection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aair pollutants 3aair pollution 3aammonia 3adecision making 3adevelopment policy 3adust 3aemissions 3aenvironmental protection 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3alongevity 3anitrogen oxides 3aparticulates 3asulfur oxides 3asustainable development 0aGaseous and particulate pollutants 0aEuropean Union countries 0aEnvironmental protection 0ak-means algorithm1 aTutak, Magdalena0 tJournal of environmental management.g2019 Feb. 01, v. 231 p.582-595dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.10.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03064naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005900151245011600210520161200326592002801938650001501966650001501981650002401996650002302020650002202043650000902065650001502074650002902089650001702118650001702135650002202152653001502174653002902189653002702218653000802245653002002253700002102273700006002294700006302354773011802417856008602535852000902621655001202630IND60758398420221123030745.0220124e20220215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075839842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1141662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMogale, Refilwe1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5350-172010aDye adsorption of aluminium- and zirconium-based metal organic frameworks with azobenzene dicarboxylate linkers  aThe high efficiency of metal-organic-frameworks (MOFs) such as the ZIF, MIL and UiO type species in dye adsorption is well established. Recently, an emerging class of photoresponsive azobenzene-based MOFs has found suitable application in gas adsorption. However, there is a dearth of research on their use in the adsorption of dyes and other water pollutants. In this research, two microporous photoresponsive azobenzene dicarboxylate MOFs of Al³⁺ (Al-AZB) and Zr⁴⁺ (Zr-AZB) were synthesized for the adsorption of congo red (CR) dye. The surface and textural properties of the synthesized MOFs were characterized by FTIR, PXRD, SEM, TGA, BET and pore analysis. Both MOFs were crystalline, thermally stable up to 300 °C and stable in aqueous medium at room temperature. The Al-AZB displayed a higher surface area (2718 m²/g) than the Zr-AZB (1098 m²/g), which significantly impacted the higher adsorption of CR. Besides, pore volumes of 0.86 cm³/g and 0.35 cm³/g were obtained for Al-AZB and Zr-AZB, respectively. The maximum adsorption capacity of Al-AZB and Zr-AZB was 456.6 mg/g and 128.9 mg/g, respectively, with the former superior to other potent adsorbents. The pseudo-second-order and Langmuir models were well correlated with the dye uptake on the MOFs. Thermodynamics revealed random and endothermic sorption of CR dominated by chemisorption, while efficient regeneration and reuse of both MOFs were achieved using dimethylformamide as eluent. The results proved the potency of the synthesized photoresponsive MOFs, as highly efficient and reusable materials for dye adsorption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aambient temperature 3adicarboxylic acids 3adimethylformamide 3adyes 3aendothermy 3aenvironmental management 3aporous media 3asurface area 3athermal stability 0aazobenzene 0aMetal-organic-frameworks 0aPore size distribution 0aDye 0aWater stability1 aAkpomie, Kovo G.1 aConradie, Jeanet1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8120-68301 aLangner, Ernst H.G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4667-33960 tJournal of environmental management.g2022 Feb. 15, v. 304 p.114166-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1141663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03080naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005700139245016100196300001600357520153600373592002801909650002201937650001701959650002101976650001801997650001902015650002102034650002002055650001002075650001102085650002402096650001802120650001902138650001702157650001002174650001002184650001902194650001302213650001002226650001002236653002302246653001802269653002602287653002202313653002002335700001802355773010602373856007402479852000902553655001202562IND60694883220221120133856.0210209e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069488322DNAL7 a10.3382/ps/pez5382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGungor, Emrah1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4380-616210aEffect of dietary raw and fermented sour cherry kernel (Prunus cerasus L.) on digestibility, intestinal morphology and caecal microflora in broiler chickens  ap. 471-478.  aThis study was conducted to investigate the effect of dietary raw sour cherry kernel (RC) or fermented sour cherry kernel (FC) on apparent digestibility, ileal morphology, and caecal microflora in broiler chickens. Raw sour cherry kernel was fermented by Aspergillus niger for 7 D. A total of 343 one-day-old Ross 308 male chicks were assigned to 7 dietary treatments consisting of 7 replicates of 7 broilers each. All birds were fed with a commercial diet or diets supplemented with 1%, 2%, or 4% RC or FC. The experimental period was 42 D. Apparent dry matter (DM), nitrogen and ash digestibilities were diminished (P < 0.05) by dietary RC inclusion, although dietary FC did not negatively affect (P > 0.05) nutrient digestibility. Dietary 1% FC increased (P < 0.01) the villus height to crypt depth ratio (VH:CD) compared with the other treatment groups, although RC4 reduced the villus height (VH, P < 0.001) and VH:CD (P < 0.01), compared with the control group. Dietary treatments had no effect (P > 0.05) on the crypt depth (CD). Birds fed 1% FC had the highest (P < 0.05) caecal Lactobacillus spp. counts among the treatment groups. Enterococcus spp. and Escherichia coli counts in cecum were not affected (P > 0.05) by dietary treatments. The results showed that the dietary inclusion of 1% FC improved ileal morphology and caecal microflora without any adverse effect on the apparent digestibility. These results indicate that FC has the potential to be a feed additive which improves intestinal health for broiler diets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus niger 3aEnterococcus 3aEscherichia coli 3aLactobacillus 3aPrunus cerasus 3abroiler chickens 3abroiler feeding 3acecum 3achicks 3adietary supplements 3adigestibility 3afeed additives 3afermentation 3aileum 3amales 3amicroorganisms 3anitrogen 3aseeds 3avilli 0asour cherry kernel 0adigestibility 0aintestinal morphology 0acaecal microflora 0abroiler chicken1 aErener, Guray0 tPoultry science.g2020 Jan., v. 99, no. 1 p.471-478dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps/pez5383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02660naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245013300160300001600293520119100309592002801500650001601528650001601544650001901560650001401579650001101593650001301604650002401617650001601641650001401657650001901671650001401690653001801704653002101722653002301743653002101766700001301787700001301800700001501813700001701828700001901845700001801864700001601882700005101898773012501949856008302074852000902157655001202166IND60674803020221118033506.0200228e20200215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067480302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2019.10.0892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Fan10aNitrogen-rich graphitic carbon nitride nanotubes for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution with simultaneous contaminant degradation  ap. 555-564.  aGraphitic carbon nitride (g-C₃N₄) has aroused great concern since it applied to the photocatalytic process. However, the inherent shortcomings of bulk g-C₃N₄, such as small active surface area, low separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers, sluggish charge transport process, etc., result in low-level photocatalytic performance. The rich-nitrogen carbon nitride nanotubes (CNNTs) made by an easy supermolecule self-assembly method could slove these subsisting problems. The CNNTs with unique morphology possess superior separation/migration of photo-excited charge carriers and enhanced photocatalytic performance. Under irradiation with visible light (λ > 400 nm), measured with Pt (3 wt%) as co-catalyst, the CNNTs have a hydrogen evolution rate of 18.06 mmol h⁻¹ g⁻¹ and its apparent quantum yield (AQY) is 12.55% (420 nm). The CNNTs are also applied to degrade antibiotics with simultaneous hydrogen production, providing a method for alleviating energy crisis and environmental pollution issues. The degradation rate of bisphenol A (BPA) is 92% and simultaneously with 13.63 μmol photocatalytic hydrogen generation after irradiation for 5 h.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotics 3abisphenol A 3acarbon nitride 3acatalysts 3aenergy 3agraphene 3ahydrogen production 3airradiation 3ananotubes 3aphotocatalysis 3apollution 0aNitrogen-rich 0ag-C3N4 nanotubes 0aHydrogen evolution 0aPhotodegradation1 aMo, Zhao1 aYan, Jia1 aFu, Jiajun1 aSong, Yanhua1 aEl-Alami, Wiam1 aWu, Xiangyang1 aLi, Huaming1 aXu, Hui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2823-59150 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2020 Feb. 15, v. 560 p.555-564dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2019.10.0893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02955naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003400149245014100183500001400324520139400338592002801732650002601760650002501786650002901811650001601840650001301856650002301869650003001892650001801922650001901940650001801959650001201977650002301989650001302012650001502025650002002040650002102060650002202081650001102103700003802114700002302152700004102175700003202216773013302248856008302381852000902464655001202473IND60707753220221123003620.0200821e20200802xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070775322DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture100803252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZepeda-Giraud, Luis  Fernando10aBiological Control of Thielaviopsis paradoxa and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides by the Extracellular Enzymes of Wickerhamomyces anomalus  aNAL-light  aAn alternative to chemical fungicides in post-harvest diseases are the use of biocontrol agents and their extracellular products against phytopathogens. Two relevant agents in post-harvest infections are Thielaviopsis paradoxa and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, causing large economic losses in cacao, pineapple, and avocado during storage. In this work, we evaluated the effect of Wickerhamomyces anomalus, an effective biocontrol agent, against these filamentous fungi, focusing on the production of extracellular enzymes and their effect on fungal growth and germination. Moreover, we evaluated the use of inactivated fungal biomass as an inducer in complete (Potato Dextrose Agar and Yeast Peptone Dextrose) and minimal culture media. The antagonistic effect of W anomalus on the growth of both phytopathogens was also studied. The extracellular enzymes in YPD cultures, using T. paradoxa inactivated biomass as the best inducer, were capable of inhibiting the germination of both phytopathogens. In minimal media, only the production of a 30 kDa glucanase with activity against laminarin was observed. The enzyme was effective against the spore germination of T. paradoxa. In post-harvest crop protection tests, growth inhibition of T. paradoxa was observed using the cell-free enzyme extract, which is a promising system to protect cocoa fruits from T. paradoxa during post-harvest.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCeratocystis paradoxa 3aGlomerella cingulata 3aWickerhamomyces anomalus 3aagriculture 3aavocados 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3aculture media 3afungal biomass 3afungal growth 3aglucose 3agrowth retardation 3apeptones 3apineapples 3aplant pathogens 3aplant protection 3aspore germination 3ayeasts1 aOlicón-Hernández, Dario  Rafael1 aPardo, Juan  Pablo1 aVillanueva, Minerva  Georgina Araiza1 aGuerra-Sánchez, Guadalupe 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2020 Aug. 02, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture100803253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02282naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245010000165300001600265520091600281592002801197650002101225650001701246650000901263650002101272650001701293650001301310650001701323650001701340653001001357653002601367653001601393653005101409653001801460700001301478700001701491700001901508700001601527700001901543700001501562700001401577700001801591773011101609856008301720852000901803655001201812IND60634253020221120165223.0190404e20190401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063425302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molp.2019.03.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Baobao10aDevelopment of a Haploid-Inducer Mediated Genome Editing System for Accelerating Maize Breeding  ap. 597-602.  aCrop breeding aims to generate pure inbred lines with multiple desired traits. Doubled haploid (DH) and genome editing using CRISPR/Cas9 are two powerful game-changing technologies in crop breeding. However, both of them still fall short for rapid generation of pure elite lines with integrated favorable traits. Here, we report the development of a Haploid-Inducer Mediated Genome Editing (IMGE) approach, which utilizes a maize haploid inducer line carrying a CRISPR/Cas9 cassette targeting for a desired agronomic trait to pollinate an elite maize inbred line and to generate genome-edited haploids in the elite maize background. Homozygous pure DH lines with the desired trait improvement could be generated within two generations, thus bypassing the lengthy procedure of repeated crossing and backcrossing used in conventional breeding for integrating a desirable trait into elite commercial backgrounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagronomic traits 3abackcrossing 3acorn 3adoubled haploids 3agene editing 3ahaploidy 3ahomozygosity 3ainbred lines 0amaize 0adoubled haploids (DH) 0aCRSIPR/Cas9 0ahaploid-inducer mediated genome editing (IMGE) 0acrop breeding1 aZhu, Lei1 aZhao, Binbin1 aZhao, Yongping1 aXie, Yurong1 aZheng, Zhigang1 aLi, Yaoyao1 aSun, Juan1 aWang, Haiyang0 tMolecular plant.g2019 Apr. 01, v. 12, no. 4 p.597-602dElsevier Inc.wJournal:J000001387x1674-20527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molp.2019.03.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04107naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005300147245011000200300001600310506011700326506007600443520164900519592002802168506003702196650001902233650001602252650001002268650001202278650001002290650001302300650001102313650002502324650001502349650000902364650001702373653002502390653001702415653002502432653002402457653002302481700005502504700005502559700005702614700005302671700005702724700005302781700005402834700005902888700005102947700005502998700005503053700005903108700005303167700005703220773012503277856008203402852000903484655001203493IND60731533320221207094423.0220621e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073153332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gpb.2020.06.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Zihu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3975-314110aNOGEA: A Network-oriented Gene Entropy Approach for Dissecting Disease Comorbidity and Drug Repositioning  ap. 549-564.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRapid development of high-throughput technologies has permitted the identification of an increasing number of disease-associated genes (DAGs), which are important for understanding disease initiation and developing precision therapeutics. However, DAGs often contain large amounts of redundant or false positive information, leading to difficulties in quantifying and prioritizing potential relationships between these DAGs and human diseases. In this study, a network-oriented gene entropy approach (NOGEA) is proposed for accurately inferring master genes that contribute to specific diseases by quantitatively calculating their perturbation abilities on directed disease-specific gene networks. In addition, we confirmed that the master genes identified by NOGEA have a high reliability for predicting disease-specific initiation events and progression risk. Master genes may also be used to extract the underlying information of different diseases, thus revealing mechanisms of disease comorbidity. More importantly, approved therapeutic targets are topologically localized in a small neighborhood of master genes in the interactome network, which provides a new way for predicting drug-disease associations. Through this method, 11 old drugs were newly identified and predicted to be effective for treating pancreatic cancer and then validated by in vitro experiments. Collectively, the NOGEA was useful for identifying master genes that control disease initiation and co-occurrence, thus providing a valuable strategy for drug efficacy screening and repositioning.

All gels were clear, with no precipitations, indicating the solubility of the drugs in the gels. The release behavior was similar for different microemulsion formulations, various drugs and increasing concentrations of a drug. These findings indicate that our system could potentially act as a generic system, where the properties of the release do not depend on the drug but rather on the attributes of the gel. The structure of composite gels was investigated using small-angle scattering of X-rays and neutrons (SAXS and SANS, respectively). SANS showed more sensitivity to the structure of the microemulsion in the composite gel than SAXS did. SAXS and SANS plots of the composite gels show that both the droplets and the gel network preserve their structure when mixed together.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3abioactive properties 3adroplets 3adrugs 3agels 3ahydrocolloids 3ahydrophobicity 3alipids 3avitamins 3awater solubility 2aDrug Delivery Systems 2aEmulsions 2aHydrogelsxchemistry 2aHydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions 2aNeutron Diffraction 2aPharmaceutical Preparationsxadministration & dosage 2aScattering, Small Angle 2aTime Factors 2aX-Ray Diffraction1 aBarat, Karnit1 aBarsht, Iris1 aZilberman, Meital1 aBianco-Peled, Havazelet0 tActa biomaterialia.g2013 Nov., v. 9, no. 11 p.8815-8822dElsevier Ltdx1742-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2013.06.0283Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02706naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245011100171300001200282520138200294592002801676650001701704650002001721650002901741650001501770650002201785650002501807651001401832651001601846653002001862653002701882653002401909653001101933700002101944700002401965700001801989700002102007700002202028700002202050773010602072856008502178852000902263655001202272IND60561456820221122091721.0180904e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056145682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsci.2017.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGibson, Fiona L.10aFactors influencing the use of decision support tools in the development and design of conservation policy  ap. 1-8.  aThere are many examples of decision support tools used to analyse information with the intention of assisting conservation managers and policy makers in their decision making. We used structured interviews to collect information on seven case studies from Australia and New Zealand to identify the factors that led to the use (or non-use) of decision support tools when developing conservation policies. The interviews explored hypotheses derived from existing literature on the use of decision support tools in conservation policy. Qualitative analysis of the interviews indicated that key factors influencing the uptake of a decision support tool in conservation policy include the alignment of the tool with the objectives and context of a policy, and its ability to be useful even in the presence of missing data. Two other factors that had been suggested in past literature were not perceived by interviewees to be as important as the above two: the presence of a champion for the decision support tool within the management agency, and the time required to apply the tool. The interviews also revealed a number of additional factors that influenced use or non-use of decision support tools that we had not extracted from existing literature: ambiguity about policy objectives, the autonomy of the agency, and the employee time costs of applying the decision support tool.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adecision making 3adecision support systems 3ainterviews 3aissues and policy 3aqualitative analysis 3aAustralia 3aNew Zealand 0aDecision making 0aDecision support tools 0aConservation policy 0aMarxan1 aRogers, Abbie A.1 aSmith, Anthony D.M.1 aRoberts, Anna1 aPossingham, Hugh1 aMcCarthy, Michael1 aPannell, David J.0 tEnvironmental science & policy.g2017 Apr., v. 70 p.1-8dElsevier LtdwJournal:12413x1462-90117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2017.01.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04702naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003400139245012100173300001800294520257200312592002802884650002102912650001502933650001402948650001202962650001902974650001702993650001903010650000903029650001503038650001903053650001603072650002503088650001303113650001203126650002003138650002903158650002103187650001303208650001703221650002603238650001503264650001603279650000903295650002103304650001703325650001103342650001903353650001303372650001903385650001303404650001003417650002403427650001903451653001903470653003003489653003603519653002303555653003003578653003303608653002603641700003003667700003203697700002703729773013003756856007303886852000903959655001203968IND60530526020171220000000.0160721e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053052602DNAL7 a10.1021/sc400436a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGutiérrez-Arriaga, César
G.10aSustainable Integration of Algal Biodiesel Production with Steam Electric Power Plants for Greenhouse Gas Mitigation  ap. 1388-1403.  aSignificant reductions in anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, particularly of fossil carbon dioxide (CO₂), are necessary worldwide in order to prevent adverse impacts of global climate change on the socio-economic sectors, ecological systems, and human health. In this context, this study aims to investigate the economic and environmental aspects of sustainability associated with the integration of algal biodiesel production with a steam electric power plant for microalgae biofixation of CO₂ in flue gases and then algal biomass conversion to biodiesel. This integrated energy system is a multipurpose process that provides the CO₂ required by the microalgae cultures as well as electricity, biodiesel produced from the algal biomass, and lipid-depleted biomass which is in turn used as an auxiliary fuel in the power plant. A multi-objective optimization strategy based on genetic algorithms is proposed to yield a set of optimal solutions providing the best compromise between the profit and the environmental impact of regenerative Rankine power generation plants coupled with algae-to-biodiesel production facilities. The power plant operates continuously, but CO₂ is fed to open pond raceways only during the daytime (12 h a day) for algae growth. The rigorous IAPWS-IF97 formulation is used to calculate the thermodynamic properties of water and steam in the steam power cycle. The environmental impact is measured by the Eco-indicator 99 methodology that follows LCA principles. The optimization problem includes the selection of multiple primary energy sources for the power plant boiler, such as fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas), biofuels, and biomass (switchgrass, softwood, and hardwood) in order to achieve significant reductions of CO₂ emissions. The optimal trade-off designs are obtained by implementing the ε-constraint method. The optimization method has been applied to a case study in México. The Pareto optimal solutions indicate that the current price for biodiesel of $3.91/gal on average would make the integrated energy system under consideration profitable. In addition, the system could achieve significant environmental improvements due to life-cycle GHG reductions that result not only from biofixation of CO₂ from combustion flue gases by microalgae and then algal biomass conversion and use as renewable fuels (i.e., biodiesel and lipid-depleted biomass) that substitute for fossil fuels, but also by significantly reducing the fossil fuel requirement compared to stand-alone coal-fired power plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanicum virgatum 3aalgorithms 3abiodiesel 3abiomass 3acarbon dioxide 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3acoal 3acombustion 3aelectric power 3aelectricity 3aenvironmental impact 3aflue gas 3afossils 3afuel production 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3ahardwood 3ahuman health 3alife cycle assessment 3amicroalgae 3anatural gas 3aoils 3apower generation 3apower plants 3aprices 3aprimary energy 3araceways 3asocioeconomics 3asoftwood 3asteam 3asystem optimization 3athermodynamics 0aGHG mitigation 0aBiological capture of CO2 0aMicroalgae biodiesel production 0aSteam power plants 0aSustainable energy system 0aMulti-objective optimization 0aLife cycle assessment1 aSerna González, Medardo,1 aPonce-Ortega, José María,1 aEl-Halwagi, Mahmoud M.0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2014 June 02, v. 2, no. 6 p.1388-1403dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/sc400436a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02425naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002100154245011000175300001600285500001900301520147100320592002801791650003001819650003001849650001101879700001901890700002201909700001901931773010901950856005502059852000902114655001202123IND50069941320221119200229.0131018e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006994132DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1472-4642.2009.00619.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPenman, Trent D.10aPredicting the impact of climate change on Australia’s most endangered snake, Hoplocephalus bungaroides  ap. 109-118.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAim To predict how the bioclimatic envelope of the broad‐headed snake (BHS) (Hoplocephalus bungaroides) may be redistributed under future climate warming scenarios. Location South‐eastern New South Wales, Australia. Methods We used 159 independent locations for the species and 35 climatic variables to model the bioclimatic envelope for the BHS using two modelling approaches – Bioclim and Maxent. Predictions were made under current climatic conditions and we also predicted the species distribution under low and high climate change scenarios for 2030 and 2070. Results Broad‐headed snakes currently encompass their entire bioclimatic envelope. Both modelling approaches predict that suitable climate space for BHS will be lost to varying degrees under both climate warming scenarios, and under the worst case, only 14% of known snake populations may persist. Main conclusions Areas of higher elevation within the current range will be most important for persistence of this species because they will remain relatively moist and cool even under climate change and will match the current climate envelope. Conservation efforts should focus on areas where suitable climate space may persist under climate warming scenarios. Long‐term monitoring programs should be established both in these areas and where populations are predicted to become extirpated, so that we can accurately determine changes in the distribution of this species throughout its range.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHoplocephalus bungaroides 3ageographical distribution 3asnakes1 aPike, David A.1 aWebb, Jonathan K.1 aShine, Richard0 tDiversity & distributions.g2010 Jan., v. 16, no. 1 p.109-118dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1366-95167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-4642.2009.00619.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02609naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245011300153300001800266520128500284592002801569650002201597650001301619650002201632650001301654650001301667650002001680650001301700650001201713650002401725650002701749650001301776650002101789650001401810653003101824653002101855653001501876653003101891653001401922700001501936773013001951856007302081852000902154655001202163IND60530526120221117225849.0160721e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053052612DNAL7 a10.1021/sc400461d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Helan10aControlled De-Cross-Linking and Disentanglement of Feather Keratin for Fiber Preparation via a Novel Process  ap. 1404-1410.  aPure protein fibers were fabricated from chicken feathers via a potentially green process. In the last several decades, efforts have been made to produce keratin-based industrial products, especially fibers. However, the methods of producing keratin fibers directly from chicken feathers could not be repeated. In this research, protein fibers from chicken feathers were developed using chemicals that could be either derived from renewable resources or facilely recycled. Backbones of keratin were preserved after cleavage of disulfide bonds using cysteine. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was applied to dissolve keratin for spinning. Increasing SDS concentration intensified the ordered conformation of keratin, first increased and then decreased the viscosity of solution, suggesting continuous disentanglement of keratin molecules and enhancement in inter- and intramolecular electrical repulsion. Diameters of the obtained fibers as small as 20 μm also proved good drawability of the keratin solution. Change in crystallinity indices was found to be consistent with that of tensile properties of the keratin fibers. In summary, regenerated fibers were successfully produced as linear keratin with preserved backbones that could be untangled and aligned in a controlled manner.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical elements 3achickens 3acrystal structure 3acysteine 3adiameter 3adisulfide bonds 3afeathers 3akeratin 3arenewable resources 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3aspinning 3atensile strength 3aviscosity 0aRegenerated keratin fibers 0aChicken feathers 0aSurfactant 0aControlled disentanglement 0aViscosity1 aYang, Yiqi0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2014 June 02, v. 2, no. 6 p.1404-1410dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/sc400461d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02173naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245006200169300001800231520053500249536036700784592002801151596003301179596002101212650001401233650001501247650003601262650001701298650001701315650001301332650002201345653002401367653002301391653002201414700001701436700001801453700001601471700001801487700001501505773012501520856008501645852000901730655001201739IND60747237220221119011056.0210812e20210803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074723722DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2019.16791312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Wenhui,10aNew diterpenoids from the rhizomes of Hedychium forrestii  ap. 2463-2469.  aA novel hexanorditerpenoid, hedychin C (1), and a new diterpenoid, hedychin D (2), were isolated from the rhizomes of Hedychium forrestii.

In this study the oxidation of Ti–40Nb for biomedical application was achieved by employing an inductively coupled radio frequency oxygen plasma. The correlation between the growth mode of the surface oxide and the electric conductivity ratio of the plasma and the oxide phase were studied by varying the sample temperature, oxygen gas pressure and additional bias potential. The plasma treated samples were characterised by confocal laser microscopy, SEM, EBSD, XPS, TEM and ToF-SIMS. The surface energy was determined by contact angle measurements using the Owens–Wendt–Rabel–Kaelble method. Well adhering oxide layers consisting of TiO₂ and Nb₂O₅ with thicknesses between 50 and 150nm were obtained. Surface roughness values and microstructure indicate that the growth mode of the oxide can be well controlled by the sample temperature and oxygen gas pressure. At temperatures above 450°C a migration of Ti ions towards the surface controls the growth process. A bias potential higher than +50V causes rough and defective surfaces with high surface energies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aalloys 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3acontact angle 3aelectrical conductivity 3aenergy 3aionic liquids 3aions 3amicrostructure 3aorthopedics 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aradio waves 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asurface roughness 3atemperature 3atitanium dioxide 3atransmission electron microscopy 2aAlloysxchemistry 2aCrystallization 2aElectrochemical Techniquesxmethods 2aImplants, Experimental 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aOptical Imaging 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aOxidesxchemistry 2aPhotoelectron Spectroscopy 2aPlasma Gasesxchemistry 2aRadio Waves 2aSurface Properties 2aThermodynamics1 aRohnke, Marcus1 aHelth, Arne1 aLeichtweiß, Thomas1 aGemming, Thomas1 aGebert, Annett1 aEckert, J.q(Jürgen),1 aJanek, Jürgen0 tActa biomaterialia.g2013 Nov., v. 9, no. 11 p.9201-9210dElsevier Ltdx1742-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2013.07.0153Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03172naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003300133040001800166100002500184245011700209300001600326506007600342520114800418592002801566506003701594650001801631650001101649650001601660650001601676650002001692650001001712650002001722650001201742650001501754650001001769650001501779650001001794650003301804650002501837650001001862650003801872650002601910650002101936650001101957650002001968650001801988650002102006650001102027650001102038650000902049650002202058650002102080650003402101650002002135650002702155700002202182700002402204700002302228700002102251700002202272773013702294856004602431852000902477655001202486IND4470569420221207064329.0120419e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447056942DNAL7 a223787262pmid7 aPMC33023582pmcid7 a10.3945/ajcn.111.0243802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEpstein, Leonard H.,10aExperimental research on the relation between food price changes and food-purchasing patterns: a targeted review  ap. 789-809.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOne way in which to modify food purchases is to change prices through tax policy, subsidy policy, or both. We reviewed the growing body of experimental research conducted in the laboratory and in the field that investigates the following: the extent to which price changes influence purchases of targeted and nontargeted foods, total energy, or macronutrients purchased; the interaction of price changes with adjunctive interventions; and moderators of sensitivity to price changes. After a brief overview of economic principles and observational research that addresses these issues, we present a targeted review of experimental research. Experimental research suggests that price changes modify purchases of targeted foods, but research on the overall nutritional quality of purchases is mixed because of substitution effects. There is mixed support for combining price changes with adjunctive interventions, and there are no replicated findings on moderators to price sensitivity in experiments. Additional focused research is needed to better inform food policy development with the aim of improving eating behavior and preventing obesity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aeating habits 3aenergy 3afood policy 3afood prices 3afood purchasing 3afoods 3anutritive value 3aobesity 3apurchasing 3ataxes 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aBehavioral Researchxmethods 2aBeveragesxeconomics 2aChild 2aDietxadverse effectsxeconomics. 2aEconomics, Behavioral 2aFeeding Behavior 2aFemale 2aFoodxeconomics 2aFood Services 2aHealth Promotion 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aMale 2aMaternal Behavior 2aNutrition Policy 2aObesityxprevention & control 2aResearch Design 2aSocioeconomic Factors.1 aJankowiak, Noelle1 aNederkoorn, Chantal1 aRaynor, Hollie A.,1 aFrench, Simone A1 aFinkelstein, Eric0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2012 Apr., v. 95, no. 4 p.789-809dAmerican Society for Clinical Nutritionx0002-91657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.111.024380  aDNAL 7aarticle03379naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245011600174300001600290500001500306520179600321592002802117650001602145650002502161650002602186650001202212650001202224650001402236650002102250650002902271650001202300650002402312650001802336650002402354650001102378650002402389650001202413650001402425650001202439650000702451650001002458651001702468651001102485653001902496653001402515653002502529653001702554653001102571653000802582700002802590773013502618856005102753852000902804655001202813IND50076243620221117205207.0140410e20120101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007624362DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2012.6417962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaz-Ferreiro, Jorge10aRevegetation and Soil Management Effects on Chemical Properties of a Saprolite Resulting from Deep Soil Removal  ap. 387-398.  a2019-12-05  aDuring the building of a hydroelectrical power plant at Ilha Solteira in the Parana River (Brazil), materials of a highly weathered soil Oxisol were extracted from a depth between 5 and 8 m for engineering works. This resulted in an abandoned depression area. The topsoil was not salvaged and the open pit was not backfilled, and as result vegetation hardly or not at all recovered. On the residual saprolite materials, an experimental field was established to assess different soil rehabilitation treatments. Field experiments were initiated in 1992. After soil tillage, two different crops and three different liming strategies were compared, giving six combinations. In addition, two uncropped control treatments, tilled and no-tilled, were established so that a total of eight treatments were assessed. The experimental design consisted of four randomized experimental blocks, which included a total of 32 plots with a plot area of 100 m². This experiment was used to study the effectiveness of the soil-reclamation treatments after a 9-year period. Soil samples were taken at three different depths (0–10, 10–20, and 20–40 cm), and they were analyzed routinely for pH, organic-matter content, and cation exchange capacity (CEC). Revegetation of the abandoned saprolite material increased soil organic-matter content and cation exchange capacity (CEC), and to some extent small differences between treatments were evidenced. Exchangeable calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) recovered faster than organic-matter content. A significant linear relationship was found between organic-matter content and CEC, suggesting continued addition of organic material will further approach the value of these parameters to those levels corresponding to natural soils under “Cerrado” vegetation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aengineering 3aexchangeable calcium 3afield experimentation 3acerrado 3aOxisols 3asaprolite 3aland restoration 3acation exchange capacity 3acalcium 3asoil organic matter 3asoil sampling 3ahydroelectric power 3aliming 3aexperimental design 3atillage 3amagnesium 3atopsoil 3apH 3acrops 3aParana River 3aBrazil 0aorganic matter 0aAmendment 0aprofile decapitation 0arevegetation 0aOxisol 0aCEC1 aAlves, Marlene Cristina0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2012 Jan. 1, v. 43, no. 1-2 p.387-398dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-24167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2012.641796  aDNAL 7aarticle02632naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245014000164300001600304520117400320592002801494650002401522650002401546650001101570650001301581650001101594650001601605650000901621650001201630650001401642650002301656650001501679650000901694650001201703653002401715653001501739653002501754653001401779653001701793700001901810700001401829700001801843700001901861700001701880700001601897773011801913856008602031852000902117655001202126IND60629602520221119091113.0190606e20190201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062960252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.10.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuan, Na10aEffect of organic loading rate on anaerobic digestion of pig manure: Methane production, mass flow, reactor scale and heating scenarios  ap. 646-652.  aThe effect of organic loading rate (OLR) with total solid (TS) control (3%–8%) on the performance of anaerobic digestion of pig manure (PM) using completely stirred anaerobic reactor was investigated. Based on the lab data, how OLR affects mass flow, construction scale and heating requirement in a farm-scale biogas plant was calculated. And three scenarios of typical reactor-heating technology were comparatively analyzed. The optimal OLR was 1.89 g volatile solid (VS)/(L.d) with methane yield of 438.38 mL/gVS in the lab condition. The lower OLR, the larger amount of water and energy consumption, lower methane production and larger amount of liquid digestate was observed. Thus, the reactor with low OLR was suitable in tropical regions with the main target of disposing PM and fertilizer production. High OLR has advantage in the investment, but owns risk of instable process for a long-term run. In our study, among the three heating supply scenarios, biogas boiler was the best option for the designed biogas plant with the given breeding scale under moderate OLR. Combined heat and power (CHP) has potential advantage for the biogas plant under high OLR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digesters 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiogas 3abreeding 3aenergy 3afertilizers 3aheat 3aliquids 3amass flow 3amethane production 3apig manure 3arisk 3atropics 0aAnaerobic digestion 0aPig manure 0aOrganic loading rate 0aMass flow 0aBiogas plant1 aZhang, Duojiao1 aLin, Cong1 aZhang, Yifeng1 aZhao, Lingying1 aLiu, Hongbin1 aLiu, Zhidan0 tJournal of environmental management.g2019 Feb. 01, v. 231 p.646-652dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.10.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02953naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245010100171300001600272520157700288592002801865650001401893650001101907650001201918650002201930650001201952650002001964650002001984650002902004650000902033650002002042650002602062650002402088650002102112650001602133650001002149651001202159651001302171651001102184700002902195700002202224700001902246773008802265856008602353990002302439852000902462655001202471IND60092007320221118033752.0141103e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009200732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.buildenv.2011.11.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRossi, Barbara10aLife-cycle assessment of residential buildings in three different European locations, basic tool  ap. 395-401.  aThe paper deals with the development of a tool used for the life cycle assessment of residential buildings located in three different European towns: Brussels (Belgium), Coimbra (Portugal) and Luleå (Sweden). The basic tool focuses on the structure and the materials of the buildings and permits the evaluation of the Embodied energy, Embodied carbon and yearly energy consumption. For that purpose, a different set of original data is taken into account for each location, in which the monthly temperatures, energy mix, heating and cooling systems are defined. The energy consumption, being for heating space or water, for cooling or for lighting is transformed into CO₂ emissions to deduce the Operational carbon as well. The influence of the energy mix can therefore be assessed in the basic tool. As a matter of fact, the heating and cooling systems habitually used in the three countries are also of great importance. The District Heating system, is, for instance, incorporated in the basic tool. The presence of solar water heater or photovoltaic panels is also strongly influencing the operational carbon. After a short literature review on building LCA and the description of the basic tool, the software Pleiades + Comfie combined with Equer is used to achieve the complete LCA for one building using two different load bearing frames.

We compared antioxidant and haematological biomarkers in the wild Italian wall lizards Podarcis siculus from three olive groves representing a gradient of management intensity. Lizards from the conventional grove showed induced antioxidant defences relative to those from the organic field. However, this induction did not avoid the occurrence of oxidative stress in males from intensively managed olive groves, who showed TBARS levels 58%–133% higher than males from the other sites. Haematological responses also suggested increased stress in females from the intensively managed olive groves, with a heterophil-to-lymphocyte ratio 5.3 to 14.8-fold higher than in the other sites. The observed stress responses of lizards along the studied gradient of agricultural management suggest their potential usefulness as non-destructive biomarkers to environmental stressors associated with agricultural intensification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPodarcis 3aagricultural management 3aagroecosystems 3aantioxidants 3abiomarkers 3aintensive farming 3aolives 3aoxidative stress 3apesticides 3apollution 3astress response 3atoxicology1 aBiaggini, Marta1 aOrtiz-Santaliestra, Manuel E.1 aCosta, Sara1 aSantos, Barbara,1 aLopes, Isabel1 aCorti, Claudia0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2022 Feb., v. 108, no. 2 p.196-203dSpringer USwJournal:jnl46145x0007-48617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-021-03404-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03655naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245021200164300001600376520181000392592002802202650001602230650001902246650001702265650002002282650001002302650002302312650001602335650002202351650002102373650001002394650004302404650001802447650001202465650002402477650002102501650003202522650001102554650002002565650001802585653002002603653001602623653003402639653002202673653002102695653002602716653002202742700003002764700002302794700002102817700002802838773012002866856008202986852000903068655001203077IND60634253520221120131325.0190516e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063425352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbd.2019.03.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKatan, Tomer10aEffect of plant-based diets with varying ratios of ω6 to ω3 fatty acids on growth performance, tissue composition, fatty acid biosynthesis and lipid-related gene expression in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar)  ap. 290-304.  aLittle is known about how variation in omega-6 to omega-3 (ω6:ω3) fatty acid (FA) ratios affects lipid metabolism and eicosanoid synthesis in salmon, and the potential underlying molecular mechanisms. The current study examined the impact of five plant-based diets (12-week exposure) with varying ω6:ω3 (0.3–2.7) on the growth, tissue lipid composition (muscle and liver), and hepatic transcript expression of lipid metabolism and eicosanoid synthesis-related genes in Atlantic salmon. Growth performance and organ indices were not affected by dietary ω6:ω3. The liver and muscle FA composition was highly reflective of the diet (ω6:ω3 of 0.2–0.8 and 0.3–1.9, respectively) and suggested elongation and desaturation of the ω3 and ω6 precursors 18:3ω3 and 18:2ω6. Furthermore, proportions of ω6 and ω3 PUFA in both tissues showed significant positive correlations with dietary inclusion (% of diet) of soy and linseed oils, respectively. Compound-specific stable isotope analysis (CSIA) further demonstrated that liver long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LC-PUFA) synthesis (specifically 20:5ω3 and 20:4ω6) was largely driven by dietary 18:3ω3 and 18:2ω6, even when 20:5ω3 and 22:6ω3 were supplied at levels above minimum requirements. In addition, significant positive and negative correlations were identified between the transcript expression of LC-PUFA synthesis-related genes and liver ω6 and ω3 LC-PUFA, respectively, further supporting FA biosynthesis. Liver ω3 LC-PUFA also correlated negatively with the eicosanoid synthesis-related transcripts pgds and cox1. This is the first study to use CSIA, hepatic transcriptome, and tissue lipid composition analyses concurrently to demonstrate the impact of plant-based diets with varying ω6:ω3 on farmed Atlantic salmon.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmo salar 3aanimal tissues 3abiosynthesis 3agene expression 3agenes 3agrowth performance 3alinseed oil 3alipid composition 3alipid metabolism 3aliver 3along chain polyunsaturated fatty acids 3amessenger RNA 3amuscles 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aplant-based diet 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3asalmon 3astable isotopes 3atranscriptome 0aAtlantic salmon 0aEicosanoids 0aHepatic transcript expression 0aLC-PUFA synthesis 0aLipid metabolism 0aOmega-6/omega-3 ratio 0aPlant-based diets1 aCaballero-Solares, Albert1 aTaylor, Richard G.1 aRise, Matthew L.1 aParrish, Christopher C.0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2019 June, v. 30 p.290-304dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12415x1744-117X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbd.2019.03.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02908naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002700149245012500176500001400301520162200315592002801937650002401965650001601989650001602005650001202021650001502033650001402048650002302062650001802085650002002103650002802123650001702151651002802168651001102196700002902207700001902236700001802255773013302273856008302406852000902489655001202498IND60707753720221123003607.0200821e20200805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070775372DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture100803292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKostrzewska, Marta  K.10aPhosphorus in Spring Barley and Italian Rye-Grass Biomass as an Effect of Inter-Species Interactions under Water Deficit  aNAL-light  aWith global warming, the problem of soil water deficit is growing in Central Europe, including Poland, and the use of catch crops is recommended to mitigate climate changes. This study aimed to determine the influence of water deficit on phosphorus (P) content and accumulation in the above-ground biomass of spring barley and Italian rye-grass growing separately and in the mixture, and on the inter-species interactions between these crops. The study was based on a pot experiment established in accordance with the additive design. The experimental factors were as follows: A. water supply of the plants: an optimal dose and a dose reduced by 50% in relation to the optimal dose, and B. the sowing type: barley sown as a single species, rye-grass sown as a single species, and barley with rye-grass catch crop. Based on the P accumulation in plant biomass, the relative yield of barley and rye-grass, the total relative yield, and the competitive equilibrium index were determined. Water deficit had no effect on the P content in the plants, but it reduced the P accumulation in barley stems, leaves and spikes, as well as in rye-grass stems and leaves, from the emergence to the end of plants’ growing period, both when the plants were sown as a single species and as a mixture. Barley was a stronger competitor than rye-grass. Inter-species competition occurred at the stem elongation and heading of barley. The intensification of inter-species competition for P under water deficit conditions should be taken into account when recommending the undersowing of barley with rye-grass for sustainable agriculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaboveground biomass 3aagriculture 3acatch crops 3aclimate 3aphosphorus 3aphytomass 3asoil water deficit 3aspring barley 3astem elongation 3asustainable agriculture 3awater supply 3aCentral European region 3aPoland1 aJastrzębska, Magdalena,1 aTreder, Kinga 1 aWanic, Maria 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2020 Aug. 05, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture100803293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02238naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245015700173300001800330520088100348592002801229650001801257650001501275650001301290650001901303650001701322650001501339650001301354650001301367650001701380653002301397653001901420653003001439700002201469700002701491700003101518700002101549700002701570773012501597856008501722852000901807655001201816IND60747237420221119010409.0210812e20210803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074723742DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2019.16791392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPromchai, Thanika10a(R)-3-(8'-Hydroxyfarnesyl)-indole and other chemical constituents from the flowers of Anomianthus dulcis and their antimalarial and cytotoxic activities  ap. 2476-2481.  aA new farnesylindole, (R)-3-(8'-hydroxyfarnesyl)-indole (1), as a scalemic mixture (33% ee) along with nine known compounds (2-10), including one farnesylindole, three flavanones, three flavone derivatives and two chalcone derivatives were isolated from the methanolic crude extract of the flowers from Anomianthus dulcis.

Location State of São Paulo, Brazil. Methods We used the software Marxan to evaluate different scenarios of amphibian conservation planning. Our approach differs from previous methods by explicitly including two different landscape metrics; habitat split for species with aquatic larvae, and habitat loss for species with terrestrial development. We evaluated the effect of habitat requirements by classifying species breeding habitats in five categories (flowing water, still water permanent, still water temporary, bromeliad or bamboo, and terrestrial). We performed analyses using two scales, grid cells and watersheds and also considered nature preserves as protected areas. Results We found contrasting patterns of deforestation between coastal and inland regions. Seventy‐six grid cells and 14 watersheds are capable of representing each species at least once. When accounting for grid cells already protected in state and national parks and considering species habitat requirements we found 16 high‐priority grid cells for species with one or two reproductive habitats, and only one cell representing species with four habitat requirements. Key areas for the conservation of species breeding in flowing and permanent still waters are concentrated in southern state, while those for amphibians breeding in temporary ponds are concentrated in central to eastern zones. Eastern highland zones are key areas for preserving species breeding terrestrially by direct or indirect development. Species breeding in bromeliads and bamboos are already well represented in protected areas. Main conclusions Our results emphasize the need to integrate information on landscape configuration and species life‐history traits to produce more ecologically relevant conservation strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBromeliaceae 3aamphibians 3abamboos 3acomputer software 3adeforestation 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3alife history 3aBrazil1 aLoyola, R.

These phenotypic changes have arisen from alterations in the genome/transcriptome, as well as the influence of many external factors on growth performance including nutrition, environment, and management. To investigate the phenotypic changes resulting from genetic selection for increased body weight, The Ohio State University maintains 2 unique genetic turkey lines: the randombred control (RBC2) line, which is comprised of genetics from 1960 era commercial turkeys and has been maintained without conscious selection for any trait; and the F line, which was originally selected from the RBC2 line and has been selected for increased 16 wk body weight for over 50 generations. This study used broad-spectrum mass-spectrometry profiling techniques to identify and quantify differences in the metabolome of the serum of F and RBC2 turkey lines. Serum samples from both F and RBC2 turkeys were subject to quantitative time of flight liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analyses. Principle component analyses showed distinct populations of metabolites in the F vs. RBC2 serum, suggesting that increased body weight is associated with the accumulation of several metabolites. Comparing the spectral features to online databases resulted in the selection of 104 features with potentially identifiable chemical structures. Of these 104 features, 25 were found at higher levels in the serum of the RBC2 line turkeys, while 79 were found at a greater abundance in the F line turkeys. A more detailed analysis of these 104 features allowed for the putative identification of 49 compounds, which were clustered into 6 functional groups: 1) energy metabolism; 2) vitamins; 3) hormones and signaling molecules; 4) lipid derivatives, fatty acid metabolites, and membrane components; 5) amino acid/protein metabolism; and 6) microbial metabolites. Further validation and experimentation is needed to confirm the identity of these metabolites and understand their biological relevance and association with selection for increased body weight.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3achemical structure 3adatabases 3aenergy metabolism 3afatty acids 3agenome 3agrowth performance 3ahormones 3aliquid chromatography 3ametabolites 3ametabolome 3anatural selection 3anutrition 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic plasticity 3aprotein metabolism 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atranscriptome 3aturkeys 3avitamins 3aOhio 0aGrowth selection 0ametabolome 0aserum 0aturkey1 aVelleman, Sandra G.1 aBernier, Matthew1 aMcCormick, Janet1 aBlakeslee, Joshua J.0 tPoultry science.g2020 Jan., v. 99, no. 1 p.517-525dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps/pez4933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03386naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245006600173300001600239520210900255592002802364650002302392650001102415650001802426650001302444650001402457650001302471650001602484650001902500650001502519650001702534650001202551651002402563651001402587653001602601653000902617653002802626653001702654653001602671653002602687700002002713773013502733856005102868852000902919655001202928IND50076243820221117205153.0140410e20120101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007624382DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2012.6418022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRayment, George E.10aNew, Comprehensive Soil Chemical Methods Book for Australasia  ap. 412-418.  aThe 1992 Australian Laboratory Handbook of Soil and Water Chemical Methods (the handbook) of Rayment and Higginson defines much of the contemporary soil chemical methodology used in Australia for soil fertility and land-resource survey assessments. In addition, codes from the handbook identify methodological details in Australian soil databases, while the codes summarize most tests used for certification purposes by the Australasian Soil and Plant Analysis Council (ASPAC) in its interlaboratory soil proficiency testing programs. A worthy, comprehensive replacement was required as the handbook is out of date in places and out of print. This article provides information on the handbook's replacement with a new book by Rayment and Lyons, titled Soil Chemical Methods-Australasia. Method codes and other strengths of the handbook have been retained and many new tests have been added. There are new chapters on acid sulfate soils, total miscellaneous elements, and miscellaneous extractable elements, plus inclusions and improvements throughout. Modern analytical techniques, such as flow-injection analysis, inductively coupled plasma–mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS), and potential alternatives to chemical testing offered by near-range and midrange infrared diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, are included. Examples of new additions include the Mehlich 3 “universal” soil test (and derived environmental P tests) and methods for potentially mineralizable nitrogen, labile carbon, particulate organic carbon, and charcoal. Around 200 methods are fully described, while information of measurement performance at different concentrations is provided where credible data were available from multiple, interlaboratory proficiency programs of ASPAC. Procedures for the chemical testing of water are no longer included, except where relevant to saturation extracts of soils. While there are informative and much expanded method preambles and reference lists, the new 2011 book has its focus on methodology. A scheme to agree on recommended methods for different soils and regional locations is outlined.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid sulfate soils 3acarbon 3acertification 3acharcoal 3adatabases 3anitrogen 3areflectance 3asoil fertility 3asoil water 3aspectroscopy 3asurveys 3aAustralasian region 3aAustralia 0aAustralasia 0abook 0ameasurement performance 0amethod codes 0aproficiency 0asoil chemical methods1 aLyons, David J.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2012 Jan. 1, v. 43, no. 1-2 p.412-418dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-24167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2012.641802  aDNAL 7aarticle02784naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245019100167500002200358520160900380592002801989653001002017653003202027653002302059653002202082653001602104700001602120700002002136700005802156700001902214700001802233773010302251856008302354852000902437655001202446IND60565885020221119072457.0170712s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056588502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sesci.2017.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGou, Guo-Ning10aIn situ boron isotopic analyses of tourmalines from Neogene magmatic rocks in the northern and southern margins of Tibet: Evidence for melting of continental crust and sediment recycling  aPre-press version  aSediment recycling has important impacts on the differentiation of the continental crust, and is considered to mainly occur in arc settings. In collisional orogenic belts, however, sediment recycling processes are comparatively less well understood. In general, sedimentary rocks or tourmaline with continental affinities have boron (B) isotope compositions that differ from marine sedimentary rocks, magmatic rocks undergoing seawater alteration or tourmaline originating from these rocks or fluids. This study uses laser-ablation multi-collector, inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-MC-ICPMS) for in-situ B isotope analyses of tourmaline from the northern and southern margins of Tibet. Tourmalines from the Hudongliang Pliocene two mica rhyolites in the Songpan-Gangzi block and the Cuonandong Miocene two mica granites in the Himalayan Block have δ11B values of −10.47 ± 0.54‰ and −12.48 ± 1.04‰, respectively. Combined with petrological and Nd–Sr isotope data, we suggest that these strongly peraluminous magmatic rocks from the northern and southern margins of Tibet were mainly generated by partial melting of subducted or overridden metasedimentary rocks with continental affinities due to the contraction caused by the collision between the Indian and Asian plates. Given the widespread occurrences of strongly peraluminous Neogene magmatic rocks in the southern and northern margin of Tibet, we suggest that the recycling of sediments with continental affinity played an important role in the evolution of continental crust during the collisional orogenic process.  aPublisher supplied data 0aTibet 0aPeraluminous magmatic rocks 0aSediment recycling 0aIn-situ B isotope 0aTourmalines1 aWang, Qiang1 aWyman, Derek A.1 aXia, Xiao-Ping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3203-039X1 aWei, Gang-Jian1 aGuo, Hai-Feng0 tSolid Earth Sciences.g2017, dElsevier B.V.aGuangzhou Institute of Geochemistryx2451-912X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sesci.2017.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02663naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245017700181300001600358520102200374592002801396596009901424596021701523650001601740650002301756650002001779650001201799650002201811650002101833650001601854650002001870650001801890651001001908653002601918653002401944653002501968653001901993653002502012773011002037856008502147852000902232655001202241IND60629602720221119091118.0190131e20190217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062960272DNAL7 a10.1080/01426397.2017.14131742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález Álvarez, David10aRethinking tourism narratives on the cultural landscapes of Asturias (Northern Spain) from the perspective of Landscape Archaeology: do archaeologists have anything to say?  ap. 117-133.  aAs in other rural areas in Spain, the Asturian countryside suffers from a profound demographic and economic crisis. Since tourism emerged as one of the main hopes for the reactivation of rural economy, the regional government has made a particular effort in promoting rural tourism. This paper intends to assess the effects that naturalistic and atemporal narratives of Asturian landscapes exert on the rural farming communities, which define the ‘tourism imaginaries’ as they become established as identity referents not only for visitors, but for the inhabitants of the region themselves. Archaeology can enhance the local communities’ agency through the appreciation of cultural values attached to these landscapes. To this end, the diachronic depth of the social and productive processes which shaped the Asturian landscapes is emphasised by relying on Landscape Archaeology. The relevant role played by farmers and herders in these activities merits their involvement in actively designing future policies.  aPublisher supplied data  aIN606B-2016/007cAxencia Galega de Innovación, Consellería de Economía, Emprego e Industria  aIN606B-2016/007cThis work was supported by the Axencia Galega de Innovación, Consellería de Economía, Emprego e Industria from the Galician regional government (Spain) through the Postdoctoral Support Program 3aarchaeology 3acultural landscape 3acultural values 3afarmers 3aissues and policy 3alocal government 3arural areas 3arural economics 3arural tourism 3aSpain 0aLandscape Archaeology 0atourism imaginaries 0alandscapes diachrony 0aanthropisation 0aterritorial branding0 tLandscape research.g2019 Feb. 17, v. 44, no. 2 p.117-133dRoutledgewJournal:J000000120x1469-97107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01426397.2017.14131743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04419naa a2200985 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245019700167300001600364520187800380592002802258650002802286650001502314650001702329650001902346650001702365650001402382650002102396650001802417650002402435650001502459650000902474650001602483650002002499650003102519650001002550650002002560650001202580650001502592650001702607650001402624650002102638650001802659650002302677650002102700650001802721653000802739653000802747653000902755653001002764653000802774653001102782653000802793653000902801653000802810653000902818653000802827653000902835653000802844653001202852653000802864653000802872653000902880653000802889653000802897653000702905653000702912653000902919653000802928653000802936653001002944653000702954653000702961653001002968653004202978653002803020653001703048653002703065653001403092700001703106700001303123700001703136700001503153700001303168700001603181700001303197773012003210856008203330852000903412655001203421IND60634253820221120131309.0190516e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063425382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbd.2019.02.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Jing-jing10aDietary arachidonic acid decreases the expression of transcripts related to adipocyte development and chronic inflammation in the adipose tissue of juvenile grass carp, Ctenopharyngodon idella  ap. 122-132.  aOverdevelopment of adipose tissue in cultured fish is one of the biggest issues plaguing current aquaculture industry, leading to unhealthy status of fishes and production losses. Diet supplemented with 0.30% arachidonic acid (ARA) has been found to reduce adipogenesis and inflammation in grass carp, but the potential mechanism is not comprehensively understood. To fully reveal the effects of dietary ARA on the mRNA profiles of adipose tissue, transcriptome techniques were applied in this study. A 10-weeks feeding experiment was performed using two isonitrogenous and isoenergetic purified diets, namely ARA-free (control) and 0.30% ARA (ARA group). Results showed increased ARA content and decreased intraperitoneal fat index and adipocyte size in the adipose tissue of fish fed ARA (P < 0.05). A total of 611 and 973 genes of the adipose tissue were significantly up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively, in fish fed ARA (P < 0.05). Dietary ARA upregulated LOX pathway but downregulated CYP450 pathway annotated genes expression. A total of 65 cell development annotated genes including 30 adipocyte proliferation, 21 adipocyte differentiation, and 14 cell apoptosis annotated genes were down-regulated in the ARA group. In addition, 19 lipid catabolism annotated genes were increased. The mRNA expression levels of 5 chemokines, 10 cytokines, 26 cytokine and chemokine receptors, 15 cell adhesion, 6 oxidative stress, and 6 angiogenesis annotated genes were all down-regulated in fish fed ARA. Finally, dietary ARA also decreased the expression of transcripts annotated with glucose transportation, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. Overall, our results demonstrate that dietary ARA has a fat reducing role, and tends to retard adipocyte development and attenuate chronic inflammation based on these adipose transcript expression results in grass carp.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCtenopharyngodon idella 3aadipocytes 3aadipogenesis 3aadipose tissue 3aangiogenesis 3aapoptosis 3aarachidonic acid 3acell adhesion 3achemokine receptors 3achemokines 3adiet 3afarmed fish 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agluconeogenesis 3aglucose 3aglycolysis 3ainflammation 3ajuveniles 3alipid metabolism 3amessenger RNA 3anutrient transport 3aoxidative stress 3atranscriptome 0aACC 0aARA 0aATGL 0aC/EBP 0aCOX 0aCYP450 0aDEG 0aFABP 0aFAS 0aFPKM 0aHSL 0aIL-6 0aIPF 0aLC-PUFA 0aLOX 0aLPL 0aMUFA 0aNPL 0aPCA 0aPG 0aPL 0aPPAR 0aROS 0aSFA 0aSREBP 0aTG 0aTL 0aTNFα 0aLong chain polyunsaturated fatty acid 0aCtenopharyngodon idella 0aAdipogenesis 0aLow-grade inflammation 0aLipolysis1 aLei, Cai-xia1 aJi, Hong1 aZhou, Ji-shu1 aYu, Hai-bo1 aLi, Yang1 aYu, Er-meng1 aXie, Jun0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2019 June, v. 30 p.122-132dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12415x1744-117X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbd.2019.02.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04026naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100007200151245017000223520194500393592002802338650001202366650001302378650001202391650001402403650001102417650002502428650001402453650002902467650001302496650001602509650000902525650001402534650001302548650001902561650001402580650001002594650001302604650001302617650001102630650001302641653002402654653003502678653002602713653001702739653001802756700003702774700003602811700002702847700006302874700002602937700002702963700007002990700003103060700006703091700003003158773011803188856008503306852000903391655001203400IND60758399220221123030848.0220124e20220215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075839922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1141892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarlos dos Santos, Josenilda1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2348-292210aCharacterization of the biofilm structure and microbial diversity of sulfate-reducing bacteria from petroleum produced water supplemented by different carbon sources  aColonization by sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) in environments associated with oil is mainly dependent on the availability of sulfate and carbon sources. The formation of biofilms by SRB increases the corrosion of pipelines and oil storage tanks, representing great occupational and operational risks and respective economic losses for the oil industry. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of the addition of acetate, butyrate, lactate, propionate and oil on the structure of biofilm formed in carbon steel coupons, as well as on the diversity of total bacteria and SRB in the planktonic and sessile communities from petroleum produced water. The biofilm morphology, chemical composition, average roughness and the microbial diversity was analyzed. In all carbon sources, formation of dense biofilm without morphological and/or microbial density differences was detected, with the most of cells observed in the form of individual rods. The diversity and richness indices of bacterial species in the planktonic community was greater than in the biofilm. Geotoga was the most abundant genus, and more than 85% of SRB species were common to all treatments. The functional predicted profile shown that the observed genres in planktonic communities were related to the reduction of sulfate, sulfite, elementary sulfur and other sulfur compounds, but the abundance varied between treatments. For the biofilm, the functions predicted profile for the oil treatment was the one that most varied in relation to the control, while for the planktonic community, the addition of all carbon sources interfered in the predicted functional profile. Thus, although it does not cause changes in the structure and morphology biofilm, the supplementation of produced water with different carbon sources is associated with changes in the SRB taxonomic composition and functional profiles of the biofilm and the planktonic bacterial communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGeotoga 3aacetates 3abiofilm 3abutyrates 3acarbon 3achemical composition 3acorrosion 3aenvironmental management 3aindustry 3alactic acid 3aoils 3apetroleum 3aplankton 3apropionic acid 3aroughness 3asteel 3asulfates 3asulfites 3asulfur 3ataxonomy 0aElectron microscopy 0aEnergy dispersion spectroscopy 0aFunctional prediction 0aSteel coupon 0a16S rRNA gene1 aLopes, Déborah Romaskevis Gomes1 aSilva, Lívia Carneiro Fidélis1 aRamos, José Luiz Lima1 aDias, Roberto Sousa1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9752-19691 aLima, Helena Santiago1 aSousa, Maíra Paula de1 aWaldow, Vinícius de Abreu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2348-29221 aPaula, Sérgio Oliveira de1 aFerreira, Sukarno Olavo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8174-02001 aSilva, Cynthia Canêdo da0 tJournal of environmental management.g2022 Feb. 15, v. 304 p.114189-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1141893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02655naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245005400171300001600225520164900241592002801890650000801918650001401926650001501940650001401955650001101969650003301980650001702013650001802030650001202048651001202060700001502072773008802087856008602175990002302261852000902284655001202293IND60092007820221118033820.0141103e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009200782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.buildenv.2011.11.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSinnott, Derek10aAir-tightness field data for dwellings in Ireland  ap. 269-275.  aAir-tightness plays a major role in both building energy performance and indoor environmental quality. Ireland’s National Methodology for the calculation of energy performance of buildings, the Building Energy Rating (BER) includes air permeability characteristics. From an international perspective, many air permeability surveys have been carried out. However, there is a paucity of knowledge relating to the existing housing stock in Ireland. This paper reports the air permeability test results of 28 houses built between 1944 and 2008 and at varying stages of retrofit. The results are compared to past studies and compliance with the existing standards. The effect of construction type, age, design details and retrofitting on air permeability is examined. While statistically small the dwellings are broadly representative of the many that will be retrofitted over the coming years. This paper addresses the lack of practical research in air-tightness for new and retrofitted dwellings in Ireland. The results challenge the perception that newer dwellings are more air-tight than older dwellings. The paper highlights design detailing, workmanship and building control deficits for the studied dwellings. The paper concludes that good design combined with high-quality workmanship, and rigorous control throughout construction is critical to ensure the delivery of a good product. The results can be complied with future research to establish a database for Ireland. The study will contribute to future research and facilitate building professionals to make informed decisions about how to achieve air-tightness standards in dwellings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abuildings 3acompliance 3adatabases 3aenergy 3aindoor environmental quality 3apermeability 3aprofessionals 3asurveys 3aIreland1 aDyer, Mark0 tBuilding and environment.g2012 May, v. 51 p.269-275dElsevier Ltdx0360-13237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2011.11.0163Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02313naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245010800159300001600267520117700283592002801460650002301488650001901511650002101530650001501551650000901566650001301575650001501588650001301603650001401616650001101630650000701641650003301648700001701681700002101698773012501719856007401844852000901918655001201927IND60656622320221120163421.0190814e20130131xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065662232DNAL7 a10.1039/c2ay26264a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDevlin, Louise10aNovel pH sensor based on anthraquinone–ferrocene modified free standing gold nanowire array electrode  ap. 880-884.  aA novel electrochemical pH sensor was fabricated through the use of an anthraquinone–ferrocene (AQ–Fc) complex based on a vertically aligned gold nanowire array electrode (AuNAE). The sensing capability was achieved by monitoring the variation in peak potential of the redox active/pH active anthraquinone moiety with respect to the redox active ferrocene moiety. The pH sensor, based on AQ–Fc/AuNAE, was characterised using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The difference in peak potential of the ferrocene and anthraquinone moieties was measured using square wave voltammetry (SWV) and was found to be linear over the range of pH 2–11, with a sensitivity of 1.38 V pH⁻¹ cm⁻² at 25 °C. The electrode was found to respond both in the presence and absence of oxygen, further expanding the potential applications to include de-oxygenated environments. The sensor showed a potential drift of 1.0–3.3% after three hours and 95% of the signal was retained after one week. Such single molecular complex (AQ–Fc) based pH sensors should provide easy manufacturing and long term stability when incorporated into the sensor designs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3aanthraquinones 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3agold 3amoieties 3amonitoring 3ananogold 3ananowires 3aoxygen 3apH 3ascanning electron microscopy1 aJamal, Mamun1 aRazeeb, Kafil M.0 tAnalytical methods.g2013 Jan. 31, v. 5, no. 4 p.880-884dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2ay26264a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02933naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100003100144245012900175300002000304520128000324592002801604650002901632650002601661650001301687650002401700650001301724650001501737650001301752650001701765650003901782650000901821650001601830650002401846650002201870650001901892650003301911650002401944653001801968653001801986653002302004653001702027653004902044700001902093700002202112700001402134700001802148700002102166773012702187856008002314852000902394655001202403IND60580700320221122002210.0170927e20170927xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058070032DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b106882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMazrad, Zihnil Adha Islamy10aDesign of Surface-Coatable NIR-Responsive Fluorescent Nanoparticles with PEI Passivation for Bacterial Detection and Killing  ap. 33317-33326.  aThe ability to quickly detect and kill bacteria is crucial in the realm of antibiotic resistance. In this study, we synthesized a detection probe consisting of polyethylenimine (PEI)-passivated polydopamine-based fluorescent carbon (FDA:PEI) nanoparticles, generating a cationic adhesive material for bacterial detection that is surface-coatable, photothermal, and antibacterial. The cationic FDA:PEI nanoparticles effectively bound to the anionic bacterial cell wall, resulting in a dramatic quenching effect visible in fluorescence spectra and confocal images. In this fluorescence on/off system, FDA:PEI nanoparticles showed similar bacterial detection abilities between aqueous- and solid-phase assays. Scanning electron microscopy clearly showed the attachment of FDA:PEI nanoparticles to the surface of bacteria, both in solution and as a coating on the surface of a polypropylene film. In addition to detection, this versatile material was found to have an antibacterial potential, via near-infrared irradiation to induce a heat release, killing bacteria by thermolysis. Thus, by exploiting the cationic and catechol moieties on the surface of polydopamine carbon dots, we developed a novel bacterial-detection platform that can be used in a broad range of conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteria 3acarbon quantum dots 3acatechol 3acell walls 3acoatings 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3aheat 3airradiation 3amicrobial detection 3apolyethyleneimine 3apolypropylenes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3athermal degradation 0aantibacterial 0aionic complex 0abacteria detection 0apolydopamine 0aphotothermal fluorescent carbon nanoparticle1 aChoi, Cheong A1 aKwŏn, Yŏng-min,1 aIn, Insik1 aLee, Kang Dae1 aPark, Sung Young0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2017 Sept. 27, v. 9, no. 38 p.33317-33326dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b106883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02393naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005500140245011700195300001800312500002000330520099300350592002801343650001401371650002001385650001801405650004101423650001701464650000901481650002301490650001501513650001401528650001701542650002001559650003201579650001101611650002301622700001401645700001801659700001801677700001601695773015301711856007401864852000901938655001201947IND60609021320221116230244.0180816e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060902132DNAL7 a10.1111/ijfs.137912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Ritian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1437-332110aEffects of different deodorising processes on the off‐odour compounds and gel properties of common carp surimi  ap. 2045-2053.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn order to improve the utilisation of the common carp (Cyprinus carpio), the effects of deodorising agents [NaCl, β‐CD, malic acid (MA) and hawthorn extract (HE)] on the volatile compounds of common carp mince and its surimi gel properties were investigated. In total, thirty‐two volatile compounds were identified, seven of which were considered the main compounds of off‐odour, using HS‐SPME‐GC‐MS and OVA analyses. HS‐SPME‐GC‐MS analysis showed that MA and HE removed 84.51% and 77.18% off‐odour compounds, respectively. Three relaxation components (T₂₁, T₂₂, T₂₃) were found in surimi, and their amounts were not affected by deodorising; however, the relaxation time of major component T₂₂ was significantly increased. Surimi deodorised by HE had the highest gel strength because of its increased breaking displacement; however, a slight decrease in whiteness was observed. Thus, appropriate levels of HE could improve the palatability of surimi.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrataegus 3aCyprinus carpio 3adeodorization 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agel strength 3agels 3aheadspace analysis 3amalic acid 3aoff odors 3apalatability 3asodium chloride 3asolid phase microextraction 3asurimi 3avolatile compounds1 aMeng, Ran1 aZhang, Huimin1 aYang, Xiaofei1 aWu, Zhaoxia0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2018 Sept., v. 53, no. 9 p.2045-2053dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl41365x0950-54237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ijfs.137913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02949naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245011700159300001800276520140500294592002801699650001601727650001701743650001801760650001901778650001801797650002701815650001301842650001101855650001401866650003101880653002801911653002701939653002301966653001701989700005802006700005802064700005702122700001502179700001402194700005702208773013902265856007802404852000902482655001202491IND60682634620221117181656.0200130e20200106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068263462DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b204172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yuewei10aStructure–Property Relationship of Stereolithography Resins Containing Polysiloxane Core–Shell Nanoparticles  ap. 4917-4926.  aStereolithography (SL) is an additive manufacturing technique for fabricating bulk and delicate objects layer by layer using UV-curable resin. However, epoxy-based photocurable resins used in SL printers are commonly brittle due to the high cross-linking density, thus restricting the widespread adoption of SL. In an effort to overcome this drawback, this paper details an approach of toughening the resulting workpieces by incorporating polysiloxane core–shell nanoparticles (SCSP) into an epoxy-based, photocurable formulation. This approach attempted to attain both thermal stabilities and transparency qualities comparable to that of resin without SCSP. This work systematically analyzed how the shell thickness of the SCSP impacted the final properties of the printed product. Introducing 5% w/w SCSP with a diameter of approximately 132 nm into the resin improved strain at break measured by tensile and flexural tests by 745.5 and 248.6%, respectively, and increased the fracture toughness by 166.3%. Owing to the advantages of toughness, thermal stabilities, transparency, and high accuracy of epoxy-based photocurable resin with SCSP, the 3D printing nanocomposite developed here is capable of preparing a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)-like workpiece with a commercial SL 3D printer. These results may expand the scope of the application of 3D printing in a wide variety of industries.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrittleness 3acrosslinking 3amanufacturing 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3apolymethylmethacrylate 3aprinters 3aresins 3asiloxanes 3athree-dimensional printing 0astereolithography resin 0acore−shell particles 0aepoxide toughening 0atransparency1 aZheng, Longhui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6879-14141 aPeng, Shuqiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0338-91571 aMiao, Jia-Tao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6454-067X1 aZhong, Jie1 aWu, Lixin1 aWeng, Zixiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8876-28640 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Jan. 06, v. 12, no. 4 p.4917-4926dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b204173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03352naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002000191245006000211300001800271506007600289520189300365592002802258506003702286650002002323650001902343650001702362650002202379650002202401650001302423650001302436650003602449650001602485650001302501650001302514650001502527650001602542700001802558700001502576700003002591700002102621700002302642773011002665856008602775852000902861655001202870IND60565317920221207081856.0170321e20170321xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056531792DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.6b037562doi7 aPMC53627472pmcid7 a282339972pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCristobal, Alba10aToward an Optimized Workflow for Middle-Down Proteomics  ap. 3318-3325.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics workflows can crudely be classified into two distinct regimes, targeting either relatively small peptides (i.e., 0.7 kDa < Mw < 3.0 kDa) or small to medium sized intact proteins (i.e., 10 kDa < Mw < 30 kDa), respectively, termed bottom-up and top-down proteomics. Recently, a niche has started to be explored covering the analysis of middle-range peptides (i.e., 3.0 kDa < Mw < 10 kDa), aptly termed middle-down proteomics. Although middle-down proteomics can follow, in principle, a modular workflow similar to that of bottom-up proteomics, we hypothesized that each of these modules would benefit from targeted optimization to improve its overall performance in the analysis of middle-range sized peptides. Hence, to generate middle-range sized peptides from cellular lysates, we explored the use of the proteases Asp-N and Glu-C and a nonenzymatic acid induced cleavage. To increase the depth of the proteome, a strong cation exchange (SCX) separation, carefully tuned to improve the separation of longer peptides, combined with reversed phase-liquid chromatography (RP-LC) using columns packed with material possessing a larger pore size, was used. Finally, after evaluating the combination of potentially beneficial MS settings, we also assessed the peptide fragmentation techniques, including higher-energy collision dissociation (HCD), electron-transfer dissociation (ETD), and electron-transfer combined with higher-energy collision dissociation (EThcD), for characterization of middle-range sized peptides. These combined improvements clearly improve the detection and sequence coverage of middle-range peptides and should guide researchers to explore further how middle-down proteomics may lead to an improved proteome coverage, beneficial for, among other things, the enhanced analysis of (co-occurring) post-translational modifications.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acation exchange 3achromatography 3adissociation 3aelectron transfer 3amass spectrometry 3apeptides 3aporosity 3apost-translational modification 3aproteinases 3aproteins 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3aresearchers1 aMarino, Fabio1 aPost, Harm1 avan den Toorn, Henk W.

MicroRNAs (miRs) has drawn much attention as a crucial regulator of autoimmune diseases. In this study, we demonstrated that miR-873 expression was significantly up-regulated in patients with SLE, and its expression was positively associated with the disease severity. CD4⁺ T cells, especially the Th17 subset, were found to be the major source of miR-873 expression. Using gain- and loss-of-function approaches, we further showed that miR-873 could facilitate the differentiation of CD4⁺ T cells into Th17 lineage. Moreover, forkhead box O1 (Foxo1), one member of the Foxo family, was identified as a novel target gene of miR-873, and Foxo1 has been known as an inhibitor of Th17 cell differentiation. Foxo1 was observed to be markedly decreased in PBMC of patients with SLE. Notably, in vivo lentivirus-mediated inhibition of miR-873 significantly alleviated the disease severity of spontaneous SLE in MRL/lpr mice, with down-regulated levels of autoantibodies, proteinuria, and IL-17A. Our data reveal a novel mechanism in which the elevated miR-873 in PBMC of SLE promotes Th17 cell differentiation through down-regulation of Foxo1. In vivo blockade of miR-873 may serve as a novel therapeutic approach in the treatment of SLE.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aautoantibodies 3acell differentiation 3adisease severity 3ainterleukin-17 3aloss-of-function mutation 3alupus erythematosus 3amaximum residue limits 3amice 3amicroRNA 3apathogenesis 3apatients 3aproteinuria 0amiR-873 0aSystemic lupus erythematosus 0aTh17 0aFoxo11 aLiu, Yifan1 aYuan, Min1 aXu, Liming1 aSun, Huanxia0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2017 Oct. 21, v. 492, no. 3 p.453-460dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.08.0753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03227naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245012000165300001600285500001100301500001900312520200500331592002802336650001502364650001902379650001202398650002202410650002402432650001002456650002202466650001302488650001502501650001502516650001602531650001902547651001002566773016102576856008302737852000902820655001202829IND60737296720221120224214.0220108e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073729672DNAL7 a10.1007/s42690-020-00389-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSagwa, C.

In Africa, honey is the most important hive product and is the main driver of producers venturing in beekeeping. Despite the enormous demand for honey both locally and internationally, production is still below potential and this is attributable to multiple challenges. They include lack of Apiculture policy, decline in the number of bee colonies, habitat destruction, and lack of data on bee population trends, low key conservation strategies and absence of structured marketing of honey and hive products. Data on pollinator populations and production trends in Kenya is scarce. The present work aims to critically examine the current state of honey bees and stingless bee production, marketing, conservation, diseases, recording and contribution to rural households in Kenya. Strategies to overcome the challenges and achieve more sustainable bee production are discussed. The number of bee colonies in Kenya has reduced by 16.76% whereas national average honey production per hive has increased from 3.77 kg/hive/year to 13.38 kg/hive for the last ten years. Seven species of stingless bees and three subspecies of Honey bees are recognised in Kenya. Forest fires, habitat destruction, pesticide use, and climate change are the major threats to these pollinators. Conservation programs in Africa do not target bees per se but forests. The establishment of bee conservation programs that involve rural communities is critical for the preservation of the genetic diversity of bee populations. Establishment of honey hubs for bulking and marketing honey and hive products is a viable option in marketing apicultural products and also an incentive for conservation. Enactment of apiculture policy and a paradigm shift in land use systems, climate change mitigation strategies, providing alternative livelihood options and involvement of rural communities are key in reversing the effects of low apiculture productivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapiculture 3aclimate change 3aforests 3agenetic variation 3ahabitat destruction 3ahoney 3aissues and policy 3aland use 3alivelihood 3apesticides 3apollinators 3astingless bees 3aKenya0 tInternational journal of tropical insect science.g2021 June, v. 41, no. 2 p.933-943dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:J000000093x1742-75927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42690-020-00389-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03354naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245011000166300001200276520191600288592002802204650002202232650002502254650003102279650002502310650002002335650001002355650003502365650001502400650001702415650001802432650001202450650001202462650001402474650001402488650001202502650001902514650002102533650001202554650000902566700001702575700001802592700001302610700001602623773012902639856008302768852000902851655001202860IND60758272220221119122509.0220517e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075827222DNAL7 a10.1186/s12906-021-03462-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Beixian10aArctiin suppresses H9N2 avian influenza virus-mediated inflammation via activation of Nrf2/HO-1 signaling  ap. 289.  aBACKGROUND: H9N2 avian influenza viruses (AIVs) infect avian and mammalian hosts and provide internal genes for new emerging highly pathogenic avian viruses that cause severe pneumonia with high mortality, for which few medications are available. Arctiin, a bioactive lignan glycoside, has been reported to possess multiple pharmacological properties. However, the effect of arctiin on H9N2 virus infection is unclear. In the current study, we analyzed the effect of arctiin on H9N2 virus infection and the underlying molecular mechanism in vitro. METHODS: The antiviral effect against H9N2 virus was determined by plaque reduction assay (PRA) and progeny virus reduction assay. We employed MTT assay, qRT-PCR, ELISA, immunofluorescence and Western blotting to better understand the anti-inflammatory effect and corresponding mechanism of arctiin on H9N2 virus-infected cells. RESULTS: The results showed that arctiin had antiviral activity against H9N2 virus. Arctiin treatment reduced H9N2 virus-triggered proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, and TNF-α. Moreover, arctiin significantly suppressed H9N2 virus-mediated expression of COX-2 and PGE₂. Furthermore, we found that arctiin inhibited H9N2 virus-mediated activation of RIG-I/JNK MAPK signaling. Interestingly, arctiin treatment obviously reversed H9N2 virus-induced reduction of Nrf2, increased the nuclear translocation of Nrf2, and upregulated Nrf2 signaling target genes (HO-1 and SOD2). Zinc protoporphyrin (Znpp)—an HO-1 inhibitor—weakened the inhibitory effect of arctiin on H9N2 virus-induced RIG-I/JNK MAPK and proinflammatory mediators. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these results suggested that the anti-inflammatory effects of arctiin on H9N2 virus infection may be due to the activation of Nrf2/HO-1 and blocked RIG-I/JNK MAPK signaling; thus, arctiin may be a promising agent for prevention and treatment of H9N2 virus infections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfluenza A virus 3aalternative medicine 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantiviral properties 3aavian influenza 3abirds 3afluorescent antibody technique 3aglycosides 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3alignans 3amammals 3amortality 3apneumonia 3aprogeny 3aprotoporphyrin 3atoxicity testing 3aviruses 3azinc1 aWang, Linxin1 aLiang, Yueyun1 aLi, Jing1 aPan, Xiping0 tBMC complementary medicine and therapies.g2021 Dec., v. 21, no. 1 p.289-289dBioMed CentralwJournal:27308x2662-76717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-021-03462-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03653naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245008700155300001600242520198300258592002802241650004402269650002202313650001502335650001802350650001102368650002202379650001702401650000902418650001202427650002202439650001802461650001102479650000702490650001302497650001402510650003302524650001102557650001302568650002302581650001502604650002502619650000902644653001902653653001502672653001202687653001302699653001602712700001302728700001702741700001502758700001602773700001902789700002102808773012802829856007302957852000903030655001203039IND60530555320221123042743.0160721e20150302xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053055532DNAL7 a10.1021/sc500659h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Xubiao10aRecovery of Lithium from Wastewater Using Development of Li Ion-Imprinted Polymers  ap. 460-467.  aRecycling lithium from waste lithium batteries is a growing problem, and new technologies are needed to recover the lithium. Currently, there is a lack of highly selective adsorption/ion exchange materials that can be used to recover lithium. We have developed a magnetic lithium ion-imprinted polymer (Fe₃O₄@SiO₂@IIP) by using novel crown ether. The Fe₃O₄@SiO₂@IIP has been synthesized by a surface imprinting technique using our newly synthesized 2-(allyloxy) methyl-12-crown-4 as a functional monomer. The Fe₃O₄@SiO₂@IIP was analyzed by Fourier infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The optimum pH for adsorption is 6. Fe₃O₄@SiO₂@IIP shows fast adsorption kinetics for lithium ions (10 min to reach complete equilibrium), and the adsorption process obeys an external mass transfer model. Homogeneous binding sites are proved by the Langmuir isotherm, and the maximum adsorption capacity is 0.586 mmol/g. Fe₃O₄@SiO₂@IIP has excellent selectivity for Li(I) because the selectivity separation factors of Li(I) with respect to Na(I), K(I), Cu(II), and Zn(II) are 50.88, 42.38, 22.5, and 22.2, respectively. The adsorption capacity of sorbent remained above 92% after five cycles. Fixed-bed column adsorption experiments indicate that the effective treatment volume was 140 bed volumes (BV) in the first run with a breakthrough of 10% of the inlet concentration for an inlet concentration of 0.5 mmol/L, and 110 BV was treated for the second run under identical conditions. We demonstrated that 89.8% of the lithium was recovered during bed regeneration using 0.5 mol/L HCl solution. Fe₃O₄@SiO₂@IIP also exhibited excellent removal efficiency for Li(I) in real wastewater, validating its great potential in advanced wastewater treatment. Accordingly, we have developed a new method for wastewater treatment that meets Li emission standards, and recovery of Li creates economic interest.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorption 3abinding sites 3acopper 3ahydrochloric acid 3aion exchange 3aions 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3amass transfer 3amodels 3apH 3apolymers 3arecycling 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asodium 3asorbents 3asorption isotherms 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3azinc 0aFe3O4@SiO2@IIP 0aWastewater 0aLithium 0aRecovery 0aCrown ether1 aGuo, Bin1 aLuo, Jinming1 aDeng, Fang1 aZhang, Siyu1 aLuo, Shenglian1 aCrittenden, John0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2015 Mar. 02, v. 3, no. 3 p.460-467dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/sc500659h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03439naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245008900171300001400260520182200274592002802096650001802124650001202142650001702154650001302171650001102184650001902195650002002214650003002234650001502264650001202279650002302291650001302314650002402327650001402351650002002365650002202385653001802407653001502425653001102440653001102451653001502462653001702477700003202494700001602526700002602542700006402568700002202632700002802654773011102682856008302793852000902876655001202885IND60602253820221118134250.0180711e20150601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060225382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ydbio.2015.02.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbou-Elhamd, Alaa10aKlhl31 attenuates β-catenin dependent Wnt signaling and regulates embryo myogenesis  ap. 61-71.  aKlhl31 is a member of the Kelch-like family in vertebrates, which are characterized by an amino-terminal broad complex tram-track, bric-a-brac/poxvirus and zinc finger (BTB/POZ) domain, carboxy-terminal Kelch repeats and a central linker region (Back domain). In developing somites Klhl31 is highly expressed in the myotome downstream of myogenic regulators (MRF), and it remains expressed in differentiated skeletal muscle. In vivo gain- and loss-of-function approaches in chick embryos reveal a role of Klhl31 in skeletal myogenesis. Targeted mis-expression of Klhl31 led to a reduced size of dermomyotome and myotome as indicated by detection of relevant myogenic markers, Pax3, Myf5, myogenin and myosin heavy chain (MF20). The knock-down of Klhl31 in developing somites, using antisense morpholinos (MO), led to an expansion of Pax3, Myf5, MyoD and myogenin expression domains and an increase in the number of mitotic cells in the dermomyotome and myotome. The mechanism underlying this phenotype was examined using complementary approaches, which show that Klhl31 interferes with β-catenin dependent Wnt signaling. Klhl31 reduced the Wnt-mediated activation of a luciferase reporter in cultured cells. Furthermore, Klhl31 attenuated secondary axis formation in Xenopus embryos in response to Wnt1 or β-catenin. Klhl31 mis-expression in the developing neural tube affected its dorso-ventral patterning and led to reduced dermomyotome and myotome size. Co-transfection of a Wnt3a expression vector with Klhl31 in somites or in the neural tube rescued the phenotype and restored the size of dermomyotome and myotome. Thus, Klhl31 is a novel modulator of canonical Wnt signaling, important for vertebrate myogenesis.

Recent work conducted in the North Sea highlighted the widespread presence of various saxitoxins in a range of benthic organisms, with the common sunstar (Crossaster papposus) demonstrating high concentrations of saxitoxins. In this study, an extensive sampling program was undertaken across multiple seas surrounding the UK, with 146 starfish and 5 brittlestars of multiple species analysed for STXs. All the common sunstars analysed (n > 70) contained quantifiable levels of STXs, with the total concentrations ranging from 99 to 11,245 µg STX eq/kg. The common sunstars were statistically different in terms of toxin loading to all the other starfish species tested. Two distinct toxic profiles were observed in sunstars, a decarbomylsaxitoxin (dcSTX)-dominant profile which encompassed samples from most of the UK coast and an STX and gonyautoxin2 (GTX2) profile from the North Yorkshire coast of England. Compartmentalisation studies demonstrated that the female gonads exhibited the highest toxin concentrations of all the individual organs tested, with concentrations >40,000 µg STX eq/kg in one sample. All the sunstars, male or female, exhibited the presence of STXs in the skin, digestive glands and gonads. This study highlights that the common sunstar ubiquitously contains STXs, independent of the geographical location around the UK and often at concentrations many times higher than the current regulatory limits for STXs in molluscs; therefore, the common sunstar should be considered toxic hereafter.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAsteroidea 3aBivalvia 3aCyanobacteria 3aOphiuroidea 3aanimal and human health 3acoasts 3afemales 3amales 3amammals 3aneurotoxicity 3aneurotoxins 3aphytoplankton 3asaxitoxins 3aEngland 3aNorth Sea1 aAlexander, Ryan P.1 aHatfield, Robert G.1 aLewis, Adam M.1 aCoates, Lewis N.1 aCollin, Tom 1 aTeixeira Alves, Mickael 1 aLee, Vanessa 1 aDaumich, Caroline 1 aHicks, Ruth 1 aWhite, Peter 1 aThomas, Krista M.1 aEllis, Jimc(Fisheries scientist)1 aTurner, Andrew D.0 tMarine drugs.g2021 Dec. 07, v. 19, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21403x1660-33977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md191206953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02919naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245018000159500001900339520137400358592002801732650001801760650001201778650002101790650002101811650003401832650001601866650000901882650003601891650002301927650002001950650001101970650001401981651001301995700002502008700003002033700002802063700002802091700002502119700001802144700002002162700003102182700001902213773012202232856007402354852000902428655001202437IND60735206820221116210703.0210423e20210401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073520682DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130411632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuzana Shahar,10aDevelopment and Relative Validity of a Semiquantitative Food Frequency Questionnaire to Estimate Dietary Intake among a Multi-Ethnic Population in the Malaysian Cohort Project  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMeasuring dietary intakes in a multi-ethnic and multicultural setting, such as Malaysia, remains a challenge due to its diversity. This study aims to develop and evaluate the relative validity of an interviewer-administered food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) in assessing the habitual dietary exposure of The Malaysian Cohort (TMC) participants. We developed a nutrient database (with 203 items) based on various food consumption tables, and 803 participants were involved in this study. The output of the FFQ was then validated against three-day 24-h dietary recalls (n = 64). We assessed the relative validity and its agreement using various methods, such as Spearman’s correlation, weighed Kappa, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and Bland–Altman analysis. Spearman’s correlation coefficient ranged from 0.24 (vitamin C) to 0.46 (carbohydrate), and almost all nutrients had correlation coefficients above 0.3, except for vitamin C and sodium. Intraclass correlation coefficients ranged from −0.01 (calcium) to 0.59 (carbohydrates), and weighted Kappa exceeded 0.4 for 50% of nutrients. In short, TMC’s FFQ appears to have good relative validity for the assessment of nutrient intake among its participants, as compared to the three-day 24-h dietary recalls. However, estimates for iron, vitamin A, and vitamin C should be interpreted with caution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aascorbic acid 3acalcium 3adietary exposure 3afood consumption 3afood frequency questionnaires 3afood intake 3airon 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3anutrient databanks 3anutrient intake 3asodium 3avitamin A 3aMalaysia1 aShahril, Mohd  Razif1 aAbdullah, Noraidatulakma 1 aBorhanuddin, Boekhtiar 1 aKamaruddin, Mohd  Arman1 aYusuf, Nurul  Ain Md1 aDauni, Andri 1 aRosli, Hanisah 1 aZainuddin, Nurzetty  Sofia1 aJamal, Rahman 0 tNutrients.g2021 Apr. 01, v. 13, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130411633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02355naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011800168300001600286520103500302592002801337650001501365650002501380650001301405650001501418650001701433650001701450650001401467650001901481653005401500653003501554653003201589653001901621653003701640700001901677700002001696700002301716773011201739856008501851852000901936655001201945IND60581154820221122162317.0180830e20160201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058115482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2015.10.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMenne, Daniel10aPrecise tuning of salt retention of backwashable polyelectrolyte multilayer hollow fiber nanofiltration membranes  ap. 396-405.  aWe report a new dynamic Layer-by-Layer (LbL) fabrication method to molecularly engineer the layer build-up within the lumen of hollow fiber membrane involving constant flux permeation rather than the conventional static adsorption method. During the constant flux coating, the polyelectrolyte concentration at the membrane surface rises continuously due to its rejection causing a convective adsorption process of the polyelectrolyte onto the membrane. The retained polyelectrolyte amount correlates with the flux and retention properties of the resulting polyelectrolyte multilayer membranes irrespective of time span or flux level used for the convection step. This fabrication method enables the synthesis of new desalination membranes with unprecedented precision on ion transport properties. Furthermore the resulting hollow fiber nanofiltration membrane is stable towards backwashing. The method can be applied to already existing membrane modules as a finishing step or as an in-operando inline regeneration or repair step.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aartificial membranes 3acoatings 3aconvection 3adesalination 3aelectrolytes 3afinishing 3ananofiltration 0aBackwashable nanofiltration hollow fiber membrane 0aConstant flux LbL modification 0aPolyelectrolyte multilayers 0aSalt retention 0aMembrane regeneration and repair1 aKamp, Johannes1 aErik Wong, John1 aWessling, Matthias0 tJournal of membrane science.g2016 Feb. 01, v. 499 p.396-405dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2015.10.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02709naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245010500156500001400261520139200275592002801667650001601695650001601711650001201727650001801739650001401757650001901771650000901790650001601799650001401815650001601829650001401845650001501859650001901874650001901893650001501912650002301927650001001950651001001960651002401970700001601994700001702010773012902027856007402156852000902230655001202239IND60715391020221116225356.0201026e20201009xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071539102DNAL7 a10.3390/rs122032772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Yang 10aSatellite Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence Reveals Heat Stress Impacts on Wheat Yield in India  aNAL-light  aWith continued global warming, the frequency and severity of heat wave events increased over the past decades, threatening both regional and global food security in the future. There are growing interests to study the impacts of drought on crop. However, studies on the impacts of heat stress on crop photosynthesis and yield are still lacking. To fill this knowledge gap, we used both statistical models and satellite solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) data to assess the impacts of heat stress on wheat yield in a major wheat growing region, the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP), India. The statistical model showed that the relationships between different accumulated degree days (ADD) and reported wheat yield were significantly negative. The results confirmed that heat stress affected wheat yield across this region. Building on such information, satellite SIF observations were used to further explore the physiological basis of heat stress impacts on wheat yield. Our results showed that SIF had strong negative correlations with ADDs and was capable of monitoring heat stress. The SIF results also indicated that heat stress caused yield loss by directly impacting the photosynthetic capacity in wheat. Overall, our findings demonstrated that SIF as an effective proxy for photosynthetic activity would improve our understanding of the impacts of heat stress on wheat yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorophyll 3acorrelation 3adrought 3afood security 3afrequency 3aglobal warming 3aheat 3aheat stress 3aheat sums 3ainformation 3aknowledge 3amonitoring 3aphotosynthesis 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3astatistical models 3awheat 3aIndia 3aIndo-Gangetic Plain1 aWang, Jing 1 aWang, Lixin 0 tRemote Sensing.g2020 Oct. 09, v. 12, no. 20dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs122032773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02800naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002300155245009900178300001600277520121100293592002801504650000801532650001501540650001601555650001701571650002601588650002601614650001901640650001901659650001001678650002301688650001401711650001701725650003401742650001301776650001501789650002201804650001501826653002901841653001901870653003201889700003201921700002301953700006601976700002002042773013302062856009002195852000902285655001202294IND60560500520221120223029.0180830e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056050052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2016.04.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSubirats, Jéssica10aMetagenomic analysis reveals that bacteriophages are reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes  ap. 163-167.  aA metagenomics approach was applied to explore the presence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in bacteriophages from hospital wastewater. Metagenomic analysis showed that most phage sequences affiliated to the order Caudovirales, comprising the tailed phage families Podoviridae, Siphoviridae and Myoviridae. Moreover, the relative abundance of ARGs in the phage DNA fraction (0.26%) was higher than in the bacterial DNA fraction (0.18%). These differences were particularly evident for genes encoding ATP-binding cassette (ABC) and resistance–nodulation–cell division (RND) proteins, phosphotransferases, β-lactamases and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance. Analysis of assembled contigs also revealed that blaOXA-10, blaOXA-58 and blaOXA-24 genes belonging to class D β-lactamases as well as a novel blaTEM (98.9% sequence similarity to the blaTEM-1 gene) belonging to class A β-lactamases were detected in a higher proportion in phage DNA. Although preliminary, these findings corroborate the role of bacteriophages as reservoirs of resistance genes and thus highlight the necessity to include them in future studies on the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance in the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aMyoviridae 3aPodoviridae 3aSiphoviridae 3aanti-infective agents 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteriophages 3abeta-lactamase 3agenes 3agenetic resistance 3ahospitals 3ametagenomics 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3aproteins 3aquinolones 3asequence homology 3awastewater 0aHorizontal gene transfer 0aBacteriophages 0aAntibiotic resistance genes1 aSànchez-Melsió, Alexandre1 aBorrego, Carles M.1 aBalcázar, José Luis,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6866-93471 aSimonet, Pascal0 tInternational journal of antimicrobial agents.g2016 Aug., v. 48, no. 2 p.163-167dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12451x0924-85797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2016.04.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03020naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245018700154500002000341520142500361592002801786596007901814596004701893596004701940596004701987650001502034650001702049650002402066650001002090650002202100650001002122650001702132650001502149650001702164650001402181650001702195650001602212650001402228651001602242700002802258700005902286773013402345856007402479852000902553655001202562IND60758272520221119122808.0211128e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075827252DNAL7 a10.1111/jeu.128642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMore, Kira10aDescription of the marine predator Sericomyxa perlucida gen. et sp. nov., a cultivated representative of the deepest branching lineage of vampyrellid amoebae (Vampyrellida, Rhizaria)  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe vampyrellids (Vampyrellida, Rhizaria) are naked amoebae of considerable genetic diversity. Three families have been well‐defined (Vampyrellidae, Leptophryidae, and Placopodidae), but most vampyrellid lineages detected by environmental sequencing are poorly known or completely uncharacterized. In the brackish sediment of Lake Bras D’Or, Nova Scotia, Canada, we discovered an amoeba with a vampyrellid‐like life history that was morphologically dissimilar from previously known vampyrellid taxa. We established a culture of this amoeba, studied its feeding behavior and prey range specificity, and characterized it with molecular phylogenetic methods and light and electron microscopy. The amoeba was a generalist predator (i.e. eukaryotroph), devouring a range of marine microalgae, with a strong affinity for some benthic diatoms and Chroomonas. Interestingly, the amoeba varied its feeding strategy depending on the prey species. Small diatoms were engulfed whole, while larger species were fed on through extraction with an invading pseudopodium. The SSU rRNA gene phylogenies robustly placed the amoeba in the most basal, poorly described lineage (“clade C”) of the Vampyrellida. Based on the phylogenetic position and the distinct morphology of the studied amoeba, we here describe it as Sericomyxa perlucida gen. et sp. nov., and establish the new vampyrellid family Sericomyxidae for “clade C.”  aPublisher supplied data  a298366‐2014cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada  a283693520cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft  a417585753cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft  a447190101cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft 3aChroomonas 3aVampyrellida 3aelectron microscopy 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3alakes 3alife history 3amicroalgae 3amicrobiology 3aphylogeny 3aprey species 3apseudopodia 3asediments 3aNova Scotia1 aSimpson, Alastair G.

Here, we investigated the role of Sirtuin 7 (Sirt7) in the regulation of rDNA chromatin structure, rDNA repeat stability and nucleolar organization. We found that Sirt7 mediates heterochromatin formation at rRNA genes through recruitment of DNA methyltransferase 1 and another member of the sirtuin family, Sirt1. Lack of Sirt7 leads to nucleolar fragmentation associated with hypomethylation of rDNA and hyperacetylation of histones at rDNA loci resulting in rDNA and genomic instability. Our findings suggest a novel role of Sirt7 in preventing cellular transformation by mediating maintenance of rDNA repeats and nucleolar integrity.  aPublisher supplied data 3agenes 3agenomics 3aheterochromatin 3ahistones 3ahomologous recombination 3aloci 3amethyltransferases 3aribosomal DNA 3aribosomal RNA 0aSirt7 0aSirt1 0aDNMT1 0arDNA repeats 0aHeterochromatin 0aNucleolus1 aHoelper, Soraya1 aKrueger, Marcus1 aBraun, Thomas1 aBober, Eva0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2017 Oct. 21, v. 492, no. 3 p.434-440dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.08.0813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01985naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100002000147245012200167300001600289520084900305592002801154650001201182650001501194650001201209650001401221650001401235650001601249650001601265650001001281650001401291650001201305651001001317700001601327700001701343700001201360700001501372700001701387773007901404856008301483852000901566655001201575IND4469252720221118063439.0141111e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446925272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.flora.2012.02.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPang, Shengmiao10aFloral morphology and reproductive biology of Dendrobium jiajiangense (Orchidaceae) in Mt.

Importantly, A. parvula uses D. jiajiangense flowers as shelter both during rainy weather and at night during sunny weather. This significantly increase the pollination success of D. jiajiangens. D. jiajiangense is self-compatible but pollinator-dependent for fruit set.

In this study a dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction (DLLME) technique was applied for extraction and pre-concentration of pesticide residues from QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe) extracts. The DLLME method was carried out using carbon tetrachloride as the extraction solvent and QuEChERS extract as the dispersive solvent. The main parameters affecting DLLME efficiency including the type and volume of extraction solvent and the volume of dispersive solvent and salt addition were optimized for the proposed method. To validate this developed method, recovery studies were carried out at two concentration levels, yielding mean recovery rates in the range of 86 to 104% with relative standard deviations below 12%. Good linearity and precision, with relative standard deviations generally below 10%, were obtained for all 19 pesticides. The method limits of detection (LOD) between 3.4 and 10.4 μg kg⁻¹ and method limits of quantification (LOQ) in the range of 11.2–34.5 μg kg⁻¹ were obtained for the proposed method. Recovery rates and method LODs and LOQs of the validated method were compared with those of the routine QuEChERS method and results indicated the efficiency of the proposed method for routine analysis of 19 pesticide residues in cucumber and tomato.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon tetrachloride 3acucumbers 3adetection limit 3agreenhouses 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aliquid-phase microextraction 3amultiresidue analysis 3apesticide residues 3apesticides 3asolvents 3astandard deviation 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atomatoes1 aRamezani, Mohammad Kazem1 aWaqif-Husain, Syed0 tAnalytical methods.g2013 Feb. 14, v. 5, no. 5 p.1192-1198dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2ay26287h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03191naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245018200170520175000352592002802102650002202130650002002152650001602172650001902188650001102207650001102218650001002229650001202239650001602251650001502267650001502282650001302297650001302310651001002323651001002333653001402343653001502357653002102372653001202393653001402405653001102419653001502430700001802445700001902463773011902482856008702601852000902688655001202697IND60732710520221120140546.0211123e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073271052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.revpalbo.2021.1044252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Yeming12aA permineralized thamnopteroid rhizome (Osmundaceae) with coprolites from the Permian of Heilongjiang Province, Northeast China: The most primitive record of Osmundaceae in Asia  aThe earliest and most primitive fossil trunk or rhizome taxa of the family Osmundaceae, as important evidence for understanding its early evolutionary history, have so far all come from the Permian of the Ural Mountains region of European Russia. In this study, a thamnopteroid rhizome fossil, one of the most primitive members of the Osmundaceae, is reported from the Permian of Heilongjiang Province, Northeast China, based on a permineralized rhizome fragment consisting of the cortex and petiole bases with coprolites. This is the first report of a thamnopteroid rhizome found outside the Ural Mountains region since the previous thamnopteroid rhizome was described more than 90 years ago. Still, all known thamnopteroid trunks and rhizomes, i.e., from the Ural Mountains region and Heilongjiang Province, occurred within the realm of the Angara flora during the Permian. The fossil records suggest that the Angaraland is perhaps the cradle for the early diversification of the Osmundaceae (first family of Osmundales), while the Cathaysia is an important region for the early diversification of the Guaireaceae (another family of Osmundales). The fossil studied herein is the most primitive and earliest record of the Osmundaceae in Asia. For the Mesozoic of Asia, four genera of trunks and rhizomes of Osmundaceae have been found in the Jurassic and Cretaceous of Northeast China and the Cretaceous of the Rajmahal Hills of India. The new fossil serves as crucial evidence for the diversification of the Osmundaceae in Asia from the Paleozoic. The occurrence of coprolites in the parenchyma of the petiole base indicates that Osmundaceae rhizomes were favorable hosts for arthropods and provided a suitable environment for their parasitism  aPublisher supplied data 3aCretaceous period 3aJurassic period 3aOsmundaceae 3aPermian period 3aRussia 3acortex 3aflora 3afossils 3apaleobotany 3apalynology 3aparasitism 3apetioles 3arhizomes 3aChina 3aIndia 0aEvolution 0aOsmundales 0aThamnopteroideae 0aAnatomy 0aPaleozoic 0aAngara 0aCoprolites1 aYang, Xiaonan1 aLiu, Fengxiang0 tReview of palaeobotany and palynology.g2021 July, v. 290 p.104425-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11736x0034-66677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.revpalbo.2021.1044253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02666naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006400148245014200212300001800354520140600372592002801778596005601806650002701862650002301889650001101912650001901923650001101942650001201953650002001965650001001985650001401995651001002009700003002019773016302049856008302212852000902295655001202304IND60737297220221121114539.0220108e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073729722DNAL7 a10.1007/s42690-020-00387-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSahayaraj, Kitherian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0127-863214aThe predation behavior and the prey size preferences of Antilochus coquebertii (Pyrrhocoridae) against Dysdercus koenigii (Pyrrhocoridae)  ap. 1763-1769.  aThe pest status of the red cotton bug, Dysdercus koenigii (Fab.) has been changing due to the climatic changes, and appearances of new natural enemies in cotton agro-ecosystems. As a specialized predator of Dysdercus bugs, Antilochus coquebertii (Fab.) has been known, and is abundant now in cotton fields in Tamil Nadu, India. Therefore we investigated its predatory behavior and the preference against prey developmental stage in order to evaluate its performance as a natural enemy against D. koenigii. The predatory behavior of A. coquevertii adults consisted of seven feeding acts; i.e., arousal, approaching, capturing, rostral probing, paralyzing, feeding and post-feeding. Adult males were quicker than females in predatory acts including aroused, approached, captured, probed the prey by rostrum, paralyzed, and post-predatory behaviors. The predators exhibited an active hunting behavior, in which they seem to have used both olfactory and visual stimuli for orientation to the prey. The results of the prey-choice test exhibited that the second, third, fourth and fifth nymphal-stage and adult predator has a reproductive-stage preference to the second, third, fourth and fifth nymphal-stage and adult prey, respectively. The results implies that the synchronization between the occurrence of the prey and the predator could have significance for the control of the pest using the predator.  aPublisher supplied data  aMRDF/01/33/P/07cMinistry of Environment and Forest 3aAntilochus coquebertii 3aDysdercus koenigii 3aadults 3aagroecosystems 3acotton 3ainsects 3anatural enemies 3apests 3apredation 3aIndia1 aFernandez, Sandhyav Merin0 tInternational journal of tropical insect science.g2021 June, v. 41, no. 2 p.1763-1769dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:J000000093x1742-75927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42690-020-00387-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03086naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010600166300001000272520169300282592002801975596006202003596005702065650002202122650001602144650001802160650001002178650001202188650001602200650001502216650001102231650002102242650002002263650001502283650001902298650001102317650000902328650001902337700002002356700001702376700001902393773012502412856008202537852000902619655001202628IND60586657320221118164713.0200424e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058665732DNAL7 a10.1007/s00027-017-0552-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMori, Terutaka10aFlow-velocity-dependent effects of turbid water on periphyton structure and function in flowing water  ap. 6.  aLand-use change, human activities, and dam management supply highly turbid water with high flow velocity; however, little is known about its effect on river ecosystems. Here, we studied the effects of flow velocity and suspended silt concentration on periphyton structure and function using experimental channels. The effects of flow velocity on algal biomass in the periphyton community depended on the suspended silt concentration; flow velocity decreased chlorophyll a in low concentrations of suspended silt (clear water), but not in moderate or high concentrations (turbid water). Filamentous cyanobacteria density was significantly influenced by flow velocity, whereas densities of non-filamentous cyanobacteria, green algae, and diatoms were not. Thus, flushing effects on attached algae, especially filamentous cyanobacteria, were exerted in clear but not in turbid waters, perhaps because algal assemblages were resistant to water current through the binding of large amounts of silt by extracellular polymeric substances. Inorganic matter and its ratio in the periphyton community decreased with flow velocity, but increased with suspended silt concentration, irrespective of flow velocity. Periphyton function, assessed by maximum photosynthesis rates and light-use efficiency, was influenced by flow velocity and suspended silt concentration through changes in periphyton structure. Flood events would be expected to refresh the periphyton community by removing senescent algae and deposited fine particles. However, we demonstrated that algae and silt in the periphyton community exposed to turbid waters with human-induced silt may accumulate, irrespective of flow velocity.  aPublisher supplied data  a24710039cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science (JP)  a14J09569cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science 3aBacillariophyceae 3aChlorophyta 3aCyanobacteria 3aalgae 3abiomass 3achlorophyll 3aecosystems 3ahumans 3ainorganic matter 3aland use change 3aperiphyton 3aphotosynthesis 3arivers 3asilt 3awater currents1 aMiyagawa, Yukio1 aOnoda, Yukio1 aKayaba, Yuichi0 tAquatic sciences.g2018 Jan., v. 80, no. 1 p.6-6dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:J000000051x1015-16217nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-017-0552-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04030naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245012200174520275700296592002803053650001803081650001103099650001603110650001603126650000903142650001503151650001403166651001103180653002803191653002503219653001903244653001703263653003003280700002303310700002403333700001803357700002003375700001803395773010103413856008503514852000903599655001203608IND60732710620221120140535.0210506e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073271062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sedgeo.2021.1059012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLai, Larry Syu-Heng10aPolygenetic mélange in the retrowedge foredeep of an active arc-continent collision, Coastal Range of eastern Taiwan  aThe Plio-Pleistocene Lichi Mélange in the Coastal Range of eastern Taiwan offers an excellent opportunity to study processes of mélange development at the continent-ocean interface of an active arc-continent collision. This paper presents new results of detailed geologic mapping, lithofacies analysis, magneto-biostratigraphy, paleocurrent, and paleoslope analyses in the southern Coastal Range to investigate the origins and significance of this mélange. The results show that the Lichi Mélange consists of mass-transport deposits including well-stratified block-in-matrix beds (olistostromes), extra-formational blocks (olistoliths), and broken formation with abundant soft-sediment deformation features that transition laterally into distal mega-slump beds and pebbly mudstones (subaqueous debrites). Abundant observations of depositional contacts and interbedding of mélange with contemporary (ca. 4–1 Ma) flysch units of the Fanshuliao and Paliwan formations confirm their sedimentary origin. Compacted sedimentological shear fabrics in olistostromal facies are broadly parallel to internal stratification and bedding, and are readily distinguishable from cross-cutting brittle fault zones related to post ~1 Ma west-vergent thrust faults. Paleoslope and paleocurrent analyses record down-slope gravity-driven transport toward the east and southeast.The data provide evidence for a polygenetic origin of the Lichi Mélange, in which sedimentary mass-wasting deposits are overprinted by younger tectonic shear zones. Slide blocks, conglomerate clasts, and detrital sand were all derived from an eroding source in the east-vergent eastern retrowedge of the Taiwan collisional orogen. The source area included tectonically accreted fragments of the two converging plates that represent shallow-crustal equivalents of the Miocene Yuli Belt and Eastern Slates exposed in the modern Central Range. Reconstructed stratigraphic panels record eastward progradation of olistostromal facies over distal basinal flysch deposits, which we infer resulted from eastward (oceanward) migration of a steep submarine slope at the leading edge of the retrowedge orogenic front. Thus, the Coastal Range basin evolved as a migrating retro-foredeep basin that formed on top of older, pre-collisional volcanic arc and forearc crust. These results demonstrate a unique type of sedimentary basin that is formed and then rapidly inverted at a convergent continent-ocean interface during the transition from intra-oceanic subduction to arc-continent collision. This revised history of the Lichi Mélange provides a new perspective on the dynamics of rapid crustal mixing and tectonic recycling at the convergent suture of an active arc-continent collision system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMiocene epoch 3abasins 3abrittleness 3adeformation 3asand 3asubduction 3atectonics 3aTaiwan 0aArc-continent collision 0aTaiwan Coastal Range 0aLichi Mélange 0aOlistostrome 0aRetrowedge foredeep basin1 aDorsey, Rebecca J.1 aHorng, Chorng-Shern1 aChi, Wen-Rong1 aShea, Kai-Shuan1 aYen, Jiun-Yee0 tSedimentary geology.g2021 June, v. 418 p.105901-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11737x0037-07387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sedgeo.2021.1059013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02593naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245016600159300001800325500002000343520124900363592002801612650002301640650001701663650003901680650001001719650002701729650001101756650001501767650001701782650002101799650001101820650002001831650001001851650001501861700005301876700001801929773015301947856007402100852000902174655001202183IND60609021820221116233420.0180816e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060902182DNAL7 a10.1111/ijfs.138022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Xiao‐Na10aImpact of arabinoxylan with different molecular weight on the thermo‐mechanical, rheological, water mobility and microstructural characteristics of wheat dough  ap. 2150-2158.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe aim of this study was to investigate the effects of arabinoxylan with different molecular weight on the wheat dough thermo‐mechanical, rheological, microstructural and water mobility properties. Arabinoxylan was extracted from wheat bran and hydrolysed by endo‐1,4‐β‐xylanase (EC 3.2.1.8 from Trichoderma reesei, 10 000 U g⁻¹) for 2 min (AXM) and 10 min (AXL), respectively. The addition of hydrolysed arabinoxylan AXL increased the stability time, decreased the setback value of wheat dough and enhanced the values of storage modulus (G′) and loss modulus (G″), while unhydrolysed arabinoxylan (AXH) reduced these values. Meanwhile, unhydrolysed arabinoxylan increased T₂ relaxation time while hydrolysed arabinoxylan AXL decreased T₂₁ and T₂₂. Confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) results showed that the addition of hydrolysed arabinoxylan AXL promoted the formation of a more compact and continuous protein network in wheat dough. These results revealed that compared with high molecular weight arabinoxylan, hydrolysed arabinoxylan could improve the rheological properties and processing properties of wheat dough by enhancing the interaction among water molecules, starch and gluten in wheat dough.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrichoderma reesei 3aarabinoxylan 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3adough 3aendo-1,4-beta-xylanase 3agluten 3ahydrolysis 3aloss modulus 3amolecular weight 3astarch 3astorage modulus 3awheat 3awheat bran1 aYang, Sha1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0674-37991 aZhu, Ke‐Xue0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2018 Sept., v. 53, no. 9 p.2150-2158dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl41365x0950-54237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ijfs.138023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03465naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094024002200137024001900159040001800178100001900196245009700215300001600312506007600328520171200404592002802116506003702144650002602181650001302207650002402220650002802244650001302272650001002285650001302295650001502308650001302323650002602336650001702362651001702379653000802396653003102404653002302435653003902458653003002497653003202527700002102559700001702580700002102597700002302618700001902641700001902660773013302679856009002812852000902902655001202911IND60560500820221207114409.0180830e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056050082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2016.04.0302doi7 aPMC49793172pmcid7 a273452682pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCourt, Richard10aRandom lopinavir concentrations predict resistance on lopinavir-based antiretroviral therapy  ap. 158-162.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aConsidering that most patients who experience virological failure (VF) on lopinavir-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) fail due to poor adherence rather than resistance, an objective adherence measure could limit costs by rationalising the use of genotype antiretroviral resistance testing (GART) in countries with access to third-line ART. A cross-sectional study was conducted in a resource-limited setting at two large clinics in Kwazulu-Natal, South Africa, in patients experiencing VF (HIV-RNA > 1000 copies/mL) on lopinavir-based ART who had undergone GART. Associations between major protease inhibitor (PI) resistance mutations and random plasma lopinavir concentrations were explored. A total of 134 patients, including 31 children, were included in the analysis. The prevalence of patients with major PI resistance mutations was 20.9% (n = 28). A random lopinavir concentration above the recommended minimum trough of 1 µg/mL [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 5.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.04–16.50; P = 0.001] and male sex (aOR = 3.19, 95% CI 1.22–8.33; P = 0.018) were predictive of the presence of at least one major PI resistance mutation. Random lopinavir concentrations of <1 µg/mL had a negative predictive value of 91% for major PI resistance mutations. Random lopinavir concentrations are strongly associated with the presence of major PI resistance mutations. Access to costly GART in patients experiencing VF on second-line ART could be restricted to patients with lopinavir concentrations above the recommended minimum trough of 1 µg/mL or, in areas where GART is unavailable, could be used as a criterion to empirically switch to third-line ART.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantiretroviral agents 3achildren 3aconfidence interval 3across-sectional studies 3agenotype 3amales 3amutation 3aodds ratio 3apatients 3aproteinase inhibitors 3atherapeutics 3aSouth Africa 0aHIV 0aLopinavir pharmacokinetics 0aProtease inhibitor 0aSecond-line antiretroviral therapy 0aAntiretroviral resistance 0aTherapeutic drug monitoring1 aGordon, Michelle1 aCohen, Karen1 aStewart, Annemie1 aGosnell, Bernadett1 aWiesner, Lubbe1 aMaartens, Gary0 tInternational journal of antimicrobial agents.g2016 Aug., v. 48, no. 2 p.158-162dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12451x0924-85797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2016.04.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02212naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245012400158520108400282592002801366650001301394650001401407650001301421650000901434650001701443650001101460650001401471700001401485700001301499700001901512700001501531700001501546700001901561700001901580700001601599773012701615856007501742852000901817655001201826IND60760744320221117024853.0211223e20211124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076074432DNAL7 a10.3390/md191206552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Shuilin 10aACE Inhibitory Peptide from Skin Collagen Hydrolysate of Takifugu bimaculatus as Potential for Protecting HUVECs Injury  aAngiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) is a crucial enzyme or receptor that catalyzes the generation of potent vasopressor angiotensin II (Ang II). ACE inhibitory peptides from fish showed effective ACE inhibitory activity. In this study, we reported an ACE inhibitory peptide from Takifugu bimaculatus (T. bimaculatus), which was obtained by molecular docking with acid-soluble collagen (ASC) hydrolysate of T. bimaculatus. The antihypertensive effects and potential mechanism were conducted using Ang-II-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) as a model. The results showed that FNLRMQ alleviated the viability and facilitated apoptosis of Ang-II-induced HUVECs. Further research suggested that FNLRMQ may protect Ang-II-induced endothelial injury by regulating Nrf2/HO-1 and PI3K/Akt/eNOS signaling pathways. This study, herein, reveals that collagen peptide FNLRMQ could be used as a potential candidate compound for antihypertensive treatment, and could provide scientific evidence for the high-value utilization of marine resources including T. bimaculatus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTakifugu 3aapoptosis 3acollagen 3afish 3ahydrolysates 3amodels 3aviability1 aPan, Nan 1 aXu, Min 1 aSu, Yongchang 1 aQiao, Kun 1 aChen, Bei 1 aZheng, Bingde 1 aXiao, Meitian 1 aLiu, Zhiyu 0 tMarine drugs.g2021 Nov. 24, v. 19, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21403x1660-33977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md191206553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02760naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245020300210300002000413500001100433520158200444592002802026650002502054650001702079650002102096650001902117650001402136650001302150650001102163650001302174773015502187856008302342852000902425655001202434IND60768625620221120082959.0220303e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076862562DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-18419-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNowicka, Beatrycze1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2696-543910aHeavy metal–induced stress in eukaryotic algae—mechanisms of heavy metal toxicity and tolerance with particular emphasis on oxidative stress in exposed cells and the role of antioxidant response  ap. 16860-16911.  aReview  aHeavy metals is a collective term describing metals and metalloids with a density higher than 5 g/cm³. Some of them are essential micronutrients; others do not play a positive role in living organisms. Increased anthropogenic emissions of heavy metal ions pose a serious threat to water and land ecosystems. The mechanism of heavy metal toxicity predominantly depends on (1) their high affinity to thiol groups, (2) spatial similarity to biochemical functional groups, (3) competition with essential metal cations, (4) and induction of oxidative stress. The antioxidant response is therefore crucial for providing tolerance to heavy metal-induced stress. This review aims to summarize the knowledge of heavy metal toxicity, oxidative stress and antioxidant response in eukaryotic algae. Types of ROS, their formation sites in photosynthetic cells, and the damage they cause to the cellular components are described at the beginning. Furthermore, heavy metals are characterized in more detail, including their chemical properties, roles they play in living cells, sources of contamination, biochemical mechanisms of toxicity, and stress symptoms. The following subchapters contain the description of low-molecular-weight antioxidants and ROS-detoxifying enzymes, their properties, cellular localization, and the occurrence in algae belonging to different clades, as well as the summary of the results of the experiments concerning antioxidant response in heavy metal-treated eukaryotic algae. Other mechanisms providing tolerance to metal ions are briefly outlined at the end.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aheavy metals 3aoxidative stress 3aphotosynthesis 3apollution 3aresearch 3athiols 3atoxicity0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Mar., v. 29, no. 12 p.16860-16911dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-18419-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02492naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002400155245009400179300001400273520129900287592002801586650003201614650000801646650000801654650003201662650001701694650000901711650000901720650001101729650001101740650001801751650001801769650005201787650001201839650001201851700001701863700002301880773008101903856008901984852000902073655001202082IND60090261120221121025946.0141102e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009026112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biologicals.2010.11.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshikawa, Rokusuke10aContamination of infectious RD-114 virus in vaccines produced using non-feline cell lines  ap. 33-37.  aAll domestic cats have a replication-competent endogenous retrovirus, termed RD-114 virus, in their genome and several feline cell lines produce RD-114 viruses. Recently, we found that a portion of live attenuated feline and canine vaccines produced using feline cell lines was contaminated with infectious RD-114 viruses. In this study, we expanded our survey and examined canine vaccines produced using ‘non-feline’ cell lines. Consequently, we found two vaccines containing RD-114 viral RNA by reverse transcriptase (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real-time RT-PCR. We also confirmed the presence of infectious RD-114 virus in the vaccines by the LacZ marker rescue assay and PCR to detect proviral DNA in TE671 cells (human rhabdomyosarcoma cells) inoculated with the vaccines. It is impossible to investigate the definitive cause of contamination with RD-114 virus; however, we suspect that a seed canine parvovirus type 2 was contaminated with RD-114 virus, because many canine parvoviruses have been isolated and attenuated using feline cell lines. To exclude RD-114 virus from live attenuated vaccines, we must pay attention to the contamination of seed viruses with RD-114 virus in addition to avoiding feline cell lines producing RD-114 virus when manufacturing vaccines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarnivore protoparvovirus 1 3aDNA 3aRNA 3aRNA-directed DNA polymerase 3aRetroviridae 3acats 3adogs 3agenome 3ahumans 3alive vaccines 3amanufacturing 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asurveys 3aviruses1 aSatō, Eiji,1 aMiyazawa, Takayuki0 tBiologicals.g2011 Jan., v. 39, no. 1 p.33-37dElsevier Ltdx1045-10567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biologicals.2010.11.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02879naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010600166300001600272520137000288592002801658650001501686650001701701650001701718650001501735650001301750650001001763650001101773650001801784650001201802650002201814650002401836650002601860650002901886653000901915653003101924653002901955653001701984653002602001700001502027700001702042700001402059700001602073700005802089773014602147856008302293852000902376655001202385IND60581382020221122032733.0181002e20171021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058138202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.08.0832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zonggui10aE3 ubiquitin ligase DTX4 is required for adipogenic differentiation in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes cell line  ap. 419-424.  aDeltex4 (DTX4) is a member of the Deltex family of proteins. To date several lines of evidences suggest that Deltex family of proteins is closely linked to cell development and cell differentiation. However, little is known about the role of DTX4 in adipogenic differentiation. In this study, we assessed the impact of DTX4 on adipogenic differentiation in vitro, we found that DTX4 protein expression gradually increased during adipogenic differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes cell line. While DTX4 stable knockdown by recombinant shRNA lentivirus (sh-DTX4) notably reduced the number of lipid droplets and down-regulated the expression of adipogenic transcription factors C/EBPα and PPARγ and adipogenic markers gene FABP4 and Adipsin. Besides, cell numbers and incorporation of 5-Ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) into cells were significantly decreased during mitotic clonal expansion (MCE) in sh-DTX4 cells postinduction. Furthermore, compared to recombinant shRNA lentivirus control group (sh-CON), the mRNA levels of Wnt signaling genes such as Wnt6, Wnt10b and β-catenin, were obviously elevated in sh-DTX4 group at day 3 of postinduction. Taken together, our results indicate that DTX4 stable knockdown inhibits adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 cells through inhibiting C/EBPα and PPARγ, arresting mitotic clonal expansion and regulating Wnt signaling pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLentivirus 3aadipogenesis 3abeta catenin 3acell lines 3adroplets 3agenes 3alipids 3amessenger RNA 3amitosis 3aprotein synthesis 3asignal transduction 3atranscription factors 3aubiquitin-protein ligase 0aDTX4 0aAdipogenic differentiation 0aMitotic clonal expansion 0a3T3-L1 cells 0aWnt signaling pathway1 aDai, Zhong1 aPan, Yaqiong1 aWu, Simin1 aLi, Zhengli1 aZuo, Changqing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0536-57330 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2017 Oct. 21, v. 492, no. 3 p.419-424dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.08.0833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02446naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245006700158300002000225520117200245592002801417650001801445650001901463650001701482650001601499650001801515650001801533650002801551650001301579650001101592650001901603650001601622653001801638653001801656653001601674653001501690653001801705700001301723700002401736700002401760773012701784856008001911852000901991655001202000IND60580701020221122054557.0170927e20170927xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058070102DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b111282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Qian10aSilver-Coated Colloidosomes as Carriers for an Anticancer Drug  ap. 32599-32606.  aSmall drug molecules are widely developed and used in the pharmaceutical industry. In the past few years, loading and delivering such molecules using polymer-shell colloidosomes has attracted interest. Traditional polymer capsules fail to encapsulate low-molecular-weight materials for long times, since they are inherently porous and permeable for small molecules. In this paper, we report a method for encapsulating an anticancer drug with small molecule weight, for cell viability tests. The silver-coated colloidosomes are prepared by making an aqueous core capsule with a polymer shell and then adding AgNO₃, surfactant, and l-ascorbic acid to form a second shell. The capsules are impermeable and can be triggered using ultrasound. We propose to use the capsules as drug carriers. The silver demonstrates a low cytotoxicity for up to 10 capsules per cell. After the silver shells are triggered by ultrasound, the released doxorubicin, the broken silver fragments, and the doxorubicin loading on the capsule surface all kill cells. The results demonstrate a nonpermeable silver-shell microcapsule with ultrasound sensitivity for potential medical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aascorbic acid 3acell viability 3acytotoxicity 3adoxorubicin 3adrug carriers 3aencapsulation 3apharmaceutical industry 3apolymers 3asilver 3asilver nitrate 3asurfactants 0acolloidosomes 0asilver shells 0aimpermeable 0aultrasound 0adrug carriers1 aGao, Hui1 aSukhorukov, Gleb B.1 aRouth, Alexander F.0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2017 Sept. 27, v. 9, no. 38 p.32599-32606dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b111283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01093naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245005600171300001600227520023200243592002800475650001000503650001300513650001400526650001000540650001300550773013600563856008200699961001300781852000900794655001200803IND60768622220221118034256.0220225e20220314xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076862222DNAL7 a10.1017/S00071145210045782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCombs, Gerald Fuson10aReflecting on ‘Selenium in Global Food Systems’  ap. 736-738.  aThis paper looks back on the setting and messages of the review ‘Selenium in Global Food Systems’⁽¹⁾ (see Abstract, Fig. 1) and highlights related findings over the 20 years since its publication.

Meisenheimer complex formation between the QD surface attached methionine and aromatic explosive molecules has helped to detect them selectively via a fluorescent quenching process. Fluorescence quenching occurred because of the transfer of excited electrons from QD to the explosive molecules. Depending upon the number of nitro groups present on the explosive molecule, the quenching efficiency of different analytes varied. Due to surface passivation and inductive effects, the methionine capped CdTe/ZnS core–shell quantum dot sample resulted in the maximum quenching constant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3achemical species 3aelectrons 3afluorescence 3aliquids 3amethionine 3anitrobenzenes 3aquantum dots 3awater solubility 3azinc sulfide1 aNataraj, D.1 aDevarajan, V.

Rotenone (ROT) is a specific inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I in the brain which leads to the generation of oxidative stress. To date, there are few data indicating that toxicity of ROT is not limited to the brain but can also affect other tissues. We aimed to examine whether ROT-induced oxidative stress could be counteracted by cranberry juice not only in the brain but also in the liver and kidney. Wistar rats were given the combined treatment with ROT and cranberry juice (CJ) for 35 days. Parameters of antioxidant status were determined in the organs. ROT enhanced lipid peroxidation solely in the brain. The increase in the DNA damage was noticed in all organs examined and in leukocytes. The beneficial effect of CJ on these parameters appeared only in the brain. Additionally, CJ decreased the activity of serum hepatic enzymes. The effect of CJ on antioxidant enzymes was not consistent, however, in some organs, CJ reversed changes evoked by ROT. Summing up, ROT can cause oxidative damage not only in the brain but also in other organs. CJ demonstrated a protective effect against ROT-induced toxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aantioxidant activity 3ablood serum 3abrain 3acranberries 3afruits 3akidneys 3alipid peroxidation 3aliver 3amitochondria 3aoxidative stress 3apolyphenols 3aprotective effect 3arotenone 3atoxicity1 aZalewski, Przemysław 1 aKujawska, Małgorzata 1 aEwertowska, Małgorzata 1 aIgnatowicz, Ewa 1 aCielecka-Piontek, Judyta 1 aJodynis-Liebert, Jadwiga 0 tNutrients.g2021 Mar. 24, v. 13, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130410503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03330naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100005400188245018900242300001200431506007600443520179000519592002802309506003702337650001102374650002102385650002802406650001402434650001102448650001502459650001702474650002002491650001202511650001202523651001402535700001802549700002102567700002202588700002302610773016102633856008102794852000902875655001202884IND60586654820221207144500.0180619e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058665482DNAL7 a10.1186/s12966-017-0617-52doi7 aPMC56989412pmcid7 a291621252pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBall, Kylie1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2893-841510aHow to get a nation walking: reach, retention, participant characteristics and program implications of Heart Foundation Walking, a nationwide Australian community-based walking program  ap. 161.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Community-based walking programs represent a low-cost, accessible approach to increasing physical activity among inactive adults. However, recruiting participants from vulnerable and hard-to-reach groups remains a challenge. This study examined the reach, retention, sociodemographic and health characteristics, physical activity levels and motivators of participants in Heart Foundation Walking, a nationwide Australian community-based walking program. METHODS: Descriptive cross-sectional analyses were undertaken with data from 22,416 participants aged 15+ years in the Heart Foundation Walking registration database in December 2015, and from four surveys of participants in 2010 (n = 2400), 2011 (n = 3274), 2012 (n = 4158) and 2015 (n = 1890). RESULTS: Heart Foundation Walking reached participants in every geographic region of Australia, including remote and sparsely populated regions, and engaged sizeable proportions of the following at-risk participants: older than 60 years (>70%); with very low incomes (17–25%); who were overweight or obese (around 60%); and with one or more chronic disease or disease risk factors (57–81%). For all demographic groups, one-year retention rates were at least 75%. Seventy percent of participants met physical activity recommendations. Over 75% reported joining the program for health and fitness reasons while the most cited motivator for continuing was the social aspect (57–73%). CONCLUSIONS: Volunteer-run, group-based walking programs can have substantial reach and retention, in particular among those at risk for physical inactivity. The provision of opportunities for social interaction appears to be a key program element in promoting long-term participation, including among high-risk groups.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3achronic diseases 3across-sectional studies 3adatabases 3aincome 3aoverweight 3arisk factors 3asocial behavior 3asurveys 3awalking 3aAustralia1 aAbbott, Gavin1 aWilson, Michelle1 aChisholm, Melanie1 aSahlqvist, Shannon0 tinternational journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity.g2017 Dec., v. 14, no. 1 p.161-161dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350546x1479-58687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12966-017-0617-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02855naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245015200157300001600309520125400325592002801579650001301607650001701620650002601637650001401663650001601677650001301693650001301706650001101719650004401730650000901774650002301783650003301806650001301839650002001852650002701872650002101899650002201920653001001942653002801952653001601980653001001996653002202006653002102028700002202049700002302071700002102094773012802115856007302243852000902316655001202325IND60530553020221122102452.0160721e20150202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053055302DNAL7 a10.1021/sc500627u2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGogoi, Pronob10aBlends of Epoxidized Alkyd Resins Based on Jatropha Oil and the Epoxidized Oil Cured with Aqueous Citric Acid Solution: A Green Technology Approach  ap. 261-268.  aAlkyd resins with 100% phthalic anhydride were prepared from jatropha oil by two-stage alcoholysis–polyesterification reactions. To improve the performance characteristics, resins were blended with different wt % of epoxidized jatropha oil (EJO) and aqueous citric acid solution without the addition of any other catalyst or solvent. Blending was facilitated via epoxidation of the alkyd resins. The prepared blends were characterized by Fourier transform infrared and NMR (¹H and ¹³C) spectroscopy studies. It was observed that the properties like curing time, chemical resistance, scratch hardness, thermal stability, and tensile strength of the alkyd resins improved significantly on blending. With 50 wt % EJO content, the thermal stability and tensile strength of the blends increased by 42 °C and 3.18 MPa, respectively. The results indicate the strong influence of the amount of EJO and citric acid on the performance of the alkyd resins. The thermal and mechanical properties of the cured films can be further improved by postcured at 160 °C. Scanning electron microscopy study showed the uniform surface morphology of the blends. Overall, the results of this study suggest suitability of these blends in surface coating applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJatropha 3aalkyd resins 3abiological resistance 3acatalysts 3acitric acid 3acoatings 3ahardness 3amixing 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoils 3aphthalic anhydride 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolvents 3astable isotopes 3asustainable technology 3atensile strength 3athermal stability 0aAlkyd 0aepoxidized jatropha oil 0acitric acid 0ablend 0athermal stability 0atensile strength1 aBoruah, Monalisha1 aSharma, Shyamalima1 aDolui, Swapan K.0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2015 Feb. 02, v. 3, no. 2 p.261-268dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/sc500627u3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02929naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245013900157300001800296520151600314592002801830650002301858650001601881650001501897650001301912650001301925650002401938650002001962650001601982650002101998650002202019650002102041650002402062650001302086650001302099650001802112650001402130650000702144650001902151650001302170650001702183700001902200700001802219773012702237856007402364852000902438655001202447IND60656620320221122161645.0190814e20130131xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065662032DNAL7 a10.1039/c2ay26201k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Suman10aOne step electrochemical synthesis of gold-nanoparticles–polypyrrole composite for application in catechin electrochemical biosensor  ap. 1024-1032.  aAn electrochemical biosensor has been fabricated for catechin detection using the nanoparticle–polymer composite as a matrix. The composite has been electrochemically synthesized and tyrosinase enzyme was entrapped during polymerization of the composite material. The composite has been characterized for its morphology, optical, structural, and electrochemical behavior. Studies revealed that the presence of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in the polymer matrix resulted in an increase in conductivity, enhanced current intensity and diffusion coefficient. The AuNPs–PPy composite provided large surface area for enzyme immobilization and facilitated electron transfer, evident from almost 10% enhancement in biosensor response in the presence of nanoparticles (NPs). For catechin detection, the biosensor showed well defined redox peaks at 0.24 V/0.14 V for the redox reaction of the hydroxyl group present in the catechol moiety of the catechin and a weak oxidation peak at 0.62 V corresponding to the oxidation of the hydroxyl group present in the central ring of catechin. The linearity was achieved from 1 × 10⁻⁹ M to 1 × 10⁻⁸ M, with a sensitivity of 6.8 × 10⁻⁵ A M⁻¹. The limit of detection (3 × SD/sensitivity) and Kₘ value are 1.2 × 10⁻⁹ M and 4.5 × 10⁻⁹ M respectively. The response time of the biosensor was about 10–12 s with an optimum pH at 7.0. The biosensor has been tested for catechin detection in water and apple juices and the response was within 10% error.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3aapple juice 3abiosensors 3acatechin 3acatechol 3acomposite materials 3adetection limit 3adiffusivity 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectron transfer 3aelectrosynthesis 3aimmobilized enzymes 3amoieties 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3aoxidation 3apH 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3asurface area1 aJain, D.

However, it remains unclear whether protein quantity or nutrient timing is central to positive adaptations. This study investigated the effect of total dietary protein content, whilst controlling for protein timing, on recovery in resistance trainees. METHODS: Fourteen resistance-trained individuals underwent two 10-day isocaloric dietary regimes with a protein content of 1.8 g.kg⁻¹.d⁻¹ (PROMOD) or 2.9 g.kg⁻¹.d⁻¹ (PROHIGH) in a randomised, counterbalanced, crossover design. On days 8–10 (T1-T3), participants undertook resistance exercise under controlled conditions, performing 3 sets of squat, bench press and bent-over rows at 80% 1 repetition maximum until volitional exhaustion. Additionally, participants consumed a 0.4 g.kg⁻¹ whey protein concentrate/isolate mix 30 min before and after exercise sessions to standardise protein timing specific to training. Recovery was assessed via daily repetition performance, muscle soreness, bioelectrical impedance phase angle, plasma creatine kinase (CK) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). RESULTS: No significant differences were reported between conditions for any of the performance repetition count variables (p > 0.05). However, within PROMOD only, squat performance total repetition count was significantly lower at T3 (19.7 ± 6.8) compared to T1 (23.0 ± 7.5; p = 0.006). Pre and post-exercise CK concentrations significantly increased across test days (p ≤ 0.003), although no differences were reported between conditions. No differences for TNF-α or muscle soreness were reported between dietary conditions. Phase angle was significantly greater at T3 for PROHIGH (8.26 ± 0.82°) compared with PROMOD (8.08 ± 0.80°; p = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: When energy intake and peri-exercise protein intake was controlled for, a short term PROHIGH diet did not improve markers of muscle damage or soreness in comparison to a PROMOD approach following repeated days of intensive training. Whilst it is therefore likely that moderate protein intakes (1.8 g.kg⁻¹.d⁻¹) may be sufficient for resistance-trained individuals, it is noteworthy that both lower body exercise performance and bioelectrical phase angle were maintained with PROHIGH. Longer term interventions are warranted to determine whether PROMOD intakes are sufficient during prolonged training periods or when extensive exercise (e.g. training twice daily) is undertaken.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abioelectrical impedance 3acreatine kinase 3across-over studies 3aenergy intake 3ahypertrophy 3amuscles 3aprotein content 3aprotein intake 3asports nutrition 3astrength training 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3awhey protein concentrate1 aZinchenko, Anastasia1 aSuckling, Craig1 aSmith, Lee1 aJohnstone, James1 aHenselmans, Menno0 tJournal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition.g2017 Dec., v. 14, no. 1 p.44-44dBioMed CentralwJournal:21397x1550-27837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12970-017-0201-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03460naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245015300179520204100332592002802373650001302401650000902414650002002423650001202443650001102455650002302466650002502489650002302514650001302537650001402550650001902564650004302583650001102626651001702637653002202654653002402676653002202700653001802722653002602740700002602766700001802792773009802810856008502908852000902993655001203002IND60678373020221122230928.0200210e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067837302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeog.2019.1021322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan Rensburg, Melissa L.14aThe ‘plastic waste era’; social perceptions towards single-use plastic consumption and impacts on the marine environment in Durban, South Africa  aPlastics, one of the most abundant materials defining our society, are a major source of pollution. Plastics have redefined society's material culture and the artefacts that will be left behind. Plastic pollution in the ocean and in coastal environments is a growing concern which requires immediate attention. Single-use plastic is polluting coastal environments the world over, and this study focused on the issue within the context of Durban, South Africa. Advocating for behavioral changes from society remains a daunting task that requires an understanding of consumer perceptions towards single-use of plastics. This research paper aimed to gain an understanding of the social perceptions that beachgoers hold towards single-use plastic consumption in the coastal areas of Durban, South Africa. The sustainability science theoretical framework underpinned the research and the study used a mixed-methods approach to achieve the objectives. Questionnaires were used to accurately capture and reflect the perceptions towards single-use plastic consumption by the Durban beachgoers. The results from the study indicated that Durban beachgoers have a generally more negative perception towards single-use plastic; a high level of awareness towards their impacts on the environment; and a strong willingness to reduce their consumption of single-use plastic. Additionally, the results revealed a strong support towards potentially implementing a Container Deposit System (CDS) and a plastic bag ban in Durban to reduce the number of plastic bottles and bags polluting the coastal environment. Based on the findings, recommendations emphasized the need to incentivize reusable shopping bags; promote increased awareness and advocacy pertaining to the environmental concerns of single-use plastic; consider the implementation of a CDS; and further explore the potential of a plastic bag ban in Durban. This research can contribute towards developing adequate, appropriate strategies to address the issues of single-use plastic pollution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadvocacy 3abags 3abehavior change 3abottles 3acoasts 3aconsumer attitudes 3aenvironmental impact 3amarine environment 3aplastics 3apollution 3aquestionnaires 3asustainability science and engineering 3awastes 3aSouth Africa 0aConsumer behavior 0aCoastal environment 0aPlastic pollution 0aPlastic waste 0aSouth African beaches1 aNkomo, S'phumelele L.1 aDube, Timothy0 tApplied geography.g2020 Jan., v. 114 p.102132-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11785x0143-62287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2019.1021323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02353naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245011300159300001800272520096600290592002801256650001301284650001501297650001601312650001201328650001301340653001601353653001501369653002601384653002401410653002901434700001601463700005801479700001701537700001801554700001801572700005901590700005601649773013901705856007801844852000901922655001201931IND60682632820221122060213.0200130e20191206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068263282DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b194202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJo, Wonhee10aProgrammable Fabrication of Submicrometer Bent Pillar Structures Enabled by a Photoreconfigurable Azopolymer  ap. 5058-5064.  aAnisotropic small structures found throughout living nature have unique functionalities as seen by Gecko lizards. Here, we present a simple yet programmable method for fabricating anisotropic, submicrometer-sized bent pillar structures using photoreconfiguration of an azopolymer. A slant irradiation of a p-polarized light on the pillar structure of an azopolymer simply results in a bent pillar structure. By combining the field-gradient effect and directionality of photofluidization, control of the bending shape and the curvature is achieved. With the bent pillar patterned surface, anisotropic wetting and directional adhesion are demonstrated. Moreover, the bent pillar structures can be transferred to other polymers, highlighting the practical importance of this method. We believe that this pragmatic method to fabricate bent pillars can be used in a reliable manner for many applications requiring the systematic variation of a bent pillar structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aanisotropy 3airradiation 3alizards 3apolymers 0abent pillar 0aazopolymer 0aphoto-reconfiguration 0aanisotropic wetting 0adirectional dry adhesive1 aChoi, Jaeho1 aKang, Hong Suk1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6581-66391 aKim, Mingeon1 aBaik, Sangyul1 aLee, Bong Jae1 aPang, Changhyun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8339-78801 aKim, Hee-Tak1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4578-54220 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Dec. 06, v. 12, no. 4 p.5058-5064dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b194203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03298naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245015000170300001400320520196800334592002802302650002502330650001602355650001102371650001302382650002202395650001002417650002002427650004402447650001302491653001402504653003202518653002702550653001202577700002902589700001602618700001702634700002102651773011002672856008502782852000902867655001202876IND60581152920221122162327.0180830e20160201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058115292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2015.10.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMueller, Robert10aRelationship between mixed and pure gas self-diffusion for ethane and ethene in ZIF-8/6FDA-DAM mixed-matrix membrane by pulsed field gradient NMR  ap. 12-19.  aPulsed field gradient (PFG) NMR was applied to study self-diffusion of an ethane/ethene mixture and the corresponding pure gases in a mixed-matrix membrane (MMM) formed by dispersing ZIF-8 particles in 6FDA-DAM polymer. In addition to the MMM, diffusion measurements of the pure gases were also carried out for the membrane constituents, i.e. ZIF-8 particle bed and the pure polymer film. PFG NMR studies were performed at a high magnetic field of 17.6T using large magnetic field gradients up to 30T/m. The former allowed achieving sufficiently large signal-to-noise ratios, while the latter enabled diffusivity measurements to be performed for molecular displacements smaller than the size of ZIF-8 particles. As a result, the gas self-diffusivities for the diffusion inside the ZIF-8 particles dispersed in the MMM and for the diffusion inside the surrounding polymer matrix could be obtained separately. For each gas, the diffusivities inside the ZIF-8 and polymer phases of the MMM were found to be smaller than the corresponding diffusivities in the neat ZIF-8 particle bed and pure polymer film. This observation is explained by the reduced framework flexibility of ZIF-8 and the polymer chain rigidification in the MMM. The ethane and ethene diffusivities in the MMM loaded with the ethane/ethene mixture were compared with the corresponding diffusivities in the MMM loaded with a single gas. It was found that the presence of another gas component in the ZIF-8 particles dispersed in the MMM does not change the self-diffusivity inside the particles for both gases. At the same time, the self-diffusivity of the faster-diffusing sorbate (ethene) in the polymer phase of the MMM was reduced by co-adsorption of the slower-diffusing sorbate (ethane) in the MMM. The analytical expression proposed in our previous work for the long-range diffusivity in MMMs was validated for gas mixtures and pure gases based on the experimental data reported in this work.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3adiffusivity 3aethane 3aethylene 3afilms (materials) 3agases 3amagnetic fields 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolymers 0aDiffusion 0aOlefin/paraffin separations 0aMixed-matrix membranes 0aPFG NMR1 aHariharan, Venkatachalam1 aZhang, Chen1 aLively, Ryan1 aVasenkov, Sergey0 tJournal of membrane science.g2016 Feb. 01, v. 499 p.12-19dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2015.10.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04393naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002400188245016800212300001100380506007600391520241900467592002802886506003702914650002502951650001102976650001002987650001902997650002303016650002303039650001903062650001203081650002203093650000803115650000903123650001903132650001203151650002003163650001903183650002203202650003103224650002103255650002203276650000903298650001703307650001003324700002503334700002103359700001903380700001603399700002003415700002003435700002403455700002403479700001903503773014303522856008103665852000903746655001203755IND60586655020221207140538.0200312e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058665502DNAL7 a10.1186/s12970-017-0202-y2doi7 aPMC56973972pmcid7 a292009822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHamarsland, Håvard10aNative whey protein with high levels of leucine results in similar post-exercise muscular anabolic responses as regular whey protein: a randomized controlled trial  ap. 43.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Protein intake is essential to maximally stimulate muscle protein synthesis, and the amino acid leucine seems to possess a superior effect on muscle protein synthesis compared to other amino acids. Native whey has higher leucine content and thus a potentially greater anabolic effect on muscle than regular whey (WPC-80). This study compared the acute anabolic effects of ingesting 2 × 20 g of native whey protein, WPC-80 or milk protein after a resistance exercise session. METHODS: A total of 24 young resistance trained men and women took part in this double blind, randomized, partial crossover, controlled study. Participants received either WPC-80 and native whey (n = 10), in a crossover design, or milk (n = 12). Supplements were ingested immediately (20 g) and two hours after (20 g) a bout of heavy-load lower body resistance exercise. Blood samples and muscle biopsies were collected to measure plasma concentrations of amino acids by gas-chromatography mass spectrometry, muscle phosphorylation of p70S6K, 4E–BP1 and eEF-2 by immunoblotting, and mixed muscle protein synthesis by use of [²H₅]phenylalanine-infusion, gas-chromatography mass spectrometry and isotope-ratio mass spectrometry. Being the main comparison, differences between native whey and WPC-80 were analysed by a one-way ANOVA and comparisons between the whey supplements and milk were analysed by a two-way ANOVA. RESULTS: Native whey increased blood leucine concentrations more than WPC-80 and milk (P < 0.05). Native whey ingestion induced a greater phosphorylation of p70S6K than milk 180 min after exercise (P = 0.03). Muscle protein synthesis rates increased 1–3 h hours after exercise with WPC-80 (0.119%), and 1–5 h after exercise with native whey (0.112%). Muscle protein synthesis rates were higher 1–5 h after exercise with native whey than with milk (0.112% vs. 0.064, P = 0.023). CONCLUSIONS: Despite higher-magnitude increases in blood leucine concentrations with native whey, it was not superior to WPC-80 concerning effect on muscle protein synthesis and phosphorylation of p70S6K during a 5-h post-exercise period.

Although thermolysin-like proteases (TLPs) have been applied in different fields, the potential of TLPs in preparing bioactive collagen peptides has rarely been evaluated. Here, we characterized a thermophilic TLP, A69, from a hydrothermal bacterium Anoxybacillus caldiproteolyticus 1A02591, and evaluated its potential in preparing bioactive collagen peptides. A69 showed the highest activity at 60 °C and pH 7.0. We optimized the conditions for bovine bone collagen hydrolysis and set up a process with high hydrolysis efficiency (99.4%) to prepare bovine bone collagen peptides, in which bovine bone collagen was hydrolyzed at 60 °C for 2 h with an enzyme–substrate ratio of 25 U/g. The hydrolysate contained 96.5% peptides that have a broad molecular weight distribution below 10000 Da. The hydrolysate showed good moisture-retention ability and a high hydroxyl radical (•OH) scavenging ratio of 73.2%, suggesting that the prepared collagen peptides have good antioxidative activity. Altogether, these results indicate that the thermophilic TLP A69 has promising potential in the preparation of bioactive collagen peptides, which may have potentials in cosmetics, food and pharmaceutical industries. This study lays a foundation for the high-valued utilization of bovine bone collagen.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnoxybacillus 3aantioxidant activity 3abacteria 3acattle 3acollagen 3acosmetics 3aenzyme substrates 3ahydrolysates 3ahydrolysis 3ahydroxyl radicals 3amolecular weight 3apH 3apeptides 3aproteinases1 aZhang, Xiao-Yu 1 aWang, Zhen 1 aZhang, Xia 1 aLiu, Shi-Cheng 1 aSong, Xiao-Yan 1 aZhang, Yu-Zhong 1 aDing, Jun-Mei 1 aChen, Xiu-Lan 1 aXu, Fei 0 tMarine drugs.g2021 Nov. 27, v. 19, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21403x1660-33977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md191206763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02441naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005500144245009700199300001800296520110700314592002801421650002401449650002501473650001101498650001901509650003401528650002001562650001101582650001201593653002301605653002101628653002701649653001701676653002001693700001901713700001901732700005401751773013901805856007801944852000902022655001202031IND60682633020221123040734.0200130e20200103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068263302DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b195102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Pei-Pei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8267-858410aNonvolatile Memory and Artificial Synapse Based on the Cu/P(VDF-TrFE)/Ni Organic Memtranstor  ap. 4673-4677.  aWe demonstrate a flexible nonvolatile multilevel memory and artificial synaptic devices based on the Cu/P(VDF-TrFE)/Ni memtranstor which exhibits pronounced nonlinear magnetoelectric effects at room temperature. The states of the magnetoelectric voltage coefficient αE of the memtranstor are used to encode binary information. By applying selective electric-field pulses, the states of αE can be switched repeatedly among 2ⁿ states (n = 1, 2, 3) in a zero dc bias magnetic field. In addition, the magnetoelectric coefficient is used to act as synaptic weight, and the induced magnetoelectric voltage VME is regarded as postsynaptic potentials (excitatory or inhibitory). The artificial synaptic devices based on the Cu/P(VDF-TrFE)/Ni memtranstor display the long-term potentiation (depression) and spiking-time-dependent plasticity behaviors. The advantages of a simple structure, flexibility, multilevel, and self-biasing make the Cu/P(VDF-TrFE)/Ni organic memtranstor a promising candidate for applications in nonvolatile memory as well as artificial synaptic devices with low energy consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3abiomimetic materials 3acopper 3aelectric field 3aelectric potential difference 3amagnetic fields 3anickel 3asynapse 0anonvolatile memory 0aferroelectricity 0amagnetoelectric effect 0amultiferroic 0asynaptic device1 aShen, Jian-Xin1 aShang, Da-Shan1 aSun, Young1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8879-35080 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Jan. 03, v. 12, no. 4 p.4673-4677dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b195103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03991naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245013600208300001200344520190100356592002802257650001602285650002602301650001602327650002002343650001802363650002702381650003302408650004202441650002002483650001402503700006302517700005902580700005802639700006302697700005802760700006202818700002402880700006302904700005602967700005903023700005603082700006103138700005903199773014703258856008303405852000903488655001203497IND60768622520221118034205.0220803e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076862252DNAL7 a10.1007/s00018-022-04180-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDi Patria, Laura1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1859-692810aDefective IGF-1 prohormone N-glycosylation and reduced IGF-1 receptor signaling activation in congenital disorders of glycosylation  ap. 150.  aThe insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signaling pathway is crucial for the regulation of growth and development. The correct processing of the IGF-1Ea prohormone (proIGF-1Ea) and the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) peptide precursor requires proper N-glycosylation. Deficiencies of N-linked glycosylation lead to a clinically heterogeneous group of inherited diseases called Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG). The impact of N-glycosylation defects on IGF-1/IGF-1R signaling components is largely unknown. In this study, using dermal fibroblasts from patients with different CDG [PMM2-CDG (n = 7); ALG3-CDG (n = 2); ALG8-CDG (n = 1); GMPPB-CDG (n = 1)], we analyzed the glycosylation pattern of the proIGF-1Ea, IGF-1 secretion efficiency and IGF-1R signaling activity. ALG3-CDG, ALG8-CDG, GMPPB-CDG and some PMM2-CDG fibroblasts showed hypoglycosylation of the proIGF-1Ea and lower IGF-1 secretion when compared with control (CTR). Lower IGF-1 serum concentration was observed in ALG3-CDG, ALG8-CDG and in some patients with PMM2-CDG, supporting our in vitro data. Furthermore, reduced IGF-1R expression level was observed in ALG3-CDG, ALG8-CDG and in some PMM2-CDG fibroblasts. IGF-1-induced IGF-1R activation was lower in most PMM2-CDG fibroblasts and was associated with decreased ERK1/2 phosphorylation as compared to CTR. In general, CDG fibroblasts showed a slight upregulation of Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) stress genes compared with CTR, uncovering mild ER stress in CDG cells. ER-stress-related gene expression negatively correlated with fibroblasts IGF-1 secretion. This study provides new evidence of a direct link between N-glycosylation defects found in CDG and the impairment of IGF-1/IGF-1R signaling components. Further studies are warranted to determine the clinical consequences of reduced systemic IGF-1 availability and local activity in patients with CDG.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3afibroblasts 3agene expression 3aglycosylation 3agrowth and development 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3ainsulin-like growth factor I receptor 3aphosphorylation 3asecretion1 aAnnibalini, Giosuè1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6914-49051 aMorrone, Amelia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2890-81791 aFerri, Lorenzo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5740-54291 aSaltarelli, Roberta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6375-127X1 aGalluzzi, Luca1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1747-526X1 aDiotallevi, Aurora1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5456-18211 aBocconcelli, Matteo1 aDonati, Maria Alice1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4769-50251 aBarone, Rita1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6302-26861 aGuerrini, Renzo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7272-70791 aJaeken, Jaak1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1571-97071 aStocchi, Vilberto1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3269-94101 aBarbieri, Elena1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3480-79830 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2022 Mar., v. 79, no. 3 p.150-150dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl55291x1420-682X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-022-04180-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02018naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006300139245012600202500002000328520072100348592002801069650001401097650001501111650001101126650001301137650001301150650001301163650002301176650001401199650001601213651001101229700002201240700002101262700002701283700002101310700002001331700002301351700002401374773011601398856007301514852000901587655001201596IND60609019720221120062937.0180816e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060901972DNAL7 a10.1111/njb.018932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNovaković, Jelica,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9473-067710aCentaurea zlatiborensis (Asteraceae, Cardueae−Centaureinae), a new endemic species from Zlatibor mountain range, Serbia  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA new species of Centaurea sect.

In the absence of in situ methods capable of directly measuring metabolite pools, intracellular metabolite measurements need to be performed after an extraction procedure. In this study, we evaluated the optimization of technologies for generation of a global metabolomics profile for intracellular metabolites in Klebsiella oxytoca. Intracellular metabolites of K. oxytoca were extracted at the early stationary phase using six different common extraction procedures, including cold methanol, boiling ethanol, methanol/chloroform combinations, hot water, potassium hydroxide, and perchloric acid. The metabolites were subsequently collected for further analysis, and intracellular metabolite concentration profiles were generated using ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. During analysis, the stability of metabolites extracted using cold methanol was clearly higher than that obtained by other extraction methods. For the majority of metabolites, extracts generated in this manner exhibited the greatest recovery, with high reproducibility. Therefore, the use of cold ethanol was the best extraction method for attaining a metabolic profile. However, in another parallel extraction method, perchloric acid may also be required to maximize the range of metabolites recovered, particularly to extract glucose 1-phosphate and NADPH.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKlebsiella oxytoca 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3achloroform 3aethanol 3aglucose 1-phosphate 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3amethanol 3aperchloric acid 3apotassium hydroxide 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 2aChemical Fractionationxmethods 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxmethods 2aIntracellular Spacexmetabolism 2aKlebsiella oxytocaxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aMass Spectrometryxmethods 2aMetabolomicsxmethods 2aSolventsxchemistry1 aYun, Seokhun1 aLee, Sang Yup1 aPark, Kyungmoon1 aLee, Jinwon0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2012 June, v. 167, no. 3 p.425-438dSpringer-Verlagx0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-012-9685-9  aDNAL 7aarticle03078naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245013700163500001900300520151300319592002801832650001801860650001101878650002801889650001401917650001501931650002301946650001701969650001901986650001102005650002602016650002502042650000902067650001902076650002002095650004302115650001302158700002502171700002602196700002102222700001902243700002902262700002502291700002502316700002602341773012202367856007402489852000902563655001202572IND60735204920221116210430.0210423e20210331xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073520492DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130411472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTodorovic, Zeljko 10aShikonin Derivatives from Onsoma visianii Decrease Expression of Phosphorylated STAT3 in Leukemia Cells and Exert Antitumor Activity  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAntitumor effects of shikonins on chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (B-PLL) are mostly unexplored. The antitumor activity of shikonins, isolated from Onosma visianii Clem (Boraginaceae), in BCL1, mouse CLL cells and JVM-13, human B-PLL cells was explored in this study. The cytotoxicity of shikonin derivatives was measured by an MTT test. Cell death, proliferation, cell cycle, and expression of molecules that control these processes were analyzed by flow cytometry. Expression of STAT3-regulated genes was analyzed by real-time q-RT-PCR (Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction). The antitumor effects of shikonin derivatives in vivo were analyzed, using flow cytometry, by detection of leukemia cells in the peripheral blood and spleens of mice intravenously injected with BCL1 cells. The two most potent derivatives, isobutyrylshikonin (IBS) and α-methylbutyrylshikonin (MBS), induced cell cycle disturbances and apoptosis, inhibited proliferation, and decreased expression of phospho-STAT3 and downstream-regulated molecules in BCL1 and JVM-13 cells. IBS and MBS decreased the percentage of leukemia cells in vivo. The link between the decrease in phosphorylated STAT3 by MBS and IBS and BCL1 cell death was confirmed by detection of enhanced cell death after addition of AG490, an inhibitor of Jak2 kinase. It seems that IBS and MBS, by decreasing STAT3 phosphorylation, trigger apoptosis, inhibit cell proliferation, and attenuate leukemia cell stemness.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-lymphocytes 3aOnosma 3aantineoplastic activity 3aapoptosis 3acell cycle 3acell proliferation 3acytotoxicity 3aflow cytometry 3ahumans 3aintravenous injection 3alymphocytic leukemia 3amice 3aneoplasm cells 3aphosphorylation 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3ashikonin1 aMilovanovic, Jelena 1 aArsenijevic, Dragana 1 aVuković, Nenad,1 aVukic, Milena 1 aArsenijevic, Aleksandar 1 aDjurdjevic, Predrag 1 aMilovanovic, Marija 1 aArsenijevic, Nebojsa 0 tNutrients.g2021 Mar. 31, v. 13, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130411473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01796naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245014500164300001800309520071400327592002801041650003501069650001201104650003101116650002101147650001501168650001501183650002701198650000801225700002701233773012701260856007401387852000901461655001201470IND60656620720221122095503.0190814e20130214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065662072DNAL7 a10.1039/c2ay26212f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThompson, Robert Q.10aNovel separation for the determination of cadmium by isotope dilution ICP-MS in samples containing high concentrations of molybdenum and tin  ap. 1346-1351.  aA four-step matrix reduction procedure, beginning with thiourea-based solid phase extraction, was developed for the determination of cadmium in difficult sample matrixes by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.

Specifically, transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) signaling plays a crucial role in the development of cranial neural crest (CNC) cell–derived bone, and loss of Tgfbr2 in CNC cells results in craniofacial skeletal malformations. Our recent studies indicate that non-canonical TGFβ signaling is activated whereas canonical TGFβ signaling is compromised in the absence of Tgfbr2 (in Tgfbr2ᶠˡ/ᶠˡ;Wnt1-Cre mice). A haploinsufficiency of Tgfbr1 (aka Alk5) (Tgfbr2ᶠˡ/ᶠˡ;Wnt1-Cre;Alk5ᶠˡ/⁺) largely rescues craniofacial deformities in Tgfbr2 mutant mice by reducing ectopic non-canonical TGFβ signaling. However, the relative involvement of canonical and non-canonical TGFβ signaling in regulating specific craniofacial bone formation remains unclear. We compared the size and volume of CNC–derived craniofacial bones (frontal bone, premaxilla, maxilla, palatine bone, and mandible) from E18.5 control, Tgfbr2ᶠˡ/ᶠˡ;Wnt1-Cre, and Tgfbr2ᶠˡ/ᶠˡ;Wnt1-Cre;Alk5ᶠˡ/⁺mice. By analyzing three dimensional (3D) micro-computed tomography (microCT) images, we found that different craniofacial bones were restored to different degrees in Tgfbr2ᶠˡ/ᶠˡ;Wnt1-Cre;Alk5ᶠˡ/⁺ mice. Our study provides comprehensive information on anatomical landmarks and the size and volume of each craniofacial bone, as well as insights into the extent that canonical and non-canonical TGFβ signaling cascades contribute to the formation of each CNC–derived bone. Our data will serve as an important resource for developmental biologists who are interested in craniofacial morphogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabnormal development 3abiologists 3abone formation 3abones 3ahomeostasis 3amice 3amicro-computed tomography 3amutants 3aneural crest 3aorganogenesis 3askeletal development 3atransforming growth factor beta 0aMouse embryo 0aCraniofacial bone development 0aTGFβ signaling 0aMicro-computed tomography1 aIwata, Junichi1 aHo, Hoang Anh1 aGrimes, Weston C.1 aPark, Shery1 aSanchez-Lara, Pedro A.1 aChai, Yang0 tDevelopmental biology.g2015 Apr. 15, v. 400, no. 2 p.180-190dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12382x0012-16067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2015.02.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03148naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245007300170300001800243520140400261592002801665650001301693650001001706650001901716650001401735650001601749650001801765650001601783650002001799650002701819650001101846650002101857650001101878650001601889650001401905650001201919650000901931650002001940650001301960650002401973650002601997650001402023650001802037650001002055650001302065650001102078650001102089650001202100650001102112650001502123653002402138653001902162653001602181653002202197700002702219700002402246773014602270856008502416852000902501655001202510IND60673976020221120213936.0191022e20191011xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067397602DNAL7 a10.1080/10408398.2018.14800072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOffiah, Vivian10aExtrusion processing of raw food materials and by-products: A review  ap. 2979-2998.  aExtrusion technology has rapidly transformed the food industry with its numerous advantages over other processing methods. It offers a platform for processing different products from various food groups by modifying minor or major ingredients and processing conditions. Although cereals occupy a large portion of the extruded foods market, several other types of raw materials have been used. Extrusion processing of various food groups, including cereals and pseudo cereals, roots and tubers, pulses and oilseeds, fruits and vegetables, and animal products, as well as structural and nutritional changes in these food matrices are reviewed. Value addition by extrusion to food processing wastes and by-products from fruits and vegetables, dairy, meat and seafood, cereals and residues from starch, syrup and alcohol production, and oilseed processing are also discussed. Extrusion presents an economical technology for incorporating food processing residues and by-products back into the food stream. In contemporary scenarios, rising demand for extruded products with functional ingredients, attributed to evolving lifestyles and preferences, have led to innovations in the form, texture, color and content of extruded products. Information presented in this review would be of importance to processors and researchers as they seek to enhance nutritional quality and delivery of extruded products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3acolor 3aextruded foods 3aextrusion 3afood groups 3afood industry 3afood matrix 3afood processing 3afood processing wastes 3afruits 3afunctional foods 3agrains 3aingredients 3alifestyle 3amarkets 3ameat 3anutritive value 3aoilseeds 3aprocessing residues 3aprocessing technology 3araw foods 3araw materials 3aroots 3aseafoods 3astarch 3asyrups 3atexture 3atubers 3avegetables 0aNutritional changes 0avalue addition 0aBy-products 0awaste utilization1 aKontogiorgos, Vassilis1 aFalade, Kolawole O.0 tCritical reviews in food science and nutrition.g2019 Oct. 11, v. 59, no. 18 p.2979-2998dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl39431x1549-78527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2018.14800073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03659naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245012400174300001600298520215200314592002802466650002502494650002502519650001202544650002202556650001702578650000902595650002502604650001802629650001402647650002402661650001602685650001402701650002002715650002002735650002002755650001802775700001102793700002302804700002702827700001702854700001802871700001602889700005502905773011302960856008303073852000903156655001203165IND60758270520221119122700.0211127e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075827052DNAL7 a10.1007/s12042-021-09292-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIbrahim, Aminu Kurawa10aQTL Mapping and Expression Analysis of Candidate Genes for Salt and Drought Tolerance in Corchorus capsularis Seedlings  ap. 345-359.  aJute is an essential fibrous crop worldwide. However, salt- and drought-induced stresses affect its production. The complex inheritance for such traits makes Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) detection cumbersome when using the approach to understand and improve the plant’s tolerance to these stresses. There is a need to identify the underlying mechanistic events under these stress conditions at the seedling stage. Therefore, this study uses genetic and transcriptomic approaches to identify the markers, QTL and candidate genes related to salt and drought tolerance in jute. We also analyzed some phenotypes, including dry root weight (DRW), dry shoot weight (DSW), root fresh weight (RFW), root length (RL), relative water content (RWC), shoot fresh weight (SFW) and Shoot length (SL). One hundred (100) recombinant inbred lines (RILs) of the white Jute and the parents were evaluated under control, salt and drought conditions. Analysis of variance indicates significant differences (p < 0.01) among the RILs, and the estimates of broad-sense heritability of the RILs ranges from 50.0 to 98.5%. Two QTL for RL and SL under drought (qRLD-1–1 and qSLD-1–1, respectively) were found in the same position and associated with the flanking markers Marker5166 and Marker7753. Moreover, qRWCS-1–1 for the relative water content under salt treatment had the highest Phenotypic Variation Explained (PVE, 24.63%) with the flanking markers Marker19007 and Marker28120. Our results suggest that these genes regulate the two stresses at the seedling stage in Corchorus capsularis and function in different pathways. However, further study is needed to validate this. Higher additive effects were observed in sodium chloride (NaCl)-induced stress which suggest that salt stress selection would be more effective and useful at the seedling stage. The relative expression analysis of the candidate genes and the phenotypes of the samples reveal that CCACVL1_12635 and CCACVL1_15402, and CCACVL1_23216 genes are the salt and drought tolerance candidate genes, respectively, and function in the cystatin and potassium ion transporter 1 (KT1) pathways.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorchorus capsularis 3aanalysis of variance 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3aheritability 3ajute 3aphenotypic variation 3aplant biology 3apotassium 3aquantitative traits 3asalt stress 3aseedlings 3asodium chloride 3atranscriptomics 3atropical plants 3awater content1 aXu, Yi1 aNiyitanga, Sylvain1 aAfzal, Muhammad Zohaib1 aZhang, Lilan1 aZhang, Liemei1 aQi, Jianmin1 aZhang, Liwu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8465-24760 tTropical plant biology.g2021 Dec., v. 14, no. 4 p.345-359dSpringer USwJournal:J000000159x1935-97567nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12042-021-09292-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03163naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245013200205300001100337520182600348592002802174596008102202596005902283596004502342650005802387650001202445650001702457650001202474650001102486650002502497650001902522651001302541700002202554773013302576856008302709852000902792655001202801IND60768623320221120083129.0220311e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076862332DNAL7 a10.1007/s10113-021-01857-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlmudi, Tiago1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2236-436910aExtreme hydroclimatic events in rural communities of the Brazilian Amazon: local perceptions of change, impacts, and adaptation  ap. 27.  aThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report reveals vast evidence of increasing climate variability and a higher frequency and intensity of extreme events. Vulnerable regions to such disturbances have been widely studied in some areas, but considerably less is known about other vulnerable regions that are key to global climatic regulation, such as Amazonia. In terms of the human dimensions of climate impacts, rural and indigenous communities in developing regions are among the most vulnerable due to their limited economic capital and direct reliance on natural resources. The purpose of this research was to reveal local perceptions about the impacts of, and adaptations to, recent climatic and associated hydrological changes caused by extreme events in the Brazilian Amazon. We worked in severely impacted rural Amazonian riverine communities utilizing a qualitative case study approach that included interviews, observation while living in the community, and participatory mapping. Our results indicate that participants perceived that there has been an increased occurrence and intensity of hydroclimatic events in the last decade, especially extreme floods. Findings also show that the repeated occurrence of extreme floods resulted in severe impacts, including some that had never been experienced by the local communities, such as the complete loss of perennials. We found that a wide range of locally devised responses was implemented, despite incipient governmental support. Data also showed that responses have evolved significantly over time due to local experience with repeated extreme events. A variety of factors also affected participants’ abilities to respond to hydroclimatic changes, notably information exchange among farmers and access to technological advancements.  aPublisher supplied data  a248999/2013cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a36820cSocial Sciences and Humanities Research Council  a0088615cOrganization of American States 3aUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 3acapital 3acase studies 3aclimate 3ahumans 3ainformation exchange 3ariparian areas 3aAmazonia1 aSinclair, A.

We used the cardiac muscle H9c2 cells under condition of oxygen glucose deprivation followed by reperfusion (OGD/R) to induce myocardial I/R injury. Then H9C2 cells were transfected with si-NC, si-KCNQ1OT1, pc-NC, pc-KCNQ1OT1, si-AdipoR1 and si-AdipoR2, respectively. The myocardial cell viability and apoptosis were respectively detected. In addition, the expression levels of inflammatory factors, apoptosis-related proteins and p38 MAPK/NF-κB pathway-related proteins were detected. Besides, an inhibitor of p38 MAPK/NF-κB pathway SB203580 was used to treat cells to verify the relationship between KCNQ1OT1 and p38 MAPK/NF-κB pathway. The expression of KCNQ1OT1 was significantly up-regulated in OGD/R-induced myocardial H9C2 cells. The OGD/R-induced decreased cell viability and AdipoR1 expression could be reversed after suppression of KCNQ1OT1. In addition, suppression of KCNQ1OT1 reduced OGD/R-induced increased expressions of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β and OGD/R-induced increased cell apoptosis, which were reversed after knockdown of AdipoR1. Besides, suppression of KCNQ1OT1 significantly down-regulated the OGD/R-induced increased expression of p-p38 and p-NF-κB, which were also reversed after knockdown of AdipoR1. Moreover, SB203580, an inhibitor of p38 MAPK/NF-κB signal pathway, could further enhance the inhibitory effects of KCNQ1OT1 suppression on the expression of p-p38, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β and p-NF-κB in OGD/R-induced myocardial H9C2 cells. Suppression of KCNQ1OT1 may prevent myocardial I/R injury following acute myocardial infarction via regulating AdipoR1 and involving in p38 MAPK/NF-κB signal pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3acell viability 3aglucose 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-6 3amyocardial infarction 3amyocardium 3anon-coding RNA 3aoxygen 3aprotective effect 3aproteins 3asignal transduction 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aAcute myocardial infarction 0aLong non-coding RNA KCNQ1OT1 0aIschemia and reperfusion injury 0aAdipoR1 0ap38 MAPK/NF-κB signal pathway1 aDai, Yingnan1 aYan, Shujun1 aShi, Yanli1 aHan, Baihe1 aLi, Jingxiu1 aCha, Li1 aMu, Jianjun0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2017 Sept. 30, v. 491 p.1026-1033dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.08.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03443naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245013900166520169900305592002802004650003002032650002902062650001802091650002502109650001702134650001502151650001602166650002402182650000902206650002002215650002302235650002202258650001702280650001502297650001502312650002902327650002102356650001202377650001102389700002702400700001902427700002202446700002902468700002402497700002802521700002602549700002802575700002302603700001702626700002302643773012702666856007502793852000902868655001202877IND60760742120221117215455.0211223e20211123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076074212DNAL7 a10.3390/md191206532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReis, Bruno de Souza,10aImmune Status and Hepatic Antioxidant Capacity of Gilthead Seabream Sparus aurata Juveniles Fed Yeast and Microalga Derived β-glucans  aThis work aimed to evaluate the effects of dietary supplementation with β-glucans extracted from yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and microalga (Phaeodactylum tricornutum) on gene expression, oxidative stress biomarkers and plasma immune parameters in gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) juveniles. A practical commercial diet was used as the control (CTRL), and three others based on CTRL were further supplemented with different β-glucan extracts. One was derived from S. cerevisiae (diet MG) and two different extracts of 21% and 37% P. tricornutum-derived β-glucans (defined as Phaeo21 and Phaeo37), to give a final 0.06% β-glucan dietary concentration. Quadruplicate groups of 95 gilthead seabream (initial body weight: 4.1 ± 0.1 g) were fed to satiation three times a day for 8 weeks in a pulse-feeding regimen, with experimental diets intercalated with the CTRL dietary treatment every 2 weeks. After 8 weeks of feeding, all groups showed equal growth performance and no changes were found in plasma innate immune status. Nonetheless, fish groups fed β-glucans supplemented diets showed an improved anti-oxidant status compared to those fed CTRL at both sampling points (i.e., 2 and 8 weeks). The intestinal gene expression analysis highlighted the immunomodulatory role of Phaeo37 diet after 8 weeks, inducing an immune tolerance effect in gilthead seabream intestine, and a general down-regulation of immune-related gene expression. In conclusion, the results suggest that the dietary pulse administration of a P. tricornutum 37% enriched-β-glucans extract might be used as a counter-measure in a context of gut inflammation, due to its immune-tolerant and anti-oxidative effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhaeodactylum tricornutum 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aSparus aurata 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abiomarkers 3abody weight 3adietary supplements 3afish 3agene expression 3agrowth performance 3aimmunosuppression 3ainflammation 3aintestines 3amicroalgae 3anutritional intervention 3aoxidative stress 3asatiety 3ayeasts1 aGonçalves, Ana Teresa1 aSantos, Paulo 1 aSardinha, Manuel 1 aConceição, Luís E.

This article describes the Copernicus Sentinel-6 mission that is designed to provide precision sea level, sea surface height, significant wave height, inland water heights and other products tailored to operational services in the ocean, climate, atmospheric and land Copernicus Services. Sentinel-6 provides enhanced continuity to the very stable time series of mean sea level measurements and ocean sea state started in 1992 by the TOPEX/Poseidon mission and follow-on Jason-1, Jason-2 and Jason-3 satellite missions. The mission is implemented through a unique international partnership with contributions from NASA, NOAA, ESA, EUMETSAT, and the European Union (EU). It includes two satellites that will fly sequentially (separated in time by 5 years). The first satellite, named Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich, launched from Vandenburg Air Force Base, USA on 21st November 2020. The satellite and payload elements are explained including required performance and their operation. The main payload is the Poseidon-4 dual frequency (C/Ku-band) nadir-pointing radar altimeter that uses an innovative interleaved mode. This enables radar data processing on two parallel chains the first provides synthetic aperture radar (SAR) processing in Ku-band to improve the received altimeter echoes through better along-track sampling and reduced measurement noise; the second provides a Low Resolution Mode that is fully backward-compatible with the historical reference altimetry measurements, allowing a complete inter-calibration between the state-of-the-art data and the historical record. A three-channel Advanced Microwave Radiometer for Climate (AMRC) provides measurements of atmospheric water vapour to mitigate degradation of the radar altimeter measurements. The main data products are explained and preliminary in-orbit Poseidon-4 altimeter data performance data are presented that demonstrate the altimeter to be performing within expectations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aaltimeters 3aclimate 3aenvironment 3ahistorical records 3ainland waters 3amicrowave radiometers 3asatellite altimetry 3asatellites 3asea level 3asynthetic aperture radar 3atime series analysis 3awater vapor 0aSea level 0aSatellite 0aAltimetry 0aSea state 0aCopernicus 0aSentinel-6 0aOcean topography1 aCullen, Robert1 aGiulicchi, Luisella1 aVuilleumier, Pierrik1 aFrancis, C.

The histochemical localization of NADPH diaphorase and immunohistochemical identification of nNOS at light and electron microscopic level was applied. Double-labeling experiments with galanin and leucine enkephalin, moreover the postembedding GABA immunogold staining was also carried out. NADPH diaphorase- and nNOS-immunopositive neurons could be identified inside the borders of medial septum. Out of their peptidergic inputs galanin- and leucine enkephaline-immunopositive varicose fibers were found in close apposition with nNOS-immunopositive neurons. Based on fine structural characteristics (large indented nucleus, thin cytoplasmic rim, lack of axosomatic synapses) the nitrergic neurons are suggested to be identical with the septal cholinergic nerve cells. Their boutons established asymmetrical synapses mainly on dendritic shafts and spines, some of which were also nNOS-immunopositive. A lower amount of nNOS-immunopositive boutons of presumably extrinsic origin were found to be GABAergic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNAD(P)H dehydrogenase (quinone) 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3abrain 3aelectron microscopy 3aenkephalin 3agamma-aminobutyric acid 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aleucine 3aneuronal nitric oxide synthase 3aneurons 3arats 3astaining 3asynapse 0anNOS 0aNADPH 0aneuropeptides 0aGABA-synaptology1 aSzőke, Balázs1 aJanzsó, Gergely0 tActa biologica Hungarica.g2017 Mar., v. 68, no. 1 p.1-13dAkadémiai Kiadóx1588-256X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556/018.68.2017.1.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02689naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245016600166300001300332520113400345592002801479650002501507650002001532650001701552650001601569650001401585650001501599650004101614650001901655650002201674650004001696650001801736650003101754650000901785650001701794650002201811650002101833653001801854653001801872653002501890653003201915700001301947700001601960700001201976773011501988856008302103852000902186655001202195IND60560498920221117225332.0190405e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056049892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tifs.2016.11.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Xiao-fei10aEffect of sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.) on blood lipid profiles: A systematic review and meta-analysis from 11 independent randomized controlled trials  ap. 1-10.  aThe effect of sea buckthorn on serum/plasma concentrations of total cholesterol, triacylglycerol (TAG), LDL and HDL-cholesterol was evaluated.

We aimed to systematically determine and quantify the potential association between dietary anthocyanin intake and risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). A systematic literature search of studies reporting anthocyanin intake and risk of fatal or nonfatal CVD was performed using SCOPUS, MEDLINE, CINAHL and Cochrane Library. The relative risk (RR) or hazard ratio (HR) of highest category of anthocyanin foods were pooled in a random-effects meta-analysis. Subgroup analysis were conducted to determine possible sources of heterogeneity. The meta-analysis suggested intake of dietary anthocyanins and reduced risk of CHD (RR = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.83, 0.99; I² = 12.0, Pₕ = 0.337) and CVD mortality (RR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.87, 0.97; I² = 0.0, Pₕ = 0.584). However, there was no relationship between the intake of these compounds and reduced risk of MI, stroke or total CVD. Subgroup analysis determined reduced risk of CHD and CVD mortality was more prominent for anthocyanidin intake, as opposed to anthocyanin or berries. Our systematic review and meta-analysis provides evidence that anthocyanins, specifically anthocyanidins, reduce the risk of CHD and CVD mortality. Further randomized controlled trials on anthocyanin intake and CVD risk factors are needed to support these findings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthocyanidins 3aanthocyanins 3acohort studies 3afood intake 3afoods 3ameta-analysis 3amortality 3arandomized clinical trials 3arelative risk 3arisk factors 3arisk reduction 3asmall fruits 3astroke 3asystematic review 0aFlavonoids 0acardiovascular disease 0aepidemiology 0aCRD420180891211 aKeane, Karen M.1 aLodge, John K.1 aHowatson, Glyn0 tCritical reviews in food science and nutrition.g2019 Oct. 11, v. 59, no. 18 p.3032-3043dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl39431x1549-78527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2018.15098353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02132naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245013700163300001600300520090800316592002801224596005901252596006101311650001301372650001001385650001601395650004301411650001301454700001801467700001401485700005501499700001801554773011801572856008301690852000901773655001201782IND60768623620221120083107.0220225e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076862362DNAL7 a10.1007/s10337-022-04128-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Ya-Ya10aPractical Evaluation of Chitosan-Based Chiral Stationary Phase for Pharmaceutical Analysis by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography  ap. 247-254.  aIn the recent years, the resolution of drug enantiomers has received widespread attention in the medical field. It is of great practical significance to develop an efficient chiral separation material for drug analysis. Based on the distinct advantages of both favorable separation performance and good solvent tolerance, chitosan bis(4-methylphenylcarbamate)-(isobutylurea) was chosen as a chiral selector for enantioseparation of a series of chiral drugs in this work. It was found that most of the tested chiral drugs were recognized with certain drug enantiomers being effectively resolved under the conventional normal phase chromatographic conditions without any mobile phase additive; thus, indicating that the proposed method is promising for practical application in pharmaceutical analysis, which may lay a foundation for the study on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drug enantiomers.  aPublisher supplied data  a51373127cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2017CFB220cNatural Science Foundation of Hubei Province 3achitosan 3adrugs 3aenantiomers 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3asolvents1 aLiang, Shuang1 aChen, Wei1 aTang, Sheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8634-02571 aBai, Zheng-Wu0 tChromatographia.g2022 Mar., v. 85, no. 3 p.247-254dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl1915x0009-58937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10337-022-04128-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02682naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245009600163300001400259520131200273592002801585650002101613650001601634650001001650650001501660650001901675650001901694650003101713650001101744650001801755650000901773650004301782650001401825650001201839653001801851653001201869653002401881653001801905700001901923700001801942700001701960700002001977700001601997773009902013856007902112852000902191655001202200IND60565316620221121021654.0170323e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056531662DNAL7 a10.1556/018.68.2017.1.32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÖrçen, Arda10aViability of SH-SY5Y cells is associated with purinergic P2 receptor expression alterations  ap. 22-34.  aTo investigate the role of metabotrophic purinergic P2Y receptors in neuroblastoma cell survival, expression of P2 receptors by normal mouse (C57BL/6) brain and human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells was investigated by Western blot and real time PCR studies. Viability of SH-SY5Y cells treated with purinergic receptor antagonists suramin and pyridoxal-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2′,4′-disulfonate (PPADS) was evaluated by MTT assay and flow cytometry. In the brain samples of C57BL/6 mice, expressions of P2Y4 and P2X7 were significantly reduced, whereas that of P2Y1 was significantly elevated in an age-dependent manner. SH-SY5Y cell viability was significantly reduced and necrotic cell rates were mildly increased by 400 μM suramin and 100 μM PPADS treatment. Antagonist treatment downregulated P2Y1, P2Y2 and P2Y4 and upregulated P2Y6, P2Y12 and P2X7 mRNA levels in SH-SY5Y cells on the 24th hour. These alterations were abolished for all P2 receptors except P2Y1 in the 48th hour. P2Y receptors are expressed by both normal mouse brain and human neuroblastoma cells. Purinergic receptor antagonism interferes with neuroblastoma viability through elevation of necrotic cell death and modulation of P2 receptor expression. P2Y receptors might thus be useful targets for future anti-tumor treatment trials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aantagonists 3abrain 3acell death 3acell viability 3aflow cytometry 3agene expression regulation 3ahumans 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areceptors 3asuramin 0aNeuroblastoma 0aSH-SY5Y 0apurinergic receptor 0aMTT-viability1 aYilmaz, Vuslat1 aGiriş, Murat1 aAkcan, Uğur1 aTüzün, Erdem,1 aErten, Gaye0 tActa biologica Hungarica.g2017 Mar., v. 68, no. 1 p.22-34dAkadémiai Kiadóx1588-256X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556/018.68.2017.1.33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01529naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245011800157300001600275520039700291592002800688650001500716650002300731650001300754650002100767650000900788650001500797650001500812650001300827700002000840700002000860700001900880700003100899700001700930773012500947856007401072852000901146655001201155IND60656621220221122063552.0190814e20121220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065662122DNAL7 a10.1039/c2ay26224j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLohar, Sisir12aA rhodamine–naphthalene conjugate as a FRET based sensor for Cr³⁺ and Fe³⁺ with cell staining application  ap. 442-445.  aA FRET based fluorescent probe (RDENAPH) containing a 2-hydroxynaphthalene unit as a donor and rhodamine B as an acceptor can discriminate Cr³⁺ and Fe³⁺ from other common metal ions through ratiometric sensing.

In this study, we successfully extracted SiO₂ from various agricultural residues such as BC, RH, and SB via rapid microwave assisted solid-state ashing (MW-SS), followed by microwave assisted magnesiothermic reduction (MW-MR) of SiO₂ into crystalline silicon (Si) at <650 °C for 30 min without the need for a reducing gas atmosphere. The MW-MR process further supports the development of an interconnected three-dimensional porous Si network with a pore diameter of 50–80 nm and wall thickness of ∼23 nm. The obtained Si is further decorated with dimensionally modulated carbon-based materials such as carbon (C), graphene nanosheets (GNS), and multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT), which can offer higher delithiation capacities (1997, 1290, and 1166 mAh g–¹, respectively) compared to pristine Si (956 mAh g–¹) extracted from RH at C/5 rate after 200 cycles. These results suggest that the earth-abundant BC, RH, and SB could be sustainable resources for large-scale production of nanoporous crystalline Si, which has been extracted via an energy efficient, low-cost microwave assisted sustainable process for lithium ion battery anodes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural wastes 3aanodes 3abamboos 3acarbon nanotubes 3aculms 3aenergy efficiency 3agraphene 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3amicrowave treatment 3ananopores 3ananosheets 3arice hulls 3asilica 3asilicon 3asugarcane bagasse 0aSugarcane bagasse 0abamboo culm 0arice husk 0abiogenic-silicon nanoporous 0agraphene 0amultiwall carbon nanotubes 0aanode material 0amicrowave 0alithium energy storage1 aMurugan, A.

In this paper, hierarchically porous magnetic microspheres (PFMMs) were prepared through solvothermal method and rapidly grafted with a novel rigid–flexible dendrimer first synthesized from monomers of trimesoyl chloride (TMC) and 1,6-hexanediamine (HDA) via interfacial polymerization process for covalent immobilization of Pseudomonas fluorescens lipase (PFL). The maximum PFL loading of the synthesized support reaches 87.5 mgₚᵣₒₜₑᵢₙ/gₛᵤₚₚₒᵣₜ, and 864% activity recovery of PFMMs-G₃.₀-PFL can be achieved at pH 9.0. Then, it was used to catalyze the resolution of (R,S)-1-phenylethanol with vinyl acetate. Under the optimized conditions, 50.0% conversion with 99.0% eeₛ can be reached within 1.5 h. In addition, a conversion of 49.2% and eeₛ of 96.9% can be retained after 10 batches of running, displaying an excellent operational stability. Importantly, a further investigation shows that the obviously improved reusability of the immobilized PFL is ascribed to the increased rigidity in comparison to fully flexible dendrimer. Thus, the newly constructed protocol for lipase immobilization exhibits a great prospect in biochemical engineering.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1,6-hexanediamine 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3abiocatalysts 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3adendrimers 3aengineering 3aindustry 3amagnetism 3amicroparticles 3aorganochlorine compounds 3apH 3apolymerization 3atrimesoyl chloride 3avinyl acetate 0abiocatalysis 0ainterfacial polymerization 0adendrimer 0aimmobilization 0aenantioseparation1 aLi, Kai1 aHe, Yaojia1 aWang, Yao1 aYan, Jinyong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2543-203X1 aXu, Li1 aHan, Xiaotao1 aYan, Yunjun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6643-597X0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Jan. 06, v. 12, no. 4 p.4906-4916dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b199403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02778naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245013800160500001400298520164400312592002801956650001301984650001901997650002002016650001502036650001602051650001302067650002002080650001902100650001102119700001302130700001402143700001502157700002002172773012902192856007402321852000902395655001202404IND60715389920221116224953.0201026e20201009xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071538992DNAL7 a10.3390/rs122032762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Zhicheng 10aWhen Self-Supervised Learning Meets Scene Classification: Remote Sensing Scene Classification Based on a Multitask Learning Framework  aNAL-light  aIn recent years, the development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has promoted continuous progress in scene classification of remote sensing images. Compared with natural image datasets, however, the acquisition of remote sensing scene images is more difficult, and consequently the scale of remote sensing image datasets is generally small. In addition, many problems related to small objects and complex backgrounds arise in remote sensing image scenes, presenting great challenges for CNN-based recognition methods. In this article, to improve the feature extraction ability and generalization ability of such models and to enable better use of the information contained in the original remote sensing images, we introduce a multitask learning framework which combines the tasks of self-supervised learning and scene classification. Unlike previous multitask methods, we adopt a new mixup loss strategy to combine the two tasks with dynamic weight. The proposed multitask learning framework empowers a deep neural network to learn more discriminative features without increasing the amounts of parameters. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on four representative remote sensing scene classification datasets. We achieved state-of-the-art performance, with average accuracies of 94.21%, 96.89%, 99.11%, and 98.98% on the NWPU, AID, UC Merced, and WHU-RS19 datasets, respectively. The experimental results and visualizations show that our proposed method can learn more discriminative features and simultaneously encode orientation information while effectively improving the accuracy of remote sensing scene classification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccuracy 3aclassification 3adata collection 3aextraction 3ainformation 3alearning 3aneural networks 3aremote sensing 3aweight1 aLuo, Ze 1 aLi, Jian 1 aChen, Can 1 aPiao, Yingchao 0 tRemote Sensing.g2020 Oct. 09, v. 12, no. 20dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs122032763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02973naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245008500167300001400252520161900266592002801885650006701913650001201980650002901992650001702021650001502038650005002053650001902103650001502122651001002137653003002147653001902177653001602196653003402212700001402246700001302260773020502273856008802478852000902566655001202575IND60560499320221117225437.0180830e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056049932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2016.12.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Bin10aMulti-source remotely sensed data fusion for improving land cover classification  ap. 27-39.  aAlthough many advances have been made in past decades, land cover classification of fine-resolution remotely sensed (RS) data integrating multiple temporal, angular, and spectral features remains limited, and the contribution of different RS features to land cover classification accuracy remains uncertain. We proposed to improve land cover classification accuracy by integrating multi-source RS features through data fusion. We further investigated the effect of different RS features on classification performance. The results of fusing Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), China Environment 1A series (HJ-1A), and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection (ASTER) digital elevation model (DEM) data, showed that the fused data integrating temporal, spectral, angular, and topographic features achieved better land cover classification accuracy than the original RS data. Compared with the topographic feature, the temporal and angular features extracted from the fused data played more important roles in classification performance, especially those temporal features containing abundant vegetation growth information, which markedly increased the overall classification accuracy. In addition, the multispectral and hyperspectral fusion successfully discriminated detailed forest types. Our study provides a straightforward strategy for hierarchical land cover classification by making full use of available RS data. All of these methods and findings could be useful for land cover classification at both regional and global scales.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdvanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer 3aLandsat 3adigital elevation models 3aforest types 3aland cover 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3aremote sensing 3atopography 3aChina 0aLand cover classification 0aRemote sensing 0aData fusion 0aTemporal and angular features1 aHuang, Bo1 aXu, Bing0 tISPRS journal of photogrammetry and remote sensing.g2017 Feb., v. 124 p.27-39dElsevier B.V.aInternational Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

However, the relationship between GMB and schizophrenia remains unclear. In this article, we review the existing evidence surrounding the gut microbiome in schizophrenia and the potential for antipsychotics to cause adverse metabolic events by altering the gut microbiome. We also evaluate the current evidence for the clinical use of probiotic and prebiotic treatment in schizophrenia. The current data on microbiome alteration in schizophrenia remain conflicting. Longitudinal and larger studies will help elucidate the confounding effect on the microbiome. Current studies help lay the groundwork for further investigations into the role of the GMB in the development, presentation, progression and potential treatment of schizophrenia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantipsychotics 3aetiology 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amicrobiome 3aprebiotics 3aprobiotics 3aschizophrenia1 aGorbovskaya, Ilona 1 aHahn, Margaret  K.1 aMüller, Daniel  J.0 tNutrients.g2021 Mar. 31, v. 13, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130411523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03669naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245012200160300001100282520182300293592002802116596008902144596007302233650001902306650001802325650002302343650003102366650002302397650001202420650002202432650001802454650001602472650001802488650001202506650001002518650003002528650001802558650000902576650001602585650002202601650002302623651001002646700001802656700001802674700001602692700001802708700001802726700001902744700001802763700001502781700001502796700001602811700005502827773009302882856008302975852000903058655001203067IND60758271320221119122601.0220225e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075827132DNAL7 a10.1186/s12284-021-00537-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yi10aMolecular Breeding of a Novel PTGMS Line of WDR for Broad-Spectrum Resistance to Blast Using Pi9, Pi5, and Pi54 Genes  ap. 96.  aBACKGROUND: The two-line method based on the photoperiod and thermo-sensitive genic male sterile (PTGMS) lines is more cost-effective, simple, and efficient than the three-line system based on cytoplasmic male-sterility. Blast and drought are the most prevalent biotic and abiotic stress factors hampering rice production. Molecular techniques demonstrate higher efficacy in the pyramiding of disease resistance genes, providing green performance under the background of water-saving and drought-resistance rice. RESULTS: This study employed molecular marker-assisted selection, conventional hybridization, and high-intensity stress screening to integrate three broad-spectrum blast resistance genes Pi9, Pi5, and Pi54 into Huhan 1S. Subsequently, a novel water-saving and drought-resistance rice (WDR) PTGMS line Huhan 74S was developed. The drought resistance of the new PTGMS line Huhan 74S was comparable to that of Huhan 1S. Pathogenicity assays involving the inoculation of 14 blast prevalent isolates in the glasshouse showed that the blast resistance frequency of Huhan 74S was 85.7%. Further evaluation under natural blast epidemic field conditions showed that Huhan 74S and its hybrids were resistant to leaf and neck blast. The critical temperature point of fertility-sterility alteration of Huhan 74S was 23 °C daily mean temperature. The complete male sterility under natural growth conditions in 2017 at Shanghai lasted for 67 days. Also, both the agronomic and grain quality traits met the requirement for two-line hybrid rice production. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that the newly bred PTGMS line Huhan 74S can be used to breed high-yielding, good-quality, disease-resistant two-line hybrid water-saving and drought-resistance rice (WDR), hence promoting sustainable rice production in China.  aPublisher supplied data  a2019-02-08-00-08-F01110cShanghai Agriculture Applied Technology Development Program  a19391900100cShanghai Municipal Commission of Science and technology 3aabiotic stress 3ablast disease 3acost effectiveness 3acytoplasmic male sterility 3adisease resistance 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3agrain quality 3agreenhouses 3ahybridization 3ahybrids 3amales 3amarker-assisted selection 3apathogenicity 3arice 3atemperature 3athermosensitivity 3awater conservation 3aChina1 aZhang, Fenyun1 aLuo, Xingxing1 aKong, Deyan1 aZhang, Anning1 aWang, Feiming1 aPan, Zhongquan1 aWang, Jiahong1 aBi, Junguo1 aLuo, Lijun1 aLiu, Guolan1 aYu, Xinqiao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6321-06760 tRice.g2021 Dec., v. 14, no. 1 p.96-96dSpringer USwJournal:J000001787x1939-84257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12284-021-00537-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03723naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245015400166520189700320592002802217650001302245650001602258650002002274650001602294650001602310650001502326650001502341650001002356650000902366650001602375650001502391650002502406650002202431650001202453650001402465653003802479653002502517653002302542653002402565653000802589653002002597653000802617653003002625653002002655653001402675700002202689700002902711700002102740700002202761700003302783700002102816700002502837700002102862700002102883773011402904856008203018852000903100655001203109IND60732709220221119153028.0211123e20210601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073270922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2021.1124022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDille, Antoine10aWhen image correlation is needed: Unravelling the complex dynamics of a slow-moving landslide in the tropics with dense radar and optical time series  aSlow-moving landslides exhibit persistent but non-uniform motion at low rates which makes them exceptional natural laboratories to study the mechanisms that control the dynamics of unstable hillslopes. Here we leverage 4.5+ years of satellite-based radar and optical remote sensing data to quantify the kinematics of a slow-moving landslide in the tropical rural environment of the Kivu Rift, with unprecedented high spatial and temporal resolution. We measure landslide motion using sub-pixel image correlation methods and invert these data into dense time series that capture weekly to multi-year changes in landslide kinematics. We cross-validate and compare our satellite-based results with very-high-resolution Unoccupied Aircraft System topographic datasets, and explore how rainfall, simulated pore-water pressure, and nearby earthquakes control the overall landslide behaviour. The landslide exhibited seasonal and multi-year velocity variations that varied across the landslide kinematic units. While rainfall-induced changes in pore-water pressure exerts a primary control on the landslide motion, these alone cannot explain the observed variability in landslide behaviour. We suggest instead that the observed landslide kinematics result from internal landslide dynamics, such as extension, compression, material redistribution, and interactions within and between kinematic units. Our study provides, a rare, detailed overview of the deformation pattern of a landslide located in a tropical environment. In addition, our work highlights the viability of sub-pixel image correlation with long time series of radar-amplitude data to quantify surface deformation in tropical environments where optical data is limited by persistent cloud cover and emphasize the importance of exploiting synergies between multiple types of data to capture the complex kinematic pattern of landslides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaircraft 3acloud cover 3adata collection 3adeformation 3aenvironment 3akinematics 3alandslides 3aradar 3arain 3arural areas 3asatellites 3atime series analysis 3atopographic slope 3atropics 3aviability 0aLandslide mechanisms and controls 0aLandslide kinematics 0aGround deformation 0aPore-water pressure 0aSAR 0aRadar-amplitude 0aUAS 0aOptical satellite imagery 0aTropical Africa 0aKivu rift1 aKervyn, François1 aHandwerger, Alexander L.1 ad'Oreye, Nicolas1 aDerauw, Dominique1 aMugaruka Bibentyo, Toussaint1 aSamsonov, Sergey1 aMalet, Jean-Philippe1 aKervyn, Matthieu1 aDewitte, Olivier0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2021 June 01, v. 258 p.112402-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11735x0034-42577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2021.1124023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02395naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001200153245006900165300001400234520126700248592002801515650001501543650002001558650002601578650002401604653002401628653002001652653003301672653001501705653001801720700001701738773020501755856008801960852000902048655001202057IND60560499420221117225544.0180830e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056049942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2016.12.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Xia10aMulti-objective based spectral unmixing for hyperspectral images  ap. 54-69.  aSparse hyperspectral unmixing assumes that each observed pixel can be expressed by a linear combination of several pure spectra in a priori library. Sparse unmixing is challenging, since it is usually transformed to a NP-hard l0 norm based optimization problem. Existing methods usually utilize a relaxation to the original l0 norm. However, the relaxation may bring in sensitive weighted parameters and additional calculation error. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-objective based algorithm to solve the sparse unmixing problem without any relaxation. We transform sparse unmixing to a multi-objective optimization problem, which contains two correlative objectives: minimizing the reconstruction error and controlling the endmember sparsity. To improve the efficiency of multi-objective optimization, a population-based randomly flipping strategy is designed. Moreover, we theoretically prove that the proposed method is able to recover a guaranteed approximate solution from the spectral library within limited iterations. The proposed method can directly deal with l0 norm via binary coding for the spectral signatures in the library. Experiments on both synthetic and real hyperspectral datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3adata collection 3ahyperspectral imagery 3asystem optimization 0aHyperspectral image 0aSparse unmixing 0aMulti-objective optimization 0al0 problem 0aBinary coding1 aShi, Zhenwei0 tISPRS journal of photogrammetry and remote sensing.g2017 Feb., v. 124 p.54-69dElsevier B.V.aInternational Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

In particular, this study investigates the effects of changing weather extremes on meso-regional-scale landscape vulnerability. Climatic-exposure parameter analysis was performed on a predicted climate change scenario. The exposure to climate change was analysed on the basis of the original data of the meso-scale IPCC A1B climate scenario from the REMO and ALADIN regional models for the periods of 2021-2050 and 2071-2100, and the regional types of climate change impacts were calculated by using cluster analysis. Selected climate exposure parameters of the REMO and ALADIN models were analysed, in particular, for extreme events (days with precipitation greater than 30 mm, heat waves, dry periods, wet periods) and for daily temperature and precipitation. The landscape functions impacted by climate change are proxies for the main recent and future problematic processes in Hungary. Soil erosion caused by water, drought, soil erosion caused by wind, mass movement and flash floods were analysed for the time periods of 1961-1990, 2021-2050 and 2071-2100. Based on the sensitivity thresholds for the impact assessments, the landscape functional sensitivity indicators were interpreted, and an integrative summary of the five indicators was made, differentiating the regions facing only a few or multiple sensitivities. In Central Hungary, the increasing exposure and sensitivity to droughts will be a serious problem when following the REMO scenario. In several regions, most indicators will change the sensitivity threshold from a tolerable risk to an increased or very high risk. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric precipitation 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acluster analysis 3adrought 3afloods 3aheat 3alandscapes 3amass movement 3amodels 3arisk 3awater erosion 3awind erosion 3aHungary1 aMeyer, Burghard C.1 aLoibl, Wolfgang1 aAubrecht, Christoph1 aCsorba, Peter1 aBata, Teodora0 tRegional environmental change.g2013 Aug., v. 13, no. 4 p.797-811dSpringer-Verlagx1436-37987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10113-012-0326-1  aDNAL 7aarticle03179naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245008000164500001400244520200400258592002802262650001502290650001002305650001002315650001402325650001202339650001902351650001902370650001602389650002102405650001002426650001902436650002002455650001502475650001902490650001302509650001202522651001102534773012902545856007402674852000902748655001202757IND60715387320221116225631.0201026e20201021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071538732DNAL7 a10.3390/rs122034652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlshawabkeh, Yahya 10aColor and Laser Data as a Complementary Approach for Heritage Documentation  aNAL-light  aHeritage recording has received much attention and benefits from recent developments in the field of range and imaging sensors. While these methods have often been viewed as two different methodologies, data integration can achieve different products, which are not always found in a single technique. Data integration in this paper can be divided into two levels: laser scanner data aided by photogrammetry and photogrammetry aided by scanner data. At the first level, superior radiometric information, mobility and accessibility of imagery can be actively used to add texture information and allow for new possibilities in terms of data interpretation and completeness of complex site documentation. In the second level, true orthophoto is generated based on laser data, the results are rectified images with a uniform scale representing all objects at their planimetric position. The proposed approaches enable flexible data fusion and allow images to be taken at an optimum time and position for radiometric information. Data fusion usually involves serious distortions in the form of a double mapping of occluded objects that affect the product quality. In order to enhance the efficiency of visibility analysis in complex structures, a proposed visibility algorithm is implemented into the developed methods of texture mapping and true orthophoto generation. The algorithm filters occluded areas based on a patch processing using a grid square unit set around the projected vertices. The depth of the mapped triangular vertices within the patch neighborhood is calculated to assign the visible one. In this contribution, experimental results from different historical sites in Jordan are presented as a validation of the proposed algorithms. Algorithms show satisfactory performance in terms of completeness and correctness of occlusion detection and spectral information mapping.

The microstructure and phase composition, morphology, particle size distribution, sphericity, flow behavior and dispersion of the as-fabricated particles on the building plate of the 3D printer were investigated. The results confirmed a uniform distribution of nanostructured calcium phosphate particles on the surface of primary Ti64 ones. Calcium phosphate appears as an octa-calcium phosphate phase. The morphology of the particles was shown as spherical, and their sphericity was better than the as-received Ti64 particles. The particle size distribution of nanocomposite powder indicated a smaller amount than the as-received Ti64 particles. Additionally, the flow behavior was improved compared to the as-received Ti64 and delivered an optimal dispersion on the building platform. Ultimately, Ti64/CaP nanocomposite powder has a very homogeneous and uniform microstructure and bears a proper flow behavior for use in powder-bed additive manufacturing machines.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium phosphates 3amicrostructure 3ananocomposites 3aparticle size distribution 3athree-dimensional printing 0aAdditive manufacturing 0aNanocomposite 0aTi6Al4V 0aCalcium phosphate 0aPowder-based 3D printer 0aFlowability1 aEkrami, Aliakbar1 aBadrossamay, Mohsen0 tPowder technology.g2021 July, v. 386 p.319-334dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2021.03.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03207naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001100156245010200167500001900269520161400288592002801902650002801930650002801958650001001986650002401996650002002020650001502040650002602055650001102081650001402092650001602106650001202122650001302134650001302147650002202160650002802182650002402210650001902234653002502253653002002278653002002298653000902318700001902327700001402346700001102360700001102371700001502382700002002397700001402417700001702431773009302448856009102541852000902632655001202641IND60678371520221120095437.0200913e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067837152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.1196662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Lu13aAn iRGD-conjugated prodrug micelle with blood-brain-barrier penetrability for anti-glioma therapy  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aVarious obstacles impede the chemotherapy efficiency of glioma in clinic, such as blood brain barrier (BBB) and blood brain tumor barrier (BBTB). Ligand-mediated polymeric micelles have shown great potential for improving the efficiency of glioma treatment. Herein, we developed a disulfide bond-conjugated prodrug polymer consisted of camptothecin (CPT) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) with further modification of iRGD peptide. The polymer of CPT-S-S-PEG-COOH could self-assemble into nanosized polymeric micelles with diameter around 100 nm, and loaded with photosensitizer IR780 for combination therapy. The micelles displayed good stability with controlled drug release under physiological environment. Importantly, the iRGD modified polymeric micelles demonstrated favorable ability to cross the BBB and target glioma cells via αv β integrin and neuropilin-1-mediated ligand transportation in vitro and in vivo. The whole synthesis process is simple and the drug loading content of CPT in the CPT-S-S-PEG-iRGD@IR780 micelles was higher than 10%. Moreover, CPT-S-S-PEG-iRGD@IR780 micelles combined chemotherapy with photodynamic therapy (PDT) displayed more excellent tumor-killing capability than the other groups. Thus, both in vitro and in vivo studies suggested that the targeting prodrug system could not only effectively cross various barriers to reach at glioma site, but also significantly enhance the antitumor effect with laser irradiation. Our findings consequently suggested that CPT-S-S-PEG-iRGD@IR780 micelles with laser irradiation are a promising drug delivery system for glioma therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantineoplastic activity 3abiocompatible materials 3ablood 3ablood-brain barrier 3abrain neoplasms 3adisulfides 3adrug delivery systems 3aglioma 3aintegrins 3airradiation 3aligands 3amicelles 3apeptides 3aphotochemotherapy 3aphotosensitizing agents 3apolyethylene glycol 3atransportation 0aPhotodynamic therapy 0aTumor targeting 0aProdrug micelle 0aiRGD1 aZhao, Xiaojing1 aFu, Tiwei1 aLi, Ke1 aHe, Ye1 aLuo, Zhong1 aDai, Liangliang1 aZeng, Rui1 aCai, Kaiyong0 tBiomaterials.g2020 Feb., v. 230 p.119666-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.1196663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03308naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245013100171300001600302520194000318592002802258650002202286650002602308650001202334650001202346650001102358650001502369650001402384650001302398650002602411650003402437650001302471650001902484650002002503650001602523650002202539650002502561650002202586650001402608651001002622700002702632700002702659773009502686856004802781852000902829655001202838IND50061028320221120052901.0130318e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006102832DNAL7 a10.1007/s11842-012-9195-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarey-Pérez, M. F.10aPractical Application of Multivariant Analysis Techniques to the Forest Management of Active Farmers in the Northwest of Spain  ap. 453-476.  aAs managers almost exclusive in many worldwide forestry regions, non-industrial private forest (NIPF) owners come to play a key role in balanced integrating the variety of forest uses and functions in policies for promoting and revitalising rural areas. In Galicia, a region in the Spanish Northwest, over 67.5% of forestland and 80% of woodland is managed by NIPF owners. Almost 40% of the Galician NIPF owners are agricultural or livestock farmers who manage a total of 169,755 agrarian holdings with woodlands. Although the number of agricultural holdings has dropped significantly over the last 60 years, farmers still constitute a representative section of the NIPF owner population in Galicia. Starting from an initial population of 31,285 active full-time professional farmers in the region, and based on data collected by a personal questionnaire from a sample comprising 4,383 of these professional farmers for the period 1993–2003, Discriminant Analysis (DA) was used to identify which socioeconomic, territorial and public-political factors were useful in distinguishing, and to what extent, that a certain population of Galician active farmers should opt to own and manage forestland areas within their agrarian holdings. The results suggested that the forestry production capacity for the area in which the agricultural holding is located, the size and the number of plots in the land base, the number of years the farmer has been the owner and the economic yield from the holding over the total family income were key factors in distinguishing between farmers with forestry activity (forestland owners) and farmers with no forestry activity (farmland owners). These findings could be used as a guide for designing, planning, and implementing research and policy measures that could allow NIPF landowners with farming and livestock activity to develop sustainable forestry, as key agents in promoting rural development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3adiscriminant analysis 3afarmers 3aforests 3aincome 3alandowners 3alivestock 3amanagers 3amultivariate analysis 3anonindustrial private forests 3aplanning 3aquestionnaires 3aresearch policy 3arural areas 3arural development 3asustainable forestry 3atimber production 3awoodlands 3aSpain1 aRodríguez-Vicente, V.1 aÁlvarez-López, J.

The role of Fgfr/Frs2α signaling in nephron progenitors is unknown. Thus, we generated mouse models using BAC transgenic Six2EGFPcre (Six2cre) mediated deletion of Fgfrs and/or Frs2α in nephron progenitors. Six2cre mediated deletion of Fgfr1 or Fgfr2 alone led to no obvious kidney defects. Six2creFgfr1ᶠˡᵒˣ/ᶠˡᵒˣFgfr2ᶠˡᵒˣ/ᶠˡᵒˣ (Fgfr1/2ᴺᴾ⁻/⁻) mice generate a discernable kidney; however, they develop nephron progenitor depletion starting at embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) and later demonstrate severe cystic dysplasia. To determine the role of Frs2α signaling downstream of Fgfr2 in Fgfr1/2ᴺᴾ⁻/⁻ mice, we generated Six2cre,Fgfr1ᶠˡᵒˣ/ᶠˡᵒˣFgfr2ᴸᴿ/ᴸᴿ (Fgfr1ᴺᴾ⁻/⁻Fgfr2ᴸᴿ/ᴸᴿ) mice that have point mutations in the Frs2α binding site of Fgfr2. Like Fgfr1/2ᴺᴾ⁻/⁻ mice, Fgfr1ᴺᴾ⁻/⁻Fgfr2ᴸᴿ/ᴸᴿ develop nephron progenitor depletion, but it does not start until E14.5 and older mice have less severe cystic dysplasia than Fgfr1/2ᴺᴾ⁻/⁻ To determine the role of Frs2α alone in nephron progenitors, we generated Six2creFrs2′Aᶠˡᵒˣ/ᶠˡᵒˣ (Frs2aᴺᴾ⁻/⁻) mice. Frs2aᴺᴾ⁻/⁻mice also develop nephron progenitor depletion and renal cysts, although these occurred later and were less severe than in the other Six2cre mutant mice. The nephron progenitor loss in all Six2cre mutant lines was associated with decreased Cited1 expression and increased apoptosis versus controls. FAC-sorted nephron progenitors in Six2cre Frs2′Aᶠˡᵒˣ/ᶠˡᵒˣ mice demonstrated evidence of increased Notch activity versus controls, which likely drives the progenitor defects. Thus, Fgfr1 and Fgfr2 have synergistic roles in maintaining nephron progenitors; furthermore, Fgfr signaling in nephron progenitors appears to be mediated predominantly by Frs2α.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal models 3aapoptosis 3abacterial artificial chromosomes 3abinding sites 3afibroblast growth factor receptor 1 3afibroblast growth factor receptor 2 3afibroblast growth factors 3akidneys 3amice 3amorphogenesis 3amutants 3apoint mutation 0aFibroblast growth factor receptors 0aFrs2α 0aNephron progenitors 0aKidney development1 aWalker, Kenneth A.1 aBushnell, Daniel1 aSchaefer, Caitlin1 aSims-Lucas, Sunder1 aPuri, Pawan1 aBates, Carlton M.0 tDevelopmental biology.g2015 Apr. 01, v. 400, no. 1 p.82-93dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12382x0012-16067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2015.01.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02662naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245012900178300001300307500001500320520104500335592002801380650001101408650002001419650004401439650002201483650001301505650001201518650001701530650001401547650001801561650001901579650000901598650003301607650004401640650001101684650001901695650001401714650001601728653002501744653002501769653002401794653002801818653001801846653003001864700002001894700003001914773009401944856008502038852000902123655001202132IND60565015420221122051058.0180831e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056501542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2017.02.0732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSavaliya, Mehulkumar L.12aA simple and sustainable process for the preparation of fuel grade esters using PE-Si composite: A reusable catalytic system  ap. 1-12.  a2019-12-06  aAn exploration of biodiesel preparation from nontraditional oil is one of the efficacious practice to answer a finite amount of raw materials of higher expenses. The main aim of this study is to upgrade the reaction process parameters (lauric acid to methanol molar ratio, reaction temperature, reaction time and % (w/w) PE-Si catalyst loading) for the preparation of fuel grade esters (methyl laureate) derived from lauric acid. Therefore, in the present work, a silica anchored sulfonic acid mediated polyol (PE-Si) composite was prepared via chloro-sulfonation of pentaerythritol and employed as an environmentally benign catalyst for single step conversion of lauric acid to fuel grade esters via esterification reaction. The PE-Si composite was evaluated by FT-IR, XRD, TPD-NH3, SEM, TGA-DTA and BET surface area analysis. Whereas, the synthesized methyl laureate (ML) was clearly evaluated by FT-IR, ¹H NMR and ¹³C NMR spectroscopy. Besides, fuel properties of fuel grade esters were measured and compared with ASTM fuel standards.  aPublisher supplied data 3asilica 3adodecanoic acid 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3amethanol 3apolyols 3asurface area 3acatalysts 3araw materials 3aesterification 3aoils 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aesters 3asulfonic acids 3abiodiesel 3atemperature 0aNon-edible feedstock 0aMethyl laureate fuel 0aASTM fuel standards 0aFatty acid alkyl esters 0asulfonic acid 0aSilica supported catalyst1 aPatel, Pooja J.1 aDholakiya, Bharatkumar Z.0 tRenewable energy.g2017 Aug., v. 109 p.1-12dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2017.02.0733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02750naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245011100169300001600280520116200296592002801458650002501486650001801511650002201529650001801551650001401569650001301583650002401596650001201620650001701632650002101649650001901670650001601689650003201705650002201737650002101759650004401780653002501824653001401849653003001863653002601893653001501919700001601934700001501950700001401965700001501979700005501994773007802049856008402127852000902211655001202220IND60581151520221122194535.0171005e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058115152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fitote.2015.10.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Deng-Gao10aCoumarins with α-glucosidase and α-amylase inhibitory activities from the flower of Edgeworthia gardneri  ap. 122-127.  aThe flower of Edgeworthia gardneri is consumed in beverages in Tibet and has potential health benefits for diabetes. As a part of our continuous studies on dietary supplements for diabetes, two monomers, five dimers and one trimer of coumarins were isolated from the flowers of E. gardneri. One dimer was a new compound (1) and its structure was determined by spectroscopic methods, including multiple NMR techniques and mass spectrometry. The inhibitory activities of all coumarins against α-amylase and α-glucosidase were evaluated. Compound 4 displayed potent inhibitory effect on both α-amylase and α-glucosidase, with an IC50 of 90 and 86μg/mL, respectively. The IC50 of compound 3 against α-glucosidase was 18.7μg/mL, and its inhibition mode was noncompetitive. Based on the fluorescence analysis, the binding constant and the number of binding sites of compound 3 were calculated as 2.05×105 and 1.24, respectively. Furthermore, the interaction between compound 3 and α-glucosidase was a spontaneous process that was driven mainly by hydrophobic force. This study could facilitate the utilization of E gardneri as functional food ingredient.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEdgeworthia gardneri 3aalpha-amylase 3aalpha-glucosidase 3abinding sites 3acoumarins 3adiabetes 3adietary supplements 3aflowers 3afluorescence 3afunctional foods 3ahydrophobicity 3aingredients 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amass spectrometry 3amedicinal plants 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 0aEdgeworthia gardneri 0aCoumarins 0aα-Glucosidase inhibition 0aα-Amylase inhibition 0aHerbal tea1 aZhou, Ai-Yu1 aDu, Zhiyun1 aZhang, Yu1 aZhang, Kun1 aMa, Yan-Yan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8639-712X0 tFitoterapia.g2015 Dec., v. 107 p.122-127dElsevier B.V.x0367-326X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fitote.2015.10.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03027naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245013700169300001400306520158700320592002801907650001501935650001701950650001801967650001301985650002401998650003002022650001202052650003702064650002002101650001102121650002902132650002602161650002102187653001702208653000902225653000902234653000802243653001902251653001102270700001902281700002002300773014502320856008302465852000902548655001202557IND60581378720221123044216.0181120e20160909xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058137872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.07.1072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHahm, Jong Ryeal10aRKIP phosphorylation–dependent ERK1 activation stimulates adipogenic lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes overexpressing LC3  ap. 12-17.  a3T3-L1 preadipocytes undergo adipogenesis in response to treatment with dexamethaxone, 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine, and insulin (DMI) through activation of several adipogenic transcription factors. Many autophagy-related proteins are also highly activated in the earlier stages of adipogenesis, and the LC3 conjugation system is required for formation of lipid droplets. Here, we investigated the effect of overexpression of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-LC3 fusion protein on adipogenesis. Overexpression of GFP-LC3 in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes using poly-l-lysine-assisted adenoviral GFP-LC3 transduction was sufficient to produce intracellular lipid droplets. Indeed, GFP-LC3 overexpression stimulated expression of some adipogenic transcription factors (e.g., C/EBPα or β, PPARγ, SREBP2). In particular, SREBP2 was highly activated in preadipocytes transfected with adenoviral GFP-LC3. Also, phosphorylation of Raf kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP) at serine 153, consequently stimulating extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK)1 activity, was significantly increased during adipogenesis induced by either poly-l-lysine-assisted adenoviral GFP-LC3 transduction or culture in the presence of dexamethasone, 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine, and insulin. Furthermore, RKIP knockdown promoted ERK1 and PPARγ activation, and significantly increased the intracellular accumulation of triacylglycerides in DMI-induced adipogenesis. In conclusion, GFP-LC3 overexpression in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes stimulates adipocyte differentiation via direct modulation of RKIP-dependent ERK1 activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipocytes 3aadipogenesis 3adexamethasone 3adroplets 3agene overexpression 3agreen fluorescent protein 3ainsulin 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aphosphorylation 3aserine 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atriacylglycerols 0aAdipogenesis 0aRKIP 0aERK1 0aLC3 0aLipid droplets 0a3T3-L11 aAhmed, Mahmoud1 aKim, Deok Ryong0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2016 Sept. 09, v. 478, no. 1 p.12-17dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.07.1073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02110naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245008400162300001800246520097700264592002801241650002601269650001601295650001101311650001201322650001401334650002301348650001201371650001701383700002001400700005601420700005901476773013501535856008101670852000901751655001201760IND60769189920221117175644.0220303e20220221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076918992DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.1c094242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Yu-Xin10aAssessing the Performance of Screening MM/PBSA in Protein–Ligand Interactions  ap. 1700-1708.  aAccurate calculation of the binding free energies between a protein and a ligand is the primary objective of structure-based drug design, but it still remains a challenging problem. In this work, we apply the screening molecular mechanics/Poisson Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) method to calculate the binding affinity of protein–ligand interactions. Our results show that the performance of the screening MM/PBSA is better than that of the standard MM/PBSA, especially in a charged-ligand system. In addition, we also investigate the effect of the solute dielectric constant on the results, and find that the optimal solute dielectric constants are different between the neutral-ligand system and the charged-ligand system. Moreover, we also evaluate the effect of the atomic-charge methods on the performance of the screening MM/PBSA. The present study demonstrates that the screening MM/PBSA should be a reliable method for calculating binding energy of biosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3adielectric properties 3adrug design 3aenergy 3aligands 3amechanics 3aphysical chemistry 3asolutes 3asurface area1 aSheng, Yan-Jing1 aMa, Yu-Qiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5433-31991 aDing, Hong-Ming1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9224-47790 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2022 Feb. 21, v. 126, no. 8 p.1700-1708dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.1c094243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03377naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001700156245015100173520168000324592002802004650002102032650002702053650002802080650000902108650001102117650003502128650002602163650001602189650001302205650001702218650001402235650001402249650001702263650002402280650001802304653003002322653001402352653001402366653002102380653001902401700001702420700001202437700001802449700001902467700001602486700001902502700001902521700001402540700002202554700001502576700001502591773009302606856009102699852000902790655001202799IND60678371720221120084845.0220523e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067837172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.1196682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Ya-Xuan10aMitochondria-acting nanomicelles for destruction of cancer cells via excessive mitophagy/autophagy-driven lethal energy depletion and phototherapy  aMitophagy is a specific self-protective autophagic process that degrades damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria, and is generally considered to reduce the effectiveness of mitochondria-targeted therapies. Here, we report an energy depletion-based anticancer strategy by selectively activating excessive mitophagy in cancer cells. We fabricate a type of mitochondria-targeting nanomicelles via the self-assembly of D-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) and dc-IR825 (a near-infrared cyanine dye and a photothermal agent). The TPGS/dc-IR825 nanomicelles enable mitochondrial damage in cancer cells, which, for self-protection, activate two autophagic pathways, (1) mitophagy and (2) adenosine triphosphate (ATP) shortage-triggered autophagy. However, the excessive mitophagy/autophagy activities far surpass the degradative capacity of autolysosomes, leading to the formation of micrometer-sized vacuoles and degradation blockage. Immunofluorescence staining and Western blot analysis reveal that the nanomicelle-treated cancer cells are under severe ATP shortage, which eventually causes substantial cell death. Moreover, the nanomicelles intravenously injected into tumor-bearing mice show high tumor accumulation, long tumor retention, and inhibit the tumor growth by inducing excessive mitophagy/autophagy and energy depletion in tumor cells. Additional near-infrared laser irradiation treatment further enhances the in vitro and in vivo anticancer efficiencies of the nanomicelles, due to the excellent photothermal and photodynamic effects of dc-IR825. We believe that this work highlights the important role of mitophagy/autophagy in treating cancers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aadenosine triphosphate 3abiocompatible materials 3adyes 3aenergy 3afluorescent antibody technique 3aintravenous injection 3airradiation 3amicelles 3amitochondria 3amitophagy 3aneoplasms 3aphototherapy 3apolyethylene glycol 3asuccinic acid 0aMitochondrial dysfunction 0aAutophagy 0aMitophagy 0aEnergy depletion 0aCancer therapy1 aJia, Hao-Ran1 aGao, Ge1 aPan, Guang-Yu1 aJiang, Yao-Wen1 aLi, Penglin1 aZhou, Ningxuan1 aLi, Chengcheng1 aShe, Cong1 aUlrich, Nathan W.1 aChen, Zhan1 aWu, Fu-Gen0 tBiomaterials.g2020 Feb., v. 232 p.119668-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.1196683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02545naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001300144245010900157300002000266520110000286592002801386650002101414650002201435650001001457650000901467650001601476650001201492650001101504650002601515650001101541650001501552650001201567650001801579650003801597653001901635653001401654653002201668653001301690653001801703700001901721700001301740700001901753700001701772700001601789700001801805773012701823856008001950852000902030655001202039IND60580697520221118062816.0170927e20170927xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058069752DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b097962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Le10aSmall Molecular TGF-β1-Inhibitor-Loaded Electrospun Fibrous Scaffolds for Preventing Hypertrophic Scars  ap. 32545-32553.  aHypertrophic scarring (HS) is a disorder that occurs during wound healing and seriously depresses the quality of human life. Scar-inhibiting scaffolds, though bringing promise to HS prevention, face problems such as the incompatibility of the scaffold materials and the instability of bioactive molecules. Herein, we present a TGF-β1-inhibitor-doped poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL)/gelatin (PG) coelectrospun nanofibrous scaffold (PGT) for HS prevention during wound healing. The appropriate ratio of PCL to gelatin can avoid individual defects of the two materials and achieve an optimized mechanical property and biocompatibility. The TGF-β1 inhibitor (SB-525334) is a small molecule and is highly stable during electrospinning and drug release processes. The PGT effectively inhibits fibroblast (the major cell type contributing to scar formation) proliferation in vitro and successfully prevents HS formation during the healing of full-thickness model wounds on rabbit ear. Our strategy offers an excellent solution for potential large-scale production of scaffolds for clinical HS prevention.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatibility 3achemical elements 3adrugs 3aears 3afibroblasts 3agelatin 3ahumans 3amechanical properties 3amodels 3ananofibers 3arabbits 3atissue repair 3atransforming growth factor beta 1 0aco-electrospun 0ascaffolds 0aTGF-β1 inhibitor 0aantiscar 0awound healing1 aYang, Junchuan1 aRan, Bei1 aYang, Xinglong1 aZheng, Wenfu1 aLong, Yunze1 aJiang, Xingyu0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2017 Sept. 27, v. 9, no. 38 p.32545-32553dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b097963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03468naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245012200167300001800289520201500307592002802322650002102350650002302371650001102394650001902405650001702424650001102441650001802452650001202470650002202482650001802504650002102522650001902543650002902562650000902591650001302600650002002613650001902633650001102652650001602663700001902679700002102698700002102719700002002740773012302760856008202883852000902965655001202974IND60758268720221118061824.0211127e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075826872DNAL7 a10.1134/S10642293211001122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSokolova, L.

Specific features of СО₂ emission from soil as a result of short-term summer green manuring of fallow fields (during 35–40 days from sowing to plowing into the soil of Raphanus sativus var. oleifera Metzg) have been studied. This is a non-standard farming practice used in the forest-steppe zone of the Cis-Baikal Region. Changes in the seasonal dynamics of the CO₂ emission relative to the traditional black fallow were studied in three-year (2015–2017) field experiments on gray forest silt loamy soil. An increase in the intensity of CO₂ emission from the soil surface after the green mass is plowed into the soil was shown for two crop rotations. The total (May–September) CO₂ efflux from the soil in the variant with green manure was 1.3–1.6 times higher than that from the traditionally cultivated soil in all years of the experiment. The intensity of mineralization processes on the plots with green manure enhanced by 38–131% in comparison with that in the black fallow. The loss of carbon reached 19–79% of the amount accumulated in the net primary production. The range of fluctuations in the total CO₂ efflux from the soil depended on a combination of factors: hydrothermic conditions, the Cₒᵣg and Nₜₒₜ content in soil; the C-to-N ratio, the N and water contents in tissues of green manure, and the carbon stock in root and aboveground residues of the precursor. The correlation between the CO₂ efflux and the studied factors weakened in the following sequence: qualitative characteristics of the green mass of oil radish > initial soil fertility > carbon pool in residues of the precursor. The results obtained indicate that the application of green manure to the fallow field increases the CO₂ emission from gray forest soil during the warm season.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaphanus sativus 3aagricultural soils 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sinks 3afallow 3aforest steppe 3aforests 3agray forest soils 3agreen manures 3agreenhouse gases 3amineralization 3anet primary productivity 3aoils 3aradishes 3asilt loam soils 3asoil fertility 3asummer 3awarm season1 aZorina, S.

The numerical solution of the three-dimensional diffusion equation in Cartesian coordinates was obtained through the finite volume method, with a fully implicit formulation and boundary condition of the third kind. Process parameters were estimated by an optimizer using experimental data. A spatial distribution analysis was carried out for water effective diffusivity and moisture content in the apple slices. The results showed that the concentration of the osmotic solution used in the pretreatment influenced the drying process and that the mathematical model that considered a variable diffusivity and shrinkage was more suitable to describe the experimental data.  aThe second author would like to thank Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq) for supporting this study and for his research grant (Processes Number 302480/2015-3 and 444053/2014-0).  aPublisher supplied data  a302480/2015-3a444053/2014-0cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq) 3aapples 3adiffusivity 3adrying 3aequations 3aliquids 3amathematical models 3ashrinkage 3asucrose 3awater analysis 3awater content 0aConvective drying 0aoptimization 0asimulation 0afinite volume method 0adiffusivity spatial distribution1 aPereira da Silva, Wilton1 aEverton de Farias Aires, Juarez1 aFreire da Silva Júnior, Aluízio1 aMaria Diniz Pereira da Silva e Silva, Cleide0 tDrying technology.g2019 Dec. 10, v. 37, no. 16 p.2034-2046dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12238x1532-23007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07373937.2018.15495653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02741naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005800144245010600202300001800308520126300326592002801589650001301617650001301630650001301643650002201656653001701678653001901695653002001714653001701734653004401751700005301795700001501848700001601863700005601879700005401935700005901989700005702048773013902105856007802244852000902322655001202331IND60682631820221120064103.0200130e20191230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068263182DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b189192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Shusheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3010-796312aA Facile Strategy To Prepare Smart Coatings with Autonomous Self-Healing and Self-Reporting Functions  ap. 4870-4877.  aHerein, we report a smart coating with autonomous self-healing and self-reporting functions by simple integration of one-component microcapsules into the matrix without external intervention. The microcapsules containing hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) solution of aggregation-induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) were synthesized, and their properties, such as their composition, thermal stability, morphology, and damage-indicating ability, were investigated systematically. The AIEgen/HDI microcapsule-embedded coatings display adaptive self-repair of scratches and simultaneous high-contrast indication of the healed damage. Two commercialized AIEgens, tetraphenylethylene (TPE) and its derivative with dimethoxyl and benzylidene-methyloxazolone moieties (DM-TPE-BMO), were utilized as examples to demonstrate the feasibility of this concept in diverse polymer matrixes (including blue autofluorescent matrixes). It was found that the content of AIEgens can even be lowered to 0.05 wt %. This facile, economical, and feasible strategy toward the dual functions of self-repairing and self-sensing provides a new route for enhancing the longevity and reliability of polymer coatings, which is appealing and of great importance in practical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoatings 3amoieties 3apolymers 3athermal stability 0aself-healing 0aself-reporting 0apolymer coating 0amicrocapsule 0aaggregation-induced emission luminogens1 aHan, Ting1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1521-63331 aZhao, Ying1 aLuo, Wenjun1 aZhang, Zhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9102-13111 aSu, Haibin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9760-65671 aTang, Ben Zhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0293-964X1 aYang, Jinglei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9413-90160 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Dec. 30, v. 12, no. 4 p.4870-4877dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b189193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02222naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245007900175500001900254520109100273592002801364650000801392650001701400650000901417650001501426650001501441650002101456650001701477651001601494700002101510700002401531700002401555700002401579700002401603773012701627856008501754852000901839655001201848IND60735203420221116210448.0210423e20210405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073520342DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms90407602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aButina, Tatyana  V.10aExtended Evaluation of Viral Diversity in Lake Baikal through Metagenomics  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLake Baikal is a unique oligotrophic freshwater lake with unusually cold conditions and amazing biological diversity. Studies of the lake’s viral communities have begun recently, and their full diversity is not elucidated yet. Here, we performed DNA viral metagenomic analysis on integral samples from four different deep-water and shallow stations of the southern and central basins of the lake. There was a strict distinction of viral communities in areas with different environmental conditions. Comparative analysis with other freshwater lakes revealed the highest similarity of Baikal viromes with those of the Asian lakes Soyang and Biwa. Analysis of new data, together with previously published data allowed us to get a deeper insight into the diversity and functional potential of Baikal viruses; however, the true diversity of Baikal viruses in the lake ecosystem remains still unknown. The new metaviromic data will be useful for future studies of viral composition, distribution, and the dynamics associated with global climatic and anthropogenic impacts on this ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abiodiversity 3acold 3aecosystems 3afreshwater 3afreshwater lakes 3ametagenomics 3aLake Baikal1 aBukin, Yurij  S.1 aPetrushin, Ivan  S.1 aTupikin, Alexey  E.1 aKabilov, Marsel  R.1 aBelikov, Sergey  I.0 tMicroorganisms.g2021 Apr. 05, v. 9, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms90407603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02665naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245014500163300002000308520117000328592002801498650001601526650002601542650001501568650001201583650001901595650002101614650001301635650001601648650001801664653003801682653001501720653002901735653002501764653002801789700001901817700002001836700001801856700001601874700002001890700002001910700001901930700001801949773012701967856008002094852000902174655001202183IND60580697720221118062851.0170927e20170927xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058069772DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b098372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Tae-Woon10aFlexible Polymer/Metal/Polymer and Polymer/Metal/Inorganic Trilayer Transparent Conducting Thin Film Heaters with Highly Hydrophobic Surface  ap. 33129-33136.  aPolymer/metal/polymer and polymer/metal/inorganic trilayer-structured transparent electrodes with fluorocarbon plasma polymer thin film heaters have been proposed. The polymer/metal/polymer and polymer/metal/inorganic transparent conducting thin films fabricated on a large-area flexible polymer substrate using a continuous roll-to-roll sputtering process show excellent electrical properties and visible-light transmittance. They also exhibit water-repelling surfaces to prevent wetting and to remove contamination. In addition, the adoption of a fluorocarbon/metal/fluorocarbon film permits an outer bending radius as small as 3 mm. These films have a sheet resistance of less than 5 Ω sq–¹, sufficient to drive light-emitting diode circuits. The thin film heater with the fluorocarbon/Ag/SiNₓ structure exhibits excellent heating characteristics, with a temperature reaching 180 °C under the driving voltage of 13 V. Therefore, the proposed polymer/metal/polymer and polymer/metal/inorganic transparent conducting electrodes using polymer thin films can be applied in flexible and rollable displays as well as automobile window heaters and other devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomobiles 3aelectrical properties 3aelectrodes 3aheaters 3ahydrophobicity 3aperfluorocarbons 3apolymers 3atemperature 3atransmittance 0a polymer/metal/polymer electrode 0a Flexible 0apolymer composite target 0a  thin film heater 0aroll-to-roll sputtering1 aKim, Sung Hyun1 aKim, Cheol Hwan1 aLee, Sang-Mok1 aKim, Han-Ki1 aPark, Jae Seong1 aYi, Chae-hŭng,1 aYang, Yong Suk1 aLee, Sang-Jin0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2017 Sept. 27, v. 9, no. 38 p.33129-33136dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b098373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03316naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245015900209300001800368520182300386592002802209650002502237650002902262650001202291650001202303650001102315650001202326650001502338650001102353650001202364650001402376650002102390650001402411650002002425650001802445650001802463650001302481650001902494651001302513700002902526700001902555700001702574773016302591856008302754852000902837655001202846IND60737293620221122043127.0220108e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073729362DNAL7 a10.1007/s42690-020-00344-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTarekegn, Mihretu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8645-225610aEvaluation of larvicidal activities of Parthenium hysterophorus L. against Anopheles arabiensis (Diptera: Culicidae), the major malaria vector in Ethiopia  ap. 1461-1469.  aMalaria is a leading public health problem in Ethiopia despite the implementation of effective indoor vector control strategies over several decades. In the country, the use of botanicals to prevent the transmission of malaria is limited. This study aimed to evaluate the larvicidal activities of the extracts of the roots, stems, and leaves of Parthenium hysterophorus against the 4th instar larvae of Anopheles arabiensis. Field collected leaves, stems and root parts of P. hysterophorus were dried and separately ground to powder and extracted in petroleum ether, hexane, acetone, and ethanol solvents. The extracts were concentrated, and stock solutions were subject to serial dilutions for use as test concentrations. Laboratory reared 4th instar larvae of An. arabiensis were used for the larvicidal bioassays. Probit analysis was used to determine LC₅₀ and LC₉₀ of the extracts. There were significant differences in percentage larval mortalities (P < 0.05) among different concentrations of the leaf, stem, and root solvent extracts, respectively. Petroleum ether extracts of P. hysterophorus root were the most effective in causing very high larval mortality at 360 ppm and 480 ppm (98.3%) when compared to other extract of the plant parts. The LC₅₀ and LC₉₀ value of petroleum ether root extract (10.7 ppm and 105.5 ppm respectively) were significantly lower than those of ethanol, acetone, and hexane root extracts. Petroleum ether root extract of P. hysterophorus has remarkably high larvicidal potential against 4th instar larvae of An. arabiensis which could be exploited for malaria vector control. Further studies on the larvicidal efficacy of the extracts under field conditions and identification of the bioactive components in the root parts of this plant are recommended.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnopheles arabiensis 3aParthenium hysterophorus 3aacetone 3aethanol 3ahexane 3ainstars 3alarvicides 3aleaves 3amalaria 3amortality 3amosquito vectors 3apetroleum 3aprobit analysis 3apublic health 3aroot extracts 3asolvents 3avector control 3aEthiopia1 aWolde-hawariat, Yitbarek1 aDugassa, Sisay1 aTekie, Habte0 tInternational journal of tropical insect science.g2021 June, v. 41, no. 2 p.1461-1469dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:J000000093x1742-75927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42690-020-00344-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02255naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245012500168300001600293520100000309592002801309650001101337650001801348650001401366650001501380650001801395650002401413650002501437650001401462653002001476653001401496653001801510653002901528700002001557700001401577700001701591700001501608700001701623773009901640856008501739852000901824655001201833IND60732707120221119200434.0210506e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073270712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2021.03.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Haiyang10aUsefulness of adding magnetic nano-powders to water: Introducing novel criteria for assessing heat transfer applications  ap. 457-466.  aIn this study, the usefulness of adding Fe₃O₄ nanoparticles to water was considered, taking into account the energy demand management. Based on experimental measurements, an increase of 90% and 130% in thermal conductivity and viscosity has been experienced owing to loading Fe₃O₄. The nanofluid advantage over base fluid is assessed by evaluating the figure of merit (FOM) proposed by various researchers. Taking into account the Prasher, Garj, Lee and Timofeeva criterion, the use of Fe₃O₄/water nanofluid is acceptable. According to Tesfai criterion, up to 1 vol%, utilizing Fe₃O₄/water nanofluid has priority over the base fluid. A novel criterion was derived for assessing the heat transfer potential in a smooth tube subjected to constant surface temperature. It was found that the heat transfer potential depends on the number of transfer units (NTU). For NTU > 5, loading nanoparticles decreased the heat transfer potential up to 11% owing to a decrease in specific heat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aheat transfer 3amagnetism 3ananofluids 3aspecific heat 3asurface temperature 3athermal conductivity 3aviscosity 0aFigure of merit 0aNanofluid 0aEnergy demand 0aNumber of transfer units1 aLiang, Miaomiao1 aHe, Zemin1 aKang, Xiaoxi1 aZhao, Yang1 aZhao, Yuzhen0 tPowder technology.g2021 July, v. 386 p.457-466dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2021.03.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02817naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245011200160300001800272520134900290592002801639650001101667650001801678650002201696650001301718650002601731650002501757650001601782650001801798650001101816653002901827653002001856653002501876653003201901653004701933700001801980700002001998700001902018700001802037700001902055700005902074773013902133856007802272852000902350655001202359IND60682632020221122043126.0200130e20200103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068263202DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b189452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Hamin10aFlexible and Transparent Thin-Film Transistors Based on Two-Dimensional Materials for Active-Matrix Display  ap. 4749-4754.  aTwo-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted significant attention because of their outstanding electrical, mechanical, and optical characteristics. Because all of the conducting (graphene), semiconducting (molybdenum disulfide, MoS₂), and insulating (hexagonal boron nitride, h-BN) components can be constructed from 2D materials, thin-film transistors based on 2D materials (2D TFTs) have been developed. However, scaling-up is necessary for these technologies to go beyond their initial implementation using the mechanical exfoliation method. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to find a method to realize high flexibility and/or transparency to their full potential. In this study, large-scale, flexible, and transparent 2D TFTs are developed and demonstrated as a backplane in active-matrix organic light-emitting diodes (AMOLEDs). With the optical chemical vapor deposition of the 2D materials, flexible (bending radius < 1 mm) and transparent (transmittance > 70%) TFTs with high electrical performances (mobility ≈ 10 cm² V–¹ s–¹, on/off current ratio > 10⁶) can be achieved. Furthermore, 2D TFTs are integrated into OLEDs by connecting the source electrode of the TFT to the anode of the OLED via a single graphene film, thus demonstrating pixel-by-pixel driving through a 2D TFT array in an active-matrix configuration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3aboron nitride 3afilms (materials) 3agraphene 3alight emitting diodes 3amolybdenum disulfide 3atransistors 3atransmittance 3avapors 0atwo-dimensional material 0aheterostructure 0athin-film transistor 0aflexible/transparent device 0aactive-matrix organic light-emitting diode1 aOh, Dong-Sik,1 aLee, Khang June1 aJung, Dae Yool1 aLee, Seunghee1 aYoo, Seunghyup1 aChoi, Sung-Yool1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0960-71460 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Jan. 03, v. 12, no. 4 p.4749-4754dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b189453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01773naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245005400165520089700219592002801116650001801144650001701162650001801179650001501197650001701212700002201229700002101251773012701272856007501399852000901474655001201483IND60760740620221117215458.0211223e20211126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076074062DNAL7 a10.3390/md191206662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMourelle, M.

Their effects are attributed to their components, i.e., to the properties and action of mineral waters, clays, and their biological fraction, which may be made up of microalgae, cyanobacteria, and other organisms present in water and clays. There are many studies on the therapeutic use of peloids made with microalgae/cyanobacteria, but very little research has been done on dermocosmetic applications. Such research demonstrates their potential as soothing, regenerating, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial agents. In this work, a method for the manufacture of a dermocosmetic peloid is presented based on the experience of the authors and existing publications, with indications for its characterization and study of its efficacy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3aantioxidants 3amanufacturing 3amicroalgae 3atherapeutics1 aGómez, Carmen P.1 aLegido, José L.0 tMarine drugs.g2021 Nov. 26, v. 19, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21403x1660-33977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md191206663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03694naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245014500166300001800311520189800329592002802227650004402255650001302299650003502312650002602347650002402373650001402397650000702411650001502418650001902433650001302452650001002465650002902475650001602504650002102520650003702541650000902578653001702587653004602604653005902650653003302709653003402742700001602776700001702792700001902809700001502828700001502843700001602858700001702874700001202891773013102903856008503034852000903119655001203128IND60530552420171220000000.0160721e20151207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053055242DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.5b013842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Chen10a“Smart” Fertilizer with Temperature- and pH-Responsive Behavior via Surface-Initiated Polymerization for Controlled Release of Nutrients  ap. 3157-3166.  aWith the fast development of sustainable modern agriculture, there has been a shift toward the development of controlled/slow release fertilizers (CSRFs) that can overcome current limitations of conventional fertilizers. Ideally, CSRFs would release nutrient matching plants demands, even when environmental conditions fluctuate. However, no current CSRFs meet this ideal, especially as nutrient release is affected by temperature and pH. In this study, a “smart” fertilizer with polymer brushes of poly(N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) grafting from polydopamine-coated ammonium zinc phosphate via surface-initiated atom-transfer radical polymerization is reported. The structure and morphology of the fertilizer were measured by transmission electron microscopy (TEM); the composition of the product was determined with Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and inductively coupled plasma (ICP) emission spectrometer. Dual-responsive controlled-release behaviors were characterized in water by spectrophotometry and ICP, and results demonstrate the “smart” fertilizer shows excellent temperature- and pH-responsive behavior to release nutrients according to the ambient environment. The nutrients release rate can be obviously accelerated in an acidic pH (below pKₐ) medium at a definite temperature. In addition, low temperature (below LCST) can accelerate the nutrients release rate in a basic medium (above pKₐ), which is contrasting to the reduction of nutrients release rate at high temperature (above LCST) in the same medium. The pH- and temperature-responsive “smart” fertilizer will improve nutrients availability and avoid excessive release of nutrients causing damage to plant roots at high temperature, which indicating that the stimuli-responsive system has potential application in sustainable modern agriculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aammonium 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3aenvironmental factors 3amineral fertilizers 3anutrients 3apH 3aphosphates 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3aroots 3aslow-release fertilizers 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 3atransmission electron microscopy 3azinc 0aPolydopamine 0aPoly(N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) 0aSurface-initiated atom-transfer radical polymerization 0aTemperature- and pH-response 0aControlled-release fertilizer1 aLü, Shaoyu1 aGao, Xuefen,1 aWang, Xinggang1 aXu, Xiubin1 aXiao, Bai,1 aGao, Nannan1 aLiu, Mingzhu1 aWu, Lan0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2015 Dec. 07, v. 3, no. 12 p.3157-3166dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.5b013843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02809naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245008600165300001600251520162000267592002801887650001501915650002201930650001501952650001801967650001201985650001101997650001502008650001602023653002702039653003202066653003102098653002502129653003102154700001702185700001602202773009902218856008502317852000902402655001202411IND60732707220221119195932.0210506e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073270722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2021.03.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKong, Yong10aHydrodynamic dead zone in multiphase geophysical flows impacting a rigid obstacle  ap. 335-349.  aWhen a gravity-driven solid-fluid mixture, such as those in geophysical flows, hits a wall-like rigid obstacle, a metastable jammed zone called hydrodynamic dead zone (HDZ) may emerge. The unjammed-jammed transition of HDZ, controlled by the intricate interactions among the obstacle, the fluid and the solid of the flow, remains an open issue to be quantified for thorough understanding its underlying physics and mechanics. This study employs a coupled Computational Fluid Dynamics and Discrete Element Method (CFD-DEM) to examine the characteristics of HDZ formed when a geophysical flow comprised of gap-graded particles and a viscous liquid impacts an obstacle. To identify key features in the zonation of HDZ, a modified granular temperature is proposed considering the influences of inherent polydispersity and both translational and rotational motions of the particles in the impacting mixture. A source-sink model is further established to offer an interpretation of the nonlinear energy dissipation process during the unjammed-jammed transition of HDZ, where the modified granular temperature serves as a function of either time or distance. The structural anisotropy is found to serve as a good indicator for illuminating the flow-structure interaction transitions. Three regimes, namely, impact-up, roll-up and heap-up regimes, have been identified according to the statistical energy conversion and dissipation in the flowing layer upon the HDZ. The influence of particle rotation is found to be more significant in the dynamical exchange of HDZ when the impacting flow contains a wider polydispersity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3aenergy conversion 3ageophysics 3ahydrodynamics 3aliquids 3amodels 3atechnology 3atemperature 0aHydrodynamic dead zone 0aMultiphase geophysical flow 0aFluid-particle interaction 0aGranular temperature 0aUnjammed-jammed transition1 aZhao, Jidong1 aLi, Xingyue0 tPowder technology.g2021 July, v. 386 p.335-349dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2021.03.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02397naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245009600159300002000255520114400275592002801419650002301447650001501470650002001485650001801505650001601523653001801539653003901557653002901596653002901625653002201654700001601676700001601692700001701708700001401725700001301739700001901752773012701771856008001898852000901978655001201987IND60580698020221118063015.0170927e20170927xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058069802DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b099392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Lei10aNovel Smart Microreactors Equipped with Responsive Catalytic Nanoparticles on Microchannels  ap. 33137-33148.  aNowadays efficient and reliable control of highly exothermic reactions to effectively prevent overheating or even explosions still remains a challenging task, although newly developed microreactor technology has shown promise. Here, we report a novel smart microreactor system equipped with responsive catalytic nanoparticles on microchannels for self-regulated control over highly exothermic reactions by responding to the reaction-generated heat. On the basis of shrinking/swelling behaviors of polymeric networks in the responsive catalytic nanoparticles, the smart microreactor could respond to the change of reaction temperature to tune the catalysis activity of catalytic particles in a thermo-feedback process. As a breakthrough result, highly exothermic reactions carried out in such a microreactor can be well-controlled in a self-regulation process without any manual assistance, efficiently ensuring the safety of the reaction. Such smart responsive catalytic systems have high potential and are attractive as a new generation of efficient tools that feature a self-regulation property for highly exothermic catalytic reactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3aexplosions 3aheat production 3ananoparticles 3atemperature 0amicroreactors 0aresponsive catalytic nanoparticles 0achemical self-regulation 0aself-adjustable kinetics 0aphase transitions1 aLiu, Zhuang1 aLiu, Lu-Yue1 aJu, Xiao-Jie1 aWang, Wei1 aXie, Rui1 aChu, Liang-Yin0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2017 Sept. 27, v. 9, no. 38 p.33137-33148dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b099393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02422naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245010700171300001600278520120600294592002801500650001301528650001101541650001401552650001101566650001601577650002101593650001301614650002901627650002001656653002601676653002701702653001601729653001401745653002201759700001601781700002401797773009701821856008501918852000902003655001202012IND60565016120221122051127.0180831e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056501612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2017.02.0822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrowne, Maria C.10aInvestigation of the corrosive properties of phase change materials in contact with metals and plastic  ap. 555-568.  aPhase change material (PCM) is used as a means of storing thermal energy. The method of PCM containment in thermal energy storage (TES) systems is important as the material is in direct contact with metal piping, plates and housing units which can be damaged if the material is corrosive. The compatibility of PCM with various materials for use in TES applications has been investigated using the immersion corrosion method and suggestions to minimise their corrosive behaviour or to mitigate it by using an alternative PCM have been presented and are described in the following paper. The metals and plastics tested were copper, brass, aluminium, stainless steel, mild steel and Perspex. These were immersed in five different PCM, three fatty acids, a salt hydrate and Micronal® for a period of 722 days. Stainless steel was determined to be the most suitable of all the PCM investigated. Aluminium can be used with all fatty acids, however caution is advised as the maximum corrosion rate was found to be 12.4 m g/cm²year. Copper and brass can be encapsulated using fatty acid and again caution is advised as corrosion rates were found to be 22.15 g/cm²year and 1.67 g/cm²year, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3acopper 3acorrosion 3aenergy 3afatty acids 3aphase transition 3aplastics 3arenewable energy sources 3astainless steel 0aPhase change material 0aThermal energy storage 0aContainment 0aCorrosion 0aMetal and plastic1 aBoyd, Ellen1 aMcCormack, Sarah J.0 tRenewable energy.g2017 Aug., v. 108 p.555-568dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2017.02.0823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02993naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245017900158300001800337520166600355592002802021650001402049650002902063650001802092650004102110650001102151650001402162650003702176650001502213650002702228650001602255650002302271700001502294700001702309700001502326700001702341700001502358773012702373856007402500852000902574655001202583IND60656619820221123033038.0190814e20130214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065661982DNAL7 a10.1039/c2ay26191j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuan, Xinchao10aFast chemical fingerprinting analysis for biodiesel/diesel blends using commercial solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridge and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS)  ap. 1205-1213.  aCommercially available solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridges were combined with GC–MS for fast cleanup and fractionation of biodiesel/diesel samples in oil fingerprinting analysis. Several commercially available SPE cartridges (e.g., silica gel/cyanopropyl (SiO₂/C₃–CN) and extractable petroleum hydrocarbons (EPH) fractionation cartridges), were employed for the fractionation of biodiesel/diesel blends into aliphatic, aromatic hydrocarbons, and fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs). The SiO₂/C₃–CN (1 g/0.5 g) SPE cartridge could not separate biodiesel from petroleum hydrocarbons effectively, however, the 5 g EPH SPE cartridge successfully separated blended samples into aliphatic, aromatic and FAME fractions by eluting with 15 mL of hexane, 15 mL of dichloromethylene (DCM)/hexane (1 : 1, v/v), and 18 mL of DCM, respectively. No cross-elution was observed among aliphatic, aromatic and FAME fractions when the loading mass of blends was less than 8 mg. The relative standard deviations (RSD) for five replicate SPE–GC–MS analyses of 5 mg of diesel blended with 20% biodiesel (volume/volume) and soybean oil ranged from 3.4% to 33.2%, 4.3% to 18.7% and 5.4% to 29.2% for selected alkane, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and FAMEs, respectively. The final recovery rates of surrogates for aliphatic, aromatic and FAME fractions ranged from 82.5 to 91.1%. This developed method was successfully used for the fingerprinting analysis of three simulated blend samples. The concentration profiles of target compounds and the blended level are both comparable to those obtained by the conventional silica gel column–GC–MS method.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiesel 3afatty acid methyl esters 3afractionation 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahexane 3apetroleum 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3asilica gel 3asolid phase extraction 3asoybean oil 3astandard deviation1 aYang, Zeyu1 aXie, Hongqin1 aXiong, Wei1 aPan, Zengkai1 aChen, Liya0 tAnalytical methods.g2013 Feb. 14, v. 5, no. 5 p.1205-1213dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2ay26191j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04848naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001400188245011400202300001200316506007600328520256200404592002802966596005902994596007403053596005103127506003703178650001103215650001803226650001603244650002603260650004903286650001203335650001903347650001903366650001203385650001303397650003103410650001003441650003503451650001703486650001303503650001103516650002503527650001503552650001603567650002103583650001903604650002403623650001303647650002103660650001003681650001303691650002003704650001403724650002903738650001103767700001203778700001803790700001303808700001403821700001203835700001603847700001403863700001703877773010503894856008203999852000904081655001204090IND60586654420221207144453.0200107e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058665442DNAL7 a291620402pmid7 aPMC56989612pmcid7 a10.1186/s12870-017-1150-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Jing10aCloning and expression of BpMYC4 and BpbHLH9 genes and the role of BpbHLH9 in triterpenoid synthesis in birch  ap. 214.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Birch (Betula platyphylla Suk.) contains triterpenoids with anti-HIV and anti-tumor pharmacological activities. However, the natural abundance of these triterpenoids is low, and their chemical synthesis is costly. Transcription factors have the ability to regulate the metabolite pathways of triterpenoids via multi-gene control, thereby improving metabolite yield. Thus, transcription factors have the potential to facilitate the production of birch triterpenoids. Plant bHLH (basic helix-loop-helix) transcription factors play important roles in stress response and secondary metabolism. RESULTS: In this study, we cloned two genes, BpMYC4 and BpbHLH9, that encode bHLH transcription factors in Betula platyphylla Suk. The open reading frame (ORF) of BpMYC4 was 1452 bp and encoded 483 amino acids, while the ORF of BpbHLH9 was 1140 bp and encoded 379 amino acids. The proteins of BpMYC4 and BpbHLH9 were localized in the cell membrane and nucleus. The tissue-specific expression patterns revealed that BpMYC4 expression in leaves was similar to that in the stem and higher than in the roots. The expression of BpbHLH9 was higher in the leaves than in the root and stem. The expressions of BpMYC4 and BpbHLH9 increased after treatment with abscisic acid, methyl jasmonate, and gibberellin and decreased after treatment with ethephon. The promoters of BpMYC4 and BpbHLH9 were isolated using a genome walking approach, and 900-bp and 1064-bp promoter sequences were obtained for BpMYC4 and BpbHLH9, respectively. The ORF of BpbHLH9 was ligated into yeast expression plasmid pYES3 and introduced into INVScl and INVScl1-pYES2-SS yeast strains. The squalene and total triterpenoid contents in the different INVScl1 transformants decreased in the following order INVScl1-pYES-SS-bHLH9 > INVScl1-pYES3-bHLH9 > INVScl1-pYES2- BpSS > INVScl-pYES2. In BpbHLH9 transgenic birch, the relative expression of the genes that encodes for enzymes critical for triterpenoid synthesis showed a different level of up-regulation compair with wild birch(control), and the contents of betulinic acid, oleanolic acid and betulin in bHLH9–8 transgenic birch were increased by 11.35%, 88.34% and 23.02% compared to in wild birch, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that the modulation of BpbHLH9 by different hormones affected triterpenoid synthesis and triterpenoid contents. This is the first report of the cloning of BpbHLH9, and the findings are important for understanding the regulatory role of BpbHLH9 in the synthesis of birch triterpenoids.  aPublisher supplied data  a31570589cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a257-2017DY02cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities  aJ1210053cNational basic science training fund0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBetula 3aabscisic acid 3aamino acids 3aantiretroviral agents 3abasic helix-loop-helix transcription factors 3abetulin 3abetulinic acid 3acell membranes 3aenzymes 3aethephon 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agenetically modified organisms 3agibberellins 3ahormones 3aleaves 3amedicinal properties 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3amethyl jasmonate 3aoleanolic acid 3aopen reading frames 3aplasmids 3apromoter regions 3aroots 3asqualene 3astress response 3asynthesis 3atranscription (genetics) 3ayeasts1 aLi, Xin1 aZhan, Yaguang1 aLi, Ying1 aQu, Ziyue1 aSun, Lu1 aWang, Siyao1 aYang, Jie1 aXiao, Jialei0 tBMC plant biology.g2017 Dec., v. 17, no. 1 p.214-214dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-017-1150-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02211naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005600146245009800202300001800300520114100318592002801459650001101487650001401498650002301512650001601535650002201551650001301573650002501586700006101611773013501672856008101807852000901888655001201897IND60769190820220517000000.0220303e20220218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076919082DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.2c002182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNandi, Ashim1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1090-766410aHeavy-Atom Tunneling in the Covalent/Dative Bond Complexation of Cyclo[18]carbon–Piperidine  ap. 1799-1804.  aRecent quantum chemical computations demonstrated the electron-acceptance behavior of this highly reactive cyclo[18]carbon (C₁₈) ring with piperidine (pip). The C₁₈–pip complexation exhibited a double-well potential along the N–C reaction coordinate, forming a van der Waals (vdW) adduct and a more stable, strong covalent/dative bond (DB) complex by overcoming a low activation barrier. By means of direct dynamical computations using canonical variational transition state theory (CVT), including the small-curvature tunneling (SCT), we show the conspicuous role of heavy atom quantum mechanical tunneling (QMT) in the transformation of vdW to DB complex in the solvent phase near absolute zero. Below 50 K, the reaction is entirely driven by QMT, while at 30 K, the QMT rate is too rapid (kT ∼ 0.02 s–¹), corresponding to a half-life time of 38 s, indicating that the vdW adduct will have a fleeting existence. We also explored the QMT rates of other cyclo[n]carbon–pip systems. This study sheds light on the decisive role of QMT in the covalent/DB formation of the C₁₈–pip complex at cryogenic temperatures.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3ahalf life 3aphysical chemistry 3apiperidines 3aquantum mechanics 3asolvents 3avan der Waals forces1 aMartin, Jan M.

The power of the functional trait approach is its generality, predictive capacity such as with respect to environmental change, and, through linkage of response and effect traits, the synthesis of community assembly with ecosystem function and services. Lichens are a potentially rich source of information about how traits govern community structure and function, thereby creating opportunity to better integrate lichens into ‘mainstream’ ecological studies, while lichen ecology and conservation can also benefit from using the trait approach as an investigative tool. This paper brings together a range of author perspectives to review the use of traits in lichenology, particularly with respect to European ecosystems from the Mediterranean to the Arctic-Alpine. It emphasizes the types of traits that lichenologists have used in their studies, both response and effect, the bundling of traits towards the evolution of life-history strategies, and the critical importance of scale (both spatial and temporal) in functional trait ecology.  aPublisher supplied data 3acommunity structure 3aecological function 3aevolution 3ainformation sources 3alichens 3alife history 3ataxonomy1 aAsplund, Johan 1 aBenesperi, Renato 1 aBranquinho, Cristina 1 aDi Nuzzo, Luca 1 aHurtado, Pilar 1 aMartinez, Isabel,1 aMatos, Paula 1 aNascimbene, Juri 1 aPinho, Pedro 1 aPrieto, María 1 aRocha, Bernardo 1 aRodríguez-Arribas, Clara 1 aThüs, Holger,1 aGiordani, Paolo 0 tMicroorganisms.g2021 Apr. 06, v. 9, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms90407663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02635naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245010900168300001800277520152400295592002801819650001101847650001801858650001301876650001001889650001501899650001901914650002001933650001601953650001501969651001001984651001301994700002102007700001902028773012302047856008202170852000902252655001202261IND60758269520221118061925.0211127e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075826952DNAL7 a10.1134/S10642293211000692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGolubtsov, V. A.10aEffect of Humidity on the Stable Carbon Isotopic Composition of Soil Organic Matter in the Baikal Region  ap. 1463-1474.  aThe stable carbon isotopes of organic matter in humus horizons of soils of the Baikal region have been studied. A wide range of soil forming factors makes it possible to identify the most important ones that determine the carbon isotopic composition of organic matter. Depending on the landscape and climatic conditions, the δ¹³C values range from –29.91 to –22.98‰. The lowest values are typical of the landscapes with the highest humidity. Analysis of the carbon fractionation factors suggests that the influence of climatic factors on ¹³C discrimination during the photosynthesis by C3 plants plays the leading role in the observed differences in the isotopic composition of soils. With an increase in precipitation during the vegetation season, the δ¹³C values in soil organic matter decrease by 1.35‰ for every 100 mm of precipitation. These values are in good agreement with isotopic gradients in the adjacent areas of Mongolia and China and reflect a considerable sensitivity of plants that form soil organic matter to the changes in humidity. Although pairwise linear regressions do not show any significant dependence of the δ¹³C values on temperature, its effect appears in an indirect manner via moistening index displaying a maximum negative correlation. Thus, not only precipitation, but also heat to moisture ratio during the vegetation season with the most intensive biological and soil processes to the greatest degree influence the carbon isotopic composition of soil organic matter.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3afractionation 3ahumidity 3ahumus 3alandscapes 3aphotosynthesis 3astable isotopes 3atemperature 3avegetation 3aChina 3aMongolia1 aVanteeva, Yu.
