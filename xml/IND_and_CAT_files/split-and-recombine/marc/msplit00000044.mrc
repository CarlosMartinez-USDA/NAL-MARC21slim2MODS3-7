The importance and role of rodents in ecosystems and the specifics associated with their research using the NIRS method are briefly mentioned. The results of previous partial studies are mentioned and discussed. The NIRS method proved to be a useful tool to determine the amount of a particular food ingredient in the diet from faeces or chyme and to estimate the food quality (i.e., diversity of nitrogenous substances in chyme). On this basis, other possible directions of research using the NIRS method in wild rodents are proposed. These could help to better understand both the relationship between rodents and their environment and practical management in sectors where rodents interfere with human interests, especially in agriculture and forestry.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiet 3afeces 3afood composition 3afood quality 3aforestry 3ahumans1 aJánová, Eva 1 aSuchomel, Josef 1 aHeroldová, Marta 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Aug. 18, v. 13, no. 16dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs131632683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02008naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002700112245010100139300001600240506002800256520097000284592002801254506003701282650001901319650001201338650001401350650002101364650002201385650004701407653001801454653002001472653001301492653002101505700002101526773010201547852000901649655001201658IND60784696620221207144659.0120120e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078469662DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPOERBA, YUYU SURYASARI10aGenetic variability among 18 cultivars of cooking bananas and plantains by RAPD and ISSR markers  ap. 118-123.  aResource is Open Access  aPoerba YS, Ahmad F (2010) Genetic variability among 18 cultivars of cooking bananas and plantains by RAPD and ISSR markers.

This study was done to assess the molecular diversity of 36 accessions (18 cultivars) of the plantain and cooking bananas (Musa acuminata x M. balbisiana, AAB, ABB subgroups) based on Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and and Inter Simple Sequence Repeats (ISSR) markers and to determine genetic relationships in the bananas. RAPD and ISSR fingerprinting of these banana varieties was carried out by five primers of RAPDs and two primers of ISSRs. RAPD primers produced 63 amplified fragments varying from 250 to 2500 bp in size. 96.82% of the amplification bands were polymorphic. ISSR primers produced 26 amplified fragments varying from 350 bp to 2000 bp in size. The results showed that 92.86% of the amplification bands were polymorphic. The range of genetic distance of 18 cultivars was from 0.06-0.67.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMusa acuminata 3abananas 3acultivars 3agenetic distance 3agenetic variation 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 0aRAPD analysis 0aMusa balbisiana 0aplantain 0acooking bananas.1 aAHMAD, FAJARUDIN0 tBiodiversitas.g2010 July, v. 11, no. 3 p.118-123dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle01143naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003700148245005300185300002100238520020600259592002800465650002000493650001900513650001700532650002000549650002300569700002000592700002700612700002000639773007900659856008200738852000900820655001200829IND60582801420221119173813.0171008e20170824xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058280142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2017.08.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartínez-Zamudio, Ricardo Iván10aSnapShot: Cellular Senescence in Pathophysiology  ap. 1044-1044.e1.  aCellular senescence is a fundamental cell fate, important both in physiological and pathophysiological processes.

In this study, we focused on environmental changes, that is, natural disasters and human activities, in the Poyang Lake Basin over the past 2000 years, to analyze interactions between land use cover changes and human activities from the perspective of regional sustainable development. We collected historical records of climate and hydrology, floods and droughts, and rivers and lakes in the Poyang Lake area, and established time sequences for the floods and droughts, lake water level and lake area, amount of farming land, and population, in order to discuss interactions between changes in the environment and the climate, with emphasis on the impacts of extreme events on lake and river basin environment changes. The following results were obtained. First, climate changes in historical periods had wide-ranging and far-reaching impacts on agricultural production, especially disasters caused by climate change. Among the changes in the Poyang Lake basin environment, including river network systems, lake water levels, etc., changes in lake water volume are direct evidence of climate change, adaptation to climate change, and obvious phased characteristics. Second, in the process of changes to the lake and river network in the Poyang Lake Basin, social and economic development is accompanied by evolution of the lake. Increases and decreases in population, the scale of agricultural production, and lake environment changes have direct and significant interactions. Third, the Poyang Lake basin’s environmental changes during the historical period are mainly reflected in the pressure feedback mode of “population–agriculture” in the lake environment.  aFunding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The research was funded by the National Social Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 18BZS154), Key Platforms and Scientific Research Projects in Universities in Guangdong Province of China (Grant No. 2018KTSCX212), and Guangdong Rural Science and Technology Commissioner Project of China (163-2019-XMZC-0009-02-0065).  aPublisher supplied data  aNo.18BZS154cnational social science fund of chinadhttps://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.13039/501100012456  a2018KTSCX212cKey Platforms and Scientific Research Projects in Universities in Guangdong Province of China  a163-2019-XMZC-0009-02-0065cGuangdong Rural Science and Technology Commissioner Project of China 3aHolocene epoch 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aevolution 3ahumans 3alakes 3aland use 3arivers 3asustainable development 3awatersheds 3aChina 3aYangtze River 0aagriculture activities 0aclimate extreme evens 0aenvironment changes 0aflood and drought 0aPoyang Lake1 aBu, Fengxian1 aDelang, Claudio O.,1 aXie, Jialin1 aYe, Quan1 aZhao, Hongfei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9507-31621 aHe, Qilin1 aHe, Wenming0 tHolocene.g2022 Feb., v. 32, no. 1-2 p.17-28dSAGE PublicationswJournal:J000001502x1477-09117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/095968362110477773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03225naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245012500171300001400296520140000310592002801710650001301738650001201751650003501763650001101798650001201809650001301821650001101834650001101845650001001856650002201866650000901888650001301897650000901910650001301919650001401932650001401946650002401960650002601984650001102010650001402021650001302035650002102048650001402069650001302083650001402096650001302110650001302123650002502136650000902161651001602170653001102186653002802197653000902225653002902234653002702263700001602290700002102306700002302327773010502350856008702455852000902542655001202551IND60552555320221120123825.0161021e20131210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055255532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2013.08.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReidy, Lorlyn10aElemental fingerprinting of soils using ICP-MS and multivariate statistics: A study for and by forensic chemistry majors  ap. 37-44.  aStudents in an instrumental analysis course with a forensic emphasis were presented with a mock scenario in which soil was collected from a murder suspect's car mat, from the crime scene, from adjacent areas, and from more distant locations. Students were then asked to conduct a comparative analysis using the soil's elemental distribution fingerprints. The soil was collected from Lafayette County, Mississippi, USA and categorized as sandy loam. Eight student groups determined twenty-two elements (Li, Be, Mg, Al, K, Ca, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Rb, Sr, Cs, Ba, Pb, U) in seven samples of soil and one sample of sediment by microwave-assisted acid digestion and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Data were combined and evaluated using multivariate statistical analyses. All eight student groups correctly classified their unknown among the different locations. Students learn, however, that whereas their results suggest that the elemental fingerprinting approach can be used to distinguish soils from different land-use areas and geographic locations, applying the methodology in forensic investigations is more complicated and has potential pitfalls. Overall, the inquiry-based pedagogy enthused the students and provided learning opportunities in analytical chemistry, including sample preparation, ICP-MS, figures-of-merit, and multivariate statistics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aarsenic 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3abarium 3acalcium 3achromium 3acobalt 3acopper 3acrime 3aforensic sciences 3airon 3aland use 3alead 3alearning 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3amicrowave treatment 3amultivariate analysis 3anickel 3apotassium 3arubidium 3asandy loam soils 3asediments 3aselenium 3astrontium 3astudents 3avanadium 3awet digestion method 3azinc 3aMississippi 0aICP-MS 0aMultivariate statistics 0aSoil 0aElemental fingerprinting 0aInquiry-based pedagogy1 aBu, Kaixuan1 aGodfrey, Murrell1 aCizdziel, James V.0 tForensic science international.g2013 Dec. 10, v. 233 p.37-44dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0379-07387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2013.08.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01596naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100002600146245008600172300001400258520069000272592002800962650002000990650002601010650002001036650001801056650002701074700002501101773008901126856008201215852000901297655001201306IND4462152420221118054205.0141101e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446215242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tvjl.2010.09.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBottero, Maria Teresa10aAnimal species identification in food products: Evolution of biomolecular methods  ap. 34-38.  aSpecies identification in food has increasingly acquired importance due to public health, economic and legal concerns.

To remain within acceptable limits for projected warming scenarios, inaction with respect to GHG mitigation in the short term implies a need for even larger removals of GHGs in the longer term, which can be conceptualized as a ‘mitigation debt’. This paper explores the economic implications of delaying GHG mitigation through ecosystem restoration using data of a large survey (N = 1377) that included a choice experiment to elicit the public’s willingness to pay (WTP) for peatland restoration in Scotland, UK. The valuation specifically considers the interaction between the timing of restoration action and long-term ecosystem resilience. We find that respondents have a substantial WTP for peatland restoration. Importantly, we find considerable benefits for early restoration action (up to £191 million annually in our case study), which is linked to an increased resilience of peatlands under future climate change. This demonstrates that delaying restoration and thus accumulating a mitigation debt has an important opportunity cost that substantially decreases the related economic benefits. Attitudes towards climate change and climate change beliefs are found to explain variation in the public’s WTP. Our research strengthens the economic argument for not delaying climate change mitigation through ecosystem restoration, demonstrating that the mitigation debt also translates into a welfare loss. To fully realise the potential benefits associated with immediate mitigation using peatland restoration, however, more needs to be understood about the mechanisms that facilitate large-scale implementation in practice.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adebt 3aecological resilience 3aecological restoration 3agreenhouse gases 3aopportunity costs 3apeatlands 3apollution control 3asurveys 3awillingness to pay 3aScotland 0aClimate change mitigation 0aNet zero emissions 0aNature-based solutions 0aPeatland restoration 0aChoice experiment 0aClimate change beliefs1 aFaccioli, Michela1 aMartin-Ortega, Julia1 aSchulze, Christoph1 aPotts, Jacqueline0 tGlobal environmental change.g2021 Sept., v. 70 p.102323-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2063x0959-37807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2021.1023233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03330naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245012800155300001600283520181500299592002802114650002302142650001402165650001802179650001602197650002602213650001102239650001402250650001702264650004402281650001002325650001202335650001302347650001202360650002402372650002002396650002202416650001602438650001302454650001402467650001102481650001102492650001102503700001602514700002002530700001702550773016302567856007302730852000902803655001202812IND60135891820221122100637.0150522e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013589182DNAL7 a10.1111/jam.127112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatil, N.S.10aMolecular characterization of intergeneric hybrid between Aspergillus oryzae and Trichoderma harzianum by protoplast fusion  ap. 390-398.  aAIMS: Protoplast fusion between Aspergillus oryzae and Trichoderma harzianum and application of fusant in degradation of shellfish waste. METHODS AND RESULTS: The filamentous chitinolytic fungal strains A. oryzae NCIM 1272 and T. harzianum NCIM 1185 were selected as parents for protoplast fusion. Viable protoplasts were released from fungal mycelium using enzyme cocktail containing 5 mg ml⁻¹lysing enzymes from T. harzianum, 0·06 mg ml⁻¹β‐glucuronidase from Helix pomatia and 1 mg ml⁻¹purified Penicillium ochrochloron chitinase in 0·8 mol l⁻¹sorbitol as an osmotic stabilizer. Intergeneric protoplast fusion was carried out using 60% polyethylene glycol as a fusogen. At optimum conditions, the regeneration frequency of the fused protoplasts on colloidal chitin medium and fusion frequency were calculated. Fusant showed higher rate of growth pattern, chitinase activity and protein content than parents. Fusant formation was confirmed by morphological markers, viz. colony morphology and spore size and denaturation gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed protoplast fusion between A. oryzae and T. harzianum significantly enhanced chitinase activity which ultimately provides potential strain for degradation of shellfish waste. Consistency in the molecular characterization results using DGGE is the major outcome of this study which can be emerged as a fundamental step in fusant identification. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Now it is need to provide attention over effective chitin degradation to manage shrimp processing issues. In this aspect, ability of fusant to degrade shellfish waste efficiently in short incubation time revealed discovery of potential strain in the reclamation of seafood processing crustacean bio‐waste.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus oryzae 3aCrustacea 3aHelix pomatia 3aPenicillium 3aTrichoderma harzianum 3achitin 3achitinase 3adenaturation 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3afungi 3ahybrids 3amycelium 3aparents 3apolyethylene glycol 3aprotein content 3aprotoplast fusion 3aprotoplasts 3aseafoods 3ashellfish 3ashrimp 3aspores 3awastes1 aPatil, S.M.1 aGovindwar, S.P.1 aJadhav, J.P.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2015 Feb., v. 118, no. 2 p.390-398dPublished for the Society for Applied Bacteriology by Blackwell Sciencex1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.127113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02225naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245011900161520117500280592002801455650001501483650001501498650001701513650001801530700002401548700002301572700002001595700002101615700002501636700002601661773012901687856007401816852000901890655001201899IND60748727920221121075733.0210827e20210818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074872792DNAL7 a10.3390/rs131632712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSudakova, Maria 10aUsing Ground Penetrating Radar for Permafrost Monitoring from 2015–2017 at CALM Sites in the Pechora River Delta  aThis paper describes the results of ground penetrating radar (GPR) research combined with geocryological data collected from the Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) testing sites in Kashin and Kumzha in August 2015, 2016, and 2017. The study area was located on the Pechora River delta. Both sites were composed of sandy ground and the permafrost depth at the different sites ranged from 20 cm to 8–9 m. The combination of optimum offset and multifold GPR methods showed promising results in these investigations of sandy permafrost geological profiles. According to direct and indirect observations after the abnormally warm conditions in 2016, the thickness and water content of the active layer in 2017 almost returned to the values in 2015 in the Kashin area. In contrast, the lowering of the permafrost table continued at Kumzha, and lenses of thin frozen rocks that were observed in the thawed layer in August of 2015 and 2017 were absent in 2016. According to recent geocryological and geophysical observations, increasing permafrost degradation might be occurring in the Pechora River delta due to the instability of the thermal state of the permafrost.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageophysics 3apermafrost 3ariver deltas 3awater content1 aSadurtdinov, Marat 1 aSkvortsov, Andrei 1 aTsarev, Andrei 1 aMalkova, Galina 1 aMolokitina, Nadezda 1 aRomanovsky, Vladimir 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Aug. 18, v. 13, no. 16dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs131632713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02517naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245008800171300001400259520131300273592002801586650001201614650001401626650001501640650000901655650002201664650001101686650001001697650000901707650001501716653001401731653001901745653002201764653002301786653002101809700002001830700002601850700001801876773010501894856008701999852000902086655001202095IND60552555420221120124015.0161021e20131210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055255542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2013.08.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTomé, Pedro,10aIdentification using face regions: Application and assessment in forensic scenarios  ap. 75-83.  aThis paper reports an exhaustive analysis of the discriminative power of the different regions of the human face on various forensic scenarios. In practice, when forensic examiners compare two face images, they focus their attention not only on the overall similarity of the two faces. They carry out an exhaustive morphological comparison region by region (e.g., nose, mouth, eyebrows, etc.). In this scenario it is very important to know based on scientific methods to what extent each facial region can help in identifying a person. This knowledge obtained using quantitative and statical methods on given populations can then be used by the examiner to support or tune his observations. In order to generate such scientific knowledge useful for the expert, several methodologies are compared, such as manual and automatic facial landmarks extraction, different facial regions extractors, and various distances between the subject and the acquisition camera. Also, three scenarios of interest for forensics are considered comparing mugshot and Closed-Circuit TeleVision (CCTV) face images using MORPH and SCface databases. One of the findings is that depending of the acquisition distances, the discriminative power of the facial regions change, having in some cases better performance than the full face.  aPublisher supplied data 3acameras 3adatabases 3aextractors 3aface 3aforensic sciences 3ahumans 3amouth 3anose 3atelevision 0aForensics 0aFacial regions 0aFacial components 0aPrimary biometrics 0aFace recognition1 aFierrez, Julian1 aVera-Rodriguez, Ruben1 aRamos, Daniel0 tForensic science international.g2013 Dec. 10, v. 233 p.75-83dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0379-07387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2013.08.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04188naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006300147245013900210300001400349520199900363536053402362592002802896596011902924596008903043650001903132650001203151650002503163650001103188650001403199650001703213650000903230650001703239650001103256650000903267650001403276651001203290653001703302653002303319653002603342653002303368653001503391700002203406700002003428700002203448700001603470773010503486856008203591852000903673655001203682IND60761939220221118182910.0220105e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076193922DNAL7 a10.1177/095968362110499752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodrigues, Kathleen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2522-902312aA 5700-year-old beach-ridge set at Cape Canaveral, Florida, and its implication for Holocene sea-level history in the southeastern USA  ap. 40-56.  aThe Cape Canaveral Peninsula is the largest Holocene coastal sand deposit composed of beach ridges on the Atlantic coast of Florida. It is composed of 16 beach-ridge sets that are separated by erosional surfaces. Despite its prominence as a Holocene coastal depocenter, there are a limited amount of chronological data constraining the timing of its formation. In this study, we apply optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating on sand-sized quartz and radiocarbon dating on individual marine shells to develop a refined chronology of the Cape Canaveral beach-ridge plain with particular focus on constraining the depositional age of the northwesterly-most, and geographically oldest, beach-ridge set on the peninsula. We obtain an average OSL age of 5680 ± 240 years (n = 4) for the initiation of coastal deposition at Cape Canaveral. The new ages, and the organization of beach ridges into 16 distinct sets indicates that the Cape Canaveral beach-ridge plain experienced an ~5700-year history of alternating deposition and erosion, with 75% of present-day Cape Canaveral (Beach-ridge Sets 5–16) deposited over the past 2000 years and Beach-ridge Sets 8–16 comprising 50% of the area over the past 1000 years. Because the minimum swale elevations of the ~5700-year Beach-ridge Set 1, and those of all the younger beach-ridge sets, are within several decimeters of present-day mean higher high water, we hypothesize that all the beach ridges present at Cape Canaveral could have been deposited at or within decimeters of present-day sea level. There is no evidence for Holocene “highstand” events over the past 5700 years in the published sea level curves from northeast and south Florida, which are based on subsurface estuarine foraminifera/leaf litter and mangrove peat data, respectively. This dichotomy illustrates the need to integrate both subaerial and subsurface data to produce a more realistic Holocene sea-level curve for the southeastern United States.  aFunding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This paper presents selected sedimentologic, geomorphologic, and chronometric information collected during an archeologic and geologic assessment of the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Grant # FA2521-12-P-0098 awarded to Glen Doran.

E918-E927.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn early Caenorhabditis elegans embryos, the Wingless/int (Wnt)- and Src-signaling pathways function in parallel to induce both the division orientation of the endomesoderm (EMS) blastomere and the endoderm fate of the posterior EMS daughter cell, called E. Here, we show that, in addition to its role in endoderm specification, the β-catenin–related protein Worm armadillo 1 (WRM-1) also plays a role in controlling EMS division orientation. WRM-1 localizes to the cortex of cells in both embryos and larvae and is released from the cortex in a Wnt-responsive manner. We show that WRM-1 cortical release is disrupted in a hypomorphic cyclin-dependent protein kinase 1 (cdk-1) mutant and that WRM-1 lacking potential CDK-1 phosphoacceptor sites is retained at the cortex. In both cases, cortical WRM-1 interferes with EMS spindle rotation without affecting endoderm specification. Finally, we show that removal of WRM-1 from the cortex can restore WT division orientation, even when both Wnt- and Src-signaling pathways are compromised. Our findings are consistent with a model in which Wnt signaling and CDK-1 modify WRM-1 in a temporal and spatial manner to unmask an intrinsic polarity cue required for proper orientation of the EMS cell division axis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3acell division 3acortex 3alarvae 3amodels 3amutants 0acell polarity 0aembryogenesis 0aasymmetric cell division 0aSrc signaling1 aIshidate, Takao1 aSharma, Rita1 aSoto, Martha C.1 aConte, Darryl1 aMello, Craig C.1 aShirayama, Masaki0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 Mar. 5, v. 110, no. 10 p.E918-E927dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.13007691103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03541naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100001900184245010300203506007600306520168300382592002802065506003702093650002502130650001902155650002102174650002202195650001202217650001102229650001302240650001402253650001902267650002202286650002302308650002102331650001802352650002002370650001602390650002602406650002102432650002202453650001102475650001502486651001102501700002702512700002702539700002102566700001902587700002202606700002402628700002402652700002202676700002402698773011902722856007702841852000902918655001202927IND60654633720221207124002.0190725e20190723xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065463372DNAL7 a10.3390/plants80702412doi7 aPMC66813152pmcid7 a313404412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJurová, Jana 10aPotential Phytotoxic Effect of Essential Oil of Non-Native Species <i>Impatiens parviflora</i> DC.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aImpatiens parviflora is non-native invasive plant species occupying large areas all over the Europe and threatens native communities by altering their species composition and reducing native biodiversity. The factor responsible for its spreading could be explained by releasing biochemical to the environment. On the other hands, high demand on secondary metabolites as potential source of new ecofriendly biocides could be beneficial. The analysis of I. parviflora essential oil (EO) led us to identify more than 60 volatiles. The main compound was hexahydrofarnesyl acetone, other dominant components were phytol, carvacrol, germacra-4(15),5,10(14)-trien-1-&alpha;-ol, and pentacosane. The potential phytotoxic effect of I. parviflora EO collected in two vegetation periods (summer and autumn) was evaluated on seed germination and root elongation of three dicot species (Raphanus sativus, Lepidum sativum, and Lactuca sativa) and on one monocot species (Triticum aestivum). The seed germination of only one dicot species, L. sativa, was affected by both EOs. In contrast, seed germination of monocot species T. aestivum was influenced only by the highest doses of EOs isolated from I. parviflora in autumn. The root elongation of tested plant species was less influenced by I. parviflora EOs. L. sativum showed sensitivity to one dose of EOs hydrodistilled in summer, while the monocot species was influenced by both EOs samples in highest doses. Our findings revealed that I. parviflora contained phenolics that were phytotoxic to the germination of some plant species, mainly at higher EOs doses, while root elongation of tested plants was not suppressed by essential oils.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aImpatiens parviflora 3aLactuca sativa 3aRaphanus sativus 3aTriticum aestivum 3aacetone 3aautumn 3abiocides 3acarvacrol 3aessential oils 3ahydrodistillation 3aintroduced species 3ainvasive species 3aphytotoxicity 3aplants (botany) 3aroot growth 3asecondary metabolites 3aseed germination 3aspecies diversity 3asummer 3avegetation 3aEurope1 aMatoušková, Martina 1 aWajs-Bonikowska, Anna 1 aKalemba, Danuta 1 aRenčo, Marek 1 aSedlák, Vincent,1 aGogaľová, Zuzana 1 aPoráčová, Janka 1 aŠalamún, Peter 1 aGruľová, Daniela 0 tPlants.g2019 July 23, v. 8, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants80702413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01501naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005400148245008300202300001400285520050500299592002800804650001400832650001100846650001300857650002700870650000900897700002700906700002100933700002100954773012100975856008201096852000901178655001201187IND60636963020221118072732.0190412e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063696302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jveb.2017.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDyson, Sue1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4774-749710aResponse to Gleerup: Understanding signals that indicate pain in ridden horses  ap. 87-90.  aDetermining the reasons for pain in ridden horses is challenging, because of the many variable factors, including primary musculoskeletal pain, tack-induced pain, or rider-induced pain. Field-based studies clearly have limitations. Assuming that those limitations are acknowledged, behavioral observations that are repeatable among horses, and that show differences between nonlame and lame horses that are reduced when lameness is abolished by diagnostic analgesia, may be useful indicators of pain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalgesia 3ahorses 3alameness 3amusculoskeletal system 3apain1 aEllis, Andyq(Andrea),1 aMullard, Jessica1 aBerger, Jeannine0 tJournal of veterinary behavior.g2018 Jan.,  Feb., v. 23 p.87-90dElsevier Inc.wJournal:J000000117x1558-78787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jveb.2017.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02392naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245010700158300001600265520107900281592002801360650001201388650002301400650001801423650002401441650002301465650002201488650002001510650001801530650001401548650001301562650002701575650002101602650001601623650002501639700001801664700001201682700001501694700001201709700001701721773012501738856007401863852000901937655001201946IND60617322920221118061427.0181025e20180201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061732292DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ay02806g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Junmei12aA nitrogen doped carbon quantum dot-enhanced chemiluminescence method for the determination of Mn²⁺  ap. 541-547.  aNitrogen doped carbon quantum dots (NCQDs) were synthesized via an ultrasonic method with ascorbic acid as the carbon source and ammonia as the nitrogen source. The synthesized NCQDs could significantly enhance the chemiluminescence (CL) reaction between luminol and KMnO₄ under alkaline conditions based on its catalysis. The increased CL intensity also depended on the synthetic temperature and time of NCQDs. Trace amounts of Mn²⁺ could cause a visible restraining of the CL intensity of the NCQD–KMnO₄–luminol system because of the formation of complexes between Mn²⁺ and some groups such as NH– and CH₂– on the surface of NCQDs, which resulted in the aggregation of NCQDs and scavenging of O₂˙⁻ free radicals and then the catalytic capacity reduction of NCQDs. Under optimum conditions, the decrease in CL intensity was proportional to the concentration of Mn²⁺ in the range of 0.3 to 50.0 µM. The detection limit (3σ) was 43.0 nM. The feasibility of the method was also demonstrated for determining Mn²⁺ concentration in water samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3aanalytical methods 3aascorbic acid 3acarbon quantum dots 3acatalytic activity 3achemiluminescence 3adetection limit 3afree radicals 3amanganese 3anitrogen 3apotassium permanganate 3asuperoxide anion 3atemperature 3aultrasonic treatment1 aChen, Xiaoxia1 aLi, Yue1 aHan, Suqin1 aDu, Yao1 aLiu, Haizhen0 tAnalytical methods.g2018 Feb. 1, v. 10, no. 5 p.541-547dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ay02806g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03167naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100002500158245013800183300001600321520141300337592002801750650001501778650001601793650002501809650001301834650001201847650001001859650001001869650002501879650001001904650001801914650001401932650001201946650002201958650002201980650004302002650001402045653001302059653001002072653000902082653001902091653002002110700002202130700002402152700002202176700002202198700002902220700003002249700003002279700002502309700002002334700002302354773009802377856009302475852000902568655001202577IND60582801920221119175144.0190318e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058280192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2017.08.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliveira, Bruna S.P.10aExpression of adiponectin and its receptors (AdipoR1 and AdipoR2) in goat ovary and its effect on oocyte nuclear maturation in vitro  ap. 127-133.  aAdiponectin is an adipokine secreted primarily by adipocytes and is involved in the control of male and female reproductive functions. Circulating levels of adiponectin are inversely correlated with body fat mass, and its biological effects are predominantly mediated through two receptors, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2. The aim of the present study was to verify the expression of the adiponectin system (adiponectin and its receptors, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2) in goat ovary using qPCR and immunohistochemistry analyses and further investigate the in vitro effects of recombinant adiponectin (5 μg/mL and 10 μg/mL) on goat oocyte nuclear maturation. We demonstrated that the mRNA and proteins of the adiponectin system are present in goat ovary. Gene and protein expression of AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 was detected in follicular cells (oocyte, cumulus, granulosa and theca) of small and large antral follicles, while adiponectin mRNA was not detected in oocytes from small and large follicles or in large follicle cumulus cells. Finally, addition of various concentrations of adiponectin in maturation medium affected the number of oocytes that reached metaphase II. In conclusion, in the present study, we detected expression of adiponectin and its receptors AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 in goat ovarian follicles. Furthermore, we demonstrated that recombinant adiponectin increases nuclear maturation of goat oocytes in vitro.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipocytes 3aadiponectin 3abioactive properties 3abody fat 3afemales 3agenes 3agoats 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amales 3amessenger RNA 3ametaphase 3aoocytes 3aovarian follicles 3aprotein synthesis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areceptors 0aFollicle 0aOvary 0aGoat 0aAdipose tissue 0aGene expression1 aCosta, Joana A.S.1 aGomes, Elizabete T.1 aSilva, Diogo M.F.1 aTorres, Sandra M.1 aMonteiro Jr., Pedro L.J.1 aSantos Filho, Antônio S.1 aGuerra, Maria Madalena P.1 aCarneiro, Gustavo F.1 aWischral, Aurea1 aBatista, André M.0 tTheriogenology.g2017 Dec., v. 104 p.127-133dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2017.08.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02966naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245008800164300001600252506002800268520176300296592002802059506003702087650002002124650001702144650001102161650001302172650001602185650001202201650003902213650002002252650001602272650002502288700001902313700002402332773013502356856008002491852000902571655001202580IND60784697320221207144624.0150830e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078469732DNAL7 a10.15835/nbha.42.2.94612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMARAKLI, Sevgi10aSalt Stress and Homobrassinosteroid Interactions during Germination in Barley Roots  ap. 446-452.  aResource is Open Access  a<p><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Garamond Premr Pro">Potential alleviation effects of Homobrassinosteroid (HBR) (0.5 and 1 µM HBR) on root germination, cell division and antioxidant system enzymes (superoxide dismutase and catalase) of barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i> L. cv. ‘Hilal’) roots grown under different salt concentrations (150 mM and 250 mM) were investigated during 48 and 72 h at dark with their controls. Salt applications decreased primary root lengths, seminal root lengths, number of roots from one seed, mitotic activity and induced mitotic abnormalities. In addition, salt application decreased protein content but increased enzyme activities both at 48 h and 72 h when compared to control. Roots treated with HBR enhanced root lengths and root number. HBR-treated roots showed more mitotic activity, mitotic abnormalities and significant enlargements at the root tips when compared to controls and only salt-treated samples. Salt + HBR applications stimulated root lengths and showed more mitotic activity and mitotic abnormalities when compared to only salt-treated samples. Salt application increased superoxide dismutase and catalase activities both at 48 h and 72 h.&nbsp; However, HBR application decreased total soluble protein content and increased enzyme activities especially at 48 h compared to control. Depending on concentration and timing, salt + HBR treatments showed varying results in total soluble protein content and enzyme activities. There was also a significant change in protein banding patterns of experimental groups separated by SDS-PAGE. These findings are expected to contribute to understanding of how HBR affect barley roots grown under different salt concentrations.</span></p>  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHordeum vulgare 3aantioxidants 3abarley 3acatalase 3agermination 3amitosis 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aprotein content 3asalt stress 3asuperoxide dismutase1 aTEMEL, Aslihan1 aGOZUKIRMIZI, Nermin0 tNotulae botanicae Horti Agrobotanici Cluj-Napoca.g2014 Dec., v. 42, no. 2 p.446-452dAcademicPreswJournal:21431x1842-43097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.15835/nbha.42.2.94613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02700naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005900151245013800210520126600348592002801614650002301642650002301665650001501688650001301703650001201716650001001728650000901738650001301747650000901760650001401769650001301783650001301796650001301809650002501822650001801847653002201865653002201887653001901909653001601928653001901944653003101963653000801994653000802002773011302010856008602123852000902209655001202218IND60746081720221118144543.0210911e20211001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074608172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1283842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParajuli, Rajan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7493-448510aWood pellets versus pulp and paper: Quantifying the impacts of wood pellets on the pulpwood markets in the southeastern United States  aSince the early 2010s, the production of industrial wood pellet for overseas exports has grown considerably in the Southern United States (U.S.). In order to meet the increasing demand for woody biomass feedstock, the wood pellet mills in the U.S. South consume roundwood pulpwood along with low-valued logging residues and sawmill wood wastes. By estimating empirical roundwood pulpwood market models based on the bi-monthly time-series data, this study estimates the impacts of wood pellet production, precipitation, and the COVID-19 Pandemic on the hardwood and softwood pulpwood stumpage prices in 12 southeastern Atlantic coastal micro-markets. Results suggest that the wood pellet industry has led to an increase in pine pulpwood prices, but no statistically significant impact is found on the hardwood pulpwood prices. Rainfall is found to be a positive determinant of the roundwood pulpwood prices. Furthermore, since March 2020, the COVID-19 Pandemic is estimated to lead about 6% decline in both pine and hardwood pulpwood prices. This study provides empirical evidence and additional insights on the timber market dynamics and how small roundwood markets have reacted to the additional wood demand from a growing bioenergy industry in the U.S. South.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3abioenergy industry 3afeedstocks 3ahardwood 3amarkets 3apaper 3apulp 3apulpwood 3arain 3aroundwood 3asawmills 3asoftwood 3astumpage 3atime series analysis 3awoody biomass 0aBiomass feedstock 0aPooled mean group 0aTimber markets 0aWood basins 0aStumpage value 0aSoutheastern United States 0aQ21 0aQ230 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Oct. 01, v. 317 p.128384-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1283843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01685naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002100184245006200205506007600267520064500343592002800988506003701016650001101053650001501064650002101079650001901100650001701119700001801136773011901154856007701273852000901350655001201359IND60654633920221207132941.0190725e20190723xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065463392DNAL7 a10.3390/plants80702432doi7 aPMC66813102pmcid7 a313405062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiong, Yuanyuan 14aThe Diverse Roles of Auxin in Regulating Leaf Development  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLeaves, the primary plant organs that function in photosynthesis and respiration, have highly organized, flat structures that vary within and among species. In recent years, it has become evident that auxin plays central roles in leaf development, including leaf initiation, blade formation, and compound leaf patterning. In this review, we discuss how auxin maxima form to define leaf primordium formation. We summarize recent progress in understanding of how spatial auxin signaling promotes leaf blade formation.

A new superpixel merging algorithm is further studied to improve the existing horizon detection algorithm. This method performs Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) superpixel segmentation on the image, and the over-segmentation problem is solved with a new superpixel merging algorithm. The improved sky horizon line segmentation algorithm is used to eliminate the interference of clouds in the sky for smoke detection. According to the spectral features, the superpixel blocks are classified by support vector machine (SVM). The experimental results show that the superpixel merging algorithm is efficient and simple, and easy to program. The smoke detection technology based on image segmentation can eliminate the interference of noise such as clouds and fog on smoke detection. The accuracy of smoke detection is 77% in a forest scene, it can be used as an auxiliary means of monitoring forest fires. A new attempt is given for forest fire warning and automatic detection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomatic detection 3afire detection 3aforest fires 3aforests 3aimage analysis 3asmoke 3asupport vector machines1 aYan, Lu0 tJournal of Forest Science.g, v. 65, no. 4 p.150-159dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21419x1212-48347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/82/2018-jfs3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03220naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001500186245007900201300001800280506007600298520143300374592002801807506003701835650002301872650001401895650002001909650002901929650001301958650001301971650001101984650001601995650002302011650001102034650001902045650001402064650001902078650002902097650002602126650002902152650001902181653001602200653001102216700002102227700001302248700001602261700001302277700001802290700001302308700002202321700002602343773017302369856007902542852000902621655001202630IND60173590820221207095408.0150603e20130305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017359082DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.13010451102doi7 aPMC35938492pmcid7 a234123342pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Eric10aHistone H2B ubiquitin ligase RNF20 is required for MLL-rearranged leukemia  ap. 3901-3906.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) fusions are potent oncogenes that initiate aggressive forms of acute leukemia. As aberrant transcriptional regulators, MLL-fusion proteins alter gene expression in hematopoietic cells through interactions with the histone H3 lysine 79 (H3K79) methyltransferase DOT1L. Notably, interference with MLL-fusion cofactors like DOT1L is an emerging therapeutic strategy in this disease. Here, we identify the histone H2B E3 ubiquitin ligase ring finger protein 20 (RNF20) as an additional chromatin regulator that is necessary for MLL-fusion–mediated leukemogenesis. Suppressing the expression of Rnf20 in diverse models of MLL -rearranged leukemia leads to inhibition of cell proliferation, under tissue culture conditions as well as in vivo. Rnf20 knockdown leads to reduced expression of MLL-fusion target genes, effects resembling Dot1l inhibition. Using ChIP-seq, we found that H2B ubiquitination is enriched in the body of MLL-fusion target genes, correlating with sites of H3K79 methylation and transcription elongation. Furthermore, Rnf20 is required to maintain local levels of H3K79 methylation by Dot1l at Hoxa9 and Meis1 . These findings support a model whereby cotranscriptional recruitment of Rnf20 at MLL-fusion target genes leads to amplification of Dot1l-mediated H3K79 methylation, thereby rendering leukemia cells dependent on Rnf20 to maintain their oncogenic transcriptional program.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acell proliferation 3achromatin 3agene expression 3ahematopoietic stem cells 3ahistones 3aleukemia 3alysine 3amethylation 3amethyltransferases 3amodels 3aneoplasm cells 3aoncogenes 3atissue culture 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3aubiquitin-protein ligase 3aubiquitination 0aepigenetics 0acancer1 aKawaoka, Shinpei1 aYu, Ming1 aShi, Junwei1 aNi, Ting1 aYang, Wenjing1 aZhu, Jun1 aRoeder, Robert G.1 aVakoc, Christopher R.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 Mar. 5, v. 110, no. 10 p.3901-3906dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.13010451103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02576naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006300151245009300214520130900307592002801616650002101644650002801665650002301693650001101716650001701727653002901744653002601773653002201799653001801821700006801839700002401907700001701931700002301948700002301971773011301994856008602107852000902193655001202202IND60746081820221118144554.0210911e20211001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074608182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1283932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWrålsen, Benedikte1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3717-549110aCircular business models for lithium-ion batteries - Stakeholders, barriers, and drivers  aBusiness models for the circular economy, or circular business models, is a growing field of research applied in various industries. Global sustainability trends, such as electrification of the transport sector and increased energy consumption from renewable sources, have led to rapid growth in the number of batteries produced, especially lithium-ion based batteries. Sustainable lifetime management, including end-of-life, needs development to avoid social and environmental harm and potentially to recapture economic value as the use of these batteries increases. Current research primarily focuses on technical and economic issues based on recycling and the second use of batteries rather than circular business models. This study's purpose is to explore the circular business models, drivers, barriers, and stakeholders required to enable value recapturing. The Delphi panel method was applied to communicate with battery experts from various disciplines. The study's findings reveal that the favored circular business model includes several circular strategies. According to the expert panel, the most critical driver is national and international regulations and policies; the most critical barrier is financial viability; the most critical stakeholders are governments and vehicle manufacturers.  aPublisher supplied data 3acircular economy 3aeconomic sustainability 3aeconomic valuation 3aenergy 3astakeholders 0aCircular business models 0aLithium-ion batteries 0aElectric vehicles 0aDelphi method1 aPrieto-Sandoval, Vanessa1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9937-77101 aMejia-Villa, Andres1 aO'Born, Reyn1 aHellström, Magnus1 aFaessler, Bernhard0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Oct. 01, v. 317 p.128393-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1283933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02955naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245010000163300001800263520145000281592002801731596005901759596005901818596005601877650002101933650002701954650001001981650003401991650001102025650002102036650002002057650001702077650001802094650001702112650001302129650001402142650002402156650002002180700002102200700001202221700001802233700001802251773012402269856008302393852000902476655001202485IND60633748820221121063849.0211002e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063374882DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-019-04586-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Xueli10aIL28RA inhibits human epidermal keratinocyte proliferation by inhibiting cell cycle progression  ap. 1189-1197.  aInterleukin (IL) 28 receptor α (IL28RA) is a well-known candidate for psoriasis susceptibility based on previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis. However, the function of IL28RA in psoriasis has not been elucidated. In the present study, the expression of IL28RA was significantly decreased in lesional tissues from patients with plaque psoriasis when compared with the expression observed in adjacent non-lesional tissues. In vitro studies further demonstrated that in the presence of IL-29, HaCaT keratinocytes with IL28RA knockdown exhibited a faster rate of proliferation than control cells, and an enhanced ratio of cells in the S and G2/M phase. By contrast, IL28RA overexpression inhibited the proliferation of HaCaT keratinocytes and caused cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phases. Western blot analysis revealed that knockdown of IL28RA upregulated cyclinB1 expression and downregulated cyclinE expression; the opposite results were observed in the IL28RA-overexpressing HaCaT cells. Finally, a mechanistic study revealed that IL28RA functions through the activation of the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling pathway to exert its anti-proliferative effect. These results suggested that weak expression of IL28RA may contribute to the pathogenesis of psoriasis and that IL28RA may be an effective drug target for the treatment of psoriasis. However, further in vivo studies are required.  aPublisher supplied data  a81130031cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a81602397cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a15ZR1405700cNatural Science Foundation of Shanghai 3aWestern blotting 3acell cycle checkpoints 3adrugs 3agenome-wide association study 3ahumans 3ain vitro studies 3ain vivo studies 3ainterleukins 3akeratinocytes 3apathogenesis 3apatients 3apsoriasis 3asignal transduction 3atransactivators1 aZhang, Shengquan1 aLi, Bao1 aZhang, Yaohua1 aZhang, Xuejun0 tMolecular biology reports.g2019 Feb., v. 46, no. 1 p.1189-1197dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-019-04586-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02520naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100002000146245013600166300001400302520150300316592002801819650000901847650001101856650001101867650001501878650001301893650001301906650001201919700001401931700001301945700001501958700001701973773008901990856008202079852000902161655001202170IND4462153320221118054314.0141101e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446215332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tvjl.2010.08.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOosterlinck, M.12aA pressure plate study on fore and hindlimb loading and the association with hoof contact area in sound ponies at the walk and trot  ap. 71-76.  aThe aim of this study was to evaluate the association between fore- and hind-hoof contact area and limb loading. Data from a previous study on forelimb loading and symmetry were compared with data on hindlimb kinetics, and the fore- and hind-hoof contact area at the walk and trot was evaluated. Five sound ponies, selected for symmetrical feet, were walked and trotted over a pressure plate embedded in a custom-made runway. The hindlimb peak vertical force (PVF) and vertical impulse (VI) were found to be significantly lower than in the forelimb, whereas their high symmetry ratios (>95%) did not show a significant difference from forelimb data. Hindlimb PVF in ponies was found to be slightly higher when compared to data reported for horses even though the ponies moved at a similar or lower relative velocity. The contact area had low intra-individual variability and was significantly smaller in the hind- than in the fore-hooves. A larger contact area was significantly associated with lower peak vertical pressure (PVP) but higher PVF and VI. No significant differences between left and right sides were found for contact area or loading variables. Pressure plate measurements demonstrated a significant association between hoof contact area and limb loading, in addition to intrinsic differences between fore and hindlimb locomotor function. The pressure plate provides the clinician with a tool to quantify simultaneously contralateral differences in hoof contact area and limb loading.  aPublisher supplied data 3afeet 3ahooves 3ahorses 3alocomotion 3apressure 3atrotting 3awalking1 aPille, F.1 aBack, W.1 aDewulf, J.1 aGasthuys, F.0 tveterinary journal.g2011 Oct., v. 190, no. 1 p.71-76dElsevier Ltdx1090-02337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2010.08.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05438naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245009000175300001400265520402100279592002804300650001804328650001504346650001404361650001604375650002604391650002204417650001004439650001204449650001604461650001204477650001104489650001204500650001804512650001904530650001404549650001604563650000904579650001504588650001804603650001104621650001704632650001904649650001704668651001104685651001804696773011304714856008404827852000904911655001204920IND60636963420221118072747.0190412e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063696342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2014.10.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDevaux, Christian A.14aThe hidden face of academic researches on classified highly pathogenic microorganisms  ap. 26-34.  aHighly pathogenic microorganisms and toxins are manipulated in academic laboratories for fundamental research purposes, diagnostics, drugs and vaccines development. Obviously, these infectious pathogens represent a potential risk for human and/or animal health and their accidental or intentional release (biosafety and biosecurity, respectively) is a major concern of governments. In the past decade, several incidents have occurred in laboratories and reported by media causing fear and raising a sense of suspicion against biologists. Some scientists have been ordered by US government to leave their laboratory for long periods of time following the occurrence of an incident involving infectious pathogens; in other cases laboratories have been shut down and universities have been forced to pay fines and incur a long-term ban on funding after gross negligence of biosafety/biosecurity procedures. Measures of criminal sanctions have also been taken to minimize the risk that such incidents can reoccur. As United States and many other countries, France has recently strengthened its legal measures for laboratories’ protection.During the past two decades, France has adopted a series of specific restriction measures to better protect scientific discoveries with a potential economic/social impact and prevent their misuse by ill-intentioned people without affecting the progress of science through fundamental research. French legal regulations concerning scientific discoveries have progressively strengthened since 2001, until the publication in November 2011 of a decree concerning the “PPST” (for “Protection du Potentiel Scientifique et Technique de la nation”, the protection of sensitive scientific data). Following the same logic of protection of sensitive scientific researches, regulations were also adopted in an order published in April 2012 concerning the biology and health field. The aim was to define the legal framework that precise the conditions for authorizing microorganisms and toxins experimentation in France; these regulations apply for any operation of production, manufacturing, transportation, import, export, possession, supply, transfer, acquisition and use of highly pathogenic microorganisms and toxins, referred to as “MOT” (for “MicroOrganismes et Toxines hautement pathogènes”) by the French law. Finally, laboratories conducting researches on such infectious pathogens are henceforth classified restricted area or ZRR (for “Zone à Régime Restrictif”), according an order of July 2012. In terms of economic protection, biosafety and biosecurity, these regulations represent an undeniable progress as compared to the previous condition. However, the competitiveness of research laboratories handling MOTs is likely to suffer the side effects of these severe constraints. For example research teams working on MOTs can be drastically affected both by (i) the indirect costs generated by the security measure to be applied; (ii) the working time devoted to samples recording; (iii) the establishment of traceability and reporting to national security agency ANSM, (iv) the latency period required for staff members being officially authorized to conduct experiments on MOTs; (v) the consequent reduced attractiveness for recruiting new trainees whose work would be significantly hampered by theses administrative constraints; and (vi) the limitations in the exchange of material with external laboratories and collaborators. Importantly, there is a risk that French academic researchers gradually abandon research on MOTs in favor of other projects that are less subject to legal restrictions. This would reduce the acquisition of knowledge in the field of MOTs which, in the long term, could be highly detrimental to the country by increasing its vulnerability to natural epidemics due to pathogenic microorganisms that are classified as MOTs and, by reducing its preparedness against possible bioterrorist attacks that would use such microorganisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal health 3abiologists 3abiosafety 3abiosecurity 3adiagnostic techniques 3adisease outbreaks 3adrugs 3aexports 3afearfulness 3afunding 3ahumans 3aimports 3amanufacturing 3amicroorganisms 3apathogens 3aresearchers 3arisk 3ascientists 3asocial impact 3atoxins 3atraceability 3atransportation 3auniversities 3aFrance 3aUnited States0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2015 Jan., v. 29 p.26-34dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2014.10.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02347naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002000191245005800211506007600269520110500345592002801450506003701478650001501515650001601530650001901546650002101565650001601586650001901602650002401621653002401645653001101669653001301680653002301693653002101716773011901737856008401856852000901940655001201949IND60690152820221207045303.0200426e20141003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069015282DNAL7 a10.4161/15592316.2014.9722682doi7 aPMC46229532pmcid7 a254828112pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeopold, A Carl10aSmart plants: Memory and communication without brains  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe immobility of plants is consistent with their principal function: collecting light to provide photosynthetic substrate for the biological system. Their immobility does impose limitations on some basic requirements, such as the need for pollination, for seed dispersal, and for protection against herbivores. Meeting these 3 needs will logically necessitate some ability for plant communication – at least a capability for beneficial adaptive behavior. Three types of plant behavior provide evidence of memory and communication abilities: a capability for memory, a capability for measuring time, and extensive evidence of chemical signaling systems. These may provide benefits for genetic outcrossing, seed dispersal and protection – beneficial adaptive behaviors. The chemical signaling system constitutes a wireless communication network that draws mobile animals into assisting plant functions that require mobility. Plants share their chemical signaling systems most frequently with insects and birds. These beneficial adaptable behaviors may be interpreted as some type of consciousness.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aherbivores 3aoutcrossing 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant adaptation 3apollination 3aseed dispersal 3asignal transduction 0aplant communication 0amemory 0abehavior 0achemical signaling 0aseed germination0 tPlant signaling & behavior.g2014 Oct. 3, v. 9, no. 10 p.e972268-dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2184x1559-23247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/15592316.2014.9722683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02458naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245006900165520126100234592002801495650001701523650001401540650001501554650000901569650002501578650001001603650002301613650002101636650002501657650002301682650002101705650001701726650001701743650002001760650001601780700002401796700002201820773011901842856007801961852000902039655001202048IND60784051020221120023717.0220726e20220712xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078405102DNAL7 a10.3390/genes130712332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShughoury, Aumer 10aMolecular Genetic Mechanisms in Age-Related Macular Degeneration  aAge-related macular degeneration (AMD) is among the leading causes of irreversible blindness worldwide. In addition to environmental risk factors, such as tobacco use and diet, genetic background has long been established as a major risk factor for the development of AMD. However, our ability to predict disease risk and personalize treatment remains limited by our nascent understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying AMD pathogenesis. Research into the molecular genetics of AMD over the past two decades has uncovered 52 independent gene variants and 34 independent loci that are implicated in the development of AMD, accounting for over half of the genetic risk. This research has helped delineate at least five major pathways that may be disrupted in the pathogenesis of AMD: the complement system, extracellular matrix remodeling, lipid metabolism, angiogenesis, and oxidative stress response. This review surveys our current understanding of each of these disease mechanisms, in turn, along with their associated pathogenic gene variants. Continued research into the molecular genetics of AMD holds great promise for the development of precision-targeted, personalized therapies that bring us closer to a cure for this debilitating disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangiogenesis 3ablindness 3acomplement 3adiet 3aextracellular matrix 3agenes 3agenetic background 3alipid metabolism 3amacular degeneration 3amolecular genetics 3aoxidative stress 3apathogenesis 3arisk factors 3astress response 3atobacco use1 aSevgi, Duriye Damla1 aCiulla, Thomas A.0 tGenes.g2022 July 12, v. 13, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes130712333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03078naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002000186245009300206300001800299506007600317520123500393592002801628506003701656650001701693650001301710650002501723650001401748650002201762650002201784650001101806650001301817650001101830650002001841650002601861650002501887650001301912650001501925650001301940650002401953650002901977650001802006650001602024653002302040653001302063653001302076653002302089700001502112700001902127700001802146700002802164700002302192773017302215856007902388852000902467655001202476IND60173591120221207100216.0150603e20130305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017359112DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.13014191102doi7 aPMC35938782pmcid7 a234311402pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDrake, Jeana L.10aProteomic analysis of skeletal organic matrix from the stony coral Stylophora pistillata  ap. 3788-3793.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIt has long been recognized that a suite of proteins exists in coral skeletons that is critical for the oriented precipitation of calcium carbonate crystals, yet these proteins remain poorly characterized. Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of proteins extracted from the cell-free skeleton of the hermatypic coral, Stylophora pistillata , combined with a draft genome assembly from the cnidarian host cells of the same species, we identified 36 coral skeletal organic matrix proteins. The proteome of the coral skeleton contains an assemblage of adhesion and structural proteins as well as two highly acidic proteins that may constitute a unique coral skeletal organic matrix protein subfamily. We compared the 36 skeletal organic matrix protein sequences to genome and transcriptome data from three other corals, three additional invertebrates, one vertebrate, and three single-celled organisms. This work represents a unique extensive proteomic analysis of biomineralization-related proteins in corals from which we identify a biomineralization “toolkit,” an organic scaffold upon which aragonite crystals can be deposited in specific orientations to form a phenotypically identifiable structure.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aScleractinia 3aadhesion 3aamino acid sequences 3aaragonite 3abiomineralization 3acalcium carbonate 3acorals 3acrystals 3agenome 3agenome assembly 3aliquid chromatography 3anucleotide sequences 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3askeleton 3astructural proteins 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atranscriptome 3avertebrates 0aacid-rich proteins 0acollagen 0acadherin 0acarbonic anhdyrase1 aMass, Tali1 aHaramaty, Liti1 aZelzion, Ehud1 aBhattacharya, Debashish1 aFalkowski, Paul G.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 Mar. 5, v. 110, no. 10 p.3788-3793dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.13014191103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02808naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245010200163520160300265592002801868650001201896650002301908650002201931650000901953650002001962650001901982650004102001700002602042700002202068700001802090700002102108700002202129700002102151700001902172700002502191773011902216856007802335852000902413655001202422IND60784051220221120062929.0220726e20220713xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078405122DNAL7 a10.3390/genes130712352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScola, Letizia 10aTGF-β/VEGF-A Genetic Variants Interplay in Genetic Susceptibility to Non-Melanocytic Skin Cancer  aDifferential genetically determined expression of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β pathway and of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) might modulate the molecular “milieu” involved in the etio-pathogenesis of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC). We have evaluated the frequency of some functionally relevant SNPs of TGF-β and VEGF-A genes in 70 NMSC patients and 161 healthy controls, typed for TGF-β1 rs1800471, TGF-β2 rs900, TGF-βR1 rs334348 and rs334349, TGF-βR2 rs4522809 and VEGF-A rs3025039 SNPs. TGF-βR2 rs1800629G allele and related genotypes were found to be associated with a possible protective role against NMSC, whereas VEGF-A rs3025039T was associated with an increased risk. To evaluate the effect of genotype combinations on NMSC susceptibility, we determined the frequencies of 31 pseudo-haplotypes due to non-random linkage among alleles of loci not lying on the same chromosome. Two pseudo-haplotypes that imply a minor allele of TGF-βR2 or minor allele of VEGF-A SNPs combined with major alleles of the other SNPs were, respectively, associated with a protective effect, and susceptibility to NMSC. In addition, a pseudo-haplotype involving minor alleles of TGF-β2 rs900, TGF-βR1 rs334348 and rs4522809 SNPs might be a susceptibility marker for NMSC. In conclusion, our data suggest that a complex interplay among the genetic polymorphisms of TGF-β, TGF-β receptors and VEGF-A genes might influence the net effect of genetic background of the patients on NMSC development. This might be relevant in the risk evaluation, diagnosis and treatment of NMSC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3agenetic background 3aprotective effect 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3askin neoplasms 3avascular endothelial growth factor A1 aBongiorno, Maria Rita1 aForte, Giusi Irma1 aAiello, Anna 1 aAccardi, Giulia 1 aScrimali, Chiara 1 aSpina, Rossella 1 aLio, Domenico 1 aCandore, Giuseppina 0 tGenes.g2022 July 13, v. 13, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes130712353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02422naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245013200153300001600285520113700301592002801438650001501466650002301481650001801504650001501522650002001537650002001557650001701577650001301594650000901607650001701616700001601633700001301649700001301662700001401675700001601689700001601705700001501721700001801736700001401754773012501768856007401893852000901967655001201976IND60617323420221118061226.0181025e20180208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061732342DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ay02828h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Yue12aA “turn-on” fluorescence sensor for ascorbic acid based on graphene quantum dots via fluorescence resonance energy transfer  ap. 611-616.  aA novel turn-on fluorescent sensor for the detection of ascorbic acid (AA) has been developed based on the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between graphene quantum dots (GQDs) and squaric acid (SQA)-iron(iii). In this assay, iron(iii) can rapidly coordinate with the SQA to produce SQA-iron(iii). The absorbance band of SQA-iron(iii) could be largely overlapped with the emission band of GQDs, thus resulting in the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-induced fluorescence quenching of GQDs. Moreover, the fluorescence of GQDs can be sensitively turned on by AA through the oxidation-reduction between iron(iii) and AA. After the transformation of SQA-iron(iii) to SQA-iron(ii), because the absorbance of the solution reduces, the FRET decreases. This FRET-based nanosensor shows high selective and sensitive response in the concentration of AA ranging from 1.0 to 95 μM with the detection limit as lower as 200 nM, which is lower than that of other fluorescent assays. Finally, the proposed sensing system was successfully applied to the direct analysis of AA in the real samples with satisfactory results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aanalytical methods 3aascorbic acid 3abiosensors 3adetection limit 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence 3agraphene 3airon 3aquantum dots1 aYan, Xiaolu1 aLi, Meng1 aGao, Han1 aSun, Jing1 aZhu, Shuyun1 aHan, Shuang1 aJia, Li-Na1 aZhao, Xian-En1 aWang, Hua0 tAnalytical methods.g2018 Feb. 8, v. 10, no. 6 p.611-616dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ay02828h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03457naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245016100170300001400331520153700345592002801882650001601910650002401926650002801950650003201978650002502010650001602035650003102051650001002082650001302092650001802105650002102123650001102144650001502155650004202170650001702212650004102229650001502270650001702285650001302302650001602315650001902331650001102350650001702361650002002378653002502398653001302423653002402436653000902460653001202469653002402481700003002505700003002535700003102565700001902596773011902615856008802734852000902822655001202831IND60582802620221119175407.0190318e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058280262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envexpbot.2017.08.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErice, Gorka10aTranscriptomic analysis reveals the importance of JA-Ile turnover in the response of Arabidopsis plants to plant growth promoting rhizobacteria and salinity  ap. 10-19.  aThe use of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) is a proven management strategy to improve plant growth. The aim was to reveal the genomic and proteomic basis of the plant tolerance to saline soil conditions. Combination of whole transcriptome analysis and proteomic profiling helped further the understanding of the complexity of salt tolerance responses. Arabidopsis plants were grown inoculated or not with Bacillus megaterium and irrigated or not with salt. Physiological, genomic and proteomic approaches were combined to reveal plant salt tolerance mechanisms. Microarray analyses revealed the up-regulation of the jasmonic acid metabolism (CYP94B3, lipooxigenase 4 and allene-oxide cyclase) under saline conditions. Knock-out mutants of the gene of interest CYP94B3, responsible of JA-Ile catabolism, were used to confirm the obtained results. Salinity resulted in leaf Na accumulation with decreased chlorophyll content, but PGPR inoculation helped to overcome the stress. Proteomic analysis showed enhanced monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR) content together with ATP synthase. CYP94B3 knock-out plants confirmed the key role of JA-Ile turnover to overcome moderate saline stress. Subsequent experimentation showed that CYP94B3 was important for salt tolerance under moderate and severe salt stress. Inoculation with B. megaterium was a valuable tool to reveal the importance of JA-Ile turnover and to recover Arabidopsis plants from saline stress. A single gene can modify the response of plants to salt stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aBacillus megaterium 3aH+/K+-exchanging ATPase 3aH-transporting ATP synthase 3aallene-oxide cyclase 3achlorophyll 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agenomics 3ajasmonic acid 3aknockout mutants 3aleaves 3ametabolism 3amonodehydroascorbate reductase (NADH) 3aplant growth 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3aproteomics 3asaline soils 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3asodium 3asoil quality 3atranscriptomics 0aArabidopsis thaliana 0aSalinity 0aBacillus megaterium 0aPGPR 0aCYP94B3 0aJasmonil isoleucine1 aRuíz-Lozano, Juan Manuel1 aZamarreño, Ángel María1 aGarcía-Mina, José María1 aAroca, Ricardo0 tEnvironmental and experimental botany.g2017 Nov., v. 143 p.10-19dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7512x0098-84727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2017.08.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02440naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002700143245020800170520125500378592002801633650001601661650001201677650001401689650001901703650001301722650002201735650001701757700002201774700002601796700001901822700002201841700002101863773011901884856007802003852000902081655001202090IND60784051320221120063013.0220726e20220713xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078405132DNAL7 a10.3390/genes130712362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoler, Catalina Torres10aExploration of the Moderating Effects of Physical Activity and Early Life Stress on the Relation between Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) rs6265 Variants and Depressive Symptoms among Adolescents  aDepression affects one in five persons at 18 years of age. Allele A of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) rs6265 is considered to be a risk factor for depression. Previous studies of the interaction between BDNF rs6265, early adversity, and/or physical activity have shown mixed results. In this study, we explored the relation between BDNF rs6265 polymorphism and childhood stress, as well as the moderating effect of physical activity in relation to depressive symptoms using binary logistic regressions and process models 1, 2 and 3 applied to data obtained at three times (waves 1, 2 and 3) from the Survey of Adolescent Life in Västmanland cohort study (SALVe). Results revealed that both childhood stress and physical activity had a moderation effect; physical activity in wave 1 with an R² change = 0.006, p = 0.013, and the Johnson–Neyman regions of significance (RoS) below 1.259, p = 0.05 for 11.97%; childhood stress in wave 2 with the R² change = 0.008, p = 0 002, and RoS below 1.561 with 26.71% and >4.515 with 18.20%; and a three-way interaction in wave 1 in genotype AA carriers. These results suggest that allele A is susceptible to physical activity (positive environment) and childhood stress (negative environment).  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescents 3aalleles 3achildhood 3acohort studies 3agenotype 3aphysical activity 3arisk factors1 aKanders, Sofia H.1 aOlofsdotter, Susanne 1 aVadlin, Sofia 1 aÅslund, Cecilia 1 aNilsson, Kent W.0 tGenes.g2022 July 13, v. 13, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes130712363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02926naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245012000170300001400290520153100304592002801835650001601863650001001879650000901889650000901898650001401907650001001921650001001931650001501941650000901956650001801965650000901983650001101992653002002003653001502023653000802038653002502046700002002071700001802091700002002109700002302129700002202152700001502174700001802189773013402207856008202341852000902423655001202432IND60761940020221118183518.0220105e20220114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076194002DNAL7 a10.1017/S00071145210008172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTorrissen, Martina10aDeposition and metabolism of dietary n-3 very-long-chain PUFA in different organs of rat, mouse and Atlantic salmon  ap. 35-54.  aThere is limited knowledge about the metabolism and function of n-3 very-long-chain PUFA (n-3 VLC-PUFA) with chain lengths ≥ 24. They are known to be produced endogenously in certain tissues from EPA and DHA and not considered to originate directly from dietary sources. The aim of this study was to investigate whether n-3 VLC-PUFA from dietary sources are bio-available and deposited in tissues of rat, fish and mouse. Rats were fed diets supplemented with a natural fish oil (FO) as a source of low dietary levels of n-3 VLC-PUFA, while Atlantic salmon and mice were fed higher dietary levels of n-3 VLC-PUFA from a FO concentrate. In all experiments, n-3 VLC-PUFA incorporation in organs was investigated. We found that natural FO, due to its high EPA content, to a limited extent increased endogenous production of n-3 VLC-PUFA in brain and eye of mice with neglectable amounts of n-3 VLC-PUFA originating from diet. When higher dietary levels were given in the form of concentrate, these fatty acids were bio-available and deposited in both phospholipids and TAG fractions of all tissues studied, including skin, eye, brain, testis, liver and heart, and their distribution appeared to be tissue-dependent, but not species-specific. When dietary EPA and DHA were balanced and n-3 VLC-PUFA increased, the major n-3 VLC-PUFA from the concentrate increased significantly in the organs studied, showing that these fatty acids can be provided through diet and thereby provide a tool for functional studies of these VLC-PUFA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmo salar 3abrain 3aeyes 3afish 3afish oils 3aheart 3aliver 3ametabolism 3amice 3aphospholipids 3arats 3atestes 0aBioavailability 0aDeposition 0an-3 0avery-long-chain PUFA1 aSvensen, Harald1 aStoknes, Iren1 aNilsson, Astrid1 aØstbye, Tone-Kari1 aBerge, Gerd Marit1 aBou, Marta1 aRuyter, Bente0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2022 Jan. 14, v. 127, no. 1 p.35-54dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45200x1475-26627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145210008173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02904naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245016600162300001100328500001900339520151400358592002801872596007501900596007501975596007802050650001702128650001802145650001102163650001102174650001602185700001602201700005602217700001702273700001602290773013202306856008302438852000902521655001202530IND60722606920221117062114.0210129e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072260692DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-020-09296-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Huan10aApplication of fuzzy comprehensive assessment and rock engineering system to assess cavability in block caving mining and establishment of its regionalized model  ap. 15.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe assessment of rock mass cavability is a key research topic when mines intend to adopt block caving mining during the feasibility stages. However, cavability assessment is a multi-index and non-linear complex process in system engineering, and uncertainty exists in the assessment process. In this situation, it is important for cavability assessments to minimize the subjectivity of human judgements and consider the factors that influence cavability and their interrelationships. In this study, we introduce a new approach that combines fuzzy comprehensive assessment (FCA) with rock engineering system (RES). First, the FCA was applied to establish an assessment model based on a conversion function, membership function, and fuzzy assessment matrix. Second, the RES was used to determine the weights of influential factors by applying an interaction matrix. Third, rock mass cavability was analysed based on the assessment model and the factor weights. The results of the cavability assessment were for a partial rock mass due to the discontinuity of the cavability assessment index value in space. Therefore, geostatistics and block models were adopted to establish a regionalized model of rock mass cavability, and the spatial distribution of cavability was obtained. Based on the Luoboling copper-molybdenum mine as a case study, FCA and the RES were applied, and a regionalized model of cavability was established. The results can provide a basis for studies of block caving mining and mine design.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFC0801604cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  a2016YFC0801601cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  a51534003cKey Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China 3acase studies 3ageostatistics 3ahumans 3amodels 3auncertainty1 aRen, Fengyu1 aHe, Rongxing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0885-775X1 aLi, Guanghui1 aZhang, Jing0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2021 Jan., v. 80, no. 1 p.15-15dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001228x1866-62807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-020-09296-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03509naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245015100171300001600322520185500338592002802193650001202221650002202233650001802255650001802273650001302291650002002304650002602324650001602350650001502366650001102381650001302392650002902405650001502434650002502449651001002474653001202484653001002496653001302506653000902519653002002528653002602548700002002574700001902594700001902613700001902632700002502651700002202676700001902698700002302717773010702740856008702847852000902934655001202943IND60552556720221120123938.0161021e20131210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055255672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2013.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLai, Foon Yin10aEstimating daily and diurnal variations of illicit drug use in Hong Kong: A pilot study of using wastewater analysis in an Asian metropolitan city  ap. 126-132.  aThe measurement of illicit drug metabolites in raw wastewater is increasingly being adopted as an approach to objectively monitor population-level drug use, and is an effective complement to traditional epidemiological methods. As such, it has been widely applied in western countries. In this study, we utilised this approach to assess drug use patterns over nine days during April 2011 in Hong Kong. Raw wastewater samples were collected from the largest wastewater treatment plant serving a community of approximately 3.5 million people and analysed for excreted drug residues including cocaine, ketamine, methamphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and key metabolites using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. The overall drug use pattern determined by wastewater analysis was consistent with that have seen amongst people coming into contact with services in relation to substance use; among our target drugs, ketamine (estimated consumption: 1400–1600mg/day/1000 people) was the predominant drug followed by methamphetamine (180–200mg/day/1000 people), cocaine (160–180mg/day/1000 people) and MDMA (not detected). The levels of these drugs were relatively steady throughout the monitoring period. Analysing samples at higher temporal resolution provided data on diurnal variations of drug residue loads. Elevated ratios of cocaine to benzoylecgonine were identified unexpectedly in three samples during the evening and night, providing evidence for potential dumping events of cocaine. This study provides the first application of wastewater analysis to quantitatively evaluate daily drug use in an Asian metropolitan community. Our data reinforces the benefit of wastewater monitoring to health and law enforcement authorities for strategic planning and evaluation of drug intervention strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acocaine 3adiurnal variation 3adrug residues 3aillicit drugs 3aketamine 3alaw enforcement 3aliquid chromatography 3ametabolites 3amonitoring 3apeople 3aplanning 3atandem mass spectrometry 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3aChina 0aCocaine 0aChina 0aKetamine 0aMDMA 0aMethamphetamine 0aSubstance consumption1 aBruno, Raimondo1 aLeung, Ho Wing1 aThai, Phong K.1 aOrt, Christoph1 aCarter, S.q(Steve),1 aThompson, Kristie1 aLam, Paul K.S.1 aMueller, Jochen F.0 tForensic science international.g2013 Dec. 10, v. 233 p.126-132dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0379-07387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2013.09.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03343naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100003500191245012400226300001400350506007600364520163900440592002802079506003702107650002602144650002102170650001602191650001602207650001002223650002202233650002702255650001302282650001402295650003402309650002002343651001002363651001202373653002702385653002602412653001902438653002202457653002502479700001702504700001302521700002602534700001902560700001602579773011302595856008402708852000902792655001202801IND60636964120221207143846.0190412e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063696412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2018.02.0182doi7 aPMC60847862pmcid7 a294627182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMbenda, Huguette Gaelle Ngassa10aGenetic diversity of the Plasmodium vivax phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase gene in two regions of the China-Myanmar border  ap. 45-52.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aArtemisinin resistance in Plasmodium falciparum was associated with mutations in the propeller domain of the PfK13 gene and increased phosphatidylinositol-3′-kinase (PfPI3K) activity. Assessment of the genetic diversity of the PfK13 ortholog PvK12 in Plasmodium vivax field samples from the same hotspots of P. falciparum artemisinin resistance revealed a limited genetic diversity of PvK12. Following the same logic, we analyzed genetic variations of the PvPI3K gene in 188 P. vivax field isolates from two geographic locations along the China-Myanmar border. Overall, high genetic diversity of PvPI3K was observed; parasites from Yunnan's Tengchong County had higher genetic diversity than those from Laiza Township, Kachin State, Myanmar. Almost all the neutrality tests applied detected statistically significant deviation from zero. The negative Tajima's D values in both populations implicated that PvPI3K gene might have experienced either a directional selection or an expansion in population size. There was low linkage disequilibrium between the PvPI3K mutations in both populations, suggesting the existence of large, almost panmictic, parasite populations that enabled effective recombination. This later result was confirmed by the detection of a minimum of five recombination events in each population with two major breakpoints. Multiple tests for selection confirmed a signature of purifying selection on PvPI3K. All the amino acid mutations were predicted to be neutral for the PI3K protein's function. These findings provide insights on the genetic diversity of P. vivax populations along the China-Myanmar border.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aPlasmodium vivax 3aamino acids 3aartemisinin 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3alinkage disequilibrium 3amutation 3aparasites 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3apopulation size 3aChina 3aMyanmar 0aArtemisinin resistance 0aPlasmodium vivax-PI3K 0aSoutheast Asia 0aGenetic diversity 0aChina-Myanmar border1 aZeng, Weilin1 aBai, Yao1 aSiddiqui, Faiza Amber1 aYang, Zhaoqing1 aCui, Liwang0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2018 July, v. 61 p.45-52dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2018.02.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03175naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245019700177300001600374520129000390592002801680650001401708650001501722650002501737650001601762650001101778650001701789650001201806650001101818650001701829650001601846650004301862650001501905650001701920650001501937650001101952650001301963650001401976650001401990650002902004650002502033651001702058651001002075651002802085651001202113653001302125653001302138653001302151653001102164653001702175700006402192700005902256773017902315856008202494852000902576655001202585IND60582802720221119175217.0190318e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058280272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bjp.2017.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChernonosov, Alexander A.10aIdentification of phenolic compounds in Myricaria bracteata leaves by high-performance liquid chromatography with a diode array detector and liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry  ap. 576-579.  aMyricaria bracteata Royle, Tamaricaceae, is a species with a wide geographic range that encompasses Eastern Europe, Western and Central Siberia, Central Asia, and the Himalayas. This plant is used in traditional folk medicine in Russia (Siberia) and in China typically as an analgesic and for the treatment of some infections and certain types of intoxication. The aim of this study was to identify phenolic constituents of the leaves of M. bracteata from two considerably distant populations. Chromatographic profiles of the leaves of M. bracteata were analyzed for the first time. Seventeen compounds, mainly methyl ethers of quercetin (isorhamnetin, rhamnazin), kaempferol (kaempferide, rhamnocitrin), and ellagic acid as well as quercetin, quercetin 3-glucoside, kaempferol, luteolin, chrysoeriol, citric acid, gallic acid, methyl gallate, ethyl gallate, and ferulic acid were identified in hydrolyzed aqueous ethanol extracts of the leaves. Flavonols and ellagic acid were the major compounds in both samples. Isorhamnetin was the main flavonoid constituent. Kaempferide and rhamnazin were also abundant in the flavonoid complex of the leaves of M. bracteata from the Altai. This study shows that M. bracteata leaves are a source of flavonoids with possible biological activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMyricaria 3aanalgesics 3abioactive properties 3acitric acid 3adiodes 3aellagic acid 3aethanol 3aethers 3aferulic acid 3agallic acid 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydrolysis 3aisorhamnetin 3akaempferol 3aleaves 3aluteolin 3apoisoning 3aquercetin 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atraditional medicine 3aCentral Asia 3aChina 3aEastern European region 3aSiberia 0aHPLC-DAD 0aLC-MS/MS 0aFlavonol 0aFlavon 0aEllagic acid1 aKarpova, Evgeniya A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4023-30901 aLyakh, Elena M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4692-70420 tRevista Brasileira de Farmacognosia.g2017 Sept.,  Oct., v. 27, no. 5 p.576-579dElsevier Editora Ltda.aSociedade Brasileira de FarmacognosiawJournal:23273x0102-695X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bjp.2017.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02380naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245010000154300001800254520116000272592002801432650000801460650002301468650001601491650001101507650002001518650001601538650002001554650000901574650002101583650001401604650001501618650002601633650002801659650001801687700001701705700001201722700001201734773012901746856007401875852000901949655001201958IND60617323520221118061135.0181025e20180322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061732352DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ay02830j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Chuan10aEngineering oligonucleotide-based peroxidase mimetics for the colorimetric assay of S1 nuclease  ap. 1405-1412.  aHerein we propose a rational design to construct peroxidase mimetics in response to S1 nuclease by employing guanine-rich oligonucleotides and Cu²⁺ ions. The enzymatic activities of DNA–Cu(ii) are highly dependent upon the binding stoichiometry between Cu²⁺ and DNA. In the H₂O₂-mediated oxidation of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine, the catalytic activity of Cu²⁺ can be accelerated approximately 88 times in the presence of AG₃(T₂AG₃)₃, whereas it shows slight enhancement in the presence of a mononucleotide (GMP). The coordination of Cu²⁺ with DNA structures greatly strengthens its ability to generate reactive oxygen species. The most intriguing finding in this study is that DNA–Cu(ii) complexes lose their enzymatic activities after the cleavage of DNA scaffolds by S1 nuclease. A colorimetric method was established for selectively evaluating the S1 nuclease activity with a limit of detection of 4.7 × 10⁻³ U mL⁻¹, only by using label-free oligonucleotides and copper ions without complicated synthesis and apparatus. This facile method can also be applicable for quantitative analysis in biological fluids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3acatalytic activity 3acolorimetry 3acopper 3adetection limit 3aengineering 3aenzyme activity 3aions 3aoligonucleotides 3aoxidation 3aperoxidase 3aquantitative analysis 3areactive oxygen species 3astoichiometry1 aZhang, Jinli1 aLi, Wei1 aFu, Yan0 tAnalytical methods.g2018 Mar. 22, v. 10, no. 12 p.1405-1412dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ay02830j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02721naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100001900176245010700195300001500302520149000317592002801807650001501835650001701850650001501867650001401882650001901896650001401915650001301929700001801942700002801960773015201988856006902140856010602209990002302315852000902338655001202347IND60643831320221120023458.0190514e20151027xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064383132DNAL7 a10.3791/530882doi7 aPMC46926712pmcid7 a265547442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Cynthia12aA reproducible computerized method for quantitation of capillary density using nailfold capillaroscopy  ap. e53088.  aCapillaroscopy is a non-invasive, efficient, relatively inexpensive and easy to learn methodology for directly visualizing the microcirculation. The capillaroscopy technique can provide insight into a patient’s microvascular health, leading to a variety of potentially valuable dermatologic, ophthalmologic, rheumatologic and cardiovascular clinical applications. In addition, tumor growth may be dependent on angiogenesis, which can be quantitated by measuring microvessel density within the tumor. However, there is currently little to no standardization of techniques, and only one publication to date reports the reliability of a currently available, complex computer based algorithms for quantitating capillaroscopy data.1 This paper describes a new, simpler, reliable, standardized capillary counting algorithm for quantitating nailfold capillaroscopy data. A simple, reproducible computerized capillaroscopy algorithm such as this would facilitate more widespread use of the technique among researchers and clinicians. Many researchers currently analyze capillaroscopy images by hand, promoting user fatigue and subjectivity of the results. This paper describes a novel, easy-to-use automated image processing algorithm in addition to a reproducible, semi-automated counting algorithm. This algorithm enables analysis of images in minutes while reducing subjectivity; only a minimal amount of training time (in our experience, less than 1 hr) is needed to learn the technique.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aangiogenesis 3aautomation 3acomputers 3aimage analysis 3aneoplasms 3apatients1 aLee, Chadd W.1 aDaskalakis, Constantine0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2015 Oct. 27, , no. 104 p.e53088-e53088dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/530883Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/53088/a-reproducible-computerized-method-for-quantitation-capillary-density  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02373naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002200142245012200164300001600286520124700302592002801549650001501577650001601592650002101608650002701629650002801656650001601684650002201700650001201722650001401734651001101748700001901759700001601778773013101794856007701925852000902002655001202011IND60765474020221121034558.0220419e20200831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076547402DNAL7 a10.17221/82/2020-pse2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrygierzec, Beata10aSowing ratio, NS fertilisation and interactions of Lolium sp. and Festulolium grown in mixtures with Trifolium repens  ap. 395-402.  aCurrent ecological trends for production of forage for livestock indicate a need for small usage of fertilisers while increasing productivity. The study aimed to assess yield and interactions of selected Lolium and Festulolium species grown in mixtures with Trifolium repens and fertilised with NS, regarding mutual interactions based on available indicators. A two-year field study (2016–2017) was carried out in southern Poland and the research objects were designed on degraded chernozems. The highest yield was observed for mixtures: L. multiflorum + T. repens and L. × boucheanum + T. repens sown in the proportion 50 : 50, fertilised with N<sub>50</sub>S<sub>15</sub>. The mean dry matter yield was higher in the 1<sup>st</sup> year of the study, in all variants of fertilisation and types of mixtures. The land equivalent ratio differed for species in individual objects, for individual cuts and study years, and was most often higher than 1.0, which points to a positive interference between species in mixtures. Also, the competitive ratio index was often higher than 1.0, which means that grass species were more competitive than white clover. However, in the second year of study T. repens was dominant in multiple objects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChernozems 3aFestulolium 3aTrifolium repens 3acrossover interference 3adry matter accumulation 3aenvironment 3aforage production 3agrasses 3alivestock 3aPoland1 aMusial, Kamila1 aLuty, Lidia0 tPlant, Soil and Environment.g, v. 66, no. 8 p.395-402dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:17122x1214-11787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/82/2020-pse3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03798naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245012200170300001400292520185300306592002802159650001902187650003102206650002502237650001202262650002202274650001502296650001502311650002002326650002702346650001802373650000902391650003502400650001702435653000702452653000802459653000902467653000802476653000802484653000902492653000802501653000902509653000702518653001002525653000802535653000802543653000702551653001002558653000802568653000802576653000702584653000802591653000902599653000702608653000602615653000902621653001702630653002502647653003602672700001802708700001302726700001702739700001802756700001802774700002402792700001802816773011302834856008402947852000903031655001203040IND60636964220221118072751.0190412e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063696422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2018.02.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Miaomiao10aVariants of TLR1 associated with tuberculosis susceptibility in the Chinese Tibetan population but not in Han Chinese  ap. 53-59.  aToll-like receptor 1 (TLR1) participates in the innate immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This study mainly investigated the relationship between polymorphisms of TLR1 and tuberculosis (TB) susceptibility in the two Chinese populations. Totally, 1185 Han and 1216 Tibetan participants were enrolled. TagSNPs of TLR1 were selected and genotyped. Analyses of linkage disequilibrium and haplotypes were performed by software Haploview and SHEsis. Gene-gene interactions were evaluated using the nonparametric multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) method. Gene-by-sex interaction in the Tibetan population and gene-by-smoking interaction in the Han population were also calculated. Association between rs4833095 and TB susceptibility was evaluated by meta-analysis. In the Tibetan population, the A alleles of rs5743557 and rs5743596 were related with reduced tuberculosis risk (p < 0.001 and p = 0.001) after adjusting for confounding factors. Additionally, rs5743604_A was associated with increased TB susceptibility (p = 0.004). The frequency of haplotype rs4833095-rs5743557-rs5743596-rs5743604 CAAG was significantly higher in the healthy controls (HC) group (p = 0.0009), while frequency of haplotype CGGA was higher in the TB group (p = 0.001). Significant associations were detected between rs4833095-rs5743557-rs5743604 interactions and TB susceptibility. Interactions between rs5743596 and sex in the Tibetan population, between rs5743604 and smoking in the Han population were revealed as well. However, no significant main effects were observed in the Han population. The rs4833095 was not associated with TB susceptibility after meta-analysis either. Our study suggested that SNPs of the TLR1 gene were associated with TB susceptibility in the Chinese Tibetan population, but not in the Han population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChinese people 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3aToll-like receptor 1 3aalleles 3acomputer software 3agenotyping 3ahaplotypes 3ainnate immunity 3alinkage disequilibrium 3ameta-analysis 3arisk 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atuberculosis 0aTB 0aMTB 0aLTBI 0aTLR 0aTIR 0aTLR1 0aPTB 0aSNPs 0aHC 0aIGRAs 0aCHB 0aMAF 0aOR 0a95%CI 0aNOS 0aHWE 0aLD 0aMDR 0aRERI 0aAP 0aS 0aGWAS 0aTuberculosis 0aToll-like receptor 1 0aSingle nucleotide polymorphisms1 aTang, Xiaoyan1 aWang, Yu1 aWu, Shouquan1 aWang, Minggui1 aLiu, Qianqian1 aSandford, Andrew J.1 aHe, Jian-Qing0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2018 July, v. 61 p.53-59dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2018.02.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03180naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005600147245020300203300001400406520175200420592002802172650001402200650001302214650001402227650001302241650001202254650002202266650001402288650001702302650001902319650001102338650002102349650001402370650001902384650001602403650000902419653002602428653001202454653002502466700001802491773013402509856008202643852000902725655001202734IND60761940120221118183307.0220105e20220114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076194012DNAL7 a10.1017/S00071145210008292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Sunmin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6092-834010aIntermittent fasting with a high-protein diet mitigated osteoarthritis symptoms by increasing lean body mass and reducing inflammation in osteoarthritic rats with Alzheimer’s disease-like dementia  ap. 55-67.  aMenopausal women are susceptible to osteoarthritis(OA) and memory impairment. We hypothesised that Alzheimer’s-like disease(AD) exacerbates OA and that intermittent fasting(IMF) with a high-protein(H-P) diet would enhance memory function and relieve OA symptoms in oestrogen-deficient animals induced AD and OA. The action mechanism was also explored. Ovariectomised Sprague–Dawley rats were fed high-fat(H-F) or H-P diets for 2 weeks, and then they had a hippocampal infusion of β-amyloid(25–35) for 4 weeks to induce AD and an injection of monoidoacetate(MIA) into the articular cartilage to induce OA. Non-AD groups had non-AD symptoms by hippocampal amyloid-β(35–25) infusion. IMF suppressed memory impairment in AD rats, especially those fed H-P diets. Compared with non-AD, AD exacerbated OA symptoms, including swelling, limping, slowed treadmill running speed, and uneven weight distribution in the left leg. The exacerbations were linked to increased inflammation and pain, but IMF and H-P lessened the exacerbation. Lean body mass(LBM) decreased with AD, but H-P protected against LBM loss. Histological examination of the knee joint revealed the degree of the cellular invasion into the middle zone, and the changes in the tidemark plateau were greatest in the AD-AL with H-F, while non-AD-IMF improved the cellular invasion to as much as non-AD-AL. H-P reduced the infiltration into the middle zone of the knee and promoted collagen production. In conclusion, AD exacerbated the articular cartilage deterioration and memory impairment, and IMF with H-P alleviated the memory impairment and osteoarthritic symptoms by decreasing hippocampal amyloid-β deposition and proinflammatory cytokine expressions and by increasing LBM.  aPublisher supplied data 3acartilage 3acollagen 3acytokines 3adementia 3afasting 3ahigh protein diet 3ahistology 3ainflammation 3alean body mass 3amemory 3amemory disorders 3amenopause 3aosteoarthritis 3aovariectomy 3apain 0aAlzheimer’s disease 0aProtein 0aIntermittent fasting1 aShin, Bae Kun0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2022 Jan. 14, v. 127, no. 1 p.55-67dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45200x1475-26627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145210008293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02190naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245010800167300001600275520099300291592002801284650002201312650002201334650001201356650001301368650001101381650001301392650001901405650001101424650001601435653002301451653002401474653002701498653001901525653002801544700001801572773010701590856008601697852000901783655001201792IND60540719620221119150121.0190318e20140102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054071962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2013.08.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNasseri, R.10aModeling of starch retrogradation onset in its aqueous solution using thermoreversible gelation concept  ap. 325-330.  aA model was developed to predict starch retrogradation onset in its aqueous solution and verified with the selected literature data. The most probable chain helix distribution was first estimated via minimizing the system free energy with respect to chain helix length. Later, the calculation was extended to double helix formation among single polymer chains with ζ¯2=10 as the retrogradation criterion. ζ¯2 is the average double helix length usually equals 10 implying the number of participating residues in the thickness of the thinnest reported starch lamella in the literature. The model prediction namely the retrogradation onset temperature, showed quite reasonable agreement with the selected literature data. Equal chain conformational entropy loss, Δs/kB≈−0.7, was inferred for various starch aqueous solutions due to the double helix kind of associations.

In alarm communication, call recipients in a social group evaluate alarm calls, enhancing their probability of survival in the face of predatory threats. Calls from naïve and younger group members might be less evocative, in terms of rendering group members vigilant, than calls from more experienced adults because adults are generally more reliable. It remains uncertain, however, what acoustic characteristics render an alarm call reliable. Here, we report that adult degus, Octodon degus (Rodentia, Octodontidae), produced an alarm with a frequency-modulated (FM) syllable, accompanied by low bandwidth and entropy, to evoke a high-vigilance response amongst receivers. Unlike adults, subadult degus did not emit the FM syllable in the warning context, and their call without the FM syllable evoked less vigilance than the adult alarm. We suggest that the FM structure of the adult-produced syllable serves as the primary feature characterizing a reliable alarm call. Our results are consistent with those found in other social rodents, e.g., ground squirrels and gerbils, also produce FM alarm calls in high-urgency situations supports the importance of the FM syllable in alarm communication.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSpermophilus 3aacoustic properties 3aadults 3aantipredatory behavior 3agerbils 3aprobability1 aNakagawa, Ryoko1 aTokimoto, Naoko1 aOkanoya, Kazuo0 tJournal of ethology.g2013 May, v. 31, no. 2 p.115-121dSpringer-Verlagx0289-07717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10164-012-0355-8  aDNAL 7aarticle02338naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001800141245009100159520140300250592002801653650001401681650002001695650001001715650001101725650001301736700002801749700002801777773015901805856007501964852000902039655001202048IND60649166720221120221639.0190703e20180116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064916672DNAL7 a10.3390/ijgi70100282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXing, Xu-Feng12aA Knowledge Base for Automatic Feature Recognition from Point Clouds in an Urban Scene  aLiDAR technology can provide very detailed and highly accurate geospatial information on an urban scene for the creation of Virtual Geographic Environments (VGEs) for different applications. However, automatic 3D modeling and feature recognition from LiDAR point clouds are very complex tasks. This becomes even more complex when the data is incomplete (occlusion problem) or uncertain. In this paper, we propose to build a knowledge base comprising of ontology and semantic rules aiming at automatic feature recognition from point clouds in support of 3D modeling. First, several modules for ontology are defined from different perspectives to describe an urban scene. For instance, the spatial relations module allows the formalized representation of possible topological relations extracted from point clouds. Then, a knowledge base is proposed that contains different concepts, their properties and their relations, together with constraints and semantic rules. Then, instances and their specific relations form an urban scene and are added to the knowledge base as facts. Based on the knowledge and semantic rules, a reasoning process is carried out to extract semantic features of the objects and their components in the urban scene. Finally, several experiments are presented to show the validity of our approach to recognize different semantic features of buildings from LiDAR point clouds.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuildings 3adata collection 3alidar 3amodels 3atopology1 aMostafavi, Mir-Abolfazl1 aChavoshi, Seyed Hossein0 tISPRS international journal of geo-information.g2018 Jan. 16, v. 7, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21619x2220-99647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi70100283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02462naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245008700169300001600256520109900272592002801371650002201399650001601421650002101437650002801458650001801486650001001504650001301514650000701527650003301534650001201567650001801579653001001597653001901607653002101626653001901647653001501666653003301681700002001714700001701734700001801751700002101769773010701790856008601897852000901983655001201992IND60540719920221119221954.0190318e20140102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054071992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2013.08.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilbir, Selim10aLevan production by Zymomonas mobilis in batch and continuous fermentation systems  ap. 454-461.  aLevan production in batch and continuous fermentation systems by Zymomonas mobilis B-14023 was investigated. The culture medium used in both of the fermentation systems contained sucrose and various organic nitrogen sources. Maximum concentration of levan was produced with yeast extract among the nitrogen sources tested. Response surface methodology was used to investigate the effects of three factors on the concentration of levan in batch cultures of Z. mobilis. Maximum levan concentration was 40.2g/L and this concentration was reached at the optimum levels of process variables, which were 299.1g/L initial substrate concentration, 42.3h incubation time, and initial pH 6.0. Continuous fermentation experiments were done in packed bed bioreactor using Ca-alginate immobilized Z. mobilis cells. The highest levan concentration (31.8±0.21g/L) was obtained at a dilution rate of 0.14h−1 while maximum volumetric productivity (6.556g/(Lh)) was obtained at a dilution rate of 0.22h−1. Increasing the dilution rate resulted in decreased levan and increased residual sugar concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZymomonas mobilis 3abioreactors 3acalcium alginate 3acontinuous fermentation 3aculture media 3alevan 3anitrogen 3apH 3aresponse surface methodology 3asucrose 3ayeast extract 0aLevan 0aPolysaccharide 0aCalcium alginate 0aImmobilization 0aZ. mobilis 0aResponse surface methodology1 aDagbagli, Seval1 aYegin, Sirma1 aBaysal, Taner1 aGoksungur, Yekta0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2014 Jan. 02, v. 99 p.454-461dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2013.08.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02478naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245013900162300001600301520139300317592002801710650002301738650001701761650001001778650001901788650001701807650001501824650002601839650000901865650001201874650001401886700001901900700002401919773009101943856007302034852000902107655001202116IND60478892720221118193359.0160115e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047889272DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.136392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHedrick, Philip W.10aExamining the cause of high inbreeding depression: analysis of whole‐genome sequence data in 28 selfed progeny of Eucalyptus grandis  ap. 600-611.  aThe genome‐wide heterozygosity at 9590 genes, all heterozygous in a single Eucalyptus grandis parent tree, was examined in a group of 28 S₁ offspring. Heterozygosity ranged from 52–79%, averaging 65.5%, much higher than the 50% expected under random segregation, supporting the occurrence of strong (47%) selection against homozygosity. The expected pattern of heterozygosity from theoretical calculations and simulations for recessive detrimentals (pseudo‐overdominance) and intrinsic heterozygote advantage was examined and compared with that observed. The observed patterns are consistent with at least several detrimental loci with large effects on both parental chromosomes of the 11 pairs. It is likely that 100 or more genes, many with substantial effects on viability, are contributing to this inbreeding depression. Although our genome‐wide analysis of nearly 10 000 genes strongly suggested that pseudo‐overdominance was responsible for the observed high inbreeding depression, heterozygote advantage could not be excluded. Finding inconvertible evidence of the cause of inbreeding depression still presents a difficult challenge. This study is the first theoretical examination of the genomic effect of inbreeding in a forest tree and provides an approach to analyze these data to determine the extent and cause of inbreeding depression across other plant genomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus grandis 3aforest trees 3agenes 3aheterozygosity 3ahomozygosity 3ainbreeding 3ainbreeding depression 3aloci 3aprogeny 3aviability1 aHellsten, Uffe1 aGrattapaglia, Dario0 tnew phytologist.g2016 Jan., v. 209, no. 2 p.600-611dAcademic Press.x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.136393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02964naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005500148245011800203300001600321520146600337592002801803596009101831650002101922650001801943650002201961650002301983650001902006650001002025650001002035650003802045650001302083650002502096650001802121650002402139650000902163650002002172650004302192650001702235700001402252700001702266700001802283773011402301856008202415852000902497655001202506IND60744980520221118011642.0210723e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074498052DNAL7 a10.1007/s13258-021-01081-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Jing1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1081-193410aGlabridin attenuates atopic dermatitis progression through downregulating the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway  ap. 847-855.  aBACKGROUND: Glabridin (GB), a bio-available phytoestrogen, displays various biological properties such as anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antiviral. OBJECTIVE: To explore the role of GB in the process of atopic dermatitis (AD). METHODS: CCK8 was used to detect the therapeutic effect of Glabridin in HaCat and NHEK cell inflammatory models. And evaluated the effect on cell proliferation and cell viability. The expression of TLR4, MyD88, P65 and P50 in HaCat and NHEK cell tissues was detected by qRT-PCR and PCR. At the same time, an AD animal model was constructed, and the cell experiment results were verified by hematoxylin–eosin (HE) and Immunohistochemistry staining (IHC). RESULTS: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) demonstrated that IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α upregulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was decreased by treatment with GB. AD progression was further confirmed to be regulated by GB by inhibiting the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway through real-time PCR and Western blot analyses. An AD-like mouse model demonstrated that GB considerably alleviated epidermal injury, relieve edema, and reduced inflammatory cell infiltration by H&E staining. Concurrently, IHC staining exhibited GB to reduce AD progression by impeding TLR4 expression. CONCLUSION: GB was observed to decrease the AD progression by suppressing the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway, which may likely serve as a novel therapeutic drug for AD management.  aPublisher supplied data  aNMDYB1713cthe Scientific Research Fund of Inner Mongolia University for Nationalities 3aWestern blotting 3aanimal models 3aatopic dermatitis 3acell proliferation 3acell viability 3adrugs 3aedema 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agenomics 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainterleukin-6 3alipopolysaccharides 3amice 3aplant estrogens 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atherapeutics1 aWang, Lin1 aZhang, Minna1 aLai, Zengjiao0 tGenes & genomics.g2021 Aug., v. 43, no. 8 p.847-855dSpringer SingaporewJournal:J000001676x1976-95717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13258-021-01081-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02786naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005900152245010300211520136400314592002801678650001801706650001601724650001901740650001001759650002901769650001401798650002401812651001001836653002601846653003001872653003301902653003301935653002901968700006301997700006102060700001802121700001502139700001602154773009802170856008702268852000902355655001202364IND60676708320221120140752.0220502e20200201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067670832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.1141962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShiraki, Hiroto1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7197-793310aFactors affecting CO2 emissions from private automobiles in Japan: The impact of vehicle occupancy  aThe road transport sector accounted for 18.8% of global CO₂ emissions in 2016. Regional efforts are indispensable for reducing automobile emissions, especially considering the diversity in regional transportation systems. Existing studies of automobile emissions have focused on nationwide transportation systems or differences in city size without considering regionality and long-term changes in vehicle occupancy. In this study, we decomposed national and regional automobile emissions in Japan between 1990 and 2015 by the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index method. Statistical data that took vehicle occupancy into account were used. Results showed that nationwide vehicle occupancy increased (due to increased vehicle size and vehicle ownership), which increased emissions by 15.2% compared to 1990 levels. In highly populated regions, fuel efficiency decreased earlier than other regions thanks to the strengthening of ordinances regarding air pollution. In Western Japan, which includes less-populated prefectures, the rising popularity of mini-vehicles resulted in increased vehicle ownership and a decrease in occupancy but also led to improvements in fuel economy. To reduce automobile CO₂ emissions, it will be essential to improve fuel efficiency and to increase vehicle occupancy through mechanisms, such as ridesharing and vehicle right sizing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3aautomobiles 3acarbon dioxide 3afuels 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aownership 3aroad transportation 3aJapan 0aTransportation sector 0aCross-regional comparison 0aMultiplicative decomposition 0aIndex decomposition analysis 0aVehicle seating capacity1 aMatsumoto, Ken'ichi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9349-97651 aShigetomi, Yosuke1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1384-09921 aEhara, Tomoki1 aOchi, Yuki1 aOgawa, Yuki0 tApplied energy.g2020 Feb. 01, v. 259 p.114196-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.1141963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02670naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245008400161300001600245520143000261592002801691650001101719650001201730650001501742650001701757650001501774650001901789650000901808650001501817650002501832650002501857650002001882650001601902650001701918651001601935651001601951700002001967700002001987700002102007700002302028773009102051856007302142852000902215655001202224IND60478892920221118193342.0160115e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047889292DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.136012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Boeck, Hans J.10aSimulated heat waves affected alpine grassland only in combination with drought  ap. 531-541.  aThe Alpine region is warming fast, and concurrently, the frequency and intensity of climate extremes are increasing. It is currently unclear whether alpine ecosystems are sensitive or resistant to such extremes. We subjected Swiss alpine grassland communities to heat waves with varying intensity by transplanting monoliths to four different elevations (2440–660 m above sea level) for 17 d. Half of these were regularly irrigated while the other half were deprived of irrigation to additionally induce a drought at each site. Heat waves had no significant impacts on fluorescence (Fᵥ/Fₘ, a stress indicator), senescence and aboveground productivity if irrigation was provided. However, when heat waves coincided with drought, the plants showed clear signs of stress, resulting in vegetation browning and reduced phytomass production. This likely resulted from direct drought effects, but also, as measurements of stomatal conductance and canopy temperatures suggest, from increased high‐temperature stress as water scarcity decreased heat mitigation through transpiration. The immediate responses to heat waves (with or without droughts) recorded in these alpine grasslands were similar to those observed in the more extensively studied grasslands from temperate climates. Responses following climate extremes may differ in alpine environments, however, because the short growing season likely constrains recovery.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanopy 3adrought 3aecosystems 3afluorescence 3agrasslands 3agrowing season 3aheat 3airrigation 3aprimary productivity 3astomatal conductance 3atemperate zones 3atemperature 3awater stress 3aAlps region 3aSwitzerland1 aBassin, Seraina1 aVerlinden, Maya1 aZeiter, Michaela1 aHiltbrunner, Erika0 tnew phytologist.g2016 Jan., v. 209, no. 2 p.531-541dAcademic Press.x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.136013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01809naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245005200174300001400226520080700240592002801047650002301075650002001098650001701118650000901135650002401144650001001168650001601178650001601194653002401210653000901234653002601243773009601269856008501365852000901450655001201459IND60600602020221121020339.0180703e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060060202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.firesaf.2013.08.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBanerjee, Dilip K.10aUncertainties in steel temperatures during fire  ap. 65-71.  aIn order to determine the fire resistance of steel members, steel temperatures must be estimated with a high confidence.

This is due to uncertainty in the thermal boundary conditions and thermophysical properties. In this study, uncertainties in both unprotected and protected steel temperatures are estimated with the use of a Monte Carlo method in conjunction with a “Lumped Heat Capacity” approach for estimating steel temperatures.

In the experiment, three kinds of waves (regular wave, focused wave and combined regular and focused wave) are generated and a box-shaped floating body with a superstructure is used. Validation computations on the experiment are performed by the improved CIP-based Cartesian grid method, in which the THINC/WLIC scheme (THINC: tangent of hyperbola for interface capturing; WLIC: weighed line interface calculation), is used for interface capturing. The highly nonlinear wave–body interactions, including large amplitude body motions and water-on-deck are numerically investigated through implementation of focused wave input to the CIP-based method. Computations are compared with experimental results and good agreement is achieved. The effects of the water-on-deck phenomena and different input focus positions on the body response are also dealt with in the research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequations 3ahydrodynamics 3anonlinear models 3aoceans 3awater waves1 aHu, Changhong0 tApplied ocean research.g2012 Mar., v. 35 p.1-13dElsevier Ltdx0141-11877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apor.2012.01.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02258naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001400143245017200157300001600329520092100345592002801266650001501294650002201309650001501331650001601346650000901362650001801371650002701389650000901416650001001425650002301435650002501458653001901483653001701502653002601519653001201545700001801557700002201575700001601597773012501613856007701738852000901815655001201824IND60515509720221120032937.0160315e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051550972DNAL7 a10.4141/cjas-2014-0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNanon, A.10aShort Communication: Assessment of lemongrass oil supplementation in a dairy diet on in vitro ruminal fermentation characteristics using the rumen simulation technique  ap. 731-736.  aNanon, A., Suksombat, W., Beauchemin, K.

J. Anim. Sci. 94: 731–736. A study using a rumen simulation technique (Rusitec) was conducted to investigate the effect of increasing lemongrass oil (LMO) supplementation on ruminal fermentation characteristics of a dairy cow diet. Increasing LMO from 0, to 100 to 200 mg kg⁻¹ dry matter did not affect volatile fatty acid concentration, whereas LMO supplementation increased large and small peptide N and reduced ammonia N concentration. Adding 200 mg of LMO kg⁻¹ dry matter also increased microbial N production. However, feed digestibility was not affected by LMO supplementation. These results suggest that the addition of LMO may inhibit deamination in the rumen.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCymbopogon 3aammonium nitrogen 3adairy cows 3adeamination 3adiet 3adigestibility 3afatty acid composition 3aoils 3arumen 3arumen fermentation 3avolatile fatty acids 0aLemongrass oil 0afermentation 0amicrobial N synthesis 0aRusitec1 aSuksombat, W.1 aBeauchemin, K.

Our studies have revealed the appearance of these putative receptors in invertebrates such as the molluscs and deuterostomes. Starfish tissue extracts contain several lysosomal enzyme activities and here we describe the affinity purification of α-fucosidase. The purified enzyme is a glycoprotein that exhibited a molecular mass of ∼56 kDa in SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. It has also cross-reacted with an antiserum to the mollusc enzyme suggesting antigenic similarities among the two invertebrate enzymes. LC–MS/MS analysis of the proteolytic peptides of the purified enzyme in combination with de novo sequencing allowed us to do partial amino acid sequence determination of the enzyme. These data suggest that this invertebrate enzyme is homologous to the known mammalian enzyme. The purified enzyme exhibited a mannose 6-phosphate dependent interaction with the immobilized starfish MPR300 protein. Our results demonstrate that the lysosomal enzyme targeting pathway is conserved even among the invertebrates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAsterias rubens 3aalpha-L-fucosidase 3aamino acid sequences 3aantiserum 3aenzyme activity 3aglycoproteins 3alysosomes 3amammals 3amannose 3amolecular weight 3amolluscs 3apeptides 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aproteolysis 3areceptors 3asequence analysis1 aHammer, Elke1 aVölker, Uwe1 aKoliwer-Brandl, Hendrik1 aKelm, Sørge1 aNadimpalli, Siva Kumar0 tBiochimie.g2012 May, v. 94, no. 5 p.1199-1205dElsevier Masson SASx0300-90847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2012.02.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02555naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245008900172300001600261520111600277592002801393650002601421650001601447650001801463650001301481650001701494650001401511650001001525650001001535650001001545650002201555650001701577650002201594650001801616650002201634650001001656650001201666650001001678651001201688653001701700653003301717653001701750653002801767700001501795700002001810773012601830856008401956852000902040655001202049IND60479613520221120223545.0160630e20081201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047961352DNAL7 a10.1556/APhyt.43.2008.2.252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVasiliu-Oromulu, L.10aFrankliniella intonsa (Trybom, 1895), a very sensitive bioindicator of air pollution  ap. 405-412.  aThe LIFE 02ENV/RO/000461AIR-AWARE project is partly dedicated to research on the flora and invertebrate fauna of downtown Bucharest (Romania).

Thysanopterological samples were collected from the herbaceous layer, on both weeds and ornamentals, following a transect approach. The preliminary results revealed a biodiversity that decreased from the park centres, which suffered the least air pollution, towards the edges of the parks, which were the most polluted. The dominant species was Frankliniella intonsa , which had high values for structural and functional indices, as well as morphological changes in body size, colour and antennae, all due to the air pollution. F. intonsa could be considered to be a very sensitive bioindicator of environmental pollution. Future analysis, however, may reveal whether Bagnalliella yuccae, F. intonsa or Haplothrips niger are more sensitive bioindicators for air pollution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFrankliniella intonsa 3aHaplothrips 3aair pollution 3aantennae 3abiodiversity 3abody size 3acolor 3afauna 3aflora 3aground vegetation 3aheavy metals 3aherbaceous plants 3ainvertebrates 3aornamental plants 3aparks 3apowders 3aweeds 3aRomania 0aThysanoptera 0a<i>Frankliniella intonsa</i> 0abioindicator 0aenvironmental pollution1 aJenser, G.1 aBărbuceanu, D.0 tActa phytopathologica et entomologica Hungarica.g2008 Dec. 1, v. 43, no. 2 p.405-412dAkadémiai Kiadóx0238-12497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FAPhyt.43.2008.2.253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03971naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004300113040001800156100002100174245012400195300001400319520219600333592002802529650002602557650001702583650001302600650001502613650001002628650001602638650001902654650002402673650001302697650001002710650001102720650001402731650001002745650002102755650001102776650001102787650002802798650001702826650002202843650001002865650003202875650001202907650001602919651001402935651001402949653002202963653001302985653002802998653002603026700002103052700002903073700002103102773013503123856009003258852000903348655001203357IND50066216620221122011151.0190318e20130603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006621662DNAL7 a236123192pmid7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2013.03.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCanel, Romina S.10aIndigenous filamentous fungi on the surface of Argentinean dry fermented sausages produced in Colonia Caroya (Córdoba)  ap. 81-86.  aSome producers of dry fermented sausages use fungal starter cultures with the aim to achieve a desirable surface appearance and avoid the growth of mycotoxigenic fungi. These commercial cultures are mainly composed of Penicillium nalgiovense biotype 6. In contrast, in the case of producers who do not use starters, sausages are spontaneously colonized by the house mycobiota, which generally consists of heterogeneous molds corresponding to different genera and species. In this work, the surface mycobiota of dry fermented sausages produced in Colonia Caroya (Córdoba, Argentina) was determined in both summer and winter seasons. All the sausages sampled had been made without the use of surface fungal starters. In the 57 sausages analyzed in the two winter seasons studied (2010 and 2012), we found a total of 95 isolates of filamentous fungi belonging to six genera (Penicillium, Aspergillus, Mucor, Cladosporium, Scopulariopsis and Eurotium) and ten fungal species, whereas in the 36 sausages analyzed in the two summer seasons studied (2011 and 2012), we found 89 isolates belonging to five genera (Penicillium, Aspergillus, Mucor, Cladosporium and Geotrichum) and ten fungal species. Although 16 different species were found in both winter and summer seasons, only 2 of them predominated completely. P. nalgiovense was found in almost 100% of the sausages analyzed, where biotype 4 was the most frequent. This species gives a whitish gray coloration to the sausages. Considering that the factories sampled do not use fungal starter cultures, this predominance is very interesting since mycotoxin production by this fungus has not been reported. Aspergillus ochraceus was isolated with a frequency of 80–90% in the summer seasons, but in none of the winter samples. The presence of this fungus in sausages produced in the summer was attributed to the high environmental temperatures and the uncontrolled temperature in the ripening rooms during the night. In all cases, A. ochraceus was responsible for the undesirable yellowish gold color of the casing. This fungus thus causes significant economic losses to the producers of Colonia Caroya during the months of high temperatures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus alutaceus 3aCladosporium 3aEurotium 3aGeotrichum 3aMucor 3aPenicillium 3aScopulariopsis 3aambient temperature 3abiotypes 3acolor 3adrying 3afactories 3afungi 3astarter cultures 3asummer 3awinter 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aFermentation 2aFood Microbiology 2aFungi 2aMeat Productsxmicrobiology 2aSeasons 2aTemperature 3aArgentina 0aArgentina 0aFilamentous fungi 0aSausages 0aPenicillium nalgiovense 0aAspergillus ochraceus1 aWagner, Jorge R.1 aStenglein, Sebastián A.1 aLudemann, Vanesa0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2013 June 03, v. 164, no. 1 p.81-86dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2013.03.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03085naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245011100161300001600272520163000288592002801918650001501946650001701961650001201978650001101990650001302001650000902014650000902023650001402032650001102046650001202057650000902069650001802078650001302096650001502109650002102124650002202145650000902167650001002176650001602186653001502202653001102217653001102228653001302239653001102252700002602263700002402289700001902313773012502332856007702457852000902534655001202543IND60515509920221120032829.0160315e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051550992DNAL7 a10.4141/cjas-2014-0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMichałek, K.10aAquaporin 2: Identification and analysis of expression in calves’ urine during their first month of life  ap. 653-659.  aMichałek, K., Dratwa-Chałupnik, A., Ciechanowicz, A.

Aquaporin 2 (AQP2) is a vasopressin-regulated water channel of the renal collecting duct and is excreted into urine. Renal excretion of AQP2 has been studied in humans, dogs, rats and mice. The aim of this study was to identify and analyze expression of AQP2 in calves’ urine. Short and controlled diarrhea was induced in the calves in order to determine any change in renal excretion of AQP2 and to evaluate a possible role of this channel in water balance during the neonatal period. For this purpose, an additional portion of lactose was administered to the calves with a milk replacer. The present work shows that after transient diarrhea associated with excessive supply of lactose in the diet, a significant increase in renal AQP2 excretion was reported in the first 3 wk of the calves’ lives. Renal excretion of this protein in the urine increased significantly despite the absence of changes in the concentration of vasopressin or the osmotic pressure of the blood plasma. The increase observed in the expression of the protein might be associated with the reduction of the total Ca²⁺ concentration in the blood plasma of calves. The results clearly indicate a different mechanism regulating urinary excretion of AQP2 in newborn calves, hitherto unknown. Although elevated renal excretion of AQP2 was observed, there was no increase in the osmolality of the urine in the calves tested.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquaporins 3ablood plasma 3acalcium 3acalves 3adiarrhea 3adiet 3adogs 3aexcretion 3ahumans 3alactose 3amice 3amilk replacer 3aneonates 3aosmolality 3aosmotic pressure 3aprotein synthesis 3arats 3aurine 3avasopressin 0aAquaporins 0abovine 0acattle 0aneonates 0akidney1 aDratwa-Chałupnik, A.1 aCiechanowicz, A.

A.10aAntigenic Detection of Human Strain of Influenza Virus A (H3N2) in Swine Populations at Three Locations in Nigeria and Ghana during the Dry Early Months of 2014  ap. 106-111.  aSince the first detection of human H3N2 influenza virus in Taiwanese pigs in 1970, infection of pigs with wholly human viruses has been known to occur in other parts of the world. These viruses, referred to as human‐like H3N2 viruses, have been known to cause clinical and subclinical infections of swine populations. Due to the paucity and complete unavailability of information on transmission of influenza viruses from other species, especially humans, to swine in Nigeria and Ghana, respectively, this study was designed to investigate the presence and prevalence of a human strain of influenza A (H3N2) in swine populations at three locations in two cities within these two West African countries in January and February, 2014. Using stratified random technique, nasal swab specimens were collected from seventy‐five (75) pigs at two locations in Ibadan, Nigeria and from fifty (50) pigs in Kumasi, Ghana. These specimens were tested directly by a sensitive Quantitative Solid Phase Antigen‐detection Sandwich ELISA using anti‐A/Brisbane/10/2007 haemagglutinin monoclonal antibody. Influenza virus A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2) was detected among pigs at the three study locations, with an aggregate prevalence of 4.0% for the two locations in Ibadan, Nigeria and also 4.0% for Kumasi, Ghana. Transmission of influenza viruses from other species to swine portends serious sinister prospects for genetic reassortment and evolvement of novel viruses. We therefore recommend that further studies should be carried out to investigate the presence of other circulating human and avian influenza viruses in swine populations in West Africa and also determine the extent of genetic reassortment of strains circulating among these pigs.

Soil hydraulic properties from two important ecological zones in Brazil are assessed. Water supplying capacity to plants is higher in semiarid than in humid zone soils. Reduction of root suction below −150 m does virtually not affect water availability. Predicting soil water availability to plants is important for agricultural and ecological models. Models that explicitly take into account root water uptake and transpiration reduction describe the ability of soil to supply water to plants based on soil hydraulic properties that depend on soil water content. The objective of this study was to further develop an existing single‐layer root water uptake model based on matric flux potential to allow for multi‐layer scenarios; and to illustrate its functionality using soil hydraulic properties from layered soils from two climate zones in Brazil: a semiarid zone and a humid zone. For each soil layer, the hydraulic properties were determined by inverse modeling of laboratory evaporation experiment data available for pressure heads between −165 and −1.5 m. The water supplying capacities of soils were evaluated using the newly developed multi‐layer root water uptake model. Soils from the semiarid zone were able to supply water to plants over a wider range of pressure heads. Soils from the humid zone showed slightly stronger hydraulic restrictions for supplying transpirable water. For the analyzed soils, only a negligible increase in available water results from decreasing the root water potential below −150 m. Therefore, based on this analysis, it is reasonable to expect plant adaptation to move toward an increase of root length density rather than to a decrease of minimum root water potential.  aPublisher supplied data  a2013/08967‐8cSão Paulo Research Foundation 3aevaporation 3aplant adaptation 3aplant available water 3aroot water potential 3asemiarid zones 3asoil water content 3atranspiration 3avadose zone 3awater uptake 3aBrazil1 ade Jong van Lier, Quirijn1 aMetselaar, Klaas0 tVadose zone journal.g2018, v. 17, no. 1 p.1-10dThe Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl3674032x1539-16637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/vzj2016.09.00833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02263naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245014800172300001800320520093700338592002801275650001701303650001401320650001701334650001201351650001501363650002401378650001701402650002001419650001101439651001201450651001201462653001401474653001501488653001401503653001201517653002401529700001901553700002201572700001901594773011101613856008401724852000901808655001201817IND60123004620221122030744.0150325e20130901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012300462DNAL7 a10.1080/00222933.2012.7630632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarpenter, Daniel10aDifferences in nest structure influence the importance of Formica rufa group (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) wood ant nests as refugia for earthworms  ap. 2305-2309.  aA previous study on the nests of the wood ant species Formica aquilonia in Finland showed them to be summer refugia for two species of earthworms in Finland. They showed that earthworm abundance and biomass were greater in nests than in surrounding soil and leaf litter, emphasizing the importance of the ants as ecosystem engineers. In this study nests of the closely related wood ant, Formica rufa in southern England were sampled to investigate whether earthworms use the nests in a similar way. Few earthworms were found in the wood ant nests sampled. The reason for these differences was probably because F . rufa nest structure was dry and lacked the moist decomposing layer found in the nests of F. aquilonia . We conclude that F. rufa nests are not used by earthworms as summer refugia in southern England. This re-emphasizes the difficulties of generalizing across closely related taxa and within biogeographical regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFormica rufa 3aant nests 3abiogeography 3abiomass 3aearthworms 3aecosystem engineers 3aplant litter 3arefuge habitats 3asummer 3aEngland 3aFinland 0awood ants 0aearthworms 0aant nests 0arefugia 0aecosystem engineers1 aSherlock, Emma1 aSandhu, Ramandeep1 aEggleton, Paul0 tJournal of natural history.g2013 Sept. 1, v. 47, no. 35-36 p.2305-2309dTaylor & Francisx1464-52627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00222933.2012.7630633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02099naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245012000167300001400287520071700301592002801018650002401046650001501070650001801085650002301103650001001126650002201136650001701158650001101175650001001186650001601196650002101212650001001233650002801243650001101271650001201282650002301294651001201317653001601329653002201345653002301367653002301390773012401413856008301537852000901620655001201629IND60479613720221120231637.0160630e20090601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047961372DNAL7 a10.1556/APhyt.44.2009.1.82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRipka, Georges,10aNew shrub-infesting Floracarus, Acaphyllisa and Anthocoptes species from Hungary (Acari: Prostigmata: Eriophyoidea)  ap. 75-86.  aAuthor made a regular mite collectings between 1990 and 2003 on ornamental trees and shrubs, on streets, parks, green spaces of housing estates, botanical gardens and private gardens, in various localities of Hungary.

Due to the limited number of CaMs, other calcium sensors modulate the regulation of Ca²⁺‐mediated cellular processes that are not managed by CaMs. Of 50 CaM‐like (CML) proteins identified in Arabidopsis thaliana, we characterized the function of CML10. Yeast two‐hybrid screening revealed phosphomannomutase (PMM) as a putative interaction partner of CML10. In vitro and in vivo interaction assays were performed to analyze the interaction mechanisms of CML10 and PMM. PMM activity and the phenotypes of cml10 knock‐down mutants were studied to elucidate the role(s) of the CML10–PMM interaction. PMM interacted specifically with CML10 in the presence of Ca²⁺ through its multiple interaction motifs. This interaction promoted the activity of PMM. The phenotypes of cml10 knock‐down mutants were more sensitive to stress conditions than wild‐type plants, corresponding with the fact that PMM is an enzyme which modulates the biosynthesis of ascorbic acid, an antioxidant. The results of this research demonstrate that a calcium sensor, CML10, which is an evolutionary variant of CaM, modulates the stress responses in Arabidopsis by regulating ascorbic acid production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3abiosynthesis 3acalcium 3acalmodulin 3amutants 3aphenotype 3aphosphomannomutase 3ascreening 3astress response 3atwo hybrid system techniques1 aNguyen, Ha Thi Kim1 aKim, Soo Youn1 aShin, Jin Seok1 aCho, Dong Hwa1 aHong, Seung Beom1 aShin, Jeong Sheop1 aOk, Sung Han0 tnew phytologist.g2016 Jan., v. 209, no. 2 p.664-678dAcademic Press.x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.136123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02443naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002100154245012500175300001400300520106400314592002801378650001001406650001901416650001001435650001201445650001201457650001001469650000901479650001401488650001001502650001601512650001201528650001701540650001001557650001401567651001101581653002301592653002401615653001001639653002701649700003401676700002601710700002401736773010201760856009001862852000901952655001201961IND60127514620221122111627.0151110e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012751462DNAL7 a10.1655/HERPETOLOGICA-D-13-000442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCondez, Thais H.12aA New Species of Brachycephalus (Anura: Brachycephalidae) from the Highlands of the Atlantic Forest, Southeastern Brazil  ap. 89-99.  aA new species of brachycephalid frog is described from the highlands of the Atlantic Forest in Serra do Mar, municipality of Cunha, São Paulo State, southeastern Brazil.

Unlike previous investigations limited to linear wave loading, the seabed response around a buried pipeline due to combined non-linear wave and current loadings is investigated in this study. Based on third-order approximation for the wave–current interactions, a parametric study has been carried out to examine the influences of wave non-linearity and current on the pore pressure firstly. Numerical results demonstrate the significant effects of current in case of larger water depth, smaller period wave and fine sand. Then, the configuration and filled materials for a trench layer that normally is used for the protection of a buried pipeline are studied. The numerical results clearly show that an appropriate trench layer can reduce the risk of liquefaction around a pipeline.  aPublisher supplied data 3aengineers 3aliquefaction 3amathematical models 3arisk reduction 3asand1 aJeng, D.-S.1 aWang, J.H.1 aZhou, X.L.0 tApplied ocean research.g2012 Mar., v. 35 p.25-37dElsevier Ltdx0141-11877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apor.2011.12.0053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02088naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245021600177300001800393520073700411592002801148650001701176650001101193650001901204650001001223650001201233650001401245650001001259650001601269650001901285651001101304653000901315653001501324653001501339653001301354700002801367700002501395700002701420773012601447856008401573852000901657655001201666IND60123004820221123012407.0150325e20130901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012300482DNAL7 a10.1080/00222933.2013.7918882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNarita, João Paulo Z.12aA new species of Ameroseius Berlese from Brazil, redescriptions of Ameroseius plumosus (Oudemans) and Ameroseius plumigera (Oudemans) (Acari: Mesostigmata: Ameroseiidae) based on the examination of type material  ap. 2311-2326.  aAmeroseius Berlese is the most numerous genus of family Ameroseiidae Evans (in Hughes 1961).

Our objective was to evaluate the success of using an active canopy sensor for developing maize N recommendations. This study was conducted in 21 farmers’ fields from 2007 to 2009, representing the maize production regions of east central and southeastern Pennsylvania, USA. Four blocks at each site included seven sidedress N rates (0–280kgNha⁻¹) and one at-planting N rate of 280kgNha⁻¹. Canopy reflectance in the 590nm and 880nm wavelengths, soil samples, chlorophyll meter (SPAD) measurements and above-ground biomass were collected at the 6th–7th-leaf growth stage (V6–V7). Relative amber normalized difference vegetative index (ANDVIᵣₑₗₐₜᵢᵥₑ) and relative SPAD (SPADᵣₑₗₐₜᵢᵥₑ) were determined based on the relative measurements from the zero sidedress treatment to the 280kgNha⁻¹ at-planting treatment. Observations from the current study were compared to relationships between economic optimum N rate (EONR) and ANDVIᵣₑₗₐₜᵢᵥₑ, presidedress NO₃ test (PSNT), or SPADᵣₑₗₐₜᵢᵥₑ that were developed from a previous study. These comparisons were based on an absolute mean difference (AMD) between observed EONR and the previously determined predicted relationships. The AMD for the relationship between EONR and ANDVIᵣₑₗₐₜᵢᵥₑ in the current study was 46kgNha⁻¹. Neither the PSNT (AMD=66kgNha⁻¹) nor the SPADᵣₑₗₐₜᵢᵥₑ (AMD=72kgNha⁻¹) provided as good an indicator of EONR. When using all the observations from the two studies for the relationships between EONR and the various measurements, ANDVIᵣₑₗₐₜᵢᵥₑ (R²=0.65) provided a better estimate of EONR than PSNT (R²=0.49) or SPADᵣₑₗₐₜᵢᵥₑ (not significant). Crop reflectance captured similar information as the PSNT and SPADᵣₑₗₐₜᵢᵥₑ, as reflected in strong relationships (R²>0.60) among these variables. Crop canopy reflectance using an active sensor (i.e. ANDVIᵣₑₗₐₜᵢᵥₑ) provided as good or better an indicator of EONR than PSNT or SPADᵣₑₗₐₜᵢᵥₑ, and provides an opportunity to easily adjust in-season N applications spatially.  aPublisher supplied data 3atemporal variation 3acrop production 3aZea mays 3acanopy 3anitrogen 3afertilizer rates 3adevelopmental stages 3asoil heterogeneity 3aaboveground biomass 3acorn 3areflectance 3awavelengths 3asoil sampling 3achlorophyll 3aPennsylvania 0asensors1 aBeegle, D.1 aZhu, Q.1 aSripada, R.0 tField crops research.g2011 Jan. 14, v. 120, no. 1 p.94-101dElsevier B.V.x0378-42907nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/486123Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2010.09.0053Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02817naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245010800177300001600285520144900301592002801750650001201778650002001790650001501810650002301825650001201848650002201860650001601882650002201898650001101920650002201931650001201953653002001965653001201985653002001997653002202017653001802039653001102057653001402068700002302082700002202105700002102127773010402148856008602252852000902338655001202347IND60126720320200508000000.0200508e20050101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012672032DNAL7 a10.2980/i1195-6860-12-1-103.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGolluscio, Rodolfo A.10aSpatial heterogeneity at different grain sizes in grazed versus ungrazed sites of the Patagonian steppe  ap. 103-109.  aIn arid ecosystems, grazing-induced desertification can be either associated with an increase or a decrease in the spatial heterogeneity of plant communities. We explored the grazing-associated change in the spatial heterogeneity along a gradient of plot sizes (= grains) in a Patagonian steppe with two structural phases: scattered grasses and shrubs surrounded by grasses. We compared the biomass heterogeneity (estimated from locally calibrated digital photographs) of three sites: one ungrazed for the last 26 y and two moderately grazed. On each site, we analyzed three belt transects of 50 contiguous 20- × 20-cm plots and grouped the photographs into plots of increasing size. We used the p parameter (gamma distribution) to measure the global heterogeneity of the biomass and semivariograms to calculate internal heterogeneity and spatial dependence (estimated from the y-intercept and the fractal dimension of semivariograms, respectively). We found that the global and the internal heterogeneity were higher in the grazed sites than in the ungrazed one, possibly because grazing increases the contrast between the structural phases. However, the fractal dimension did not change with grazing. The difference between grazed and ungrazed sites did not disappear when grain increased, probably because the grazing-induced biomass increase of the shrub-dominated phase was higher than the biomass decrease of the scattered grasses phase.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3adesertification 3aecosystems 3afractal dimensions 3agrasses 3agrazing intensity 3aphotographs 3aplant communities 3ashrubs 3aspatial variation 3asteppes 0aarid ecosystems 0abiomass 0adesertification 0afractal dimension 0asemivariogram 0aCorrea 0a1971-19841 aPérez, Juliana A.1 aParuelo, José M.1 aGhersa, Claudio,0 tÉcoscience.g2005 Jan. 1, v. 12, no. 1 p.103-109dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19715x2376-76267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2980/i1195-6860-12-1-103.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03288naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245010700162300001600269520189300285592002802178650001202206650002302218650001702241650002002258650002502278650001902303650002302322650001902345650001702364650001102381650001302392650001102405650001802416650001102434650002402445650001702469650001002486650001202496650001302508651001302521700001702534700001902551700001302570700001502583773010202598856007302700852000902773655001202782IND60486130120221121021442.0160218e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048613012DNAL7 a10.1111/zph.122142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcFadden, A.

The objective of this study was to develop and apply a multicriteria ranking model for zoonoses in Mongolia, a country highly affected by zoonotic disease, to inform optimal resource allocation at the national level. Diseases were evaluated based on their impact on human health, livestock sector health and the wider society through affects on the economic value of livestock, as well as the feasibility of control in both the human and livestock population. Data on disease in Mongolia were collected from various government departments including the Mongolian State Central Laboratory, the Mongolian Department of Veterinary and Animal Breeding, the Mongolian Ministry of Health, Mongolian National Center for Communicable Diseases, the National Center for Zoonotic Disease and expert opinion from a workshop with a number of Mongolian Government officials and researchers. A combined score for both impact of the disease and feasibility of its control was calculated. Five zoonotic diseases were determined to be of high priority from this assessment (i.e. ovine brucellosis, echinococcosis (hydatids), rabies, anthrax and bovine brucellosis). The results supported some of the findings for high‐priority diseases (namely brucellosis, rabies and anthrax) from a previous priority setting exercise carried out in Mongolia in 2011, but also identified and ranked additional animal diseases of public health importance. While the process of model development was largely Mongolian specific, the experience of developing and parameterizing this multicriteria ranking model could be replicated by other countries where zoonoses have substantive impacts on both animal and human health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthrax 3abovine brucellosis 3acase studies 3acontrol methods 3adeveloping countries 3aechinococcosis 3aeconomic valuation 3aexpert opinion 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3ahydatids 3amodels 3apublic health 3arabies 3aresource allocation 3arisk ranking 3asheep 3asociety 3azoonoses 3aMongolia1 aMuellner, P.1 aBaljinnyam, Z.1 aVink, D.1 aWilson, N.0 tZoonoses and public health.g2016 Mar., v. 63, no. 2 p.138-151dBlackwell Verlagx1863-19597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/zph.122143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02944naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245013600168300001600304520135400320592002801674650001201702650001401714650001901728650001001747650001301757650002201770650002301792650002601815650001501841650002201856650002201878650001001900651001101910653001701921653002901938653002201967653002801989653002602017653001202043653002302055653000902078653001802087653000902105700002602114700002302140700002102163700001902184773010402203856008602307852000902393655001202402IND60126720520200508000000.0200508e20050101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012672052DNAL7 a10.2980/i1195-6860-12-1-110.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarbaro, Luc10aComparative responses of bird, carabid, and spider assemblages to stand and landscape diversity in maritime pine plantation forests  ap. 110-121.  aWe carried out a multi-taxa study to investigate the responses of species assemblages to stand and landscape variables in maritime pine plantation forests in the Landes de Gascogne (southwestern France). Breeding birds, carabid beetles, and ground-dwelling spiders were sampled simultaneously in a balanced set of 27 stands varying in tree species composition, age, and vertical structure. The composition and structure of surrounding landscapes were quantified within a 500-m radius around the stands. Species responses to a combination of 12 stand and landscape variables were estimated using multiple stepwise regression. Bird, carabid, and spider assemblages were related to the same explanatory variables using a set of co-inertia analyses. Tree height was the best predictive variable for all taxa at species richness, species assemblage, and individual species levels. Landscape variables were important as secondary factors, especially landscape fragmentation, spatial heterogeneity, and shape and spatial distribution of deciduous forest patches in the surrounding landscape. The occurrence of deciduous forest patches and an increasing landscape heterogeneity appeared to be beneficial to forest birds and spiders but not to carabids, probably because forest carabids are generally poor dispersers, more sensitive to habitat fragmentation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAraneae 3aCarabidae 3aPinus pinaster 3abirds 3abreeding 3adeciduous forests 3aforest plantations 3ahabitat fragmentation 3alandscapes 3aspatial variation 3aspecies diversity 3atrees 3aFrance 0abiodiversity 0adeciduous forest patches 0aforest management 0alandscape fragmentation 0aspatial heterogeneity 0aHänggi 0aStöckli & Nentwig 0a1995 0aCoulon et al. 0a20001 aPontcharraud, Laurent1 aVetillard, Fabrice1 aGuyon, Dominique1 aJactel, Hervé0 tÉcoscience.g2005 Jan. 1, v. 12, no. 1 p.110-121dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19715x2376-76267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2980/i1195-6860-12-1-110.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03203naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245011600167300001600283520151300299592002801812650002301840650000901863650001201872650002001884650001401904650003701918650002301955650000901978650002601987650001302013650001402026650001402040650001702054650001002071650001202081650003102093650001502124650002302139653001102162653002602173653001802199653001702217653002102234653002102255700002602276700001802302700002902320700002502349700002002374700002002394773012502414856007702539852000902616655001202625IND60515510320221123034929.0160315e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051551032DNAL7 a10.4141/cjas-2014-0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAalhus, Jennifer L.10aReview: Canadian beef grading – Opportunities to identify carcass and meat quality traits valued by consumers  ap. 545-556.  aAalhus, J.

Review: Canadian beef grading – Opportunities to identify carcass and meat quality traits valued by consumers. Can. J. Anim. Sci. 94: 545–556. Beef value is in the eye, mouth or mind of the consumer; however, currently, producers are paid on the basis of carcass grade. In general, affluent consumers are becoming more discerning and are willing to pay for both credence and measureable quality differences. The Canadian grading system for youthful carcasses identifies both lean yield and quality attributes, whereas mature carcasses are broadly categorized. Opportunities exist to improve the prediction of lean meat yield and better identify meat quality characteristics in youthful beef, and to obtain additional value from mature carcasses through muscle profiling. Individual carcass identification along with development of database systems like the Beef InfoXchange System (BIXS) will allow a paradigm shift for the industry as traits of economic value can be easily identified to improve marketing value chains. In the near future, developing technologies (e.g., grade cameras, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, and spectroscopic methods such as near infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and hyperspectral imaging) will be successfully implemented on-line to identify a multitude of carcass and quality traits of growing importance to segments of the consuming population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3abeef 3acameras 3acarcass quality 3adatabases 3adual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 3aeconomic valuation 3aeyes 3ahyperspectral imagery 3aindustry 3alean meat 3amarketing 3ameat quality 3amouth 3amuscles 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3aprediction 3awillingness to pay 0aReview 0aCanadian beef grading 0acarcass yield 0ameat quality 0anew technologies 0aconsumer demands1 aLópez-Campos, Óscar1 aPrieto, Nuria1 aRodas-González, Argenis1 aDugan, Michael E.

The system makes a prediction step ahead of time, compares it with the online measured value, and makes a logical judgment based on the residual error to achieve the purpose of real-time diagnosis of the automatic monitoring system. We developed a novel combined algorithm for dam deformation prediction using two traditional models and one optimization model. The developed algorithm combines two sub-algorithms: the gray model (GM) (1, 1) and the back-propagation neural network (BPNN) model. The GM (1, 1) addresses the effects of the automated monitoring of data from unstable situations; the BPNN model addresses the internal non-linear regularity of the dam displacement. The connection weights and thresholds of the BPNN model can be optimized and determined via the genetic algorithm (GA), which can decrease the uncertainties within the model predictions and improve the prediction accuracy. The results show that the fault self-diagnosis system based on the GM-GA-BP combined model can realize online fault diagnosis better than the traditional single models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aautomation 3adeformation 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aprediction 3auncertainty1 aRen, Chao1 aZheng, Zhong-Tian1 aLiang, Yue-Ji1 aLu, Xian-Jian0 tISPRS international journal of geo-information.g2017 Dec. 27, v. 7, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21619x2220-99647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi70100043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02466naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245018300153300001600336520113900352592002801491650001901519650001801538650000901556650001301565650002401578650002101602650002501623650001601648650001301664650002401677650001601701650002001717650001301737650001901750700001901769700001701788700001301805700001401818773011801832856007301950852000902023655001202032IND60478893720221118193230.0160115e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047889372DNAL7 a10.1111/jfd.123452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVo, N T K10aDifferential viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus genotype IVb infection in fin fibroblast and epithelial cell lines from walleye, Sander vitreus (Mitchill), at cold temperatures  ap. 175-188.  aA cell line, WE‐cfin11e, with an epithelial‐like morphology was developed from a caudal fin of walleye, Sander vitreus (Mitchill), characterized as distinct from the established walleye caudal fin fibroblast‐like cell line, WE‐cfin11f, and compared with WE‐cfin11f for susceptibility to VHSV IVb. Immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy were used to localize the intermediate filament protein, vimentin, the tight junction protein, zonula occludens‐1 (ZO‐1), the extracellular matrix protein, collagen I, and the viral protein, G. Although both cell lines contained vimentin, only WE‐cfin11e stained for ZO‐1 and only WE‐cfin11f stained for collagen I. Ascorbic acid increased the accumulation of collagen I and caused the appearance of collagen fibres only in WE‐cfin11f cultures. At 14 °C, both cell lines produced VHSV IVb, but the infection developed more rapidly in WE‐cfin11f. At 4 °C, both cell lines became infected with VHSV IVb as judged by the expression of viral proteins, N and G, but only WE‐cfin11f produced virus. The results suggest that cold temperatures can modulate viral tropism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSander vitreus 3aascorbic acid 3acold 3acollagen 3aconfocal microscopy 3aepithelial cells 3aextracellular matrix 3afibroblasts 3agenotype 3aimmunocytochemistry 3atemperature 3atight junctions 3avimentin 3aviral proteins1 aBender, A.

In this study, molecular dynamics simulation with reactive force field is performed to investigate the surface instability induced thermal degradation of Ni nanocatalyst and coke deposition induced catalyst deactivation. Coke deposited on catalyst surfaces is a complex mixture of carbonaceous organics. Coke surrogate models containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and oxygenated aromatics are proposed to reflect the molecular size and O/C ratio based on the molecular structures identified during lignin pyrolysis and soot inception mechanism. Lindemann index is used to characterize the degree of crystallinity of catalyst. It is found that atoms at unsaturated sites of outer shell show high mobility and tend to modify the coordination number distribution. Mechanisms behind the effects of temperature, PAH size and oxygen content on coke adsorption are revealed from three aspects of molecular collision dynamics, thermal dynamics and kinetics. The modification of crystallinity of catalyst outer shell and the occurrence of seeping after coke adsorption would affect the subsequent catalyst regeneration. This study is expected to provide guidance on the design of anti-coking catalyst, evaluation of catalyst regeneration and reactor optimisation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3acrystal structure 3aenergy 3alignin 3amolecular dynamics 3amolecular weight 3ananocatalysts 3aoxygen 3apyrolysis 3asoot 3atemperature 0aBiomass 0aCatalyst deactivation 0aCoke deposition 0aMolecular modelling1 aVolpe, Roberto1 aJiang, Xi0 tApplied energy.g2021 Nov. 15, v. 302 p.117557-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.1175573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02101naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245006500160300001300225520118400238592002801422650001101450650001101461650001001472650002501482700001401507700001701521700002301538700001601561773008401577856008201661990002301743852000901766655001201775IND60088817220221119222307.0141102e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008881722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apor.2012.01.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Jun10aShip's tracking control based on nonlinear time series model  ap. 1-11.  aFor actualization of ship tracking control along a desired path with a constant velocity, a hybrid model is proposed to represent the ship's tracking dynamic behavior. Firstly, a single-input single-output nonlinear time series model is built for characterizing the responses between the ship's heading angle deviation and its rudder angle. To represent nonlinearity of the ship motion, the rolling angle is used as the model index to make the model parameters vary with the ship sailing states considering the yaw-heel-effect. The nonlinear time series model is identified offline by using previously observed real data. Then, a state-space model combined with the relationship between the heading angle deviations and the cross track errors is proposed to represent the tracking dynamic behavior. On the basis of the identified state-space type tracking motion model, a predictive controller is designed to steer the ship sailing forward with the constant velocity along the predefined reference path. The effectiveness of the nonlinear time series model-based method for the tracking control proposed in this paper is demonstrated by simulation studies and actual experiments.  aPublisher supplied data 3amodels 3aoceans 3aships 3atime series analysis1 aPeng, Hui1 aOhtsu, Kohei1 aKitagawa, Genshiro1 aItoh, Tohru0 tApplied ocean research.g2012 June, v. 36 p.1-11dElsevier Ltdx0141-11877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apor.2012.01.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02000naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245010000174300001600274520070100290592002800991650001901019650001701038650001201055650002001067650001201087650002301099650005201122650001401174653001901188653002001207653002201227653003001249653002401279700002301303700003501326700002701361773010701388856008601495852000901581655001201590IND60540720820221118022426.0190318e20140102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054072082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2013.08.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRajakumar, Perumal10aSynthesis and cardio protective biological applications of glucodendrimers by H9C2 cell studies  ap. 403-414.  aNovel glucodendrimers scaffolds containing α-d-glucopyranoside at the surface and triazole as bridging unit have been synthesized.

In June and July of 2007 and 2008, we surveyed 19 of Rhode Island's largest salt marshes. Seaside Sparrow abundance had declined at 9 of 11 marshes where the species was present in 1982, and we detected no sparrows at 4 smaller (<20 ha) marshes where they were present in 1982. Seaside Sparrow abundance increased at 3 marshes, including 1 at which the birds were not detected in 1982. We used aerial photographs to quantify changes in marsh size and human development within 150-m and 1-km buffers surrounding each marsh. From 1981 to 2008, the overall average number of structures within the 150-m and 1-km buffers increased by 37% and 66%, respectively. Concomitantly, salt-marsh area decreased by an overall average of 11%. Seaside Sparrow abundance was related to marsh size, but our analyses did not detect a statistical relationship of landscape or habitat-loss variables with the decline in sparrows. The Seaside Sparrow is currently classified as a species of concern in Rhode Island. However, given the population decline we documented, and the impending threat to salt-marsh habitats imposed by rising sea levels, we suggest that the classification be reassessed now and periodically in the future, and that monitoring efforts for the species be continued.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmmodramus 3aaerial photography 3abirds 3abreeding 3abuffers 3ahabitats 3ahuman development 3alandscapes 3amonitoring 3apopulation dynamics 3asalt marshes 3asurveys 3aRhode Island1 aReinert, Steven E.1 aGallagher, Meghan E.1 aLussier, Suzanne M.1 aWalsh, Eric0 tNortheastern naturalist.g2015, v. 22, no. 4 p.658-671dHumboldt Field Research Institutex1092-61947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1656%2F045.022.04033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02065naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001600143245013500159300001600294520090000310592002801210650001101238650001601249650001701265650003201282650002101314651001101335653001701346653001901363653002901382653001801411700001201429700001701441700002201458773012501480856007701605852000901682655001201691IND60515510620221121160827.0160315e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051551062DNAL7 a10.4141/cjas-2014-0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, W.

Sixty feed barley samples were collected from various locations in western Canada. Samples were either ground (1 mm) or dry-rolled to a processing index of 80%, and fermentability was assessed by measuring gas production (GP) and dry matter disappearances (DMD) at 0, 4, 8, 14 and 24 h of incubation using a batch culture technique. Physical and chemical composition, and GP and DMD varied substantially among samples. There were significant correlations among test weight and nutrient content of barley with GP and DMD of ground barley. The results indicate that the impact of nutrient content on in vitro DMD is more easily detected with ground than rolled barley.  aPublisher supplied data 3abarley 3afeed barley 3afermentation 3agas production (biological) 3anutrient content 3aCanada 0aBarley grain 0agas production 0adry matter disappearance 0abatch culture1 aOba, M.1 aSwift, M.

By implementing ANN on heat insulation results of coating samples, prepared based on a L16 orthogonal array, mean fireproofing time (MFPT) values were properly predicted. The predicted data were then proved to be valid through performing closeness examinations on fuzzy inference systems results regarding their experimental counterparts. However, the possible deviations tapped into phenomena like foam detachment and char cracking were alleviated by ANFIS modeling embedded with pertinent fuzzy rules based on the sole and associative practical role of used additives. The contribution of each intumescent coating component on the formulation with optimized fireproofing behavior was then explored using GA modeling. A similar optimization procedure was also conducted using conventional Taguchi experimental design but the GA based optimized intumescent coating was found to exhibit higher MFPT value than that suggested by the Taguchi method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTaguchi method 3aadditives 3aalgorithms 3aammonium polyphosphates 3aartificial intelligence 3acoatings 3acracking 3aexperimental design 3aflame retardants 3afoams 3aheat 3ainsulating materials 3aliquids 3amelamine 3aneural networks 3aprediction 3athermoplastics 0aIntumescent coating 0aFlame retardant 0aArtificial intelligence techniques 0aGenetic algorithm1 aKhorasani, Manouchehr1 aAkhlaghi, Shahin1 aFazilat, Hakimeh1 aGedde, U.

We aim to describe the current literature and gaps in knowledge of chronic sequelae associated with common foodborne illnesses. A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science for peer-reviewed articles published January 1, 2000 to April 1, 2018. Articles available in English, of any epidemiological study design, for 10 common foodborne pathogens (Campylobacter, Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Listeria, Shigella, Cryptosporidium, Cyclospora, Giardia, Yersinia, and norovirus) and their associated gastrointestinal (GI)- and joint-related sequelae were included. Of the 6348 titles screened for inclusion, 380 articles underwent full-text review; of those 380, 129 were included for data extraction. Of the bacterial pathogens included in the search terms, the most commonly reported were Salmonella (n = 104) and Campylobacter (n = 99); E. coli (n = 55), Shigella (n = 49), Yersinia (n = 49), and Listeria (n = 15) all had fewer results. Norovirus was the only virus included in our search, with 28 article that reported mostly GI-related sequelae and reactive arthritis (ReA) reported once. For parasitic diseases, Giardia (n = 26) and Cryptosporidium (n = 18) had the most articles, and no results were found for Cyclospora. The most commonly reported GI outcomes were irritable bowel syndrome (IBS; n = 119) and inflammatory bowel disease (n = 29), and ReA (n = 122) or “joint pain” (n = 19) for joint-related sequelae. Salmonella and Campylobacter were most often associated with a variety of outcomes, with ReA (n = 34 and n = 27) and IBS (n = 17 and n = 20) reported most often. This scoping review shows there are still a relatively small number of studies being conducted to understand specific pathogen/outcome relationships. It also shows where important gaps in the impact of chronic sequelae from common foodborne illnesses still exist and where more focused research would best be implemented.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCampylobacter 3aCryptosporidium 3aCyclospora 3aEscherichia coli 3aGiardia 3aListeria 3aNorovirus 3aSalmonella 3aShigella 3aYersinia 3aarthritis 3acomplications (disease) 3aepidemiological studies 3aexperimental design 3afood pathogens 3afoodborne illness 3agastrointestinal system 3ainflammatory bowel disease 3airritable bowel syndrome 3aparasitoses 3aviruses 0afoodborne diseases/complications 0afoodborne diseases/epidemiology 0afunctional gastrointestinal disorders 0aautoimmune disorders 0afoodborne infections 0ascoping review1 aAusthof, Erika1 aArmstrong, Alexandra1 aSchaefer, Kenzie1 aVilla Zapata, Lorenzo1 aMcClelland, D.

Impact crater descriptive indices can be used to describe morphological features and thus provide direct evidence for both the current state and evolution history of the Moon. Current description methods for lunar impact craters are predominantly qualitative, and mostly focus on their morphological profiles. Less attention is paid to the detailed morphological features inside and outside of the craters. A well-established and descriptive index system is required to describe the real morphological features of lunar impact craters, which are complex in a systematic way, and further improve study, such as heterogeneity analyses of lunar impact craters. This study employs a detailed lunar surface morphological analysis to propose a descriptive index system for lunar impact craters, including indices for the description of individual craters based on their morphological characteristics, spatial structures and basic composition (i.e., crater rim, crater wall, crater floor, central uplift, and ejecta), and indices for crater groups, including spatial distribution and statistical characteristics. Based on the proposed descriptive index system, a description standard for lunar impact craters is designed for categorising and describing these indices in a structured manner. To test their usability and effectiveness, lunar impact craters from different locations are manually detected, and corresponding values for different indices are extracted and organised for a heterogeneity analysis. The results demonstrate that the proposed index system can effectively depict the basic morphological features and spatial characteristics of lunar impact craters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEarth system science 3adescriptive studies 3ageomorphology 3aspatial data1 aLei, Mengling1 aLiu, Danyang1 aZhou, Yi1 aZhao, Hao1 aQian, Kejian0 tISPRS international journal of geo-information.g2017 Dec. 29, v. 7, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21619x2220-99647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi70100053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02233naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002300186245009700209300001800306506007600324520093600400592002801336506003701364650002201401650001201423650001301435650001401448653001201462653002501474653001701499653000901516653000901525700001901534700002101553773017301574856007901747852000901826655001201835IND60173588720221207113034.0150603e20130305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017358872DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12196051102doi7 aPMC35938802pmcid7 a234311562pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKessels, Helmut W.10aMetabotropic NMDA receptor function is required for β-amyloid–induced synaptic depression  ap. 4033-4038.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe mechanisms by which β-amyloid (Aβ), a peptide fragment believed to contribute to Alzheimer’s disease, leads to synaptic deficits are not known. Here we find that elevated oligomeric Aβ requires ion flux-independent function of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) to produce synaptic depression. Aβ activates this metabotropic NMDAR function on GluN2B-containing NMDARs but not on those containing GluN2A. Furthermore, oligomeric Aβ leads to a selective loss of synaptic GluN2B responses, effecting a switch in subunit composition from GluN2B to GluN2A, a process normally observed during development. Our results suggest that conformational changes of the NMDAR, and not ion flow through its channel, are required for Aβ to produce synaptic depression and a switch in NMDAR composition. This Aβ-induced signaling mediated by alterations in GluN2B conformation may be a target for therapeutic intervention of Alzheimer’s disease.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAlzheimer disease 3aamyloid 3apeptides 3areceptors 0asynapse 0aion-flow independent 0aamyloid-beta 0aNR2A 0aNR2B1 aNabavi, Sadegh1 aMalinow, Roberto0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 Mar. 5, v. 110, no. 10 p.4033-4038dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12196051103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02855naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245016800159300001400327520139800341592002801739650004101767650001501808650002901823650002501852650003001877650001301907650001201920650001501932650001401947650003701961650001401998650000902012650001102021650001002032650001502042700002602057700002302083700001402106700001602120700001802136773016102154856007302315852000902388655001202397IND60135889620221120163932.0150522e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013588962DNAL7 a10.1111/jam.126672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSatthanakul, P.10aAntimicrobial effect of lemongrass oil against oral malodour micro‐organisms and the pilot study of safety and efficacy of lemongrass mouthrinse on oral malodour  ap. 11-17.  aAIMS: Lemongrass oil (LG) has been reported as being effective against bacteria embedded within the biofilm. The aims of this study were to investigate antimicrobial activity against common odourigenic micro‐organisms, the safety and efficacy of LG mouthrinse on oral malodour in healthy volunteers. METHODS AND RESULTS: Antimicrobial activity of LG mouthrinse was examined against common odourigenic micro‐organisms using broth microdilution assay and the disc diffusion method. A randomised double‐blind clinical study was performed in 20 healthy volunteers. Volatile sulphur compounds (VSCs) level was measured using a Halimeter on day 0 and day 8 in each volunteer. The results showed that LG mouthrinse was effective against Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans ATCC43718 and Porphyromonas gingivalis W50 but less effective against Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175. In addition, the mouthrinse significantly reduced VSCs on day 8. CONCLUSIONS: LG mouthrinse was able to reduce oral malodour and appeared to be safe. The overall satisfaction of the mouthrinse was acceptable. However, the spiciness and taste of the mouthrinse need to be improved. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study demonstrated that the LG mouthrinse significantly reduced oral malodour. This mouthrinse would be another alternative mouthrinse choice for prevention of malodour, plaque and gingivitis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans 3aCymbopogon 3aPorphyromonas gingivalis 3aStreptococcus mutans 3aanti-infective properties 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3agingivitis 3ahalitosis 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3aoff odors 3aoils 3asulfur 3ataste 3avolunteers1 aTaweechaisupapong, S.1 aPaphangkorakit, J.1 aPesee, M.1 aTimabut, P.1 aKhunkitti, W.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2015 Jan., v. 118, no. 1 p.11-17dPublished for the Society for Applied Bacteriology by Blackwell Sciencex1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.126673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02863naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245009500204500001500299506007600314520142800390592002801818506003701846650001901883650001401902650001001916650001001926650002301936650001401959650001601973650002101989650001802010650001902028650001602047650001202063650001002075653001102085700002102096700002102117700002102138700001702159773011902176856007702295852000902372655001202381IND60654631420221207120828.0190725e20190712xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065463142DNAL7 a10.3390/plants80702202doi7 aPMC66815042pmcid7 a313369022pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarmens, Harry 10aCan Reduced Irrigation Mitigate Ozone Impacts on an Ozone-Sensitive African Wheat Variety?  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGround-level ozone (O<inf>3</inf>) pollution is known to adversely affect the production of O<inf>3</inf>-sensitive crops such as wheat. The magnitude of impact is dependent on the accumulated stomatal flux of O<inf>3</inf> into the leaves. In well-irrigated plants, the leaf pores (stomata) tend to be wide open, which stimulates the stomatal flux and therefore the adverse impact of O<inf>3</inf> on yield. To test whether reduced irrigation might mitigate O<inf>3</inf> impacts on flag leaf photosynthesis and yield parameters, we exposed an O<inf>3</inf>-sensitive Kenyan wheat variety to peak concentrations of 30 and 80 ppb O<inf>3</inf> for four weeks in solardomes and applied three irrigation regimes (well-watered, frequent deficit, and infrequent deficit irrigation) during the flowering and grain filling stage. Reduced irrigation stimulated 1000-grain weight and harvest index by 33% and 13%, respectively (when O<inf>3</inf> treatments were pooled), which compensated for the O<inf>3</inf>-induced reductions observed in well-watered plants. Whilst full irrigation accelerated the O<inf>3</inf>-induced reduction in photosynthesis by a week, such an effect was not observed for the chlorophyll content index of the flag leaf. Further studies under field conditions are required to test whether reduced irrigation can be applied as a management tool to mitigate adverse impacts of O<inf>3</inf> on wheat yield.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3afilling period 3aflowering 3awheat 3aozone 3adeficit irrigation 3apollution 3agrain yield 3airrigation rates 3aharvest index 3aphotosynthesis 3achlorophyll 3astomata 3acrops 0aleaves1 aHayes, Felicity 1 aSharps, Katrina 1 aRadbourne, Alan 1 aMills, Gina 0 tPlants.g2019 July 12, v. 8, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants80702203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02602naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002800176245014100204300001500345520126100360592002801621650001501649650001401664650001501678650002201693650001001715650001301725650001701738650000901755650001601764650001601780650001401796700002301810773015201833856006901985856010602054990002302160852000902183655001202192IND60643829720221116224710.0190514e20151119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064382972DNAL7 a10.3791/530712doi7 aPMC46927362pmcid7 a266495672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRousseau, Jean-Philippe10aElectrophysiology on isolated brainstem-spinal cord preparations from newborn rodents allows neural respiratory network output recording  ap. e53071.  aWhile it is well known that the central respiratory drive is located in the brainstem, several aspects of its basic function, development, and response to stimuli remain to be fully understood. To overcome the difficulty of accessing the brainstem in the whole animal, isolation of the brainstem and part of the spinal cord is performed. This preparation is maintained in artificial cerebro-spinal fluid where gases, concentrations, and temperature are controlled and monitored. The output signal from the respiratory network is recorded by a suction electrode placed on the fourth ventral root. In this manner, stimuli can be directly applied onto the brainstem, and the effect can be recorded directly. The signal recorded is linked to the inspiratory signal sent to the diaphragm via the phrenic nerve, and can be described as bursts (around 8 bursts per minute). Analysis of these bursts (frequency, amplitude, length, and area under the curve) allows precise characterization of the stimulus effect on the respiratory network. The main limitation of this method is the viability of the preparation beyond the early post-natal stages. Thus, this method greatly focuses on the study of the whole network without the peripheral inputs in the newborn rat.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrain stem 3adiaphragm 3aelectrodes 3aelectrophysiology 3agases 3aneonates 3anerve tissue 3arats 3aspinal cord 3atemperature 3aviability1 aCaravagna, Céline0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2015 Nov. 19, , no. 105 p.e53071-e53071dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/530713Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/53071/electrophysiology-on-isolated-brainstem-spinal-cord-preparations-from  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02049naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245012300169300001800292500001900310500001100329520084600340592002801186650001401214650000901228650001501237650001801252650001401270650001301284650001101297650001401308650001201322700001901334700002601353700002701379773016601406856008201572852000901654655001201663IND60722603420221117062809.0210106e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072260342DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-020-11171-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarijan, Shazani10aMicroplastics in freshwater ecosystems: a recent review of occurrence, analysis, potential impacts, and research needs  ap. 1341-1356.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aReview  aThe utilization of plastics has now become a threat to the environment as it generates microplastic particles (<5 mm in size). The increasing studies on the occurrence of microplastics in different environmental compartments have raised concern about the potential effects on ecosystems and living organisms. Of these, numerous studies are focused on marine environments. The occurrence of microplastics is recently extended to the freshwater environments, including river systems, streams, lakes, pond, creek, and estuarine rivers. This paper overviews the current knowledge and research findings on the occurrence of microplastics in water, sediment, and fish in freshwater environments. The review also covers the adopted methodology and impacts of microplastics to the ecosystem. Future perspectives are discussed as well in this review.  aPublisher supplied data 3aestuaries 3afish 3afreshwater 3amicroplastics 3apollution 3aresearch 3arivers 3asediments 3astreams1 aAzman, Shamila1 aSaid, Mohd Ismid Mohd1 aMohamad Hidayat Jamal,0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2021 Jan., v. 28, no. 2 p.1341-1356dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-11171-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03111naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100003000186245012500216300001800341506007600359520150300435592002801938506003701966650003302003650001202036650002102048650002202069650001202091650001402103650001402117650002802131650002202159650001402181653002102195653002002216653002302236653001802259653003002277700002002307700002202327700001902349773017302368856007902541852000902620655001202629IND60173588920221207112738.0150603e20130305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017358892DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12199221102doi7 aPMC35938362pmcid7 a234266242pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoua, Faisal Hammad Mekky10aStructure of Sr-substituted photosystem II at 2.1 Å resolution and its implications in the mechanism of water oxidation  ap. 3889-3894.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II (PSII) is a tetra-manganese calcium penta-oxygenic cluster (Mn ₄CaO ₅) catalyzing light-induced water oxidation through several intermediate states (S-states) by a mechanism that is not fully understood. To elucidate the roles of Ca ²⁺ in this cluster and the possible location of water substrates in this process, we crystallized Sr ²⁺-substituted PSII from Thermosynechococcus vulcanus , analyzed its crystal structure at a resolution of 2.1 Å, and compared it with the 1.9 Å structure of native PSII. Our analysis showed that the position of Sr was moved toward the outside of the cubane structure of the Mn ₄CaO ₅-cluster relative to that of Ca ²⁺, resulting in a general elongation of the bond distances between Sr and its surrounding atoms compared with the corresponding distances in the Ca-containing cluster. In particular, we identified an apparent elongation in the bond distance between Sr and one of the two terminal water ligands of Ca ²⁺, W3, whereas that of the Sr-W4 distance was not much changed. This result may contribute to the decrease of oxygen evolution upon Sr ²⁺-substitution, and suggests a weak binding and rather mobile nature of this particular water molecule (W3), which in turn implies the possible involvement of this water molecule as a substrate in the O-O bond formation. In addition, the PsbY subunit, which was absent in the 1.9 Å structure of native PSII, was found in the Sr-PSII structure.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aThermosynechococcus vulcanus 3acalcium 3achemical bonding 3acrystal structure 3aligands 3amanganese 3aoxidation 3aoxygen evolving complex 3aoxygen production 3astrontium 0amembrane protein 0awater-splitting 0astructural changes 0acyanobacteria 0aartificial photosynthesis1 aUmena, Yasufumi1 aKawakami, Keisuke1 aShen, Jian-Ren0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 Mar. 5, v. 110, no. 10 p.3889-3894dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12199221103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02238naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245011500167300001600282520108200298592002801380650001101408650001501419650003101434650001201465650001401477650001601491650002101507653002801528700005401556700001601610700001401626700001401640700001701654773009901671856008501770852000901855655001201864IND60746079320221118145445.0210820e20210801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074607932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2021.07.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoutaieb, M.10aTowards a more efficient Hydrothermal Carbonization: Processing water recirculation under different conditions  ap. 115-123.  aThe use of Processing Water (PW) on the Hydrothermal Carbonization (HTC) of tunisian pine cones was investigated under different temperature (200 and 240 °C) and residence time conditions (3 and 20 h). Recirculating PW improved the HC (hydrochar) solid yield, without being detrimental to the carbon content of the HC. The heating value of the HCs, that with a single reaction already involved a rise of this parameter in the range 22.1–55.8% as compared to the raw material, was further increased up to 24.9–58.6% for cyclic runs. This was attributed to enhanced secondary char formation by reusing liquid, although this effect depended on the severity of previous HTC and was affected by both temperature and time.The HCs showed an increment on C and especially on N for cyclic runs. Also, thermal degradation peaks during HC TGA/DTA analyses showed a broader temperature range decomposition upon pyrolysis when PW was recirculated. The modifications of HC surface morphologies and functional groups was also investigated and associated to related reaction mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3ahydrochars 3ahydrothermal carbonization 3aliquids 3apyrolysis 3atemperature 3awaste management 0aRecycling process water1 aRomán, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8851-27101 aLedesma, B.1 aSabio, E.1 aGuiza, M.1 aOuederni, A.0 tWaste management.g2021 Aug. 01, v. 132 p.115-123dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2021.07.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02309naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245011600165300001600281520129700297592002801594650002301622650002301645650000901668650001401677650001101691650001101702651002101713700003201734773014101766856007901907852000901986655001201995IND60690150520221119103345.0200426s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069015052DNAL7 a10.1139/cjfas-2019-01042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolt, Carrie A.10aImpact of time-varying productivity on estimated stock–recruitment parameters and biological reference points  ap. 836-847.  aModels with time-varying parameters are increasingly being considered in the assessment of fish stocks, but their reliability when used to derive biological reference points or benchmarks has not been thoroughly evaluated. Here, we evaluated stock–recruitment models with and without time-varying productivity in a simulation framework for sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) under different scenarios of productivity and exploitation. Ignoring trends in productivity led to overestimates of productivity and underestimates of capacity when both exploitation rates and productivity declined over time, resulting in an underestimation on average of benchmarks of biological status. Despite being less biased, time-varying models had relatively poor fit based on AICc and BIC model selection criteria. Our simulation results were compared with empirical analyses of 12 Fraser River sockeye salmon stocks in British Columbia, Canada. Although benchmarks were less biased when based on time-varying models, underlying true benchmarks based on spawner abundances at maximum sustainable yield, SMSY, trend downwards when productivity declines, which may not be aligned with conservation objectives. We conclude with best practices when adapting biological benchmarks to time-varying productivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus nerka 3aempirical research 3afish 3afisheries 3amodels 3arivers 3aBritish Columbia1 aMichielsens, Catherine G.J.0 tCanadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences.g2020, v. 77, no. 5 p.836-847dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl32083x1205-75337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2019-01043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02405naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245009600170300001600266520126400282592002801546650002101574650002401595650001901619650001001638650002001648650001001668650001201678650002201690650001401712650000701726700002101733700003301754700003101787773012201818856008201940852000902022655001202031IND60633746520221121145815.0211002e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063374652DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-018-4555-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohtashami, Mahnaz10aMolecular cloning, expression and characterization of poxa1b gene from Pleurotus ostreatus  ap. 981-990.  aIn recent decades, fungus laccases (p-diphenol-dioxygen oxidoreductases; EC 1.10.3.2) have attracted the attention of researches due to their wide range of biotechnological and industrial applications. In the present study, we have cloned a gene encoding laccase (poxa1b) from Pleurotus ostreatus and then heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli BL21. The biochemical properties of POXA1b were characterized using ABTS as a typical substrate of laccases. Moreover, the in vitro oxidation of the benzo[a]pyrene was investigated in the presence or absence of ABTS. The codon-optimized poxa1b showed higher expression yields and efficiency in comparison with the wild-type (p < 0.01). The maximum activity of POXA1b (2075 UL-1) was observed after incubation at 50 °C for 0.5 h and the enzyme retained more than 85% of its initial activity after 2 h incubation at 25–45 °C. The optimum pH of the enzyme was pH4 and the enzyme was stable when being incubated at pH range from 2.5 to 4.5 for 2 h in the absence of ABTS, the enzyme oxidized a little amount of benzo[a]pyrene, whereas its oxidation enhanced following the ABTS addition. These findings indicate POXA1b of P. ostreatus as a promising candidate for further biotechnological approaches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aPleurotus ostreatus 3abenzo(a)pyrene 3afungi 3agene expression 3agenes 3alaccase 3amolecular cloning 3aoxidation 3apH1 aFooladi, Jamshid1 aHaddad-Mashadrizeh, Aliakbar1 aHousaindokht, Mohammadreza0 tMolecular biology reports.g2019 Feb., v. 46, no. 1 p.981-990dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-018-4555-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02662naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245014100152300001600293520144700309592002801756650002601784650002901810650001101839650001201850650001601862650001901878650001601897650001601913650001401929650002101943700001501964700001801979700001501997700001902012773016302031856007302194852000902267655001202276IND60135890020221121010523.0150522e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013589002DNAL7 a10.1111/jam.126732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDogi, C.10aComparison of toxicogenic and immunosuppressive capacity of Aspergillus fumigatus strains isolated from clinical and corn silage samples  ap. 175-181.  aAIMS: To compare clinical and environmental Aspergillus fumigatus strains on their toxicogenic and immunosuppressive capacity. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 51 strains of A. fumigatus isolated from clinical and corn silage samples were assayed. All A. fumigatus strains were assayed for gliotoxin production, therefore strains with different gliotoxin capacities and isolated from different sources were selected and assayed for their effects on bovine macrophages and lymphocytes. Spore diffusates (SDs) obtained from all A. fumigatus strains were able to inhibit macrophage phagocytosys, regardless of their gliotoxin production capacity. However, most but not all strains were able to inhibit bactericidal activity. SDs from all A. fumigatus strains reduced lymphocytes viability. The heat treatment was not always able to inhibit the negative effect on immune cells. CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference between clinical and environmental isolates in their toxicogenic and immunosuppressive capacity. Gliotoxin would not be responsible for the immunosuppressive activity observed by the assayed A. fumigatus strains. However, gliotoxin could be present in the SD, together with some other substances. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results obtained suggest that any environmental strain of A. fumigatus is a putative infectious strain. Prevention measures should be applied to control environmental Aspergillus conidia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus fumigatus 3aantibacterial properties 3acattle 3aconidia 3acorn silage 3aheat treatment 3alymphocytes 3amacrophages 3aviability 3avirulent strains1 aAlonso, V.1 aFochesato, A.1 aPoloni, V.1 aCavaglieri, L.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2015 Jan., v. 118, no. 1 p.175-181dPublished for the Society for Applied Bacteriology by Blackwell Sciencex1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.126733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03491naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006400147245012700211300001600338520158300354592002801937596008801965596009802053596008102151650001702232650001902249650001702268650002002285650003102305650001702336650001302353650001202366650004302378650001402421650002102435650001202456650004002468650002402508650001002532700002102542700002402563700002002587700002002607700001902627700001802646700002302664700002502687700002402712773012202736856008202858852000902940655001202949IND60633746620221121184941.0211002e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063374662DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-018-4553-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGasparotto, Aline S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6305-119310aDifferential expression of miRNAs related to angiogenesis and adipogenesis in subcutaneous fat of obese and nonobese women  ap. 965-973.  aTo disclose the mechanisms surrounding obesity, we selected microRNAs (miRNAs) that target genes involved in adipogenesis, angiogenesis, and inflammation and compared their expression levels in the subcutaneous adipose tissue of 40 obese and nonobese women. Mature miRNAs were extracted from subcutaneous adipose tissue samples that were collected during surgery and quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. miR-16 was overexpressed in the nonobese group (n-expression ratio = − 151.1; P < 0.001). Furthermore, the expression levels of two other miRNAs were significantly correlated with waist circumference in nonobese women (miR-27b, r = 0.453; P = 0.027 and miR-424-5p, r = 0.502, P = 0.014). Central and total subcutaneous adipose tissue thicknesses were correlated with miR-424-5p levels (r = 0.506, P = 0.034 and r = 0.475, P = 0.046, respectively) in the nonobese group. In the obese group, miR-424-5p expression was correlated with body mass index (r = 0.582, P = 0.018). miR-16 and miR-424 have shown correlations with body-fat-mass-related parameters. Because these miRNAs have vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors as target genes, they may be involved in the alterations of angiogenesis observed in obesity. In addition, higher levels of miR-27 and miR-424 were correlated with higher fat depot measurements in nonobese women. These results highlight the importance of miRNA expression in subcutaneous adipose tissue and encourage further investigation of miRNAs as prognostic markers.  aPublisher supplied data  a471437/2012-3cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (BR)  a12/2226-9 and 1153-2551/13-9cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul  aScholarshipcCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior 3aadipogenesis 3aadipose tissue 3aangiogenesis 3abody mass index 3agene expression regulation 3ainflammation 3amicroRNA 3aobesity 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areceptors 3asubcutaneous fat 3asurgery 3avascular endothelial growth factors 3awaist circumference 3awomen1 aBorges, Diego O.1 aSassi, Marina G.

METHODS AND RESULTS: The 6‐O‐sulfotransferase isoform‐3 (6‐OST‐3) can be conveniently prepared at mg/L levels in the laboratory by culturing E. coli on Luria–Bertani medium in shake flasks and inducing with isopropyl β‐D‐1‐thiogalactopyranoside at an optical density of 0·6–0·8. The production of larger amounts of 6‐OST‐3 required fed‐batch cultivation of E. coli in a stirred tank fermenter on medium containing an inexpensive carbon source, such as glucose or glycerol. The cultivation of E. coli on various carbon sources under different feeding schedules and induction strategies was examined. Conditions were established giving yields (5–20 mg g‐cell‐dry weight⁻¹) of active 6‐OST‐3 with excellent productivity (2–5 mg l⁻¹ h⁻¹). CONCLUSIONS: The production of 6‐OST‐3 in a fed‐batch fermentation on an inexpensive carbon source has been demonstrated. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The ability to scale‐up the production of heparin biosynthetic enzymes, such as 6‐OST‐3, is critical for scaling‐up the chemoenzymatic synthesis of heparin. The success of this project may someday lead to a commercially viable bioengineered heparin to replace the animal‐sourced anticoagulant product currently on the market.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aabsorbance 3aanticoagulants 3abatch fermentation 3acarbon 3acontainers 3aenzymes 3afermenters 3aglucose 3aglycerol 3aheparin 3amarkets1 aSuflita, M.1 aFiaschetti, C.M.1 aLi, G.1 aLi, L.1 aZhang, F.1 aDordick, J.S.1 aLinhardt, R.J.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2015 Jan., v. 118, no. 1 p.92-98dPublished for the Society for Applied Bacteriology by Blackwell Sciencex1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.126843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02808naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245015600166520097100322592002801293650001301321650001801334650001501352650001501367650001601382650001801398650001101416650002401427650001001451650002601461650006201487650001101549653001301560653001001573653001001583653001601593653001701609653002201626653001701648700002401665700002101689700001501710700001601725700005901741700001901800700001701819700002001836700001901856700001601875700005701891700006301948773012702011856008302138852000902221655001202230IND60746079720221118144753.0211009e20211201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074607972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2021.1135232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnand, Anjali10aComplex target SELEX-based identification of DNA aptamers against Bungarus caeruleus venom for the detection of envenomation using a paper-based device  aComplex target SELEX always have been an intriguing approach to the scientific community, as it offers the potential discovery of novel biomarkers. We herein successfully performed SELEX on Bungarus caeruleus venom to develop a panel of highly affine aptamers that specifically recognizes the B. caeruleus (common krait) venom and was able to discriminate the B. caeruleus venom from Cobra, Russell's, and Saw-scaled viper's venom. The aptamers generated against the crude venom also lead to the identification of the specific component of the venom, which is β-Bungarotoxin, a toxin uniquely present in the B. caeruleus venom. The best performing aptamer candidates were used as a molecular recognition element in a paper-based device and were able to detect as low as 2 ng krait venom in human serum background. The developed aptamer-based paper device can be used for potential point-of-care venom detection applications due to its simplicity and affordability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBungarus 3aaffordability 3abiomarkers 3abiosensors 3ablood serum 3abungarotoxins 3ahumans 3anucleotide aptamers 3apaper 3apoint-of-care systems 3asystematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment 3atoxins 0aAptamers 0aSELEX 0aKrait 0aSnake venom 0aBungarotoxin 0aMass-spectrometry 0aPaper device1 aChatterjee, Bandhan1 aDhiman, Abhijeet1 aGoel, Renu1 aKhan, Eshan1 aMalhotra, Anita1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1738-90461 aSantra, Vishal1 aSalvi, Nitin1 aKhadilkar, M.V.1 aBhatnagar, Ira1 aKumar, Amit1 aAsthana, Amit1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3419-884X1 aSharma, Tarun Kumar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0065-60990 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2021 Dec. 01, v. 193 p.113523-dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2021.1135233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02715naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245016100159300001800320500002000338520135500358592002801713650001501741650001601756650001801772650002401790650001801814650001601832650001501848650001501863650002601878650001701904700006201921700002001983700002402003700005502027773015102082856007502233852000902308655001202317IND60755431120221120064749.0211102e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075543112DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.113172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChou, Yu‐Jou10aProducing high quality mung bean sprout using atmospheric cold plasma treatment: better physical appearance and higher γ‐aminobutyric acid (GABA) content  ap. 6463-6471.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Germination of mung beans increases the content of dietary fiber, vitamin C, antioxidants, and γ‐aminobutyric acid (GABA). Atmospheric cold plasma is a recently developed technology that can rapidly modify the surface properties of an object. In this work, atmospheric cold plasma was utilized to promote higher moisture absorption of mung bean seeds and, thus, enhance the germination ratio and GABA level. The selected healthy seeds that were exposed to plasma generated at different ionizing powers. RESULT: According to the experimental results, atmospheric cold plasma treatments on mung bean seeds could induce significantly more water absorption and lead to a higher rate of germination. The physical appearance of the sprout developed after plasma treatment was noticeably modified to a more desirable form, which has a short radicle and longer hypocotyls with a larger diameter. The content of the bioactive component GABA in plasma‐treated beans was approximately three times higher than the untreated group due to the response of seed to the environmental stress created by the plasma treatment. CONCLUSION: The result from this work will serve as a good reference for future investigation that is searching for a solution to enhance bioactive compound production in natural products. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aagriculture 3aascorbic acid 3abioactive compounds 3adietary fiber 3agermination 3ahypocotyls 3amung beans 3anonthermal processing 3awater uptake1 aCheng, Kuan‐Chen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0387-78041 aHsu, Fu‐Chiun1 aWu, James Swi‐Bea1 aTing, Yuwen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9100-11610 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2021 Dec., v. 101, no. 15 p.6463-6471dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl48536x0022-51427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.113173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02146naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001900148245006800167300001600235520091800251592002801169650001801197650001801215650002901233650001301262650001001275650001401285650001201299650001001311650001001321650002301331650001601354650001001370650001101380653002901391653001301420653001301433653001301446653001101459653000901470700002201479773012701501856005101628852000901679655001201688IND4462147520221120155350.0140414e20110414xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446214752DNAL7 a10.1080/19315260.2010.5313762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKempraj, Vivek10aComparison of Wines From Grape and a Mix of Beetroot and Carrot  ap. 171-176.  aWine is one of the oldest forms of alcoholic beverages and can impart benefits to human beings. Beetroot (Beta vulgaris L) and carrot (Daucus carota L) are rich in betalain and carotene. These vegetables have medicinal and nutritive properties. Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae INVSc1) was used to prepare wine from beetroot and carrot and its quality was compared to grape wine. The vegetable wine was reddish-brown in color, slightly acidic (titratable acidity = 1.0 ± 0.02 g tartaric acid/100 mL), sweet (3.1 ± 0.07 g of reducing sugar/100 mL), and with an alcohol content of 10.6 ± 0.8%. No major differences in biochemical aspects of the wine were found. Organoleptic analysis indicated that the vegetable wine was preferred over the grape wine for taste and color/appearance. The taste was a significant criteria (χ² = 36.46; P < 0.01) in selection of the vegetable wine as the superior product.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeta vulgaris 3aDaucus carota 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aalcohols 3abeets 3acarotenes 3acarrots 3acolor 3ataste 3atitratable acidity 3awine grapes 3awines 3ayeasts 0aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 0aBeetroot 0aBetalain 0aBeverage 0aCarrot 0aWine1 aDasgupta, Debjani0 tInternational journal of vegetable science.g2011 Apr. 14, v. 17, no. 2 p.171-176dTaylor & Francis Groupx1931-52797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19315260.2010.531376  aDNAL 7aarticle02745naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245014600153300001800299520144300317592002801760650001501788650001501803650003501818650001601853650001401869650000901883650001801892650001101910650001201921650001501933650002101948650002601969650001801995650002202013700001302035700001602048700001702064700002002081773012702101856007402228852000902302655001202311IND60617321520221117173423.0181025e20180301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061732152DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ay02748f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Yu10aQuantitative analysis of sinters using laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) coupled with kernel-based extreme learning machine (K-ELM)  ap. 1074-1079.  aThis work explores the combination of LIBS technology and K-ELM algorithm for the quantitative analysis of total iron (TFe) content and alkalinity of sinter. The main components of sinter ore samples were qualitatively identified from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) database. 30 sinter ore samples were compressed into pellets and prepared for LIBS measurements. 20 sintered samples were used as calibration samples, and their LIBS spectral data were used as input variables to construct the calibration model, and the other 10 sinter samples were used as test set samples. In order to verify the prediction ability of the sintered sample calibration model, the performance of a kernel-based extreme learning machine (K-ELM) and partial least square (PLS) models were compared by means of root mean square error (RMSE). The experimental results showed that the K-ELM model is superior to the partial least square regression (PLSR) model in quantitative analysis of TFe and alkalinity, both for the calibration set and the test set. Correlation coefficients obtained by the K-ELM model are above 0.9, and the RMSEs are relatively lower. The method proposed in this paper can quickly and effectively realize quantitative analysis of total iron content and alkalinity in a sinter, and can be used for the analysis and control of metallurgical raw materials, thus reducing analysis time and saving production costs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aalkalinity 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acalibration 3adatabases 3airon 3aleast squares 3amodels 3apellets 3aprediction 3aproduction costs 3aquantitative analysis 3araw materials 3aspectral analysis1 aYan, Fei1 aYang, Guang1 aChen, Haixiu1 aSong, Zhensheng0 tAnalytical methods.g2018 Mar. 1, v. 10, no. 9 p.1074-1079dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ay02748f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02822naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245013200163300001400295520168500309592002801994596010702022596006302129650001202192650001302204650001302217650001302230650001402243650001602257700001902273773011202292856008302404852000902487655001202496IND60761937620221118180229.0220105e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076193762DNAL7 a10.1007/s13258-021-01156-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Jing10aPhysiological characteristics and miRNA sequencing of two root zones with contrasting ammonium assimilation patterns in Populus  ap. 39-51.  aBACKGROUND: The net ammonium fluxes differ among the different root zones of Populus, but the physiological and microRNA regulatory mechanisms are unclear. OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the physiological and miRNA regulatory mechanisms, we investigated the two root zones displaying significant differences in net NH₄⁺ effluxes of P. × canescens. METHODS: Populus plantlets were cultivated with 500 μM NH₄Cl for 10 days. Six plants were randomly selected to determine the net NH₄⁺ fluxes using a noninvasive microtest technique. High-throughput sequencing were used to determine the dynamic expression profile of miRNA among the different root zones of Populus. RESULTS: Net NH₄⁺ efflux in zone I (from 0 to 40 mm from the root apex) was − 19.64 pmol cm⁻² s⁻¹ and in zone II (from 40 to 80 mm) it was − 43.96 pmol cm⁻² s⁻¹. The expression of eleven miRNAs was significantly upregulated, whereas fifteen miRNAs were downregulated. Moreover, eighty-eight target genes of the significantly differentially expressed miRNAs were identified in root zone II compared with zone I. Particularly, ptc-miR171a/b/e and their target, SCL6, were found to be important for the difference in net NH₄⁺ effluxes in the two root zones. Moreover, the expression of the target of ptc-miR169d, NFYA3 was upregulated in root zone II compared with root zone I, contributing to increased NH₄⁺ efflux and decreased NH₄⁺ assimilation in root zone II. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that miRNAs regulate the expression levels of their target genes and thus play key roles in net NH₄⁺ fluxes and NH₄⁺ assimilation in different poplar root zones.  aPublisher supplied data  aCAFYBB2016QB005cthe Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Non-profit Research Institution of CAF  a31500507cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China 3aPopulus 3aammonium 3agenomics 3amicroRNA 3aplantlets 3arhizosphere1 aWu, Jiang ting0 tGenes & genomics.g2022 Jan., v. 44, no. 1 p.39-51dSpringer SingaporewJournal:J000001676x1976-95717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13258-021-01156-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02665naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245013000165300001600295520126500311592002801576650001801604650002001622650002101642650002401663650001401687650001001701650001501711650001201726650002801738650001001766650002201776650001601798650001301814650001201827650001501839650001601854651001201870700002001882700001801902700002001920700002601940773014101966856007902107852000902186655001202195IND60690150920221119103203.0200426s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069015092DNAL7 a10.1139/cjfas-2019-01962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAždajić, Mija10aEffects of a decade of selenium emission reductions on mercury accumulation in aquatic biota in the Sudbury region of Ontario  ap. 848-856.  aControl of smelting emissions in the Sudbury (Ontario, Canada) area has dramatically decreased the amount of selenium (Se) deposited onto the surrounding landscape. Historically, Se emissions in Sudbury correlated with lower total mercury (Hg) and methylmercury levels (MeHg) in tissues of zooplankton, amphipods (Hyalella azteca), mayflies (Stenonema femoratum), and young-of-the-year perch (Perca flavescens). In 2017, ten years following emission reductions, we evaluated whether changes in Se deposition affected total Hg and MeHg burden in lake biota. We show that total Se concentrations in the water of the majority of lakes have increased despite decreases in Se depositions, most likely due to the long residence time of Se in the watershed and the water column. As a result, Se in water continues to correlate with lower total Hg and MeHg accumulation in tissues of zooplankton, amphipods, mayflies, and perch. These results suggest that Se continues to exhibit a protective effect on Hg accumulation in biota, even years after emissions have greatly decreased. We expect this work to inform efforts aiming at long-term recovery of aquatic environments affected by smelter emissions and aid in designing remediation strategies involving Se additions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEphemeroptera 3aHyalella azteca 3aPerca flavescens 3aaquatic environment 3aemissions 3alakes 3alandscapes 3amercury 3amethylmercury compounds 3aperch 3aprotective effect 3aremediation 3aselenium 3atissues 3awatersheds 3azooplankton 3aOntario1 aBelzile, Nelson1 aGunn, John M.1 aBlais, Jules M.1 aPoulain, Alexandre J.0 tCanadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences.g2020, v. 77, no. 5 p.848-856dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl32083x1205-75337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2019-01963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03178naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245014700168520161400315592002801929650000801957650003001965650001501995650002102010650001802031650002002049650002602069650001902095650001502114650001002129650002602139650001002165650001202175650001902187650001202206650002102218650001302239650001102252650002902263650002002292653002302312653001602335653002002351653001602371700001702387700005202404773011202456856008302568852000902651655001202660IND60746079820221118144720.0210918e20211115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074607982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2021.1135292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Myeongsoon10aSelective and easy detection of microcystin-LR in freshwater using a bioactivated sensor based on multiwalled carbon nanotubes on filter paper  aMicrocystin-LR (MC-LR) is a cyanobacterial toxin produced as a result of eutrophication in polluted water in warm weather conditions. The MC-LR could cause health problems in mammal organs such as the liver, heart, and muscle. Therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) has stipulated a limit of <1.0 ng/mL in drinking water. Thus, detection and quantification are vital, but current techniques require complex and expensive offsite analysis. We have developed an inexpensive, sensitive, and field-deployable sensor based on bioactivated multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs, diameter 20 nm) and micropore filter paper (0.45-μm pore size) for the detection of MC-LR. A specially designed DNA oligonucleotide (5-NH₂-C₆-AN₆) was used as the MC-LR targeting aptamer (MCTA). For bioactivation, MCTA was immobilized on the carboxylated MWCNTs via the formation of amide bonds. The bioactivated MWCNTs were deposited on the micropore filter paper by suction filtering. The detection of MC-LR in freshwater was possible within 1.5 h, achieved by measuring the changes in electrical resistance caused by the selective MC-LR and MCTA interactions. Despite suffering from some matrix effects, the detection limit of the sensor was 0.19 ng/mL for low-concentration MC-LR (≤0.5 ng/mL). This method is much cheaper (biosensor price: < $2.5) than liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectroscopy analysis (ca. $50/sample) which is a standard method for MC-LR detection in a modern laboratory. Thus, this cheap and straightforward MC-LR sensor has applications for detection in remote locations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aWorld Health Organization 3abiosensors 3acarbon nanotubes 3acarboxylation 3adetection limit 3aelectrical resistance 3aeutrophication 3afreshwater 3aheart 3aliquid chromatography 3aliver 3amammals 3amicrocystin-LR 3amuscles 3aoligonucleotides 3aporosity 3aprices 3atandem mass spectrometry 3awater pollution 0aPaper-based sensor 0aCyanotoxins 0aCarbon nanotube 0aDNA aptamer1 aKim, Hak Jun1 aKim, Don1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5465-44190 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2021 Nov. 15, v. 192 p.113529-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2021.1135293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02279naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245018200166500001900348520092800367592002801295650001001323650002301333650001601356650001801372650002301390650001201413650001501425650001701440650001101457650001601468650001101484650001501495653001601510653003301526653001501559653002101574700002301595700001801618773011801636856008201754852000901836655001201845IND60716156020221121072744.0201124e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071615602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bse.2020.1041812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaoka, Takashi10aCarotenoids of land-locked and sea-run types of masu salmon Oncorhynchus masou ishikawae inhabiting in the Nagara River, Japan, from the perspective of chemical ecological study  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCarotenoids of the land-locked type (Amago) and sea-run type (Satsukimasu) of masu salmon Oncorhynchus masou ishikawae inhabiting the Nagara River, Gifu Prefecture, Japan were investigated from the perspective of the chemical ecological point of view.

However, some newly developed dyes with chromophores or main acceptors isolated from anchoring groups also exhibit comparable or even higher performances. To investigate the relatively untouched electronic coupling effect in dye-sensitized solar cells, a relatively precise method is proposed in which the strength is adjusted gradually by changing isolation spacers between main acceptors and anchoring groups to partially control the electronic interaction. After an analysis of 3 different groups of 11 sensitizers, it is inferred that the electronic coupling should be kept at a suitable level to balance the electron injection and recombination. Based on a reference dye LI-81 possessing a cyanoacrylic acid as acceptor and anchoring group, both photocurrent and photovoltage are synergistically improved after the properties of isolation spacers were changed through the adjustment of the length, steric hindrance, and push–pull electronic characteristic. Accordingly, the rationally designed dye LI-87 with an isolation spacer of thiophene ethylene gives an efficiency of 8.54% and further improved to 9.07% in the presence of CDCA, showing a new way to develop efficient sensitizers.  aPublisher supplied data 3adyes 3aphotovoltaic cells 3atitanium dioxide 0adye-sensitized solar cells 0aisolation spacers 0aelectronic coupling 0aelectron injection and recombination 0athe structure−property relationship1 aWan, Sushu1 aZhong, Cheng1 aXu, Ting1 aFang, Manman1 aWang, Jinfeng1 aXie, Yujun1 aZhang, Yu1 aMei, Anyi1 aHan, Hongwei1 aPeng, Qian1 aLi, Qianqian1 aLi, Zhen0 tACS applied materials .g2016 Oct. 26, v. 8, no. 42 p.28652-28662dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.6b100303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01759naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245008200164300001500246520091000261592002801171653002401199653001701223653002001240653001601260653001401276700001601290773007201306856008201378852000901460655001201469IND60547634220221118222613.0161027s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054763422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ieri.2014.08.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Weiwei10aResearch on the Knowledge Acquirement of Rapid Design for Mechanical Products  ap. 96-101.  aDuring the process of mechanical products rapid design, the key issues trouble the designers are obtaining the design knowledge and extracting the design rules.

Through the unstructured data study of mechanical products, the domain ontology model based on the whole life cycle information is set up. The domain ontology model enables the designers to share design knowledge and experience in different departments. Since the design rules are difficult to extract during the design process, the reduction algorithm based on rough set theory is applied to data mining. The method completes the product data reduction and improves the effectiveness and accuracy of the design rules extraction.

An effective Bt maize pest resistance monitoring programme relies on well-established baseline susceptibility data. The target pest of Bt maize in South Africa, Busseola fusca (Fuller) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), has evolved resistance to Bt maize expressing Cry1Ab proteins, with numerous reports of resistance from the highveld region of the country. Although Bt maize has been cultivated in the Eastern Cape province since 2001, no data exist on the resistance status of field populations of B. fusca to Bt maize in this region. In view of this, B. fusca larvae were collected from fields in two Bt maize cultivating areas and a non-Bt maize cultivating area of the Eastern Cape for laboratory assays to determine the level of susceptibility of B. fusca to Bt maize. Rearing colonies of each population were established and neonate larvae from each population were used to infest non-Bt maize plants, and Bt maize of events MON810 and MON89034. All larvae maintained on MON89034 died within seven days of infestation. Survival of all B. fusca populations maintained on MON810 declined rapidly during the first seven days and was significantly (P<0.001) lower than larval survival on non-Bt maize. Similarly, mass of surviving larvae of all populations on MON810 from the first two weeks to the 21st day was significantly (P < 0.001) lower than the mass of larvae on non-Bt maize. These results indicate that fieldcollected populations screened in this study are still susceptible to Bt maize.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aBusseola fusca 3acorn 3aevolution 3alarvae 3amonitoring 3aneonates 3apest resistance 3apests 3aproteins 3arearing 3asmall farms 3atransgenic plants 3aSouth Africa 0aBusseola fusca 0ainsect resistance management 0arefuge planting 0aresistance evolution 0asurvival1 aObi, A.1 aAssefa, Y.1 aErasmus, A.1 aBerg, J. van den,0 tAfrican entomology.g2017 Mar., v. 25, no. 1 p.200-209dEntomological Society of Southern AfricawJournal:jnl50015x1021-35897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4001/003.025.02003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03106naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100001800161245008300179300001600262500000900278520183800287592002802125650001102153650002602164650001202190650001602202650001702218650001902235650001202254650001002266650002002276650001402296650001502310650001702325650002702342650003602369651001002405651001402415700001502429773012102444852000902565856009802574655001202672IND2056296520221122061204.0191122e199503  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205629652DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1995.0011183X003500020024x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMansur, L.

Our objective was to determine the relationship in performance between soybeans grown in northern USA and those in central Chile for days to maturity (RS), plant height, lodging, seed protein and oil concentration, and seed weight and yield. For this purpose, 284 recombinant inbred lines of soybean (RIL) ranging from Maturity Group 00 to I, their parents, ‘Minsoy’ and ‘Noir 1’, and 10 check cultivars were evaluated in Minnesota, USA, and central Chile during 2 yr using a randomized complete-block design with three replications. There were highly significant differences among RILs for all traits. Estimates of heritability (h²) on an entry mean in the USA ranged from 0.65 for protein concentration to 0.89 for R8 and plant height, whereas in Chile they ranged from 0.74 for oil concentration to 0.93 for plant height. Across countries, h² ranged from 0.69 for oil concentration to 0.93 for plant height. Moreover, the phenotypic (and rank) correlations for performance between central Chile and northern USA were high, positive, and highly significant (P < 0.01): 0.89 (0.90), 0.89 (0.90), 0.79 (0.85), 0.68 (0.62), 0.67 (0.62), 0.78 (0.80), (0.70) for R8, plant height, lodging, seed protein and oil concentration, and seed weight and yield, respectively. The same correlations for the 10 check cultivars confirmed these results. We concluded that selection for these traits in off-season winter nurseries in central Chile should also be effective in identifying genotypes that perform similarly in the northern USA.

Biodiversitas 22: 2032-2044. Biodiversity plays a crucial role in sustainable agriculture. Permaculture is a design philosophy that values this role as it consciously integrates diverse components into the farm landscape. The purpose of the study was to characterize the general structure of permaculture landscapes in the Philippines and identify the landscape components that comprise its farming systems. The research was conducted in 12 permaculture farms in 11 provinces in the Philippines in 2018. Aerial photography and farm inventory were employed for data collection. A crop diversity survey was conducted using a modified belt transect method with alternating 20 m2 plots within a 1 ha sampling area. Full enumeration of plant species in each plot was performed to determine species richness and samples were manually counted to compute for the Shannon-Wiener Diversity Index. Results of the study showed that permaculture landscapes were organized into six spatial zones: ‘house,’ ‘garden,’ ‘grazing,’ ‘cash crops,’ ‘food forest,’ and 'wilderness.' It was identified that each zone contained components belonging to six categories: abiotic, biotic, man-made structural, technological, socio-economic, and cultural. 'Biotic' results showed that all sites recorded high species richness (>20-65) with the highest found in Glinoga Organic Farm with 65. Aloha House in Palawan had the highest diversity with a score of 0.311. An analysis of the ratio of plant species per plant category showed that the vegetable/cereal crops dominated the landscape in 50% of sites. While 20% were characterized by tree/fruit-bearing crops. Perennial species were the most abundant in all sites with 75-95% of the total plant species. In conclusion, permaculture provided a design framework for restructuring our agricultural landscapes into diverse and productive ecosystems for human settlement and food production.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPhilippines 3aaerial photography 3adata collection 3afarm inventories 3afarms 3afood production 3aforests 3ahuman settlements 3alandscapes 3apermaculture 3aphilosophy 3asocioeconomics 3aspecies richness 3asurveys 3asustainable agriculture 3avegetables 3awilderness 0aagroecology 0aagroecosystems 0abiodiversity 0adiversified farming systems 0aecological network 0alandscape ecology1 aInocencio, Buot.

Cuban honey bees have a European origin, being hybrids of Apis mellifera mellifera and A. m. ligustica. Although Varroa destructor and Nosema are widely distributed in the country, there is no information regarding Nosema species identity and the presence of honey bee viruses. In this study, we report for the first time the presence of Nosema ceranae, Acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV), Deformed wing virus (DWV) and Sacbrood bee virus (SBV) in Cuba. Their detection in different provinces and the simultaneous infection of colonies by several viruses indicate that they are widely spread in Cuba. On the other side, N. apis and Black queen cell virus (BQCV) were not detected.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcute bee paralysis virus 3aApis mellifera mellifera 3aBlack queen cell virus 3aNosema ceranae 3aRNA 3aVarroa destructor 3aapiculture 3abee viruses 3ahoney 3ahoney bees 3aresearch 3aviruses 3aCuba 0aApis mellifera 0aDeformed wing virus 0aSacbrood bee virus1 aGarcía, Carlos Ariel Yadró1 aInvernizzi, Ciro1 aBranchiccela, Belén1 aPiñeiro, Adolfo Mauricio Pérez1 aMorfi, Alejandro Pérez1 aZunino, Pablo1 aAntúnez, Karina0 tJournal of apicultural research.g2020 Aug. 7, v. 59, no. 4 p.468-471dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12840x2078-69137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00218839.2020.17494513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02606naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245009000156300001800246520150100264592002801765650001201793650001201805650001901817650002001836650001101856650001201867650001101879650001201890650001301902650001601915650001201931700001801943700002001961700001801981700002101999773010402020856007502124852000902199655001202208IND60534093520221116140411.0160802e20130718xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053409352DNAL7 a10.1021/ef400330j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaryazdi, F.10aDensity of Hydrocarbon Mixtures and Bitumen Diluted with Solvents and Dissolved Gases  ap. 3666-3678.  aDensity data are reported for the following mixtures at temperatures from 20 to 175 °C and pressures up to 40 MPa: ethane + n-decane, propane + n-decane, butane + n-decane, propane + toluene, and propane + cyclooctane, as well as bitumen diluted with ethane, propane, n-butane, n-pentane, n-heptane, and carbon dioxide. A straightforward excess volume based mixing rule is proposed to determine the density of liquid mixtures of hydrocarbons. Excess volumes are accounted for with a binary interaction parameter, and a correlation is proposed to estimate the interaction parameter when mixture data are unavailable. For dissolved gaseous solvents and liquid solvents near their critical point, the input to the mixing rule is their effective liquid density. Effective density correlations were developed for n-alkanes from methane to n-heptane and carbon dioxide. The method is only valid for mixtures in the liquid region with a reduced temperature below approximately 0.52 (or higher at higher pressure). The mixing rule with no excess volume predicted the density of over 60 binary mixtures of liquid hydrocarbons at 25 °C and hydrocarbon mixtures with dissolved gas components over a broad range of pressures and temperatures with an average deviation of less than 1% when the criterion for validity was met. The density of diluted bitumen mixtures was also predicted with the same accuracy. All of the data were fitted to within experimental error when using binary interaction parameters.  aPublisher supplied data 3abitumen 3abutanes 3acarbon dioxide 3adissolved gases 3aethane 3amethane 3amixing 3apropane 3asolvents 3atemperature 3atoluene1 aMotahhari, H.1 aSchoeggl, F.

People’s views towards Gunung Palung National Park, West Kalimantan, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 19: 1138-1146. It is a common belief that the management of national park prevents local communities from accessing the park and using the park resources. Illegal logging and other unwanted encroachments to the park become a big problem, as national park authority has a limited capacity to monitor the whole park. This research aimed to study how local communities viewed Gunung Palung National Park, which is located in Ketapang and Kayong Utara District, West Kalimantan Province, Indonesia. A total of 91 respondents from seven villages were interviewed. In general, about 70% of respondents viewed the importance of economic benefits, resulting from limited access to traditional gardens in the use zone of the park and the supply of clean water. Approximately 67% of these respondents viewed the protection of natural resources in the park was not important. This view was possibly due to their little knowledge of the park management and the use of zoning system in the park. It was reported that park officers have some activities, but the collaboration and relationship between park officers and local communities need more time to mature.

Analysis of nutlet morphological characteristics of some Iranian Ajuga L. taxa. Biodiversitas 20: 2833-2840. Ajuga is one of the problematic Lamiaceae genera, which naturally grows in different parts of Iran. There are many discussions about infrageneric and infraspecific classifications of the genus and several synonyms were definite for its taxa. In the current study, we evaluated nutlet morphological characteristics from six Iranian taxa of the genus using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Light microscopy (LM). In total, thirteen (four qualitative and nine quantitative) nutlet morphological variables were investigated, and the obtained data were analyzed using MVSP and SPSS software. Quantitative nutlet features varied among the studied taxa and ANOVA test revealed significant variations (P <0.01) for most of them. Moreover, PCA analysis showed some characteristics made more than 60% of variations. Some quantitative characteristics like nutlet and ventral sculpturing shapes were nearly stable among the taxa. But dorsal sculpturing shape and existence of exocarp cell indumentum highly varied among the taxa and could be used as distinguishing traits for identification of taxa. The studied taxa were divided into four groups in UPGMA dendrogram and also PCA and PCO plots of the nutlet features. CA. Joined plot revealed that each group had specific nutlet characteristic (s). Taxa arrangements were not similar to those have been definite for them in Flora Iranica and Flora of Iran. Furthermore, some infraspecific taxa must be redefinite. It is advised to use complementary molecular studies to better clearing species relationship, taxa position and rank in the genus.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAjuga 3acomputer software 3aexocarp 3aflora 3alight microscopy 3aIran 0aajuga 0amicromorphology 0anutlet 0ataxonomy1 aTABARIPOUR, RAHELEH1 aESKANDARI, MAJID0 tBiodiversitas.g2019 Sept., v. 20, no. 10dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.13057/biodiv/d2010083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03220naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245009000164300001800254520199800272592002802270650002202298650001102320650000902331650001702340650001502357650002102372650004402393650001602437650003702453700002402490700002802514700001802542700002402560700002502584700002502609773010402634856007502738852000902813655001202822IND60534092120221120031242.0160802e20130620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053409212DNAL7 a10.1021/ef400633d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHattingh, Burgert B.10aElucidation of the Structural and Molecular Properties of Typical South African Coals  ap. 3161-3172.  aAdvanced analytical techniques were performed on four South African coals, three noncoking and one coking, containing different maceral contributions (vitrinite contents ranging between 24 and 66 vol %, m.m.f.b.). Inertinite-rich (INY, UMZ) and vitrinite-rich (G#5 and TSH) coals were investigated to quantify differences and similarities in structural properties. Coals from the Witbank region (INY, UMZ, and G#5) have similar carbon contents (79.2–83.8 wt % d.a.f.), in contrast to a carbon content of 90.8 wt % (d.a.b.) for coal TSH. The free swelling index (FSI) indicated that the Witbank coals were noncoking while TSH was strongly coking. Solid state nuclear magnetic resonance indicated that the vitrinite-rich (65.9 vol % m.m.f.b.), higher rank (1.23 RoV %) coal TSH was more aromatic (81%) and more polycondensed than the other three coals. Coal G#5 was the least aromatic (66%) and was characterized by its larger proportion of protonated aliphatics as compared to the other coals. Coals UMZ, INY, and G#5 had similar average aromatic cluster sizes (ranging between 19 and 21 aromatic carbons) and number of cluster attachments (5 to 6) as estimated from NMR data. Furthermore, the cluster attachments of coal TSH were concentrated more in the side-chains, whereas the attachments of the other three coals were more prominent in bridge-and/or loop structures. XRD carbon crystallite analyses showed that coal G#5 contained the largest amount of amorphous carbon (67%), consistent with a higher volatile matter yield in comparison to the other coals. Laser-desorption ionization mass time-of-flight spectroscopy indicated that all four coals displayed similar molecular weight distributions ranging up to 1800 m/z. Coal TSH showed a maximum abundance at a higher molecular mass (608 m/z) in comparison to the other three coals. HRTEM analyses confirmed the presence of slightly more aromatic fringes in the higher molecular mass range for coal TSH in comparison to the other coals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acarbon 3acoal 3acrystallites 3aionization 3amolecular weight 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3athyrotropin 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aEverson, Raymond C.1 aNeomagus, Hein W.

For this, six piles were prepared in commercial composting conditions, using AD in a range of 40%–80% (on a dry weight basis). Physico-chemical and chemical parameters and the thermal behaviour were evaluated during the process, as were the physical and chemical parameters of the final composts. The proportion of AD in the mixtures has a significant effect on the development of the thermophilic stage of composting, showing the piles with higher proportion of AD a quicker organic matter degradation. In addition, the evolution of the thermal indices R1 and R2 was different depending on the origin of the sludge used, indicating an increase in the relative concentration of more recalcitrant materials in the piles prepared with AS. The estimation of the global warming potential showed that the use of higher proportion of AD in the composting mixture may be a strategy to mitigate the emission of greenhouse gases during the composting process. Moreover, the end-products obtained had an additional marketable value, with a balanced nutrient content and a good degree of maturity, which indicates the viability of the composting process as a method for the stabilization of these organic wastes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArundo donax 3abiomass 3acomposting 3acomposts 3aglobal warming potential 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ainvasive species 3anutrient content 3aorganic matter 3asewage 3asewage sludge 3athermal properties 3aviability 0aCompost 0aArundo donax biomass 0aSludge 0aThermal analysis 0aGreenhouse gases1 aSáez-Tovar, J.A.1 aAndreu-Rodríguez, J.1 aPérez-Murcia, M.D.1 aMartínez-Sabater, E.1 aMarhuenda-Egea, F.C.1 aPérez-Espinosa, A.1 aBustamante, M.A.1 aAgulló, E.1 aVico, A.1 aParedes, C.1 aMoral, R.0 tWaste management.g2018 Aug., v. 78 p.730-740dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2018.06.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01251naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001100138245008700149300001800236520029600254592002800550650000800578650002300586650002300609650001600632650001000648650002100658700002000679700002700699773012900726856007300855852000900928655001200937IND60658373420221121221214.0190817e20090414xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065837342DNAL7 a10.1039/b819643e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Li10aReversible stability switching of a hairpin DNA via a photo-responsive linker unit  ap. 1915-1917.  aWe have designed and synthesized a novel photo-responsive linker unit, 4,4′-bis(hydroxymethyl)-azobenzene, which was introduced to the loop oligonucleotide in a DNA hairpin and was able to reversibly control the stability of the whole hairpin structure via UV or visible light irradiation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions 3airradiation 3alight 3aoligonucleotides1 aKoumoto, Kazuya1 aSugimoto, N.q(Naoki),0 tChemical communications.g2009 Apr. 14, , no. 14 p.1915-1917dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b819643e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02387naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094024002200138024001900160040001800179100002500197245007100222300001600293520105100309592002801360650001901388650001501407650002801422650001601450650001301466650001101479650001601490650001601506650001601522650001601538650002001554650002601574650001201600650001101612650000901623650002601632700001801658700002101676773009801697856009001795990002301885852000901908655001201917IND60113543320221120181727.0141111s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011354332DNAL7 a10.1016/B978-0-12-407766-9.00016-X2doi7 aPMC49764442pmcid7 a233747252pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKemper, Jongsook Kim10aSirtuin 1 Deacetylase: A Key Regulator of Hepatic Lipid Metabolism  ap. 385-404.  aObesity is a serious medical problem worldwide and disruption of metabolic/energy homeostasis plays a pivotal role in this global epidemic. In obese people, fatty liver (steatosis) develops, which increases the risk for diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and even, liver cancer. Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is a NAD⁺-dependent deacetylase that functions as a key metabolic/energy sensor and mediates homeostatic responses to nutrient availability. Accumulating evidence indicates that SIRT1 is a master regulator of the transcriptional networks that control hepatic lipid metabolism. During energy-deprived conditions, SIRT1 deacetylates and alters the expression and activities of key transcriptional regulators involved in hepatic lipogenesis, fatty acid β-oxidation, and cholesterol/bile acid metabolism. This review will discuss the latest advances in this field, focusing on beneficial roles of SIRT1 in hepatic lipid metabolism including its potential as a therapeutic target for treatment of steatosis and other obesity-related metabolic diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeta oxidation 3abile acids 3acardiovascular diseases 3acholesterol 3adiabetes 3aenergy 3afatty acids 3afatty liver 3ahomeostasis 3alipogenesis 3aliver neoplasms 3anutrient availability 3aobesity 3apeople 3arisk 3atranscription factors1 aChoi, Sung-E.1 aKim, Tong-hyŏn,0 tVitamins and Hormones.g2013, v. 91 p.385-404dElsevier Science & Technologyx0083-67297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-407766-9.00016-X3Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02840naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245009800158300002000256520157400276592002801850650001601878650001701894650000701911650001201918650001101930650001601941653003701957653002701994653002002021653001802041653001702059700002002076700001802096700001402114700001702128700001702145700001502162700001402177773012602191856008002317852000902397655001202406IND60555362820221119224158.0161027e20161026xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055536282DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b096502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Yuxin10aMultifunctional Reversible Fluorescent Controller Based on a One-Dimensional Photonic Crystal  ap. 28844-28852.  aWith the aim to build a multifunctional solid fluorescent controller, a one-dimensional photonic crystal and CdSe fluorescent single layer were separated on the opposite sides of quartz substrates. The separation structure remarkably facilitates materials selection for the fluorescent controller, which allows one to freely choose the fluorescent substance and constituents of 1DPC from a wide range of available materials with the best desirable properties and without caring about the interactions between them. Fluorescent enhancement and weakened effect were successfully achieved when the excitation light was irradiated from different sides of the fluorescent device. In addition, the fluorescent intensity can be altered reversibly along with environmental pH values according to the change of a pH-responsive one-dimensional photonic crystal layer, which is quite different from a previously reported quenching mode. Meanwhile, the original position of the photonic stop band is essential for deciding what pH value would produce the best effect of fluorescent control. It provides a way to adjust the effect of fluorescent controller according to certain applied situations. The mechanism of fluorescent variation was confirmed by the assistance of a finite-difference time-domain simulation. Furthermore, this device is also able to modulate fluorescent wavelength and full width at half-maximum by overlapping the photonic stop band and the emission of CdSe. Therefore, this method offers a universal strategy for the fabrication of fluorescent controllers.  aPublisher supplied data 3acontrollers 3afluorescence 3apH 3aphotons 3aquartz 3awavelengths 0aone-dimensional photonic crystal 0afluorescent controller 0amultifunctional 0apH responsive 0aquantum dots1 aShen, Huaizhong1 aYe, Shunsheng1 aYao, Dong1 aLiu, Wendong1 aZhang, Junhu1 aZhang, Kai1 aYang, Bai0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2016 Oct. 26, v. 8, no. 42 p.28844-28852dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b096503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03530naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245011700171300001600288520180900304592002802113650001102141650002002152650002202172650001702194650002302211650001102234650002502245650001002270650002002280650002002300650002302320650003302343650002802376650001102404650001202415650001802427650002202445650001402467650001402481650001502495650001102510651001002521653003102531653002202562653001302584653003902597653000902636653002302645700001902668700002302687700002202710773011402732856008502846852000902931655001202940IND60570800220221118052536.0180904e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057080022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.parint.2017.06.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoudhary, Kirti10aMorphological and molecular characterisation of three Indian Neascus-type metacercariae (Digenea: Diplostomidae)  ap. 652-659.  aDiplostomid digeneans are important parasites whose larval stages infect freshwater snails and fish as first and second intermediate hosts respectively. Diplostomid digeneans as adults are parasitic in many fish-eating birds and mammals. Our understanding of the species diversity of diplostomid digeneans remains incomplete, especially in the Indian sub-continent. Here, we describe three Neascus-type metacercariae (N. hanumanthai, N. gussevi, and N. xenentodoni) from freshwater fish specimens of Channa punctata (Bloch 1793), Trichogaster fasciata (Bloch and Schneider 1801) and Xenentodon cancila (Hamilton, 1822) respectively, collected in India. Next, we characterised these metacecariae using nuclear (28S and ITS1) and mitochondrial DNA (cox1) to determine their systematic and phylogenetic position. Molecular identification using interspecific variation for all three molecular markers revealed a closer relationship between N. hanumanthai and N. gussevi (1.9%–2.4%) than either of N. hanumanthai and N. gussevi to N. xenentodoni (3.1%–3.7% and 4.4%–4.0% respectively). In phylogenetic analyses, estimated by neighbour-joining (NJ) and maximum likelihood (ML) methods, N. gussevi and N. hanumanthai nested as sister groups of Posthodiplostomum Dubois, 1936 for all three markers used; N. xenentodoni, however, nested as a sister taxa of all other diplostomes when using 28S and ITS1 and nested as a sister taxa of Bolbophorus, Alaria and Neodiplostomum using cox1. These findings suggest that N. hanumanthai and N. gussevi are members of Posthodiplostomum, but that N. xenentodoni belongs to a separate and unknown genus. Similarly, by proteomics, we found that the cox1 protein sequences and structures were similar between N. hanumanthai and N. gussevi but distinct for N. xenentodoni.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlaria 3aChanna punctata 3aPosthodiplostomum 3aTrichogaster 3aXenentodon cancila 3aadults 3aamino acid sequences 3abirds 3afreshwater fish 3agenetic markers 3aintermediate hosts 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3ainterspecific variation 3alarvae 3amammals 3ametacercariae 3amitochondrial DNA 3aparasites 3aphylogeny 3aproteomics 3asnails 3aIndia 0aNeascus-type metacercariae 0aPosthodiplostomum 0a28S rDNA 0aInternal transcribed spacer region 0acox1 0aIn silico analysis1 aTripathi, Amit1 aPandey, Keshava C.1 aAgrawal, Nirupama0 tParasitology international.g2017 Oct., v. 66, no. 5 p.652-659dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12048x1383-57697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.parint.2017.06.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01453naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245009400160300001800254520037000272592002800642650002300670650002200693650002200715700002300737700002600760700002300786700002100809700002800830700001900858700002200877773013200899856007501031852000901106655001201115IND60658841920221119094908.0190826e20110201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065884192DNAL7 a10.1039/c0cc04418k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Jackson J.10aTemperature-dependent crystal structure of the isopropanol clathrate of Dianin's compound  ap. 2029-2031.  aThe title compound undergoes two order–disorder transitions between 15 and 299 K, dictated by ordering of the guest molecules in the host cages, and resulting in three related crystal structures.

R.10aSeparation of Oil/Water Emulsions in Continuous Flow Using Microwave Heating  ap. 3173-3178.  aThis work studies a continuous flow microwave system to enhance gravity settling of water-in-oil emulsions. Settling times were found to be dependent upon the applied power, flow rate, and energy input. Power and energy input are linked to liquid flow rate within the flow system used in this study, so a key objective of this work was to understand the effect of turbulence on the heating and separation of the flowing emulsion. At high flow rates (9–12 L/min), it was found that turbulence dominates, with settling times largely independent of energy input. At lower flow rates (1–6 L/min), when turbulence was decreased, it was found that the settling time decreased as the power density was increased. Settling times have the potential to be less than half that of untreated emulsions and can be reduced further if turbulence can be minimized between the microwave heating zone and the settling zone in the process equipment.  aPublisher supplied data 3acontinuous systems 3aemulsions 3aenergy 3agravity 3amicrowave treatment 3aoils 3aseparation 3aturbulent flow1 aRobinson, John P.1 aKingman, Sam W.1 aLester, Ed H.1 aAzzopardi, Barry J.1 aDimitrakis, Georgios1 aBriggs, John0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2013 June 20, v. 27, no. 6 p.3173-3178dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fef400634n3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02990naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100001800161245015700179300001600336500000900352500001500361520177900376592002802155650001902183650001402202650001602216650001302232650001602245650001502261650002502276650001502301651001402316653001902330653001002349700001702359773012102376852000902497856009802506655001202604IND2056296120221120224347.0191122e199503  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205629612DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1995.0011183X003500020021x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPanter, D.

Selection of Superior Crosses from a Limited Number of Yield Trials  ap. 405-410.  aepub  a2019-12-04  aEconomic constraints on many plant breeding programs have forced breeders to limit the number of environments for performance testing of new genetic material. The use of best linear unbiased predictions (BLUP), which augments predictions of individuals by using observations on their close relatives, should provide improved predictions of performance under such conditions. The objectives of this study were to determine (i) whether BLUP values were more precise predictors than least squares means [i.e, best linear unbiased estimates (BLUE)] from soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] yield trials conducted in one or two environments, and (ii) how much improvement in the precision of BLUP could be gained by inclusion of historical parental data. Bulks and lines of 24 soybean crosses and four check cultivars were evaluated at 11 different environments in Tennessee to estimate the mean seed yield of each cross and cultivar. Historical yield records on parents of each cross were compiled from trials conducted in Tennessee from 1982 through 1990. Using subsets of the 11 environments, we predicted yield using three methods: (i) BLUE, (ii) BLUP(NP), without parental data, and (iii) BLUP(P), with parental data. Standard errors of differences (S⁻d) and rank correlations (rₛ) between the actual and predicted mean yields showed that either method of BLUP was superior to BLUE for providing precise yield estimates. Because of the high genetic relationships among the crosses used in this study, including historical parental information did little to increase the precision of BLUP(P) over BLUP(NP).

The impact of these interactions on the evolution of each partner depends on the time‐scale considered. Short‐term dynamics – ‘coevolution’ in the narrow sense – has been reviewed elsewhere. We focus here on the long‐term evolutionary dynamics of cospeciation and speciation following host shifts. Whether hosts and their symbionts speciate in parallel, by cospeciation, or through host shifts, is a key issue in host–symbiont evolution. In this review, we first outline approaches to compare divergence between pairwise associated groups of species, their advantages and pitfalls. We then consider recent insights into the long‐term evolution of host–parasite and host–mutualist associations by critically reviewing the literature. We show that convincing cases of cospeciation are rare (7%) and that cophylogenetic methods overestimate the occurrence of such events. Finally, we examine the relationships between short‐term coevolutionary dynamics and long‐term patterns of diversification in host–symbiont associations. We review theoretical and experimental studies showing that short‐term dynamics can foster parasite specialization, but that these events can occur following host shifts and do not necessarily involve cospeciation. Overall, there is now substantial evidence to suggest that coevolutionary dynamics of hosts and parasites do not favor long‐term cospeciation. Contents Summary 347 I. Introduction 348 II.

However, the EPA currently does not consider any economic criteria when ordering sites for remediation. Given the local economic benefits to cleaning, the EPA may be able to increase overall social welfare by considering certain economic criteria. We build a theoretical model that incorporates both the short-run and long-run cleanup benefits and identifies the site and location characteristics that impact welfare. We then use calibrated Monte Carlo simulations to compare 6 feasible cleanup policies and 1 infeasible best-case policy to the status quo policy. We find that the best of the feasible policies can on average improve welfare by 1.88% of the status quo policy, though the administrative costs are likely non-trivial. A similarly beneficial alternative may be to use a set of heuristics regarding site characteristics to order cleanups. In order of importance, the ranking criteria are: site cleanup cost (cheapest first), long-term economic damages from waste, areas currently in a recession, and local discount rates. Ex ante local economic stability has no significant effect. This set of heuristics sees a slightly smaller mean welfare increase (1.85%). Notably, since 3 of the 4 criteria are easily observable, this increase is nearly costless.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3acleaning 3adiscount rate 3aissues and policy 3aprioritization 3aremediation 3asocial welfare 3atheoretical models 3awastes1 aMcMahon, Matthew1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4989-98251 aRoush, Justin0 tEnvironmental and resource economics.g2019 Apr., v. 72, no. 4 p.1225-1249dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871699x0924-64607nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10640-018-0245-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02697naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245011900165300001600284506002800300520158900328592002801917506003701945650001101982650001501993650002002008650001202028650001002040650001502050650001402065651001402079700002202093700002902115773010202144856008002246852000902326655001202335IND60764516520221215143603.0211116e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076451652DNAL7 a10.13057/biodiv/d2002342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSASMITA, NANANG10aAdaptation of Morus alba and Morus cathayana plants in a different climate and environment conditions in Indonesia  ap. 544-554.  aResource is Open Access  aSasmita N, Purba JH, Yuniti IGAD. 2019.

The results show different growth rates from various regions in Indonesia. Mulberry growth in West Java was the best compared to mulberry which growth in Bali and Kalimantan. The highest live percentage was observed in West Java for M. alba (95%) and M. cathayana (90%), followed by Bali M. alba (85%) and M. cathayana (80%), Kalimantan M. alba (80%) and M. cathayana (75%). The best high parameter of mulberry plant in West Java for M. alba (80cm) and M. cathayana (76 cm), in Bali for M. alba (67 cm) and M. cathayana (76cm), in Kalimantan for M. alba (58 cm) and M. cathayana (50cm). The best mulberry species based on the whole parameter is M. alba in West Java. This means that West Java climate and environmental conditions are good for mulberry cultivation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBorneo 3aMorus alba 3aMorus cathayana 3aclimate 3afarms 3amulberries 3asilkworms 3aIndonesia1 aPURBA, JHON HARDY1 aI GUSTI AYU DIYAH YUNITI0 tBiodiversitas.g2019 Feb., v. 20, no. 2 p.544-554dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.13057/biodiv/d2002343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01339naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245014300159300001800302520035500320592002800675650002300703650001500726650001200741650000900753650001300762650001400775650001100789650001400800773012900814856007300943852000901016655001201025IND60658373620221121220922.0190817e20090224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065837362DNAL7 a10.1039/b819658c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Jing-Fang10aFacile preparation of an ultrathin nickel film coated nanoporous gold electrode with the unique catalytic activity to oxidation of glucose  ap. 1270-1272.  aA facile approach to prepare a Ni coated nanoporous gold (Ni@NPG) electrode with the combination of a UPD monolayer and galvanic displacement is described, which not only conserves the 3-D nanostructure of the NPG electrode but presents unique catalytic activity to the electrode surface to significantly enhance the performance of glucose detection.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3aelectrodes 3aglucose 3agold 3ananogold 3ananopores 3anickel 3aoxidation0 tChemical communications.g2009 Feb. 24, , no. 10 p.1270-1272dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b819658c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02719naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002200141245012100163520139800284592002801682650002201710650001701732650002101749650002301770650002401793650002001817650001601837650001601853650001901869650002801888650002201916650001601938650001701954651001401971700003201985700002602017700002702043700002602070773011702096856007502213852000902288655001202297IND60649767020221118033222.0190706e20181130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064976702DNAL7 a10.3390/land70401482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRondhi, Mohammad 10aAgricultural Land Conversion, Land Economic Value, and Sustainable Agriculture: A Case Study in East Java, Indonesia  aAgricultural land conversion (ALC) is an incentive-driven process. In this paper, we further investigate the inter-relationship between land economic value (LEV) and ALC. To achieve this goal, we calculated the LEV for agricultural and non-agricultural (housing) uses in two areas of East Java, Indonesia. The first area represents peri-urban agriculture, which is facing rapid urbanization and experiencing a high rate of ALC. The second area represents rural agriculture, with zero ALC. Furthermore, we identified factors affecting LEV in both areas for both uses. The results of this study show that agricultural land yielded a higher economic benefit in rural areas. Conversely, compared to agricultural land, housing in urban areas yields a value that is seven times higher. Moreover, agricultural land was shown to yield a higher profit after conversion. Ironically, a similar comparison does not exist in rural areas. Agricultural land yielded a value that was only 19% higher, indicating that agricultural land can easily be converted. This is also proven by the growing number of new urban cores in the periphery area. There are several factors affecting land economic value, such as agricultural use, soil fertility, accessibility, and cropping pattern, which are important variables. Meanwhile, the accessibility and location of peri-urban areas increase the land value for housing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3acase studies 3acropping systems 3aeconomic valuation 3afinancial economics 3aland use change 3aland values 3arural areas 3asoil fertility 3asustainable agriculture 3aurban agriculture 3aurban areas 3aurbanization 3aIndonesia1 aPratiwi, Pravitasari  Anjar1 aHandini, Vivi  Trisna1 aSunartomo, Aryo  Fajar1 aBudiman, Subhan  Arif0 tLand.g2018 Nov. 30, v. 7, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land70401483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02927naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100001700161245008000178300001600258500000900274500001500283520166100298592002801959650001201987650002301999650000902022650003002031650003702061650001302098650001302111650002202124650002302146650003702169650001702206653003702223653001002260700001902270773012102289852000902410856009802419655001202517IND2056295720221122052005.0191122e199503  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205629572DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1995.0011183X003500020017x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChung, Y.

Identity of Resistance Genes  ap. 383-388.  aepub  a2019-12-04  aGene number and mode of inheritance of powdery mildew resistance in 10 wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) lines was determined in a previous report. However, the allelic relationships of these genes to each other and to known genes was not determined. Eight of the 10 powdery mildew resistant wheat lines were crossed with each other and to each of 13 host differential lines that have known genes for resistance to powdery mildew, caused by Blumeria graminis (DC.) E. O. Speer sp. tritici Em. Marchal. In each cross, 300 to 800 F₂ seedlings were evaluated for their reaction to isolate 127 of B. graminis f. sp. tritici in the greenhouse to determine the relationship and putative identity of resistance genes in the eight lines. One common gene, Pm4b, was identified in the wheat lines C39, A55-2, R107, ‘Armada’, and SIS. The three genes in C39 and SI5 were identified as Prm2, Pm4b, and Pm6 based on lack of susceptible progeny from crosses of these lines with the corresponding host differentials. The resistance genes in OK75R3645 and GO4779 differ from each other and from those identified in the other resistant lines. The resistance gene in OK75R3645 most likely is an allele or closely linked to the Pm3 locus. It is probable that the resistance gene in GO4779 is Pml, as no segregation for susceptible progeny was observed in the cross of GO4779 with the differential line Axminster/8*CC(Pml). A single recessive gene, pm8, was postulated for ST1-25, whose disease reaction was intermediate to isolate 127. Six different genes governing resistance to powdery mildew were identified among the eight wheat lines, and Pm4b was the most common gene.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3agenetic resistance 3aloci 3afungal diseases of plants 3aBlumeria graminis f. sp. tritici 3acrossing 3aallelism 3aTriticum aestivum 3adisease resistance 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3awinter wheat 0aErysiphe graminis f. sp. tritici 0alines1 aGriffey, C.

Evidence indicates that obesity-induced inflammation is a major cause of insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes. Environmental factors, such as nutrients, affect body energy balance through epigenetic or chromatin-based mechanisms. As a bromodomain and external domain family transcription regulator, Brd2 regulates expression of many genes through interpretation of chromatin codes and participates in the regulation of body energy balance and immune function. In the severely obese state, Brd2 knockdown in mice prevented obesity-induced inflammatory responses, protected animals from insulin resistance, glucose intolerance and pancreatic beta cell dysfunction, and thus uncoupled obesity from diabetes. Brd2 provides an important model for investigation of the function of transcription regulators and the development of obesity and diabetes; it also provides a possible, innovative target to treat obesity and diabetes through modulation of the function of a chromatin code reader.  aPublisher supplied data 3achromatin 3aenergy balance 3aenvironmental factors 3aepigenetics 3agene targeting 3agenes 3aglucose 3ainflammation 3ainsulin resistance 3amice 3amodels 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3anutrients 3aobesity 3atranscription factors1 aDeeney, Jude T.1 aDenis, Gerald V.0 tVitamins and Hormones.g2013, v. 91 p.49-75dElsevier Science & Technologyx0083-67297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-407766-9.00003-13Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01298naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245003000169300001300199520055900212592002800771653001600799653002100815653001800836700001700854773007000871856008200941852000901023655001201032IND60547632920221118222520.0161027s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054763292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ieri.2014.08.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFiliposka, Sonja10aComplex Cloud Datacenters  ap. 8-14.  aThe network architecture deployed in a data center is of extreme importance and should provide the data center with the high throughput while keeping overprovisioning at the minimum costs.

Municipalities bargain over a transfer payment that slows spread but requires an infested municipality to forgo nonmarket benefits from the host species. We find that when the uninfested municipality has a relative bargaining power advantage, bargaining may attain the first-best solution. However, in many cases a short-term bargaining agreement is unlikely to succeed, which suggests a role for higher levels of government to facilitate long-term agreements even when the details are left to municipalities to negotiate.  aPublisher supplied data 3acollaborative management 3ahosts 3ainvasive species1 aAmacher, Gregory S.1 aHaight, Robert G.0 tEnvironmental and resource economics.g2019 Apr., v. 72, no. 4 p.1041-1068dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871699x0924-64607nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10640-018-0238-83Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle02245naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002500144245010100169300002000270520100900290592002801299650002001327650001801347650002601365653002701391653002101418653002801439653003501467653001601502700002501518700001401543700002301557700002001580700001901600700002401619773012901643856007801772852000901850655001201859IND60555363120221119224206.0161027e20161026xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055536312DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b097682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeterson, Gregory I.10aProduction of Materials with Spatially-Controlled Cross-Link Density via Vat Photopolymerization  ap. 29037-29043.  aWe describe an efficient method to produce objects comprising spatially controlled and graded cross-link densities using vat photopolymerization additive manufacturing (AM). Using a commercially available diacrylate-based photoresin, 3D printer, and digital light processing (DLP) projector, we projected grayscale images to print objects in which the varied light intensity was correlated to controlled cross-link densities and associated mechanical properties. Cylinder and bar test specimens were used to establish correlations between light intensities used for printing and cross-link density in the resulting specimens. Mechanical testing of octet truss unit cells in which the properties of the crossbars and vertices were independently modified revealed unique mechanical responses from the different compositions. From the various test geometries, we measured changes in mechanical properties such as increased strain-to-break in inhomogeneous structures in comparison with homogeneous variants.  aPublisher supplied data 3alight intensity 3amanufacturing 3amechanical properties 0aadditive manufacturing 0agraded materials 0avat photopolymerization 0afunction-based representations 0avoxel model1 aSchwartz, Johanna J.1 aZhang, Di1 aWeiss, Benjamin M.1 aGanter, Mark A.1 aStorti, Duane,1 aBoydston, Andrew J.0 tACS applied materials .g2016 Oct. 26, v. 8, no. 42 p.29037-29043dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.6b097683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02821naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245011900169300001600288520087200304592002801176650001501204650001501219650001501234650000901249650002101258650001201279650001001291650001901301650001101320650001901331650001401350650001301364650001501377651001001392653003201402653002201434653002301456653001801479653002201497653002501519700001901544700001501563700002501578700002201603700002201625700002501647700002001672700001801692700002701710700002401737700002201761700001801783700002501801700002301826700005601849700002401905700002201929773011401951856008502065852000902150655001202159IND60570800520221118052701.0180904e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057080052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.parint.2017.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUni, Shigehiko10aZoonotic infection with Onchocerca dewittei japonica in an 11-year-old boy in Kansai Region, Western Honshu, Japan  ap. 593-595.  aAn 11-year-old boy living in Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture, Kansai Region, Western Honshu, Japan had zoonotic onchocercosis. The patient developed a painful swelling on the little finger of his left hand. The worm detected in the excised mass had external transverse ridges but did not have inner striae in the cuticle. On the basis of the parasite's histopathological characteristics, the causative agent was identified as a female Onchocerca dewittei japonica (Spirurida: Onchocercidae). The species of the filarial parasite was confirmed by sequencing the cox1 gene of the parasite. The Japanese wild boar Sus scrofa leucomystax is a definitive host for O. dewittei japonica, which is then transmitted by blackflies as the vector to humans. The current case described occurred in the Kansai Region, Western Honshu, where such infections were previously not reported.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOnchocerca 3aSimuliidae 3aSus scrofa 3aboys 3adefinitive hosts 3afemales 3agenes 3ahistopathology 3ahumans 3aonchocerciasis 3aparasites 3apatients 3awild boars 3aJapan 0aEmerging infectious disease 0aFilarial parasite 0aJapanese wild boar 0aOnchocercosis 0aTransverse ridges 0aVector-borne disease1 aFukuda, Masako1 aOgawa, Kou1 aLim, Yvonne Ai Lian,1 aAgatsuma, Takeshi1 aBunchom, Naruemon1 aSaijuntha, Weerachai1 aOtsuka, Yasushi1 aBhassu, Subha1 aMat Udin, Ahmad Syihan1 aZainuri, Nur Afiqah1 aOmar, Hasmahzaiti1 aNakatani, Jun1 aMatsubayashi, Makoto1 aMaruyama, Haruhiko1 aRamli, Rosli1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0410-96041 aAzirun, Mohd Sofian1 aTakaoka, Hiroyuki0 tParasitology international.g2017 Oct., v. 66, no. 5 p.593-595dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12048x1383-57697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.parint.2017.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01390naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002700140245011600167300001800283520039100301592002800692650002300720650001600743650001000759650001800769650001700787650001100804700002100815700002200836773013400858856007500992852000901067655001201076IND60658842220221119094723.0190826e20110221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065884222DNAL7 a10.1039/c0cc04424e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnežević, Nikola Ž.10aFunctionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticle-based visible light responsive controlled release delivery system  ap. 2817-2819.  aA supramolecular assembly for visible light responsive release of cargo molecules is presented.

Assessment of benthic and coral community structure in an inshore reef in Balok, Pahang, Malaysia. Biodiversitas 20: 872-877. Inshore water reef closer to human activities are often neglected since they are not protected by marine park management. Little is known on how this reef responses to challenging environment in terms of abundance, diversity and benthic community composition. This study provides a quantitative assessment on the benthic community composition at 5 reef sites in Balok, Pahang, Malaysia and observed the ecological adaptation in the reef community towards turbid water environment. Balok reef has 39% overall coral cover with very low macroalgae abundance (4%). A total of 28 coral genera from 12 families have been recorded with Porites the most dominant genus in the coral assemblages. Most reef sites in Balok are categorized under conservation class 1 (CC1), which indicated that resilient and survival of the reef rely on stress-tolerators taxa. The data presented here showed that Balok reef is highly resilient towards constant exposure to high sedimentation and wave action.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abenthic organisms 3acommunity structure 3acorals 3ahumans 3amacroalgae 3amarine parks 3aMalaysia1 aSAAD, SHAHBUDIN1 aAHMAD, ZUHAIRI1 aYUSOF, MUHAMMAD HAMIZAN1 aKHODZORI, MOHD FIKRI AKMAL0 tBiodiversitas.g2019 Mar., v. 20, no. 3 p.872-877dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.13057/biodiv/d2003353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01953naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100007000147245006500217300001600282520103900298592002801337650001301365650001601378650001101394700002401405700001901429773013601448856008201584852000901666655001201675IND60638868620221117232608.0190816e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063886862DNAL7 a10.1007/s10640-018-0233-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Frutos Cachorro, Julia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8494-394310aSharing a Groundwater Resource in a Context of Regime Shifts  ap. 913-940.  aWe study the occurrence of shocks in a common groundwater resource problem using a differential game. In particular, we use Rubio and Casino’s adaptation of the Gisser and Sánchez model where we introduce a sudden change in the dynamics of the resource, namely a decrease in the recharge rate of the aquifer. We compare the pareto optimal solution with open-loop and feedback equilibria. First, we show analytically how different solutions, at the steady state, depend on the intensity of the shock. Moreover, we show that the cost and the strategic effects are decreasing functions of the intensity of the shock, i.e. that all the solutions get closer at the steady state for more intense shocks. We finally apply the game to the particular case of the Western La Mancha aquifer. The aim of this application is to estimate how shocks influence the inefficiency of open loop and feedback strategies in terms of welfare. We show that this inefficiency decreases the earlier the shock occurs or the higher the intensity of the shock.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3agroundwater 3amodels1 aErdlenbruch, Katrin1 aTidball, Mabel0 tEnvironmental and resource economics.g2019 Apr., v. 72, no. 4 p.913-940dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871699x0924-64607nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10640-018-0233-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02963naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245010300167300001600270520159800286592002801884650002101912650001301933650001501946650001701961650002901978650001602007650001002023650001702033650001602050650001302066650002202079650001502101653000802116653001502124653003702139653003702176653001402213700002102227700002402248700001502272773012402287856008502411852000902496655001202505IND60702337720221120235352.0200717e20200807xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070233772DNAL7 a10.1080/00218839.2020.17183412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSari, Fatih10aUsing AHP and PROMETHEE multi-criteria decision making methods to define suitable apiary locations  ap. 546-557.  aBeekeeping activities have a rapidly increasing importance due to their derived products and their contributions to human health, biodiversity, agriculture, and pollination. Moreover, beekeeping can play a major role in supporting rural development and bringing the benefits of sustainable developments and productivity. Thus, the decision on correct apiary locations via suitability analysis techniques seems essential to sustain and increase the yield and efficiency. However, this decision-making process requires a large number of parameters including the topography of the field surrounding environment and climate conditions. At this point, Multi Criteria Decision Analysis techniques can provide efficient solutions for decision making on suitable apiary locations. In this study, suitable apiary site selection analysis for beekeeping activities via Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and The Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment of Evaluations (PROMETHEE) methods was proposed for Konya city located in Central Anatolia as a pilot application. Aspect, elevation, slope, flora, water resources, roads, railroads, settlements, electricity lines, buildings, precipitation, and natural disaster area criteria were assessed to generate beekeeping suitability for apiaries. The restrictions and requirements of beekeeping activities were specified considering expert beekeeper decisions and recent studies for the study area. The AHP and PROMETHEE suitability maps were validated with existing 461 apiary locations to be able to determine the reliability and applicability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTurkey (country) 3aapiaries 3abeekeepers 3abiodiversity 3adecision support systems 3aelectricity 3aflora 3ahuman health 3apollination 3aresearch 3arural development 3atopography 0aAHP 0abeekeeping 0aGeographical Information Systems 0amulti-criteria decision analysis 0aPROMETHEE1 aKandemir, İrfan1 aCeylan, Durmuş Ali1 aGül, Aziz0 tJournal of apicultural research.g2020 Aug. 7, v. 59, no. 4 p.546-557dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12840x2078-69137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00218839.2020.17183413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02740naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245012000163506002800283520146700311592002801778506003701806650002201843650002801865650002101893650001601914650003101930650001201961650001401973650001601987653002002003653001802023653001202041653001402053653001502067653001302082700002102095700002102116773009202137856008002229852000902309655001202318IND60764516820221207082409.0211121e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076451682DNAL7 a10.13057/biodiv/d2005252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPRABOWO, HERI10aMass production of the entomopathogenic nematode, Steinernema carpocapsae on Tenebrio molitor and Spodoptera litura  aResource is Open Access  aAuthors. 2019. Mass production of the entomopathogenic nematode, Steinernema carpocapsae on Tenebrio Molitor and Spodoptera litura. Biodiversitas 20: 1344-1349. Steinernema carpocapsae is the most developed biological agents to control pests nowadays, to support this nematode as a biological agent mass production technique is required. S. carpocapsae can be produced via in vivo methods. In vivo production has some advantages, such as cheap, easy, and sustainable to be developed in small farm agriculture. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the mass production of S. carpocapsae using Tenebrio molitor and Spodoptera litura larvae as hosts. Twenty-five last instar larvae were inoculated with different concentrations of infective juvenile (IJ) (e.g., 100, 200, 300 and 400 IJ/larvae) of S. carpocapsae Asembagus. The production of S. carpocapsae with concentrations of 100, 200, 300 and 400 IJ/larvae on T. molitor and S. litura showed 3.62x103; 6.29x103; 1.13x104; 1.52x104; 1.13x104; 1.46x104; 1.54x104; and 1.94x104 IJ/larvae, respectively. The IJ harvest from T. molitor and S. litura shows the longest body length for IJ at a concentration of 400 IJ/larva of 437.48µm and 591.42µm, respectively. This study indicates that T. molitor and S. litura can be used to produce S. carpocapsae. The production of S. carpocapsae with a concentration of 400 IJ / larvae on T. molitor and S. litura showed the highest total yield and body length of IJ.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSpodoptera litura 3aSteinernema carpocapsae 3aTenebrio molitor 3abody length 3aentomopathogenic nematodes 3ainstars 3ajuveniles 3asmall farms 0amass production 0as.carpocapsae 0ain vivo 0aasembagus 0at. molitor 0as.litura1 aADIKADARSIH, SRI1 aDAMAIYANI, JANIS0 tBiodiversitas.g2019 Apr., v. 20, no. 5dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.13057/biodiv/d2005253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02860naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245010500164300001600269520140100285592002801686650001201714650001601726650003301742650002201775650001601797650001201813650001501825650001401840650002101854650001201875650001801887651001001905653001101915653001601926653001301942653001501955653001301970653001001983700001701993700001702010700001702027700001502044700001802059700001402077700001802091700001302109773011402122856008502236852000902321655001202330IND60570800620221118052533.0180904e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057080062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.parint.2017.06.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCui, Ping12aA new species of Eimeria (Apicomplexa: Eimeriidae) from Californian rabbits in Hebei Province, China  ap. 677-680.  aRabbit coccidiosis is caused by infection with one or usually several Eimeria species, parasitizing in hepatobiliary ducts or intestinal epithelium of rabbits. To date, 11 species of rabbit coccidia have been well documented. Here we report a new species of Eimeria from rabbits. Sporulated oocysts were ellipsoidal to slightly ovoidal, 37.4 (32.6–41.2) μm in length, 23.5 (20.9–25.5) μm in width, with a shape index (length/width) 1.6 (1.43–1.91) and smooth, bilayered, homogeneously thick wall. The micropyle was obvious and with an inner diameter of 6.2 (5.0–7.5) μm. Both oocyst residuum and polar granule were absent. Sporocysts were ellipsoidal to elongate, 17.2 (13.2–20.0) μm long and 8.4 (7.5–9.1) μm wide, with a shape index (length/width) of 2.1 (1.74–2.21) and the presence of Stieda body and sporocyst residuum. The prepatent period was 132h. Phylogenetic analysis showed that 18S rDNA sequence of the new species clustered together with the 11 rabbit Eimeria species into a clade. However, ITS-1 sequence of the new species shared low similarities (27.1%–30%) with those of 11 rabbit Eimeria species. As the data above supported the erection of a new species, we named it as Eimeria kongi n. sp., in honor of Fanyao Kong, a Chinese parasitologist. The finding of the new species has important implications for the diagnosis and prevention of rabbit coccidiosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEimeria 3acoccidiosis 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aintestinal mucosa 3anew species 3aoocysts 3aparasitism 3aphylogeny 3aprepatent period 3arabbits 3aribosomal DNA 3aChina 0aRabbit 0aNew species 0aCoccidia 0aMorphology 0a18S rDNA 0aITS-11 aLiu, Hongbin1 aFang, Sufang1 aGu, Xiaolong1 aWang, Peng1 aLiu, Chunling1 aTao, Geru1 aLiu, Xianyong1 aSuo, Xun0 tParasitology international.g2017 Oct., v. 66, no. 5 p.677-680dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12048x1383-57697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.parint.2017.06.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02037naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245008500170300001800255520083700273592002801110596008001138650002601218650001401244650001401258650003101272650002701303650001101330650001301341650001601354700006001370700002801430773013801458856008201596852000901678655001201687IND60638868720221117232650.0190816e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063886872DNAL7 a10.1007/s10640-018-0241-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHopfensitz, Astrid10aCatch Uncertainty and Reward Schemes in a Commons Dilemma: An Experimental Study  ap. 1121-1153.  aWe design and conduct a laboratory experiment with students and a field experiment with fishermen to test how catch uncertainty and reward schemes affect extraction in an open access fishery. We find that uncertainty in the relationship between effort and catch increases extraction effort and accelerates resource depletion. Importantly, participants increase their extraction after a disadvantageous shock, but do not react to advantageous shocks. One possible explanation of this phenomenon is a self-serving bias. Price-responsive demand, relative to a fixed price setting, decreases extraction effort and increases efficiency. Price-responsive demand has a greater effect on students than on fishermen living inside a marine protected area, but fishermen outside this restricted area are very responsive to conditional pricing.  aPublisher supplied data  aIDEA-131-2014cLatin American and Caribbean Environmental Economics Program 3afield experimentation 3afisheries 3afishermen 3alaboratory experimentation 3amarine protected areas 3aprices 3astudents 3auncertainty1 aMantilla, César1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4752-44481 aMiquel-Florensa, Josepa0 tEnvironmental and resource economics.g2019 Apr., v. 72, no. 4 p.1121-1153dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871699x0924-64607nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10640-018-0241-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02594naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245004200164300001400206520122500220592002801445650002301473650002201496650002001518650002001538650002101558653000801579653000801587653000801595653002501603653001601628653001801644653001901662653001501681653004301696653003601739653003201775653002501807653001601832653003001848653001601878700002501894773011001919856008602029852000902115655001202124IND60628448120221121043119.0190206e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062844812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jeconom.2017.09.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Ping10aThreshold regression with endogeneity  ap. 50-68.  aThis paper studies estimation in threshold regression with endogeneity in the regressors and thresholding variable. Three key results differ from those in regular models. First, both the threshold point and the threshold effect parameters are shown to be identified without the need for instrumentation. Second, in partially linear threshold models, both parametric and nonparametric components rely on the same data, which prima facie suggests identification failure. But, as shown here, the discontinuity structure of the threshold itself supplies identifying information for the parametric coefficients without the need for extra randomness in the regressors. Third, instrumentation plays different roles in the estimation of the system parameters, delivering identification for the structural coefficients in the usual way, but raising convergence rates for the threshold effect parameters and improving efficiency for the threshold point. Simulation studies corroborate the theory and the asymptotics. An empirical application is conducted to explore the effects of 401(k) retirement programs on savings, illustrating the relevance of threshold models in treatment effects evaluation in the presence of endogeneity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconometric models 3aeconomic analysis 3aeconomic theory 3ainstrumentation 3athreshold models 0aC21 0aC24 0aC26 0aThreshold regression 0aEndogeneity 0aLocal shifter 0aIdentification 0aEfficiency 0aIntegrated difference kernel estimator 0aRegression discontinuity design 0aOptimal rate of convergence 0aPartial linear model 0aU-statistic 0aThreshold treatment model 0a401(k) plan1 aPhillips, Peter C.B.0 tJournal of econometrics.g2018 Mar., v. 203, no. 1 p.50-68dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11871x0304-40767nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2017.09.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03831naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004100113040001800154100001900172245012900191300001600320520187400336592002802210650000902238650001102247650001702258650001202275650001602287650002002303650003002323650001002353650002702363650001002390650001202400650001402412650001002426650002502436650001002461650005602471650001202527650002402539650005702563650008802620650004502708650001402753650002402767651001502791651001502806653003302821653001902854653002702873653001702900700001702917700001502934700001402949700002002963773012502983856008803108852000903196655001203205IND50066050120221120172058.0190318e20130601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006605012DNAL7 a232607962pmid7 a10.1016/j.prevetmed.2012.11.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMardones, F.O.14aThe value of animal movement tracing: A case study simulating the spread and control of foot-and-mouth disease in California  ap. 133-138.  aThe purpose of this study was to estimate the benefits of an electronic animal tracing system and an improved paper-based system in terms of the potential spread of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) if introduced in California. A spatial, stochastic simulation model and data for California were used to simulate FMD outbreaks originating from a dairy herd as the index case (IC). Descriptive statistics of the simulated FMD outbreak extent and duration were examined to determine the benefit of an electronic system or paper-based tracing systems of varying efficacies. According to the simulations, an electronic tracing system would reduce the median number of infected premises (IPs) by 8–81%, depending on size of the IC herd compared with the results expected from identifying IPs based on clinical signs alone. The benefit also varied by IP herd type, e.g. ≥50% for sheep farms, goat farms and calf and heifer raising operations and ≤20% for swine and beef premises. The electronic system simulated a decrease in the median duration from at least 200d to 42d, if the IC were a small dairy and from 110d to 45d if the IC were a large dairy. The impact of an introduction of FMD in California could be reduced substantially even without an electronic system, if paper-based tracing were more efficient; however, these benefits are far less than those that could be realized from an electronic animal identification system. Results show that substantial benefits, in terms of fewer IPs and infected animals and reduced epidemic duration, may be realized as a result of an efficient electronic animal identification system, compared with a paper-based animal tracing system; however, until then, an improvement in the current system, especially regarding the ability to trace movements the day prior to a premises being diagnosed with FMD, may be highly beneficial.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeef 3acalves 3acase studies 3adairies 3adairy herds 3adisease control 3aelectronic identification 3afarms 3afoot-and-mouth disease 3agoats 3aheifers 3aherd size 3asheep 3astochastic processes 3aswine 2aAnimal Identification Systemsxmethodsxveterinary. 2aAnimals 2aComputer Simulation 2aDisease Outbreaksxprevention & controlxveterinary. 2aFoot-and-Mouth Diseasexepidemiologyxprevention & controlxtransmissionxvirology. 2aFoot-and-Mouth Disease Virusxphysiology 2aLivestock 2aModels, Theoretical 3aCalifornia 0aCalifornia 0aAnimal identification system 0aEpidemic model 0aFoot-and-mouth disease 0aTraceability1 azu Donha, H.1 aThunes, C.1 aVelez, V.1 aCarpenter, T.E.0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2013 June 01, v. 110, no. 2 p.133-138dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34182x0167-58777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2012.11.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02920naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245009500160300001800255520160900273592002801882650003701910650001501947650002801962650001101990650001202001650001002013650000902023650001302032650001102045650002302056650001702079650001902096650000902115650001602124651001402140700002202154700001302176700001702189700001802206700001802224700002002242773010402262856007502366852000902441655001202450IND60534092720221120222812.0160802e20130718xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053409272DNAL7 a10.1021/ef301832b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSkovbjerg, L. L.10aPreferential Adsorption of Hydrocarbons to Nanometer-Sized Clay on Chalk Particle Surfaces  ap. 3642-3652.  aThe demand for oil is increasing, but many reservoirs are reaching the end of their productive lifetime. A clearer understanding of the fundamental chemical and physical controls on the wetting behavior of reservoir pore surfaces would provide clues for developing methods to improve, or enhance, recovery of the currently inaccessible oil (improved/enhanced oil recovery, IOR/EOR). In this work, the surfaces of chalk were investigated to understand hydrophobicity at nanometer scale spatial resolution. Chalk samples from the gas and water zones of the Danish sector in the North Sea Basin were used. With inverse gas chromatography (IGC), the surface characteristics were compared. Chalk from the gas zone has a lower surface energy, dispersive as well as specific, than chalk from the water zone, clearly indicating that the gas zone pore surfaces are more hydrophobic. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows that the concentration of hydrocarbons is higher in gas zone chalk than in water zone chalk, which is consistent with IGC measurements. With combined atomic force microscopy and chemical force mapping, we demonstrated that the hydrophobicity of chalk is not correlated spatially with the calcite of the coccolith elements, but rather with nanometer-sized authigenic clay crystals that decorate the surfaces of the coccoliths. Our results suggest that clay and adsorbed organic material, not calcite, are responsible for wettability alterations in chalk during the introduction of hydrocarbons. Furthermore, we show that surface hydrophobicity is heterogeneous, even within single-clay laths.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3aatomic force microscopy 3abasins 3acalcite 3achalk 3aclay 3acrystals 3aenergy 3agas chromatography 3ahydrocarbons 3ahydrophobicity 3aoils 3awettability 3aNorth Sea1 aOkhrimenko, D.

Abundance of soil microbes, endophytic fungi and blast disease of paddy rice with three pest management practices. Biodiversitas 21: 4234-4239. Rice production in Indonesia faces a potential threat of pests and diseases. Biointensive Integrated Pest Management (Bio IPM) is a new approach based on natural and biological control, which effectively controls pests and diseases. However, the impact of this technology on soil microbes and endophytic fungi is almost unknown. The objective of the study was to investigate the effect of Bio IPM on abundance of soil microbes, endophytic fungi, and blast disease under field conditions. Three pest management types were tested i.e. conventional, reduced pesticides, and Bio IPM. Field experiment was set in four replications in randomized complete block design. Experiments were carried out in two seasons i.e. dry and wet season. Variables assessed during experiment were amount of soil bacteria, soil fungi, phosphate solubilizing bacteria, colonization of total leaf endophytes, colonization of Nigrospora sp., and blast disease severity. The results showed that the abundance of soil bacteria and phosphate solubilizing bacteria were significantly increased with Bio IPM whereas it was not found to be significant in soil fungi. Total endophytic fungi and Nigrospora sp. were found higher in Bio IPM especially in early growth stages. Bio IPM controlled neck blast more effectively than conventional and reduced pesticides, but it did not show any significant effect on leaf blast disease.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNigrospora 3abiological control 3ablast disease 3adisease severity 3aendophytes 3afield experimentation 3aleaves 3aphosphates 3arough rice 3asoil 3asolubilization 3awet season 3aIndonesia 0abio ipm 0aendophytes 0anigrospora 0aneck blast 0apaddy rice 0apgpr 0asoil microbiology 0astraw amendment1 aIstiaji, Bonjok1 aTriwidodo, Hermanu1 asuryaningsih, andika septiana0 tBiodiversitas.g2020 Aug., v. 21, no. 9dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.13057/biodiv/d2109393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04124naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003200135040001800167100002500185245014500210300001000355500001500365506007600380520225200456592002802708506003702736650001802773650001502791650001702806650001502823650002302838650001402861650002402875650001702899650001702916650003802933650000902971650002302980650001403003650002203017650001203039650003703051650001103088650006003099650002003159650002703179651001103206653005503217700002303272700002303295700002303318773011703341856007903458852000903537655001203546IND50067237320221207090828.0190131e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006723732DNAL7 aPMC36398892pmcid7 a233606152pmid7 a10.1186/1751-0147-55-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNyman, Ann-Kristin J10aEvaluation of the specificity of three enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for detection of antibodies against Salmonella in bovine bulk milk  ap. 5.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The Swedish Salmonella control program has been running for decades and has resulted in a low prevalence of Salmonella in Swedish food producing animals. Routine bacteriology is used to detect Salmonella, however, bacteriology is time consuming, costly and has a low sensitivity. Different enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) have been developed for detection of antibodies against Salmonella Dublin and S. Typhimurium in bovine bulk milk, individual milk samples as well as in sera. Screening bulk milk for antibodies against Salmonella spp. could improve the cost-effectiveness of the surveillance in Swedish dairy cattle, but as characteristics of tests may vary in different populations, tests should always be evaluated in the specific population where they will be used. Hence, the aim of this study was to evaluate the specificities of three bovine ELISAs when used to analyse bulk milk samples from Swedish dairy cattle. A second aim was to compare the performance of the two Dublin ELISAs tested. METHODS: Bulk milk samples for analysis were randomly selected from samples collected within the Swedish bulk milk sampling scheme and analyzed with the three ELISAs; a Danish in-house Dublin ELISA, PrioCHECK® Salmonella Ab bovine Dublin ELISA and PrioCHECK® Salmonella Ab bovine ELISA (hereafter named mixed ELISA). The specificities of the ELISAs were calculated assuming a disease-free status in Sweden i.e. that all test positive samples were assumed to be false positive results. This assumption can be used when a disease is known to be infrequent. RESULTS: The calculated specificities of the two Dublin ELISAs and the mixed ELISA, when using the producer’s recommended cut-off value of the corrected optic-density percent (ODC%) were 99.4% (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 98.8% -99.8%), 99.4% (95% CI: 98.8% -99.8%) and 97.9% (95% CI: 96.8% -98.7%), respectively. The correlation between the ODC% values of the two Dublin ELISAs was 0.83. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the evaluated ELISAs have sufficiently high specificities to be used as supplement to bacteriological examinations in the Swedish Salmonella control program in cattle as well as a primary screening test in routine surveillance for S. Dublin.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amilk analysis 3amonitoring 3afood animals 3aantibodies 3aantibody detection 3abulk milk 3aconfidence interval 3adairy cattle 3abacteriology 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3amilk 3acost effectiveness 3ascreening 3aSalmonella Dublin 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Bacterialxchemistry 2aCattle 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxmethodsxveterinary. 2aMilkxchemistry 2aSalmonellaximmunology 3aSweden 0aSalmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Dublin1 aÅgren, Estelle CC1 aBergström, Karin,1 aWahlström, Helene0 tActa veterinaria scandinavica.g2013 Dec., v. 55, no. 1 p.5-5dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl16962x1751-01477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1751-0147-55-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02985naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245014700162300001600309500001900325500002000344520142800364592002801792596007001820596003601890650001601926650002601942650001001968650001001978650001401988650001402002650001502016650001302031650001402044650003002058650005202088650001702140650001302157650002902170650001402199700001602213700002302229700002402252700001702276773011602293856007302409852000902482655001202491IND60734389620221123033329.0210417e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073438962DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.121552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLangenbach, Caspar10aUDP‐glucosyltransferase UGT84A2/BRT1 is required for Arabidopsis nonhost resistance to the Asian soybean rust pathogen Phakopsora pachyrhizi  ap. 536-545.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNonhost resistance (NHR) of plants to fungal pathogens comprises different defense layers. Epidermal penetration resistance of Arabidopsis to Phakopsora pachyrhizi requires functional PEN1, PEN2 and PEN3 genes, whereas post‐invasion resistance in the mesophyll depends on the combined functionality of PEN2, PAD4 and SAG101. Other genetic components of Arabidopsis post‐invasion mesophyll resistance remain elusive. We performed comparative transcriptional profiling of wild‐type, pen2 and pen2 pad4 sag101 mutants after inoculation with P. pachyrhizi to identify a novel trait for mesophyll NHR. Quantitative reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐qPCR) analysis and microscopic analysis confirmed the essential role of the candidate gene in mesophyll NHR. UDP‐glucosyltransferase UGT84A2/bright trichomes 1 (BRT1) is a novel component of Arabidopsis mesophyll NHR to P. pachyrhizi. BRT1 is a putative cytoplasmic enzyme in phenylpropanoid metabolism. BRT1 is specifically induced in pen2 with post‐invasion resistance to P. pachyrhizi. Silencing or mutation of BRT1 increased haustoria formation in pen2 mesophyll. Yet, the brt1 mutation did not affect NHR to P. pachyrhizi in wild‐type plants. We assign a novel function to BRT1, which is important for post‐invasion NHR of Arabidopsis to P. pachyrhizi. BRT1 might serve to confer durable resistance against P. pachyrhizi to soybean.  aPublisher supplied data  cExcellence Initiative of the German Federal and State Governments  cBASF Plant Science Company GmbH 3aArabidopsis 3aPhakopsora pachyrhizi 3afungi 3agenes 3ahaustoria 3amesophyll 3ametabolism 3amutation 3apathogens 3aresistance to penetration 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asoybean rust 3asoybeans 3atranscription (genetics) 3atrichomes1 aCampe, Ruth1 aSchaffrath, Ulrich1 aGoellner, Katharina1 aConrath, Uwe0 tnew phytologist.g2013 Apr., v. 198, no. 2 p.536-545dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.121553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01616naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245011600167300001800283520053000301592002800831650001300859650002100872650002300893650002100916650001100937650001400948650001400962650001000976650002200986700005701008773012101065856008301186852000901269655001201278IND60649693620190814000000.0190705e20190620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064969362DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.9b018662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStrehl, Julia10aElectrochemical, Manganese-Assisted Carbon–Carbon Bond Formation between β-Keto Esters and Silyl Enol Ethers  ap. 5259-5263.  aThe electrochemical carbon–carbon bond formation process between β-keto esters and silyl enol ethers was investigated utilizing manganese salts.

Thus, there is need for the development or adoption of new strategies such as alternative production systems. In this study, Hass avocado plants grafted on two rootstocks (Mexicola -seed propagated and Dusa® - vegetative-propagated and referred as clonal) were grown in a greenhouse and substrate (coir growth container, 55 L of volume and 500 × 480 mm, H X W) culture system in Valparaiso Region, Chile. Plant growth and development during the vegetative and reproductive phases until end of flowering (63 weeks) were monitored. Plant aerial and root parameters from these two rootstock types (seed and clonal) were monitored by measuring canopy and trunk area, trunk height, root area, type of roots (rhizotron), non-structural carbohydrates dynamics, further primary metabolites, water use efficiency (WUE) and nitrate and phosphate use efficiency (NUE and PUE). Results of this study corroborated that continuous fertigation with nutrient solution provide better growing conditions resulting in prolonged and more continuous growth and flowering than open field conditions. In addition, differences in aerial and root growth between plants grown on these two different rootstocks under similar fertigation and environmental conditions were found. Plants grown on Mexicola rootstock were more efficient energetically as sustained by higher trunk area, tree height and higher root content of the main non-structural carbohydrates (mannoheptulose and perseitol) than plants grown on the clonal rootstock. Our findings suggest that this alternative growing system for Hass avocado, besides being more intensive could have a positive impact on environmental indicators (WUE, NUE and PUE) related to sustainability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aavocados 3acanopy 3acarbohydrates 3aclimate change 3acoir 3afertigation 3agreenhouses 3ametabolites 3anitrates 3anutrient solutions 3anutrient use efficiency 3aphosphates 3arisk 3aroot growth 3arootstocks 3atree height 3awater footprint 3awater use efficiency 3aChile 0aHydroponic 0aGreenhouse 0aWoody tree 0aPrimary metabolites 0aPhenology 0aNutrient emissions1 aCuneo, Italo F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8092-09871 aAlvaro, Juan E.1 aPedreschi, Romina0 tScientia horticulturae.g2021 Feb. 05, v. 277 p.109830-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2020.1098303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03036naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006100150245012900211300001600340520135100356592002801707650001301735650002201748650001201770650001201782650001301794650001101807650001001818650001101828650000901839650000901848650001401857650001101871650001301882650001401895650001101909650002101920651001701941653001701958653003401975653003402009653002102043700002402064700001902088700002302107700002102130700001702151700003002168700002202198700002102220700002802241773009502269856008502364852000902449655001202458IND60612038520221121014659.0200614e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061203852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2018.06.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDobaradaran, Sina1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0958-509510aCharacterization of plastic debris and association of metals with microplastics in coastline sediment along the Persian Gulf  ap. 649-658.  aThis study reports number, size and color distribution, and metal contents of microplastics as well as adherent sediments along the Persian Gulf. Samples were collected from 9 stations in summer 2015 with a sampling time interval of 10 days. Plastic size of 2–5 mm, and ≤0.25 mm with 45 and 33% and white and colorless plastics with 62 and 33% had the highest abundance considering number per m², respectively. In general, the majority of collected plastics (79%) were smaller than 5 mm (defined size for microplastics). The mean Al, Fe, Mn, Cd, Cr, Ni, Pb, Cu contents of plastic fragments were 115, 531, 32.2, 0.035, 0.915, 2.03, 4.59, and 3.6 μg g⁻¹, respectively while the mean Al, Fe, Mn, Cd, Cr, Ni, Pb, Cu contents of sediments were 186, 3050, 127, 0.81, 5.01, 14.5, 48.6 and 5.43 μg g⁻¹ respectively. There were significant differences between the abundance of plastic items as well as the all examined metal concentrations of microplastics and sediments at different sampling times. As there is no regular cleanup program in the studied areas, significant differences between plastic items number at different sampling times (with higher plastic items number at the first day of sampling) showed that a large number of plastic items may enter from beaches to the sea and become available to marine organisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aaquatic organisms 3abeaches 3acadmium 3achromium 3acoasts 3acolor 3acopper 3airon 3alead 3amanganese 3anickel 3aplastics 3asediments 3asummer 3awaste management 3aPersian Gulf 0aMarine waste 0aMicroplastic characterization 0aPlastic debris size and color 0aThe Persian Gulf1 aSchmidt, Torsten C.1 aNabipour, Iraj1 aKhajeahmadi, Nahid1 aTajbakhsh, Saeed1 aSaeedi, Reza1 aJavad Mohammadi, Mohammad1 aKeshtkar, Mozhgan1 aKhorsand, Maryam1 aFaraji Ghasemi, Fatemeh0 tWaste management.g2018 Aug., v. 78 p.649-658dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2018.06.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02452naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245017000158300002000328520108100348592002801429650001101457650001401468650002301482650001501505650001701520650001501537650001301552650001301565650001101578650001901589653002301608653001801631653000901649653002501658653000801683653001501691700001701706700001901723700002001742700001601762773012901778856007801907852000901985655001201994IND60555363520221119224152.0161027e20161026xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055536352DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b098112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Mei10aPorous N-Doped Carbon Prepared from Triazine-Based Polypyrrole Network: A Highly Efficient Metal-Free Catalyst for Oxygen Reduction Reaction in Alkaline Electrolytes  ap. 28615-28623.  aMetal-free N-doped carbon (NC) materials have been regarded as one of the most promising catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media because of their outstanding ORR catalytic activity, high stability, and good methanol tolerance. Up to now, only a small minority of such catalysts have been synthesized from triazine-based polymeric networks. Herein, we report the synthesis of such NC catalyst by directly pyrolyzing a nitrogen-rich, triazine-based polypyrrole network (TPN). The TPN is fabricated by oxidative polymerization of 2,4,6-tripyrrol-1,3,5-triazine monomer using TfOH as the protonating agent and benzoyl peroxide as the oxidizing agent. The obtained NC-900 (pyrolyzed at 900 °C) catalyst exhibits excellent ORR activity in alkaline media with a high ORR onset potential (0.972 V vs RHE), a large kinetic-limiting current density (15.66 mA cm–² at 0.60 V), and good MeOH tolerance and durability. The as-synthesized NC-900 material is a potential candidate as a highly active, stable, and low-cost ORR catalyst for alkaline fuel cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adurability 3aelectrolytes 3afuel cells 3amethanol 3aoxidants 3aoxygen 3apolymerization 0apolymeric networks 0aporous carbon 0adope 0anetal-free catalysts 0aORR 0afuel cells1 aLiu, Yijiang1 aChen, Hongbiao1 aYang, Duanguang1 aLi, Huaming0 tACS applied materials .g2016 Oct. 26, v. 8, no. 42 p.28615-28623dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.6b098113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04187naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006200139245012500201300001800326500002000344520193500364592002802299596008002327596003002407596007502437596007502512596007502587596007202662650001402734650002202748650001502770650001802785650001702803650001802820650001102838650001102849650002202860650001302882650002002895650003702915650001402952700007302966700006403039700002303103700006403126700006303190700002103253700006603274700006003340773015103400856007303551852000903624655001203633IND60743162920221119104419.0210707e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074316292DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.67152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeronimo, Gabriela1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2077-240610aDevelopment of S75:R25 bupivacaine‐loaded lipid nanoparticles functionalized with essential oils for treating melanoma  ap. 2197-2207.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: A new role as an antitumoral agent has been proposed for the local anesthetic bupivacaine (BVC), considering its toxic effects on cancer cells. However, such drug repositioning requires an improvement in drug available concentrations and sustained release profiles to surpass BVC short action and narrow therapeutic window. Nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) may provide bupivacaine with sustained release, and they can be formulated with essential oils, whose intrinsic therapeutic properties may act synergistically with BVC. This study reports the development of two NLC formulations prepared with lavender or melaleuca oils and enantiomeric excess S(−)75:R(+)25 bupivacaine (BVCS₇₅). The nanoparticles were characterized by dynamic light scattering, nanotracking analysis, transmission electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and X‐ray diffraction, and their stability was followed for 1 year. Encapsulation efficiency and in vitro BVCS₇₅ release profile were also measured. Additionally, the effect on the viability of mice (B16‐F10) and human (SK‐MEL‐25) melanoma cells was determined, as was in vivo anesthesia assessed by the tail flick test in mice. RESULTS: The two formulations optimized by factorial design (NLC‐L‐B and NLC‐M‐B) showed robust physical and chemical properties, 1‐year stability and sustained release in vitro. Cytotoxicity tests revealed a decrease in IC₅₀ values, relative to free BVCS₇₅, of ~80% and 62% (NLC‐L‐B) and 80% and 25% (NLC‐M‐B) in mice and human melanoma cells, respectively. Encapsulation in both formulations doubled the anesthesia time of BVCS₇₅. CONCLUSION: Combining the effects of bupivacaine and NLC excipients, the two optimized NLC formulations containing BVCS₇₅ may be interesting nanosystems for the treatment of melanomas after further in vivo tests. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI).  aPublisher supplied data  cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient&iacute;fico e Tecnol&oacute;gico  cG.G. and E.P. fellowships  a14/14457‐5cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a17/15174‐5cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a18/07100‐4cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  cInstituto Nacional de Ci&ecirc;ncias e Tecnologia ‐ Bioanalítica 3aLavandula 3aX-ray diffraction 3aanesthesia 3abiotechnology 3acytotoxicity 3aencapsulation 3ahumans 3alipids 3alocal anesthetics 3amelanoma 3atail flick test 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aviability1 aRodrigues da Silva, Gustavo H1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7377-85321 ade Moura, Ludmilla D1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8449-57621 aRibeiro, Lígia NM1 aGuilherme, Viviane A1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1008-29061 aMendonça, Talita C1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3513-10221 aCastro, Simone R1 aBreitkreitz, Márcia C1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0596-96921 ade Paula, Eneida1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4504-57230 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2021 Aug., v. 96, no. 8 p.2197-2207dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.67153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01966naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100008300138245014100221300001800362520095200380592002801332650002301360650002201383650002901405700002501434700001801459773012901477856007301606852000901679655001201688IND60658372620221121151543.0190817e20090321xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065837262DNAL7 a10.1039/b819534j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMirasBoth of these authors contributed equally to this article., Haralampos N.10aUnravelling the complexities of inorganic and supramolecular self-assembly in solution with electrospray and cryospray mass spectrometry  ap. 1297-1311.  aElectrospray (ESI) and cryospray mass spectrometry (CSI-MS) are proving to be exceptionally versatile tools when used in conjunction with high resolution time-of-flight (TOF) systems to investigate the self-assembly of supramolecular architectures, inorganic coordination and organometallic compounds, labile molecules and clusters both from a structural and mechanistic point of view. In this feature article, we review very recent progress where mass spectrometry is being applied to highly labile and complex coordination and polyoxometalate (POM) cluster systems and we present some highlights from our initial electrospray and cryospray studies, which probe the self-assembly of inorganic cluster architectures. We discuss the major contributions of ESI and CSI-MS to labile and self-assembling inorganic architectures with great emphasis on future potential and ramifications for inorganic chemistry and the area of self-assembly as a whole.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3amass spectrometry 3aorganometallic compounds1 aWilson, Elizabeth F.1 aCronin, Leroy0 tChemical communications.g2009 Mar. 21, , no. 11 p.1297-1311dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b819534j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02373naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245006500168300001800233520097900251592002801230650002201258650002401280650002301304650001201327650004401339650002201383650001101405650001201416650002001428653004601448653001701494653001801511653002101529653001301550653001001563700002301573700002001596700001701616700005501633700002101688700002201709773008201731856008101813852000901894655001201903IND60551396720221120124510.0161018e20140902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055139672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2014.06.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGibson, Harry W.10aStereochemistry of alkylated isoquinoline Reissert compounds  ap. 5904-5918.  aA series of alkylated isoquinoline Reissert compounds (2-acyl-1-alkyl-1,2-dihydroisoquinoline-1-nitriles) with either 3-H (3) or 3-CH3 (4) substituents was examined by 1H, 13C, and 19F NMR spectroscopies and X-ray crystallography. In all cases the trans-amide conformation, with reference to the carbonyl oxygen and the 3-position of the isoquinoline ring, exists exclusively in the solid state, and predominates in solution. As expected the 1-alkyl groups (isopropyl, isobutyl, benzyl) are nearly pseudo-axial or axial in all cases. In N-aroyl compounds the larger ortho-aroyl substituent lies syn to the 1-alkyl moiety in nine of the 11 cases, as revealed by X-ray crystallographic studies. In solution NMR results show that atropisomerism about the Ar/CO bond is usually rapid at room temperature, but slow at −50 °C and usually favors the syn isomer. CH⋯π interactions of the 3-methyl protons of 4 with the N-aroyl moieties appear to influence the atropisomerism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aambient temperature 3achemical reactions 3aisomers 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aorganic compounds 3aoxygen 3aprotons 3astereochemistry 0aAlkylated isoquinoline Reissert compounds 0aAtropisomers 0aAmide isomers 0aX-ray structures 0aRotamers 0aNOESY1 aBerg, Michael A.G.1 aPrice, Terry L.1 aNiu, Zhenbin1 aLee, Minjae1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1600-55571 aRouser, Mason A.1 aSlebodnick, Carla0 tTetrahedron.g2014 Sept. 02, v. 70 p.5904-5918dElsevier Ltdx0040-40207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2014.06.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02876naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245009700170300001600267520124600283592002801529650002201557650003701579650000801616650001101624650002501635650003501660650001101695650001901706650001401725650001301739650001101752650001701763650003701780650001901817650001201836650001801848650001801866650003301884650001601917650003701933653002901970653001501999653001602014653002202030700002202052700002002074700002202094700002202116773009002138856008502228852000902313655001202322IND60629146220221120102700.0190320e20190315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062914622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2019.01.0852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTouahra, Fouzia10aRole of the nanoparticles of Cu-Co alloy derived from perovskite in dry reforming of methane  ap. 465-474.  aEnhanced the carbon resistance and sintering of the metal-active site of catalysts for the dry reforming of methane (DRM) can be achieved by the metal-perovskite interaction. Perovskite-based catalysts LaCoO3 and LaCu0.55Co0.45O3 were prepared using the sol-gel citrate method. The products obtained, after heat treatment under air at 800 °C, were characterized by several techniques such as: inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Brunauere Emmette Teller method (BET), scanning electron microscopy (SEM-EDX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR). After reduction, the catalysts were evaluated in the reforming of methane reaction under continuous flow with CH4/CO2 ratio equal to 1, at atmospheric pressure and temperature ranging from 400 to 700 °C. LaCu0.55Co0.45O3 catalyst exhibit higher activity compared to LaCoO3. According to the catalytic and characterization results before and after reaction, the higher activity obtained in the case of LaCu0.55Co0.45O3 can be explained by the lower Co particle size and formation of Cu-Co alloy during the reduction which prevents the CoO formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aair 3aalloys 3aatmospheric pressure 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3acitrates 3acobalt 3acobalt oxide 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aheat treatment 3amethane 3ananoparticles 3aparticle size 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aDry reforming of methane 0aPerovskite 0aCu-Co alloy 0aCarbon resistance1 aChebout, Redouane1 aLerari, Djahida1 aHalliche, Djamila1 aBachari, Khaldoun0 tEnergy.g2019 Mar. 15, v. 171 p.465-474dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2019.01.0853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03110naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245018900169300001600358520128600374592002801660650001801688650001701706650001701723650002201740650002001762650002001782650001701802650001701819650001501836650001501851650001901866650002001885653000601905653000601911653000701917653001001924653000601934653000701940653000701947653000601954653000601960653000701966653001601973653000901989653000701998653000902005653000602014653000602020653000602026653000602032653000702038653000702045653000702052653001702059653001702076653001302093653002902106653003102135700001902166700001902185773011702204856008202321852000902403655001202412IND60570799520221117235114.0180904e20170915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057079952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bej.2017.06.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPandurić, Nikola10aFully integrated biotransformation of fumaric acid by permeabilized baker's yeast cells with in situ separation of L-malic acid using ultrafiltration, acidification and electrodialysis  ap. 221-229.  aL-malic acid is a dicarboxylic acid and an intermediate of cell metabolism. It belongs to a group of “bulk“ chemicals with estimated consumption of 40,000 tons per year. It can be prepared by extraction from natural fruit juices or by bioconversion of fumaric acid with an enzyme fumarase. In this work a completely integrated production of L-malic acid from fumaric acid with in situ separation of L-malic acid was developed. Whole permeabilized cells of baker's yeast were used as biocatalyst. Baker's yeast was chosen in this biochemical reaction as an inexpensive and accessible source of the enzyme fumarase. The process of biotransformation of fumaric acid with in situ separation of product was composed of five process steps connected in series: biotransformation, crystallization with acidification, sedimentation, concentration using electrodialysis and dissolution by neutralization. The average conversion of fumaric acid has been increased from 77.5% recorded in the continuous process to 91.3% in the continuous process with in situ separation of product. At the same time, volumetric productivity of 15.1g dm⁻³day⁻¹ achieved in the continuous process has been increased to 26.1g dm⁻³day⁻¹ in the continuous process with in situ separation of product.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3abakers yeast 3abiocatalysts 3abiotransformation 3acrystallization 3aelectrodialysis 3afruit juices 3afumaric acid 3amalic acid 3ametabolism 3aneutralization 3aultrafiltration 0aA 0ac 0ac0 0acfeed 0aI 0aKi 0aKm 0ap 0aq 0aq0 0aqV,feed(+N) 0aqV,N 0aQV 0aS.A. 0aT 0at 0aX 0aV 0avm 0aρ 0aτ 0aL-malic acid 0aFumaric acid 0aFumarase 0aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 0ain situ product separation1 aŠalić, Anita1 aZelić, Bruno,0 tBiochemical engineering journal.g2017 Sept. 15, v. 125 p.221-229dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12044x1369-703X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bej.2017.06.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02139naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002300156245003300179300001600212520090800228592002801136650001601164650001901180650001401199650001301213650002701226650001301253650002301266650001101289650001701300650001201317650002301329650001201352650001301364650003001377700002001407700002801427700003001455773009801485856009001583990002301673852000901696655001201705IND60113542420221120052541.0141111s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011354242DNAL7 a10.1016/B978-0-12-398313-8.00008-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos, Esther Dos10aAdiponectin and Reproduction  ap. 187-209.  aAdiponectin is an adipocyte-derived cytokine that acts as a major regulator of insulin sensitivity. Adiponectin deficiency can result in severe diabetes and metabolic disorders in humans. Since its discovery, our understanding of adiponectin's biological functions has expanded from insulin sensitization properties to new effects on inflammation, immunology, and human reproduction. Indeed, both obesity and excessive leanness are associated with reproductive dysfunction. The objective of this chapter is to review such biological actions and the potential roles of adiponectin on human reproduction. There is accumulative evidence for direct effects of this adipokine on the late stages of folliculogenesis and on the development of a functional placenta. In addition, clinical and genomic studies associate hypoadiponectinemia with pregnancy-related disorders, including polycystic ovarian syndrome.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadiponectin 3aanimal ovaries 3acytokines 3adiabetes 3afollicular development 3agenomics 3ahuman reproduction 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3aobesity 3aplacenta 3apolycystic ovary syndrome1 aPecquery, René1 aMazancourt, Philippe de1 aDieudonné, Marie-Noëlle0 tVitamins and Hormones.g2012, v. 90 p.187-209dElsevier Science & Technologyx0083-67297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-398313-8.00008-73Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02573naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002000138245013000158520136400288592002801652650001401680650001301694650001501707650001301722650001001735650002201745650001101767650002601778650000901804650001401813650001401827650002301841700001901864700002201883700001901905700002001924700001901944773011901963856007202082852000902154655001202163IND60648865520221116164059.0190701e20180817xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064886552DNAL7 a10.3390/f90805012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeri, Francesco10aDetermining Noise and Vibration Exposure in Conifer Cross-Cutting Operations by Using Li-Ion Batteries and Electric Chainsaws  aIn many activities, chainsaw users are exposed to the risk of injuries and several other hazard factors that may cause health problems. In fact, environmental and working conditions when using chainsaws result in workers&rsquo; exposure to hazards such as noise, vibration, exhaust gases, and wood dust. Repeated or continuous exposure to these unfavourable conditions can lead to occupational diseases that become apparent after a certain period of time has elapsed. Since the use of electric tools is increasing in forestry, the present research aims to evaluate the noise and vibration exposure caused by four models of electric chainsaws (Stihl MSA160T, Stihl MSA200C Li-Ion battery powered and Stihl MSE180C, Stihl MSE220C wired) during cross-cutting. Values measured on the Stihl MSA160T chainsaw (Li-Ion battery) showed similar vibration levels on both right and left handles (0.9&ndash;1.0 m s&minus;2, respectively) and so did the other battery-powered chainsaw, the Stihl MSA200C (2.2&ndash;2.3 m s&minus;2 for right and left handles, respectively). Results showed a range of noise included between 81 and 90 dB(A) for the analysed chainsaws. In conclusion, the vibrations and noise were lower for the battery chainsaws than the wired ones, but, in general, all the values were lower than those measured in previous studies of endothermic chainsaws.  aPublisher supplied data 3achainsaws 3aconifers 3aendothermy 3aforestry 3agases 3alithium batteries 3amodels 3aoccupational diseases 3arisk 3avibration 3awood dust 3aworking conditions1 aLaschi, Andrea1 aFoderi, Cristiano1 aFabiano, Fabio1 aBertuzzi, Lucia1 aMarchi, Enrico0 tForests.g2018 Aug. 17, v. 9, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f90805013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01701naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100006700138245012500205300001800330520053600348592002800884650002300912650001600935650001600951650001700967650000900984650001500993650000701008650001101015700001501026700001901041700001801060700002001078700001801098773012901116856007301245852000901318655001201327IND60658372720221121151607.0190817e20090224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065837272DNAL7 a10.1039/b819538b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSwamyThese authors contributed equally to this work., K.

The unit energy consumption (UEC); the sizes of the LNG heat exchangers; and the liquefaction rate (LR) are chosen as the objective functions of the MOPSO algorithm. Optimizations were performed under two separate circumstances: initially, the optimization in the early stages of the plant design was considered; and consequently the optimization in the operational conditions was implemented. A fuzzy-based clustering method is then used to choose the optimum solution from the resulting points of the Pareto fronts derived from the MOPSO algorithm. The performance of this optimization is compared against the performances of a base case and the optimization performed on the same process using the genetic algorithm (GA). The utilized algorithm improves the objectives values, reduces the exergy destructions in the process and enriches the performance of the LNG heat exchangers. In addition, it is confirmed that the optimization performed at the early stages of the process design yields better results and cost savings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acost effectiveness 3aexergy 3aheat exchangers 3aliquefaction 3aliquefied natural gas 3anitrogen 3aprocess design 0aLiquefaction process 0aLNG heat exchangers 0aUnit energy consumption 0aMulti-objective optimization 0aMOPSO algorithm1 aJazayeri-Rad, Hooshang1 aShahbazian, Mehdi1 aFetanat, Abdolvahhab0 tEnergy.g2019 Apr. 01, v. 172 p.286-303dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2019.01.0873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03664naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001200144245013800156300002000294520207800314592002802392650002502420650001202445650001002457650000902467650001202476650001402488650001602502650002002518650002402538650001802562650002102580650001802601650001402619650001702633650001502650650001202665650001602677650002002693653003202713653002902745653002602774653002202800653002002822653002602842700002802868700002202896773012902918856007803047852000903125655001203134IND60555362120221119224308.0161027e20161026xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055536212DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b093692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Xi10aMagnetoresponsive Poly(ether sulfone)-Based Iron Oxide cum Hydrogel Mixed Matrix Composite Membranes for Switchable Molecular Sieving  ap. 29001-29014.  aStimuli-responsive membranes that can adjust mass transfer and interfacial properties “on demand” have drawn large interest over the last few decades. Here, we designed and prepared a novel magnetoresponsive separation membrane with remote switchable molecular sieving effect by simple one-step and scalable nonsolvent induced phase separation (NIPS) process. Specifically, poly(ether sulfone) (PES) as matrix for an anisotropic membrane, prefabricated poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) nanogel (NG) particles as functional gates, and iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) as localized heaters were combined in a synergistic way. Before membrane casting, the properties of the building blocks, including swelling property and size distribution for NG, and magnetic property and heating efficiency for MNP, were investigated. Further, to identify optimal film casting conditions for membrane preparation by NIPS, in-depth rheological study of the effects of composition and temperature on blend dope solutions was performed. At last, a composite membrane with 10% MNP and 10% NG blended in a porous PES matrix was obtained, which showed a large, reversible, and stable magneto-responsivity. It had 9 times higher water permeability at the “on” state of alternating magnetic field (AMF) than at the “off”-state. Moreover, the molecular weight cutoff of such membrane could be reversibly shifted from ∼70 to 1750 kDa by switching off or on the external AMF, as demonstrated in dextran ultrafiltration tests. Overall, it has been proved that the molecular sieving performance of the novel mixed matrix composite membrane can be controlled by the swollen/shrunken state of PNIPAAm NG embedded in the nanoporous barrier layer of a PES-based anisotropic porous matrix, via the heat generation of nearby MNP. And the structure of such membrane can be tailored by the NIPS process conditions. Such membrane has potential as enabling material for remote-controlled drug release systems or devices for tunable fractionations of biomacromolecule/-particle mixtures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasymmetric membranes 3adextran 3adrugs 3aheat 3aheaters 3ahydrogels 3airon oxides 3amagnetic fields 3amagnetic properties 3amass transfer 3amolecular weight 3ananoparticles 3ananopores 3apermeability 3aseparation 3asieving 3atemperature 3aultrafiltration 0amagnetoresponsive materials 0athermoresponsive nanogel 0amagnetic nanoparticle 0amolecular sieving 0aultrafiltration 0amixed matrix membrane1 aNguyễn, Quốc Bảo,1 aUlbricht, Mathias0 tACS applied materials .g2016 Oct. 26, v. 8, no. 42 p.29001-29014dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.6b093693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02989naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245014400171300001600315520139400331592002801725650003001753650001301783650001201796650001201808650001901820650001301839650004101852650001301893650001101906650001201917650001401929650002101943650001401964650001401978650001801992650001602010650002102026650001802047653003002065653001902095653001202114653002602126653003202152653001002184700001802194700001802212700001802230700002002248773007402268856008402342852000902426655001202435IND60585432920221120151817.0171109e20141101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058543292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2014.08.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Chae-yŏng,10aAssessment of miscanthus biomass (Miscanthus sacchariflorus) for conversion and utilization of bio-oil by fluidized bed type fast pyrolysis  ap. 284-291.  aLiquid bio-oils were produced from miscanthus (Miscanthus sacchariflorus) by fast pyrolysis at various temperature ranges (350–500 °C) with a short residence time and their physicochemical properties were determined to evaluate the potentials for biofuel utilization. Before operating fast pyrolysis, miscanthus was subjected to ICP-ES (inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer) analysis and TGA (thermogravimetric analysis). It was learned that miscanthus was thermally unstable due to large amounts of inorganic constituents including potassium (5643.8 ppm), calcium (711.0 ppm) and magnesium (1403.1 ppm). With fast pyrolysis, the yield of bio-oil gradually decreased with increasing temperature and residence time. The maximum yield of bio-oil was ca. 58.9 wt% at 350 °C with a residence time of 1.9 s. The HHV (higher heating value) of bio-oil was determined up to 18.0 MJ/kg produced at 400 °C with a residence time of 1.9 s. The water content of bio-oil was ranged from 21.1 to 56.9 wt%. GC/MS (gas chromatography/mass spectrometry) analysis showed that bio-oil was mostly composed of carbohydrate derivatives and lignin derivatives. 1-(Acetyloxy)-2-butanone, furfural, dihydro-methy-furanone and levoglucosan were the predominant low molecular weight compounds that originated from carbohydrate and those from lignin were guaiacol 4-vinylphenol and syringol.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMiscanthus sacchariflorus 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3acalcium 3afluidized beds 3afurfural 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aguaiacol 3alignin 3aliquids 3amagnesium 3amolecular weight 3apotassium 3apyrolysis 3aspectrometers 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 3awater content 0aMiscanthus sacchariflorus 0aFast pyrolysis 0aBio-oil 0aInorganic constituent 0aThermo-gravimetric analysis 0aGC/MS1 aOh, Shinyoung1 aHwang, Hyewon1 aMoon, Youn-Ho1 aChoi, Joon Weon0 tEnergy.g2014 Nov. 01, v. 76 p.284-291dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2014.08.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02783naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245014400165300001800309500002000327520148500347592002801832596007201860650002101932650001101953650001801964650001301982650001401995650002102009650001902030650000902049650001302058650001702071650000902088700006702097773015102164856007302315852000902388655001202397IND60743161620221119104439.0210707e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074316162DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.67362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKanagaratnam, Jeeveni13aAn innovative use of electrochemically modified three‐dimensional carbon felt for a rapid recovery of gold from diluted chloride solution  ap. 2219-2227.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: This study presents the novel use of modified Shipley‐activated carbon felt in an electrogenerative process via flow‐through batch recycle cell to recover gold, Au(III), from chloride solutions. RESULTS: The recovery of Au(III) was conducted in a batch recycle cell equipped with three‐dimensional activated carbon felt as a cathode and zinc as an anode. Several initial Au(III) concentrations (50, 100, 250, and 500 mg L⁻¹) and different types of cathode materials (carbon felt and reticulated vitreous carbon) were used to evaluate the cell performance. Both the electrodes were at the same size (2.0 cm × 5.3 cm × 0.3 cm) and volume (3.18cm³). At optimum conditions, total Au(III) recovery was achieved with the use of activated carbon felt at a concentration of 500 mg L⁻¹ within 30 min of operation with a flow rate of 50 mL min⁻¹. This was achieved at a fractional conversion of 1.00, where all the 2894 mol of Au were fully deposited at the cathode. This can be ascribed to the massive surface area and high porosity of carbon felt. Carbon felt has a specific surface area of 1229 cm²g⁻¹ and a porosity of 94.81%. The morphological and compositional studies of the electrodeposited Au(III) onto activated carbon felt cathode material were also carried out. CONCLUSION: It is confirmed that Au(III) has been successfully deposited by cathodic reduction of Au(III) ions. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI).  aPublisher supplied data  cNippon Sheet Glass Foundation for Materials Science and Engineering 3aactivated carbon 3aanodes 3abiotechnology 3acathodes 3achlorides 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectroplating 3agold 3aporosity 3asurface area 3azinc1 aSuah, Faiz Bukhari Mohd1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9361-45240 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2021 Aug., v. 96, no. 8 p.2219-2227dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.67363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05180naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002400156245006500180300001600245520320500261592002803466650002003494650001603514650002603530650001103556650003103567650001503598650001503613650001603628650001303644650002403657650001603681650001403697650001203711650002203723650002003745650002503765650001203790650003503802650002003837650001103857650001203868650002403880650002003904650001503924650000903939650002303948650001203971650001203983650001503995650003004010650001804040650001204058650001204070650000904082650000904091650001004100650001904110650001604129650002504145650001004170700002504180700002104205773009804226856009004324990002304414852000904437655001204446IND60113542620221120041542.0141111s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011354262DNAL7 a10.1016/B978-0-12-398313-8.00010-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalin, Marie-France10aAdiponectin and the Control of Female Reproductive Functions  ap. 239-287.  aAdiponectin is the most abundant protein secreted by the white adipose tissue. It circulates at high levels in the bloodstream and its serum concentration is inversely correlated with body fat mass. The wide distribution of adiponectin receptors (AdipoR1, AdipoR2, and T-cadherin) in peripheral tissues and organs allows adiponectin to exert pleiotropic effects on whole-body metabolism. Besides its well-known antidiabetic, antiatherogenic, and anti-inflammatory properties, accumulating evidence suggests a direct role for adiponectin in reproductive tissues. The mammalian ovary and the ovarian follicle express AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, and treating pig granulosa cells with adiponectin induces changes characteristic of the periovulatory period. Moreover, additive effects are observed between adiponectin and insulin in induction of granulosa cell gene expression, thus suggesting that adiponectin actions on the ovary may be mediated through its insulin-sensitizing effects. Adiponectin receptors are also detected in the uterus. In women, higher AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 gene expression was observed during the mid-secretory phase of the menstrual cycle, suggesting that adiponectin is implicated in the endometrial changes in preparation for embryo implantation. Adiponectin receptors are found in oocytes and early developing pig, rabbit, and mice embryos, and it has been demonstrated that adiponectin can increase the success of porcine embryo development to the blastocyst stage in vitro. Moreover, adiponectin concentration is two to three times greater in human fetal circulation and in umbilical cord blood, compared to adult plasma. This further indicates a role for adiponectin in fetal growth. It has been further suggested that adipose-derived and locally produced adiponectin may act as a key neuromodulator of reproductive functions. For example, the inhibition of LH and GnRH release from rat pituitary and hypothalamic cells following treatment with adiponectin provides evidence that adiponectin may also act on the release of gonadotropins. Adipose tissue is now recognized as an important factor in the complex equation by which the nutritional status regulates female reproductive functions. For example, underweight women have delayed puberty and higher risk of premature delivery, whereas overweight and obese women have early puberty and are prone to develop polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and preeclampsia. Because hypoadiponectinemia is often associated with the abovementioned disorders, it has been suggested that this adipokine might play a role in the development of these pregnancy-related complications. Moreover, as these reproductive disorders often come with metabolic complications such as insulin and glucose resistance, the insulin-sensitizing effects of adiponectin may explain the observed association of this adipokine with PCOS, GDM, and preeclampsia. This review summarizes current knowledge on the role of adiponectin in female reproductive tissues and highlights mechanisms where information is available. We also discuss about the known and potential roles of adiponectin in the development of reproductive disorders.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditive effect 3aadiponectin 3aadiponectin receptors 3aadults 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3ablastocyst 3ablood flow 3ablood serum 3abody fat 3aembryo implantation 3aendometrium 3aequations 3afemales 3afetal development 3agene expression 3agestational diabetes 3aglucose 3agonadotropin-releasing hormone 3agranulosa cells 3ahumans 3ainsulin 3aluteinizing hormone 3amenstrual cycle 3ametabolism 3amice 3anutritional status 3aobesity 3aoocytes 3apleiotropy 3apolycystic ovary syndrome 3apre-eclampsia 3apuberty 3arabbits 3arats 3arisk 3aswine 3aumbilical cord 3aunderweight 3awhite adipose tissue 3awomen1 aBordignon, V.

Complex 1 exhibits remarkable luminescent properties, especially the multifunction sensitivity and selectivity for detecting Ru³⁺, UO₂²⁺; as well as small biomolecules thiamines (TPP, TMP, and TCl) based on a “turn-off” manner. In particular, the pyrophosphate groups of TPP and the phosphate groups of TMP could further affect the quenching rate, leading to different luminescent responds. In addition, we also discussed and proved the luminescence quenching mechanism in detail through comparative test and PXRD characterization. Therefore, complex 1 could be used as a kind of excellent luminescence sensor to detect Ru³⁺, UO₂²⁺, and thiamines (TPP, TMP, and TCl).  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochemical compounds 3achlorides 3aindium 3aligands 3aluminescence 3aphosphates 0aindium complexes 0a1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triamine hexaacetic acid (H6TTHA) 0ametal ions 0athiamines 0aluminescent sensing1 aSong, Jian1 aLi, Shuang1 aChi, Yu-Xian1 aBai, Feng-Ying1 aXing, Yong-Heng0 tACS applied materials .g2016 Oct. 26, v. 8, no. 42 p.28718-28726dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.6b094563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02884naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245008500168300001400253520141200267592002801679650001301707650001301720650001701733650002401750650001301774650001801787650001201805650002001817650002201837650002401859650001501883650001101898650000701909650001301916650001701929650001601946653003001962653003001992653002602022653002002048653001302068653002002081700002102101700001902122700002002141773011402161856008202275852000902357655001202366IND60570799920221117235042.0180904e20171015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057079992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bej.2017.06.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHollermann, Gesa10aFunctionalized porous ceramic microbeads as carriers in enzymatic tandem systems  ap. 30-39.  aPorous Al2O3/SiO2 microbeads (MBs) are propped as carriers for enzymes used in flow reactor setups for tandem enzymatic reactions. Glucose oxidase (GOx) and catalase (CAT) perform sequential reactions. GOx catalyzes the conversion of glucose and O2 to gluconic acid and H2O2. CAT decomposes H2O2 to H2O and O2. Spherical MBs were fabricated via ionotropic gelation followed by rapid-sintering (1200°C/5min), featuring reasonably high open porosity (∼50%), appropriate specific surface area (30±5m²/g) and multi-modal pore sizes (d50=79nm) for envisaged enzyme immobilizations. After activation and amino-silanization, GOx and CAT were successfully immobilized onto MBs applying an EDC/sulfo-NHS crosslinking reaction. Under varied pH and temperature conditions, the immobilized enzymes showed advantages towards harsh conditions (pH 2; 70°C) and demonstrated high activities at neutral pH and 21±2°C (RT), serving as optimal conditions for flow experiments. By varying flow rates (0.1–6ml/min) in individual reactor compartments, GOx- and CAT-functionalized MBs achieved satisfiable H2O2 conversion rates at 1.0ml/min for 24h. In tandem use, obtained H2O2 is constantly degraded over time, maintaining high enzymatic overall performances for two more operation cycles. The presented strategy is particularly interesting, as it can potentially be transferred to other multi-enzyme reaction systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalase 3aceramics 3acrosslinking 3aenzymatic reactions 3agelation 3agluconic acid 3aglucose 3aglucose oxidase 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aimmobilized enzymes 3amicrobeads 3aoxygen 3apH 3aporosity 3asurface area 3atemperature 0aPorous ceramic microbeads 0aSurface functionalization 0aEnzyme immobilization 0aGlucose oxidase 0aCatalase 0aTandem reaction1 aDhekane, Radhika1 aKroll, Stephen1 aRezwan, Kurosch0 tBiochemical engineering journal.g2017 Oct. 15, v. 126 p.30-39dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12044x1369-703X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bej.2017.06.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01261naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002400137245004100161300001800202520055100220592002800771650001000799650001100809650000900820773009800829856007100927852000900998655001201007IND60518518320221121134845.0160418e196911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051851832DNAL7 a10.2307/19369032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHairston, Nelson G.10aOn the Relative Abundance of Species  ap. 1091-1094.  aWhen data are collected so that they can be treated as coming from a variety of sample sizes, it is possible to use the same data to test the effect of altering sample size on the fit to any model. The method is applied to nonpredatory soil mites and their fit to the "broken—stick" model of MacArthur. It is found that by choosing a quadrat size of 4 in.² (25.8 cm²), a good fit is obtained. Smaller and larger quadrats involving the same data do not permit the data to fit the model.

It circulates in plasma as homotrimers and higher-order oliogomers of homotrimers. To facilitate the production of active recombinant adiponectin as a therapeutic tool, we designed a single-chain globular domain adiponectin (sc-gAd) in which three monomer sequences are linked together in tandem to form one contiguous polypeptide. Here, we present the crystal structure of human sc-gAd at 2.0Å resolution. The structure reveals a similar trimeric topology to that of mouse gAd protein.

To date, molecular phylogenetic studies included toxascarid representatives collected only from dogs or felids, therefore the intra-species differences between T. leonina collected from different host species has not been noticed. In this paper, we test the hypothesis of cryptic speciation in the T. leonina complex based on extended sequence data (ITS1, nad1, cox1) and individuals collected from dogs, felids and foxes. Phylogenetic analysis clustered T. leonina representatives into three well-supported clades depending on their host species, i.e. dogs and wolves, wild felids and foxes. Both genetic distances and the barcoding-gap analysis strongly support the species status of populations inhabiting different hosts. The results suggest additional genetic separation in felids. However, to determine the actual size of the Toxascaris complex, it would be necessary to analyse individuals collected from other canid and felid Toxascaris leonina host species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCanidae 3aFelidae 3aToxascaris leonina 3acryptic speciation 3adogs 3afoxes 3agenetic distance 3ahost specificity 3ahosts 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aparasites 3aphylogeny 3awolves 0aToxascaris leonina 0aCryptic-species 0aITS1 0acox1 0anad1 0aBarcode gap1 aDabert, Mirosława1 aJarosz, Wojciech1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1139-51701 aRząd, Izabela1 aPilarczyk, Bogumiła1 aMizgajska-Wiktor, Hanna0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2019 Feb., v. 266 p.80-83dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2019.01.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01388naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245014300159300001800302520030600320592002800626650001200654650002300666650002100689650001900710650001400729650001900743650002100762700001900783700001500802700001600817773013300833856007500966852000901041655001201050IND60658841520221119095040.0190826e20110214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065884152DNAL7 a10.1039/c0cc04407e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, Jiaojiao10aEnhanced photoelectrochemical activities of a nanocomposite film with a bamboo leaf-like structured TiO₂ layer on TiO₂ nanotube arrays  ap. 2598-2600.  aA novel nanocomposite TiO₂ film consisting of a bamboo leaf-like nano TiO₂ layer on a nanotubular TiO₂ arrays surface is synthesized by electrochemical anodization with wet chemical pretreatment; it shows almost three times higher activity as compared to that of nanotubular TiO₂ arrays alone.  aPublisher supplied data 3abamboos 3achemical reactions 3aelectrochemistry 3ananocomposites 3ananotubes 3aphotochemistry 3atitanium dioxide1 aLin, Changjian1 aYe, Meidan1 aLai, Yuekun0 tChemical communications.g2011 Feb. 14, v. 47, no. 9 p.2598-2600dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c0cc04407e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01803naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245010100170300001800271520055700289592002800846650001300874650001100887650002100898650002300919650002300942650002300965650001000988650002300998650003601021650001401057650003001071700001501101700001201116700001201128700005201140773012101192856008301313852000901396655001201405IND60649692720221120113414.0190705e20190625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064969272DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.9b018232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFang, Shuaishuai10aAsymmetric Synthesis of C2-Quaternary Indolin-3-ones Enabled by N-Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis  ap. 5211-5214.  aAn N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC)-catalyzed formal [4 + 2] annulation of 2-aryl-3H-indol-3-ones with α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acids bearing γ-H was developed via an in situ activation strategy.

One way to achieve this is by including add-ons in the food medium. This approach is commonly followed in culturing red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) which is used as a model insect for a variety of laboratory studies. Commonly yeast is used as a food admixture for escalating beetle production and promoting oviposition. In this study, we aim to evaluate some alternates for yeast, i.e. agar-agar and folic acid at three levels (3.33 %, 6.66%and 10 %) for enhancing laboratory culturing of T. castaneum. The results demonstrated that highest adult production was achieved by adding yeast at the rate of 6.66%(279±23.24) to the food medium while agar-agar and folic acid produced more adults albeit with prolonged larval duration of about 5 days as compared to yeast when ad-mixed at rates of 10%(196.6±21.52) and 3.33%(164.8±3.51). The experiment confirms yeast as a best add-on for enhancing the T. castaneum population but agar-agar and folic acid could be used as substitute when the cultures are required to be maintained vitally without fast developments, for maintaining master cultures in the laboratories.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTribolium castaneum 3aadults 3afolic acid 3ainsects 3alarval development 3alife history 3aoviposition 3ayeasts 0aTribolium castaneum 0ayeast 0aagar-agar 0afolic acid1 aSaeed, Q.1 aRahman, S.1 aQayyum, M.F.0 tAfrican entomology.g2017 Mar., v. 25, no. 1 p.37-41dEntomological Society of Southern AfricawJournal:jnl50015x1021-35897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4001/003.025.00373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03656naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245016600166500001900332520208700351592002802438650002202466650002502488650001702513650001002530650001102540650001602551650001602567650001102583650002002594650001602614650001202630650001202642650001902654650001202673650002002685653001802705653000802723653002502731653002302756653002102779653001702800700005502817700001602872700005802888773010902946856008603055852000903141655001203150IND60716154320221121044436.0210121e20210205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071615432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2020.1098042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLara, O.A.10aEffect of a photoselective filter on the yield and postharvest quality of 'Viroflay' baby spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) leaves cultivated in a hydroponic system  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aConsumers are demanding foods with high sensory and nutritional quality including a higher content of compounds that help maintain good health. Given this scenario, new technologies are emerging to produce fresh salads that have the characteristics currently in demand. Shade nettings or photoselective filters on fruit and vegetable crops are a technology that provides protection, modifies the light spectrum resulting in a higher accumulation of antioxidant compounds, making them more desirable to consumers. The objective of this study was to compare the effect of shade netting on the fresh quality parameters of baby leaf spinach grown in a hydroponic system at harvest and after a period of 10 days at 4 °C. By using different shade netting colors, the average photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) that reaches the plants was modified during the growing period of baby leaf spinach (red: 118.35 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹; blue:117.96 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹; gray: 63.18 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹ and control without shade nettings: 278.12 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹). At harvest, baby leaf spinach grown under the red shade netting reached the highest yield. However, with the blue filter, leaves showed a value of 9.3 % dry weight, significantly higher than the values from red and gray filters with values of 7.3 and 6.3 %, respectively. The phenolic compound contents reached significantly higher values of 485.5 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE) per 100 g⁻¹ FW for the baby leaf spinach grown under the red filter compared to the blue, gray and control filters with values of 472.5; 387.6 and 316.5 mg GAE per 100 g⁻¹ FW, respectively. The antioxidant capacity was significantly higher under the red filter. The sensory quality parameters indicated that spinach grown under color filters did not show off-flavors and maintained its turgidity and appearance at harvest. In the postharvest period, baby leaf spinach grown under red filter maintained the highest total phenol content and antioxidant activity after 10 days at 4 °C with similar appearance and turgidity as the control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSpinacia oleracea 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acolor 3afruits 3agallic acid 3ahydroponics 3aleaves 3anutritive value 3aoff flavors 3aphenols 3aphotons 3aphotosynthesis 3aspinach 3astorage quality 0aShade netting 0aPAR 0aAntioxidant capacity 0aPhenolic compounds 0aSensory analysis 0aCold storage1 aAmorós, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5817-28981 aTapia, M.L.1 aEscalona, V.H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8651-80190 tScientia horticulturae.g2021 Feb. 05, v. 277 p.109804-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2020.1098043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03361naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001400145245016700159506002800326520183600354592002802190506003702218650001102255650001402266650002102280650001502301650001902316650001702335650003002352650001202382650001702394650002302411650002602434650002602460650001202486650001002498650002502508650002302533651001402556653001702570653003402587653002202621653001902643700002402662773009202686856008002778852000902858655001202867IND60764516120221215143555.0211121e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076451612DNAL7 a10.13057/biodiv/d2008212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSudrajat,14aThe contribution of forest remnants within industrial area to threatened mammal conservation: A case study in liquefied natural gas industry in Bontang, Indonesia  aResource is Open Access  aSudrajat, Putro MD. 2019. The contribution of forest remnants within industrial area to endemic and threatened mammal conservation: A case study in liquefied natural gas industry in Bontang, East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 20: 2257-2265. Tropical forests harbor high biodiversity, while natural protected area is one of the approaches for biodiversity conservation. However, the conversion of natural forests for various purposes has caused forest fragmentation. A novel strategy of conservation is proposed in the form of protected area within industrial estate as the contribution of industrial company in biodiversity conservation. The purpose of this study is to document the endemic and threatened species of mammals existing at two forest fragments with extent of 15 ha and 7.4 ha in a natural gas refinery industry area in Bontang, East Kalimantan and their potential as biodiversity conservation areas. Mammals were monitored at the two forest fragments through direct surveys, trace identification, mist nets, and camera traps. The results of the study show that according to IUCN Red List there were 23 mammal species (belonging to 18 genera, 15 families and six orders) of conservation concern found within the forest fragments including one species is under Critically Endangered, two are Endangered, four are Vulnerable, ten are Least Concern, one is Near Threatened and three are Not Evaluated. Four of those species are considered as endemic, namely Bornean orangutan, Pongo pygmaeus morio, Müller’s gibbon, Hylobates muelleri, Proboscis monkey, Nasalis larvatus and East Bornean slow loris, Nycticebus menagensis. These findings suggest that forest fragments located in the environment of industrial estate can be considered as important conservation strategy if they are well preserved and maintained.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBorneo 3aHylobates 3aNasalis larvatus 3aNycticebus 3aPongo pygmaeus 3abiodiversity 3abiodiversity conservation 3acameras 3acase studies 3aconservation areas 3ahabitat fragmentation 3aliquefied natural gas 3amammals 3amists 3aoil and gas industry 3athreatened species 3aIndonesia 0aconservation 0aendemic and theatened mammals 0aindustrial estate 0aremnant forest1 aPUTRO, MINTORO DWI 0 tBiodiversitas.g2019 July, v. 20, no. 8dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.13057/biodiv/d2008213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01695naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245007900165300001600244520071500260592002800975650000801003650002901011650002001040650001101060650002201071650001101093650001501104650002301119700001901142700001301161773008901174856008501263852000901348655001201357IND60098365320221119223330.0141104e20120323xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009836532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.febslet.2012.02.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Wei10aPrediction of replication origins by calculating DNA structural properties  ap. 934-938.  aIn this study, we introduced two DNA structural characteristics, namely, bendability and hydroxyl radical cleavage intensity to analyze origin of replication (ORI) in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome. We found that both DNA bendability and cleavage intensity in core replication regions were significantly lower than in the linker regions. By using these two DNA structural characteristics, we developed a computational model for ORI prediction and evaluated the model in a benchmark dataset. The predictive performance of the jackknife cross-validation indicates that DNA bendability and cleavage intensity have the ability to describe core replication regions and our model is effective in ORI prediction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3adata collection 3agenome 3ahydroxyl radicals 3amodels 3aprediction 3areplication origin1 aFeng, Pengmian1 aLin, Hao0 tFEBS letters.g2012 Mar. 23, v. 586, no. 6 p.934-938dElsevier B.V.x0014-57937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2012.02.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03014naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010600167300001600273520185800289592002802147650001302175650002202188650002002210650001102230650001702241650002202258650001902280650002502299650001402324650002602338650001802364650002302382700002102405700002002426773009202446856008102538852000902619655001202628IND60121686920221119084747.0150318e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012168692DNAL7 a10.1007/s00248-014-0502-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKerepesi, Csaba10aVisual Analysis of the Quantitative Composition of Metagenomic Communities: the AmphoraVizu Webserver  ap. 695-697.  aLow-cost DNA sequencing methods have given rise to an enormous development of metagenomics in the past few years. One basic— and difficult—task is the phylogenetic annotation of the metagenomic samples studied. The difficulty comes from the fact that the typical environmental sample contains hundreds of unknown and still uncharacterized microorganisms. There are several possible methods to assign at least partial phylogenetic information to these uncharacterized data. Originally, the 16S ribosomal RNA was used as phylogenetic marker, then genome sequence alignments and similarity measures between the unknown genome and the reference genomes were applied (e.g., in the MEGAN software), and more recently, phylogeny–based methods applying suitable sets of marker genes were suggested (AMPHORA, AMPHORA2, and the webserver implementation AmphoraNet). Here, we present a visual analysis tool that is capable of demonstrating the quantitative relations gained from the output of the AMPHORA2 program or the easy–to–use AmphoraNet webserver. Our web-based tool, the AmphoraVizu webserver, makes the phylogenetic distribution of the metagenomic sample clearly visible by using the native output format of AMPHORA2 or AmphoraNet. The user may set the phylogenetic resolution (i.e., superkingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species) along with the chart type and will receive the distribution data detailed for all relevant marker genes in the sample.

These populations, presumably harboring unique gene complexes, are particularly interesting in the context of climate change. Pinus brutia Ten. is widespread in the eastern Mediterranean Basin and in Cyprus in particular it is the most common tree species. This study evaluated genetic patterns and morphoanatomical local adaptation along the species geographical distribution and altitudinal range in Cyprus. Analysis showed that the Cyprus population of P. brutia is a peripheral population with high genetic diversity, comprised of different subpopulations. Evidence suggests the presence of ongoing dynamic evolutionary processes among the different subpopulations, while the most relic and isolated subpopulations exhibited a decreased genetic diversity compared to the most compact subpopulations in the central area of the island. These results could be the consequence of the small size and prolonged isolation of the former. Comparing populations along an altitude gradient, higher genetic diversity was detected at the middle level. The phenotypic plasticity observed is particularly important for the adaptive potential of P. brutia in an island environment, since it allows rapid change in local environmental conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus brutia 3aaltitude 3aclimate change 3aforest trees 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ageographical distribution 3aphenotypic plasticity 3aCyprus 3aMediterranean region1 aAravanopoulos, Filippos  (Phil) A.1 aChristou, Andreas  K.0 tForests.g2018 Aug. 24, v. 9, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f90905143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03371naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245013900163300001600302506002800318520199100346592002802337506003702365650001002402650001402412650001002426650002202436650001502458650002402473650002002497650001502517650002602532650001202558650000902570650002202579650001302601651001402614700002002628700001002648700001602658700001602674700002002690773010202710856008002812852000902892655001202901IND60764514220221207093906.0211116e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076451422DNAL7 a10.13057/biodiv/d2002222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPRATIWI, RINI10aSpecies diversity and community composition of mosquitoes in a filariasis endemic area in Banyuasin District, South Sumatra, Indonesia  ap. 453-462.  aResource is Open Access  aPratiwi R, Anwar C, Salni, Hermansyah, Novrikasari, Ghiffari A, Putra R, Huda A. 2019. Species diversity and community composition of mosquitoes in a filariasis endemic area in Banyuasin District, South Sumatra, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 20: 453-462. Mosquitoes are well known as the most medically important arthropod vectors which should be monitored and evaluated because of their potential to transmit diseases. One step in monitoring and evaluation could be conducted by assessing the presence of prevalent mosquito’s vectors including their species diversity and composition. The present study has successfully recorded the diversity and community composition of mosquitoes in two villages in Banyuasin District, South Sumatra Province, Indonesia. The research was conducted for four months from December 2016 to March 2017 by collecting mosquitoes using Indoor and Outdoor Human Landing Collection method (HLC). The result shows that there were 8239 mosquitoes collected consisting of 12 genera and 38 species. Mansonia is found as the most dominant genus in Sedang Village, while in Muara Sugih Village, Culex is the most dominant. Assessment on species diversity showed that Sedang Village haes higher diversity compared to Muara Sugih Village. Further analysis indicates that environmental characteristics and presence of water plant play important role in the diversity, abundance, and dominance of mosquitoes. Waterlogged area covered with Pistia stratiotes in Sedang Village likely facilitate the breeding of Mansonia spp while extensive rice field in Muara Sugih Village may enable the high numbers of Culex spp. Anopheles spp. and Aedes spp. mosquitoes. The findings of this study suggest the rationale for the high cases of filariasis in Banyuasin District. Future research should be directed to reveal mosquitoes’ dispersal pattern and its potential as disease vector, the risk of transmitted disease, and further prevention to reduce the number of filariasis cases.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAedes 3aAnopheles 3aCulex 3aPistia stratiotes 3aarthropods 3acommunity structure 3adisease vectors 3afilariasis 3ahuman-landing catches 3apaddies 3arisk 3aspecies diversity 3avillages 3aIndonesia1 aAnwar, Chairil,1 aSALNI1 aHermansyah,1 aNOVRIKASARI1 aGHIFFARI, AHMAD0 tBiodiversitas.g2019 Feb., v. 20, no. 2 p.453-462dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.13057/biodiv/d2002223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03027naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011100167300001400278500001500292520166000307592002801967650002701995650001102022650001902033650001102052650001102063650003002074650003002104650003502134650003002169650001302199650001502212650002202227650001002249653001602259653001602275700002102291700001902312700001602331700002702347700001702374773010902391856004802500852000902548655001202557IND50067222720221120060123.0131105e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006722272DNAL7 a10.1007/s11032-013-9852-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerovic, Jelena12aA versatile fluorescence-based multiplexing assay for CAPS genotyping on capillary electrophoresis systems  ap. 61-69.  a2019-12-06  aRecent advances in next-generation sequencing techniques and the development of genomics resources for crop plants with large genomes allow the detection of a large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and their use in a high-throughput manner. However, such large numbers of SNPs are on the one hand not needed in some plant breeding projects and on the other hand not affordable in some cases, raising the need for fast and low-cost innovative techniques for marker detection. In marker selection in plant breeding programs, cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) markers still play a significant role as a complement to other high-throughput methods for SNP genotyping. New methods focusing on the acceleration of CAPS-based genotyping are therefore highly desirable. The combination of the classical CAPS method and a M13-tailed primer multiplexing assay was used to develop an agarose-gel-free protocol for the analysis of SNPs via restriction enzyme digestion. PCR products were fluorescence-labeled with a universal M13 primer and subsequently digested with the appropriate restriction endonuclease. After mixing differently labeled products, they were detected in a capillary electrophoresis system. This method allowed the cost-effective genotyping of several SNPs in barley in a multiplexed manner at an overall low cost in a short period of time. This new method was efficiently combined with the simultaneous detection of simple sequence repeats in the same electrophoresis run, resulting in a procedure well suited for marker-based selection procedures, genotyping of mapping populations and the assay of genetic diversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3amicrosatellite repeats 3abarley 3aplant breeding 3amixing 3agenome 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arestriction endonucleases 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3acapillary electrophoresis 3agenomics 3agenotyping 3agenetic variation 3acrops 0amethodology 0anew methods1 aSilvar, Cristina1 aKoenig, Janine1 aStein, Nils1 aPerović, Dragan-Bobi,1 aOrdon, Frank0 tMolecular breeding.g2013 June, v. 32, no. 1 p.61-69dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:jnl53942x1380-37437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11032-013-9852-x  aDNAL 7aarticle02445naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011500166300001600281520115700297592002801454650001801482650001601500650001001516650001501526650001101541650001601552650002201568650001401590650001101604650001701615650001301632650000901645650001101654650001901665650001201684650001101696650001101707700002401718700001601742700002301758773011501781856008201896852000901978655001201987IND60570798620221117235112.0191031e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057079862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pbi.2017.06.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaroussi, Shai10aNutrient scavenging and energy management: acclimation responses in nitrogen and sulfur deprived Chlamydomonas  ap. 114-122.  aPhotosynthetic organisms have evolved to modulate their metabolism to accommodate the highly dynamic light and nutrient conditions in nature. In this review we discuss ways in which the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii acclimates to nitrogen and sulfur deprivation, conditions that would limit the anabolic use of excitation energy because of a markedly reduced capacity for cell growth and division. Major aspects of this acclimation process are stringently regulated and involve scavenging the limited nutrient from internal and external sources, and the redirection of fixed carbon toward energy storage (e.g. starch, oil). However, photosynthetic organisms have also evolved mechanisms to dissipate excess absorbed light energy, and to eliminate potentially dangerous energetic electrons through the reduction of O2 and H+ to H2O; this reduction can occur both through photosynthetic electron transport (e.g. Mehler reaction, chlororespiration) and mitochondrial respiration. Furthermore, algal cells likely exploit other energy management pathways that are currently not linked to nutrient limitation responses or that remain to be identified.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlamydomonas 3aacclimation 3aalgae 3aautotrophs 3acarbon 3acell growth 3aelectron transfer 3aelectrons 3aenergy 3amitochondria 3anitrogen 3aoils 3aoxygen 3aphotosynthesis 3aprotons 3astarch 3asulfur1 aSanz-Luque, Emanuel1 aKim, Rick G1 aGrossman, Arthur R0 tCurrent opinion in plant biology.g2017 Oct., v. 39 p.114-122dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl58157x1369-52667nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pbi.2017.06.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03808naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245014400168300001600312520247000328592002802798650001302826650002602839650002502865650001902890650002302909650001102932650002902943650002602972650001502998650001903013650001103032650002103043650001503064650002803079700002103107700001803128700002203146700002403168773009203192856008103284852000903365655001203374IND60121685320221119084828.0150318e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012168532DNAL7 a10.1007/s00248-014-0512-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmado, André M.10aDisentangling the Interactions Between Photochemical and Bacterial Degradation of Dissolved Organic Matter: Amino Acids Play a Central Role  ap. 554-566.  aPhotochemical and bacterial degradation are important pathways to carbon mineralization and can be coupled in dissolved organic matter (DOM) decomposition. However, details of several mechanisms of the coupled photochemical and biological processing of DOM remain too poorly understood to achieve accurate predictions of the impact of these processes on DOM fate and reactivity. The aim of this study was to evaluate how photochemical degradation of amino acids affects bacterial metabolism and whether or not photochemical degradation of DOM competes for amino acids with biological processes. We examined the interactions between photochemical and bacterial degradation dynamics using a mixture of 18 amino acids and examined their dynamics and turnover rates within a larger pool of allochthonous or autochthonous DOM. We observed that photochemical exposure of DOM containing amino acids led to delayed biomass production (even though the final biomass did not differ), most likely due to a need for upregulation of biosynthetic pathways for amino acids that were damaged by photochemically produced reactive oxygen species (ROS). This response was most pronounced in bacterial communities where the abundance of photosensitive amino acids was highest (amended treatments and autochthonous DOM) and least pronounced when the abundance of these amino acids was low (unamended and allochthonous DOM), likely because these bacteria already had these biosynthetic pathways functioning. We observed both a cost and benefit associated with photochemical exposure of DOM. We observed a cost associated with photochemically produced ROS that partially degrade key amino acids and a benefit associated with an increase in the availability of other compounds in the DOM. Bacteria growing on DOM sources that are low in labile amino acids, such as those in terrestrially influenced environments, experience more of the benefits associated with photochemical exposure, whereas bacteria growing in more amino acid-rich environments, such as eutrophic and less terrestrially influenced waters, experience a higher cost due to the increased necessity of salvage pathways for these essential amino acids. Finally, we propose a conceptual model whereby the effects of DOM photochemical degradation on microbial metabolism result from the balance between two mechanisms: One is dependent on the DOM sources, and the other is dependent on the DOM concentration in natural systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3abiochemical pathways 3abiodegradation 3abiomass production 3acarbon 3adissolved organic matter 3aessential amino acids 3ametabolism 3amineralization 3amodels 3aphotosensitivity 3aprediction 3areactive oxygen species1 aCotner, James B.1 aCory, Rose M.1 aEdhlund, Betsy L.1 aMcNeill, Kristopher0 tMicrobial ecology.g2015 Apr., v. 69, no. 3 p.554-566dSpringer-Verlagx0095-36287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-014-0512-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02802naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245007900172300001600251520172400267592002801991650001902019650001902038650001802057650002402075650002402099650002302123650002602146650001402172650002202186650001502208650002302223650001502246651001302261773009002274856005502364852000902419655001202428IND4468173920221119161944.0120525e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446817392DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1600-0706.2011.19706.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSiefert, Andrew10aSpatial patterns of functional divergence in old‐field plant communities  ap. 907-914.  aSpatial patterns of functional traits have received little attention in community ecology but have the potential to provide insights into the processes that structure communities. In this study, I used semivariograms to describe spatial patterns of functional traits and evaluate processes (niche differentiation, environmental filtering, and dispersal limitation) driving functional divergence in old‐field plant communities. I collected spatially explicit data on key plant functional traits (vegetative height, specific leaf area [SLA], and leaf dry matter content [LDMC]) and environmental variables (soil depth and soil moisture) across a range of spatial scales (< 1–1500 m) in old fields in central New York. All traits displayed nonrandom spatial patterns consistent with the environmental filtering hypothesis, but patterns differed among traits. Height had strong spatial dependence at scales congruent with spatial heterogeneity of soil depth, indicating that soil depth acted as a spatial template for divergence in height. SLA and LDMC had much weaker spatial dependence, with > 90% of total divergence occurring within 1‐m2 plots, demonstrating that high levels of functional divergence may occur at very fine spatial scales. Spatial patterns of intraspecific functional divergence differed among four common species (Solidago canadensis, Bromus inermis, Poa pratensis and Galium mollugo), indicating that species differed in their trait responses to environmental variation. This study provides novel descriptions of spatial patterns of functional traits in plant communities and demonstrates how these patterns can help understand the processes driving functional divergence across spatial scales.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBromus inermis 3aGalium mollugo 3aPoa pratensis 3aSolidago canadensis 3acommunity structure 3adry matter content 3aenvironmental factors 3aleaf area 3aplant communities 3asoil depth 3asoil heterogeneity 3asoil water 3aNew York0 tOikos.g2012 June, v. 121, no. 6 p.907-914dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0030-12997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0706.2011.19706.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02960naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245016900166300001600335520193700351592002802288653003002316653002602346653004502372653002802417700001602445700001502461700001802476773007302494856008202567852000902649655001202658IND60547630620221118222701.0161027s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054763062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ieri.2013.11.1042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Hongyi12aA Conversion of Sample Medium from Water to Acetonitrile by Subzero Temperature Liquid-liquid Extraction for Acetonitrile-salt Stacking in Capillary Electrophoresis  ap. 277-283.  aIn capillary electrophoresis (CE) analysis, acetonitrile-salt stacking (ASS) is an efficient way for enhancing the response signal of the analyte which is dissolved in the aqueous medium of acetonitrile and NaCl. The higher volume fraction of acetonitrile (60 to 80%) in the sample medium is strictly demanded if ASS is conducted. Consequently, it is necessary to develop a convenient method for converting the water-based sample to the acetonitrile-based sample without any dilution of the analyte during the sample preparation procedure. Acetonitrile subzero temperature liquid-liquid extraction (ASTLLE) is the best choice for this purpose. ASTLLE is based on the unique property of acetonitrile that a phase separation can occur if the homogenous mixture solution of acetonitrile and water is kept at a subzero temperature for a short period. The upper layer is the acetonitrile-rich phase, and the lower layer is the water phase. Accompanying the phase separation, the analytes of relatively weak polarity such as mononitrophenol isomers (at acidic condition) can be transferred to acetonitrile-rich phase. The volume fraction of acetonitrile in the formed acetonitrile-rich phase was estimated on the basis of its viscosity which was determined by CE instrument. It was confirmed that the volume fraction of acetonitrile in the formed acetonitrile-rich phase was in the range of 70 – 80% (v/v), indicating that the sample processed by ASTLLE met the ASS demand for high volume fraction of acetonitrile. The combination of ASTLLE and ASS was successfully applied to the analysis of mononitrophenol isomers in acidic aqueous solution. The precisions (RSD) of the migration time and peak area for six replicate runs of the three mononitrophenol isomers were in the range of 1.1∼1.3% and 5.5∼8.5% respectively. The lowest detection limit of mononitrophenol isomers was 1×10-4μg-mL-1.The recovery ranged from 96.1 to 113.4%  aPublisher supplied data 0acapillary electrophoresis 0aacetonitrile stacking 0alow temperature liquid-liquid extraction 0amononitrophenol isomers1 aZhao, Jieyu1 aWu, Zhibin1 aWang, Zichuan0 tIERI Procedia.g2013, v. 5 p.277-283dElsevier B.V.x2212-66787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ieri.2013.11.1043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01958naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245010400171300001200275520081300287592002801100650003901128650002401167650002001191650003201211650001401243650001401257650001401271650001401285700002701299700002101326700006301347773010701410856008201517852000901599655001201608IND60570798820221117235217.0180904e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057079882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mib.2016.08.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aByndloss, Mariana X10aHow bacterial pathogens use type III and type IV secretion systems to facilitate their transmission  ap. 1-7.  aWork on type III or type IV secretion systems (T3SSs or T4SSs) is often focused on elucidating how these sophisticated bacterial virulence factors manipulate host cell physiology to cause disease. But to fully understand their role in pathogen biology, it is important to consider whether the morbidity or mortality they trigger is somehow linked to enhancing communicability of the microbe. Recent work on Salmonella enterica and Brucella abortus provide captivating examples of how manipulation of host cells with T3SSs or T4SSs instigates distant downstream consequences that promote spread of the pathogen. It is clear from these examples that T3SSs and T4SSs are ultimately transmission factors placed under selection by an incredibly complex series of events unfolding during host pathogen interaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrucella melitensis biovar Abortus 3aSalmonella enterica 3acell physiology 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3amorbidity 3amortality 3apathogens 3avirulence1 aRivera-Chávez, Fabian1 aTsolis, Renée M1 aBäumler, Andreas J1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9152-78090 tCurrent opinion in microbiology.g2017 Feb., v. 35 p.1-7dElsevier LtdwJournal:12432x1369-52747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2016.08.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02017naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245013500170300001800305520077700323592002801100650001401128650002301142650001101165650001501176650001401191653001601205653002701221653001801248653002301266653002501289700002001314700002001334700001801354700002101372700002201393700002101415773008101436856008101517852000901598655001201607IND60551396120221120124450.0161018e20141007xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055139612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2014.06.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavies, Stephen G.10aAsymmetric syntheses of the methyl glycosides of 2-deoxy-2-aminohexoses: d-allosamine, d-mannosamine, d-idosamine and d-talosamine  ap. 7106-7119.  aA range of the methyl glycosides of 2-deoxy-2-aminohexoses, comprising d-allosamine, d-mannosamine, d-idosamine and d-talosamine, were prepared from the corresponding d-aldopentoses via a seven step synthetic sequence. The doubly diastereoselective conjugate addition of the requisite antipode of lithium N-benzyl-N-(α-methylbenzyl)amide and in situ enolate oxidation with the requisite antipode of camphorsulfonyloxaziridine (CSO) was used as the key, stereodefining step. Sequential reduction of the resultant α-hydroxy-β-amino esters and oxidative cleavage of the C(1)–C(2) diol unit furnished the corresponding α-amino aldehydes.

In order to search for effective control agent, the essential oil of sweet orange [Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck] was evaluated for its insecticidal activity against the larvae and pupae of housefly using contact toxicity and fumigation bioassays. In the contact toxicity assay, lethal concentration, LC₅₀ of C. sinensis essential oil against housefly larvae, varied between 3.93 and 0.71 μl/cm² for different observation days, while lethal time, LT₅₀, varied between 5.8 to 2.3 days. Mortality of larvae were significant with different concentrations (F = 2.79, df = 4, P < 0.05) and time (F = 6.69, df = 3, P < 0.01). In fumigant assay for housefly larvae, LC₅₀ of 71.2 and 52.6 μl/l was obtained in 24 and 48 h, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy of oil treated larvae revealed extreme dehydration and surface distortion while control larvae were free from any of the above symptoms and presented smooth surface, conforming effect of essential oil on housefly larvae. Percentage inhibition rate of oil against housefly pupae was 27.3–72.7% for contact toxicity and 46.4–100% for fumigation assay. Compositional analysis of C. sinensis essential oil using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS) revealed D-limonene (73.24%), α-pinene (5.86%) and myrcene (4.45%) as major components whereas its vapour profile (solid-phase micro extraction-GC/MS) was dominated by D-limonene at 92.57%. Significant activity of C. sinensis essential oil against larvae and pupae of housefly, pave the way for its use as eco-friendly housefly control measure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus sinensis 3aMusca domestica 3aMyrtaceae 3abioassays 3aessential oils 3aetiological agents 3afumigants 3afumigation 3agas chromatography 3ainsecticidal properties 3alarvae 3alethal concentration 50 3amass spectrometry 3amortality 3aoils 3aoranges 3apupae 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atoxicity 3avapors1 aMishra, Sapna1 aMalik, Anushree1 aSatya, Santosh0 tParasitology research.g2012 May, v. 110, no. 5 p.1929-1936dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-011-2719-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02261naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245007500164300001400239520063800253592002800891650002300919650002600942650001500968650001200983650002000995650002801015650002401043650001801067650001001085650004801095650002401143650001701167650002701184653000701211653000801218653000701226653000801233653000801241653000701249653000901256653002401265653001201289653002301301653002701324700001701351700001801368700001701386700001401403700001701417700001801434700001901452773010601471856008501577852000901662655001201671IND60628446420221121043114.0190319e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062844642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2018.12.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Wuren14aThe acaricidal activity and mechanism of eugenol on Psoroptes cuniculi  ap. 56-62.  aIn this study, the acaricidal effect of eugenol was measured and its mechanism of action investigated.

Containing many mycelia, it has a positive effect on animal health but its high fibre content may be detrimental to growth. In order to reduce the environmental problems caused by mushroom waste compost and possibly increase the use of agriculture byproducts, this study aimed to investigate the effects of replacing broiler feed with Pennisetum purpureum schum compost (PWMC) and its effect on meat quality and fat metabolism. Totally 240 broilers were used and allocated to 4 different treatments, including control group, 5% PWMC, Saccharomyces cerevisiae fermented PWMC (FPW) and Pennisetum purpureum schum (PP). Each treatment had 3 replicates and 20 broilers in a pen. The results show that replacing 5% broiler feed with PWMC, FPW and PP decreased the depth of subcutaneous fat in broilers from 3.6 to 2.6, 2.7 and 2.8 mm, respectively (p = .0132). Furthermore, adipolysis mRNA expression increased in all treatment groups, slightly increasing breast and thigh meat accumulation. Overall, mushroom waste compost at 5% in broiler diets could improve the body composition of broilers and adipolysis-related mRNA expression.HighlightsHigh-fibre agricultural by-products can replace part of the broiler diet without affecting its growth performance. High-fibre agricultural by-products can decrease broiler subcutaneous fat accumulation. High-fibre agricultural by-products can enhance fat metabolism-related mRNA expression.  aThe authors thank the Ministry of Science and Technology [MOST 109-2313-B-005-008-MY3 and 109-2321-B-005-016-] and the iEGG and Animal Biotechnology Center from The Feature Areas Research Center Program within the framework of the Higher Education Sprout Project by the Ministry of Education (MOE) in Taiwan to Prof. Tzu-Tai Lee.  aPublisher supplied data  a109-2313-B-005-008-MY3a109-2321-B-005-016- 3aCenchrus purpureus 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aanimal health 3abreasts 3acomposts 3adiet 3afiber content 3agene expression 3agrowth performance 3alipid metabolism 3ameat 3ameat quality 3amushrooms 3amycelium 3anutrient uptake 3asubcutaneous fat 0aMushroom waste 0afermentation 0aagricultural by-products 0aadipose metabolism1 aShih, Hsin Der1 aShy, Yi Ming1 aChang, Sheng Chang1 aLee, Tzu Tai0 tItalian journal of animal science.g2020 Dec. 14, v. 19, no. 1 p.940-950dTaylor & FranciswJournal:11638x1828-051X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1828051X.2020.18088613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02773naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100001700161245011400178300001600292500000900308520152000317592002801837650001301865650001701878650002201895650004501917650002001962650001401982650002101996650003302017700001502050700001502065700001502080700001802095700001602113700001902129773012002148852000902268856009802277655001202375IND2054011920221120160610.0191122e199605  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205401192DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1996.0011183X003600030043x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDubreuil, P.10aOrganization of RFLP Diversity among Inbred Lines of Maize Representing the Most Significant Heterotic Groups  ap. 790-799.  aepub  aOne hundred-sixteen inbred lines of maize (Zea mays L.) from significant heterotic groups (i.e., European flint, Lancaster Sure Crop, Minnesota 13, and Reid Yellow Dent) and miscellaneous origins were assayed for restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). Our goals were to investigate (i) genetic variability and its structure among and within heterotic groups and (ii) the use of RFLP markers to assign miscellaneous lines to heterotic groups by means of probes selected for locus specificity, clear patterns, and reproducibility. Among the 63 single copy probe-enzyme combinations used, 372 variants were scored with a mean of 5.9 variants per combination. Principal component and cluster analyses performed on lines from established heterotic groups clearly separated flint lines from dent lines. Loci that contributed the most to the genetic differentiation between European flint and northern U.S. dent lines were determined. Within U.S. germplasm, classification showed an association of inbreds that closely matched associations based on pedigree relationships. Correlation between pedigree distance and molecular Rogers' distance was significant (r = 0.77, P < 0.001). Based on these results, classification by molecular distance was convenient (i) for identifying heterotic groups and (ii) for assigning origins to unknown or broadly based inbreds. This information should prove useful for choosing (i) combinations of inbreds to be evaluated in hybrid trials and (ii) parents for breeding programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3ainbred lines 3agenetic variation 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3agenetic markers 3aheterosis 3agenetic distance 3aprincipal component analysis1 aDufour, P.1 aKrejci, E.1 aCausse, M.1 ade Vienne, D.1 aGallais, A.1 aCharcosset, A.0 tCrop science.g1996 May, v. 36, no. 3 p.790-799dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci1996.0011183X003600030043x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01714naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001200149245010700161300001800268520058900286592002800875650001200903650002300915650002300938650002800961650002000989650001601009650001201025700001501037700005401052700005701106773012101163856008301284852000901367655001201376IND60649691820221122060856.0190705e20190618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064969182DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.9b017652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Min10aRhodium-Catalyzed Regiodivergent [3 + 2] and [5 + 2] Cycloadditions of Quinolinium Ylides with Alkynes  ap. 5167-5171.  aRhodium-catalyzed regiodivergent [3 + 2] and [5 + 2] cycloadditions of quinolinium ylides with alkynes are reported, providing highly functionalized five-membered indolizine derivatives and seven-membered 1,4-oxazepine compounds, respectively, in moderate to excellent yields under mild reaction conditions.

While little is known about its cognate cellular role, antibodies against PHF20 are present in sera from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, glioblastoma and childhood medulloblastula. PHF20 comprises two N-terminal Tudor domains, a central C2H2-link zinc finger domain and a C-terminal zinc-binding PHD domain, and is a component of some MLL methyltransferase complexes. Here, we report the crystal structures of the N-terminal Tudor domains of PHF20 and highlight the novel structural features of each domain. We also confirm previous studies suggesting that the second Tudor domain of PHF20 exhibits preference for dimethylated histone substrates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3achildhood 3acrystal structure 3ahepatoma 3ahistones 3ahumans 3apatients 3atranscription factors 3azinc finger motif1 aLi, Zhihong1 aTempel, Wolfram1 aGuo, Yahong1 aBian, Chuanbing1 aLi, Yanjun1 aLam, Robert1 aMin, Jinrong0 tFEBS letters.g2012 Mar. 23, v. 586, no. 6 p.859-865dElsevier B.V.x0014-57937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2012.02.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03467naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003200150245010800182300001300290520175100303592002802054650001502082650001702097650002102114650002002135650001802155650001602173650001602189650000902205650001702214650000902231650002002240650001002260650001102270650001402281650001402295650001302309650002702322653001602349653003102365653001302396653001702409653001502426653001602441700003102457700002302488700002202511700002402533700001902557700002002576700002102596700006102617773010502678856008502783852000902868655001202877IND60628446620221121043108.0190319e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062844662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2018.12.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTermatzidou, Sofia-Afroditi10aAnthelmintic activity of injectable eprinomectin (eprecis® 20 mg/mL) in naturally infected dairy sheep  ap. 7-11.  aThe anthelmintic activity of an injectable eprinomectin formulation (Eprecis® 20 mg/mL) was evaluated in 150 naturally infected dairy sheep raised in 3 semi-intensive flocks. All ewes were at the same stage of lactation and grazed on natural pastures. Ewes did not receive any anthelmintic treatment for at least 4 months prior to the experiment. In each flock, 50 ewes were selected and randomly allocated to control (C) or treatment (T) groups (n = 25 per group). Groups were balanced according to the ewes’ bodyweight (BW) and fecal egg count (FEC) measured seven days before eprinomectin administration (day-7). On study day 0, ewes in group T, received 0.2 mg/kg BW of eprinomectin subcutaneously (Eprecis® 20 mg/mL, Ceva). Ewes in group C were left untreated. Fecal samples were collected on day 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28 post-treatment to assess FEC and for coprocultures. Ewes were weighed on day 0 and 28. Overall and within-flock efficacy of eprinomectin was calculated throughout the experimental period. No local or general adverse reaction after injection was observed. The most prevalent parasite genera were Teladorsagia, Haemonchus and Trichostrongylus. Following treatment, the overall mean FEC of C and T groups differed significantly (P < 0.001). Overall and within-flock efficacy of eprinomectin was 99.8%–100.0% and 99.7%–100.0%, respectively. Contrary to C group, ewes treated with injectable eprinomectin increased their BW during the study (−0.5 kg vs. + 1.5 kg, P < 0.001). In this field study, a single subcutaneous injection of eprinomectin to dairy sheep, at 0.2 mg/kg BW, resulted in excellent curative anthelmintic activity; egg counts remain low for at least 28 days after treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaemonchus 3aTeladorsagia 3aTrichostrongylus 3aadverse effects 3aanthelmintics 3abody weight 3adairy sheep 3aeggs 3aeprinomectin 3aewes 3afecal egg count 3afeces 3aflocks 3alactation 3aparasites 3apastures 3asubcutaneous injection 0aDairy sheep 0aGastrointestinal nematodes 0aEfficacy 0aEprinomectin 0aInjectable 0aFormulation1 aArsenopoulos, Konstantinos1 aSiachos, Nektarios1 aKazana, Panagiota1 aPapadopoulos, Elias1 aAchard, Damien1 aKarembe, Hamadi1 aBramis, Georgios1 aArsenos, Georgios1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3224-51280 tVeterinary parasitology.g2019 Feb., v. 266 p.7-11dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2018.12.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01936naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009800166300001400264520095800278592002801236650001701264650002401281650001001305650002601315650001501341650001901356650002501375700002201400773010901422856008201531852000901613655001201622IND60570799120221117235045.0180904e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057079912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mib.2016.11.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdair, Karen L10aMaking a microbiome: the many determinants of host-associated microbial community composition  ap. 23-29.  aThe composition of many host-associated microbial communities is characterized by seemingly contradictory features: strong selection for specific taxa by the host, but substantial variability among hosts and over time within one host. Recent advances have revealed that both deterministic and stochastic processes operating across multiple spatial scales shape the composition of host-associated microbial communities. Although most research has focused on deterministic processes within individual hosts, the microbiota within each host is increasingly recognized to contribute to a wider metacommunity maintained by transmission between individual hosts and dispersal between host-associated and free-living microbial communities. By applying a community ecology perspective encompassing the microbial metacommunity, the many determinants of host-associated microbial community composition can be identified, guiding the directions of future research.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3acommunity structure 3ahosts 3amicrobial communities 3amicrobiome 3amicroorganisms 3astochastic processes1 aDouglas, Angela E0 tCurrent opinion in microbiology.g2017 Feb., v. 35 p.23-29dElsevier LtdwJournal:12432x1369-52747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2016.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02930naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100002400161245006700185300001600252500000900268520180300277592002802080650002102108650001702129650002102146650001902167650002802186650001702214650001302231650001202244650001702256650002302273650002102296651001202317773012002329852000902449856009802458655001202556IND2054004720221122143729.0191122e199605  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205400472DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1996.0011183X003600030029x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcCarty, Lambert B.10aSelective Control of Common Bermudagrass in St. Augustinegrass  ap. 694-698.  aepub  aCommon bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pens.] is the most troublesome weed in commercially produced St. Augustinegrass (Stenotaphrum secundatum (Walter) Kuntze] sod due to inadequate selective control methods. Currently available herbicides are nonselective and require multiple applications, which delays replanting, and cause significant St. Augustinegrass injury. Research was conducted to evaluate several herbicides for selective control of common bermudagrass in ‘Floratam’ St. Augustinegrass. Herbicides included ethofumesate [(±)2-ethoxy-2,3-dinydro-3,3-diinethyl-5-benzofuranyl methanesulfonate] and ethofumesate plus either flurprimidol [αa-(1-methylethyl)-α-[4-trifluourmethoxyy)phenyl]-5-pyrimidinemethanol], atrazine [6-chloro-N-ethyl-N′-(1-methylethyl)-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine], or siduron [N-(2-methylcyclohexyl)-N-phenylurea]. Excellent (>95%) common bermudagrass control followed sequential applications of ethofumesate plus atrazine applied in March, April, and May. Good control (80–89%) was observed with ethofumesate alone applied the same months. Inconsistent and/or poor control (<70%) of common bermudagrass was obtained with ethofumesate plus either flurprimidol or siduron. Additional treatments made in February and/or in November of the previous year did not increase control. St. Augustinegrass turf quality was unaffected by ethofumesate plus atrazine. Turf quality was reduced 4 to 8 wk after repeat applications of ethofumesate plus siduron. Ethofumesate plus flurprimidol combinations reduced turf quality for 8 to 12 wk. Properly timed ethofumesate plus atrazine applications is the first reported means of selectively controlling common bermudagrass in St. Augustinegrass turf. Contribution from the Florida Agric. Exp.

Quartz, larnite, gehlenite, mayenite, and calcium sulfate were formed during co-combustion. Slight or medium slagging was predicted to occur when slagging tendency was assessed based on the mineral components and fusion temperature of the ash. The SO2 emission peak at the devolatilization stage increased with increasing SMR of MS but only slightly changed with increasing SMR of CS. SO2 emission at the char combustion stage was suppressed due to the sulfur retention effects of sludge ash. NO, HCN, and N2O were the main emission forms of N-containing gases. With increasing SMRs of MS and CS, HCN emissions became increasingly prominent, whereas NO showed only a slight increase and even decreased. In addition, the volatilization percentages (VP) of Cd, Zn, Cr, and Ni decreased. By contrast, the VP of Pb increased when coal was combusted with CS because Pb was considerably influenced by high Cl. The concentrations of Cd, Cr, Ni, Pb, and Zn in the bottom ashes were determined and satisfied China's threshold limit value for landscaping land application or soil amendment.  aPublisher supplied data 3abottom ash 3acadmium 3acalcium sulfate 3achromium 3acoal 3acombustion 3aemissions 3agases 3ahydrogen cyanide 3aland application 3alandscaping 3alead 3anickel 3anitric oxide 3anitrous oxide 3apollutants 3aquartz 3asewage sludge 3asludge ash 3asoil amendments 3asulfur 3asulfur dioxide 3atemperature 3avolatilization 3azinc 3aChina 0aCo-combustion 0aSludge recycling 0aBottom ash 0aSlagging tendency 0aGas pollutants 0aHeavy metals1 aWang, Ruikun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5712-74381 aWu, Junhong1 aYin, Qianqian1 aWang, Chunbo0 tEnergy.g2019 Mar. 15, v. 171 p.809-818dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2019.01.0823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01609naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245012700166300001600293520066900309592002800978653002001006653001301026653003301039653002501072700001301097700001901110700001401129773007301143856008201216852000901298655001201307IND60547631120221119001814.0161027s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054763112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ieri.2013.11.1092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Haiyue10aOptimizing the Extraction of Catechin from Peanut Red Skin Using Response Surface Methodology and its Antioxidant Activity  ap. 312-320.  aCatechin was rich in the peanut red skin.

And the superoxide anion (O2−) inhibition rate of the catechin was 42.50% through the pyrogallol autoxidation - spectrophotometric method which indicated that the catechin had certain antioxidant ability.  aPublisher supplied data 0aPeanut red skin 0aCatechin 0aResponse surface methodology 0aAntioxidant activity1 aLiu, Man1 aHan, Shengting1 aWei, Ying0 tIERI Procedia.g2013, v. 5 p.312-320dElsevier B.V.x2212-66787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ieri.2013.11.1093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02431naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010200169300001800271520119700289592002801486650001601514650002001530650001201550650002201562650001101584650001501595653002501610653002501635653003701660653003001697653003701727653002201764700001901786700002101805700002101826773009201847856008501939852000902024655001202033IND60629146020221120102653.0190320e20190315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062914602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2019.01.0832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Fangfang12aA coulombic efficiency-based model for prognostics and health estimation of lithium-ion batteries  ap. 1173-1182.  aCoulombic efficiency, as an important battery parameter, is highly related to the loss of lithium inventory, which is the dominant aging factor for lithium-ion batteries. In this paper, a semi-empirical model is derived from this relationship to capture the capacity degradation of lithium-ion batteries. The coulombic efficiency-based model effectively captures the convex degradation trend of lithium iron phosphate batteries and presents better fitting performance than the existing square-root-of-time model. To evaluate the proposed model, a battery cycle life experiment was designed, in which the subjects were continuously cycled under a federal urban driving schedule to simulate real-life battery usage. To perform online battery health estimation and prognostics, a particle filtering framework incorporating the proposed model was constructed to update the model parameters regularly with periodically measured data. Remaining useful life of the battery was then predicted by extrapolating the models with renewed parameters. The experimental results indicated that the proposed prognostic method can provide higher prediction accuracy than the existing square-root-of-time model.  aPublisher supplied data 3ainventories 3airon phosphates 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3amodels 3aprediction 0aDegradation modeling 0aCoulombic efficiency 0aLithium iron phosphate batteries 0aLoss of lithium inventory 0aRemaining useful life prediction 0aHealth estimation1 aSong, Xiangbao1 aDong, Guangzhong1 aTsui, Kwok-Leung0 tEnergy.g2019 Mar. 15, v. 171 p.1173-1182dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2019.01.0833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02274naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001500138245005300153520125500206592002801461650001301489650001301502650001401515650001201529650001301541650001101554650001901565650001001584700002501594700001501619700001701634700001401651700001801665700001701683773011901700856007201819852000901891655001201900IND60648865320221116164233.0190701e20180816xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064886532DNAL7 a10.3390/f90805002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ping10aTaylor’s Power Law for Leaf Bilateral Symmetry  aLeaf shape and symmetry is of interest because of the importance of leaves in photosynthesis. Recently, a novel method was proposed to measure the extent of bilateral symmetry in leaves in which a leaf was divided into left and right sides by a straight line through the leaf apex and base, and a number of equidistant strips were drawn perpendicular to the straight line to generate an equivalent number of differences in area between the left and right parts. These areal differences are the basis for a measure of leaf bilateral symmetry, which was then examined to see how well it follows Taylor&rsquo;s power law (TPL) using three classes of plants, namely, 10 geographical populations of Parrotia subaequalis (H.T. Chang) R.M. Hao et H.T. Wei, 10 species of Bambusoideae, and 10 species of Rosaceae. The measure of bilateral symmetry followed TPL for a single species or for a class of closely related species. The estimate of the exponent of TPL for bamboo plants was significantly larger than for the dicotyledonous trees, but its goodness of fit was the best among the three classes of plants. The heterogeneity of light falling on branches and leaves due to above-ground architectural patterns is an important contributor to leaf asymmetry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParrotia 3aRosaceae 3aasymmetry 3abamboos 3abranches 3aleaves 3aphotosynthesis 3atrees1 aRatkowsky, David  A.1 aXiao, Xiao1 aYu, Xiaojing1 aSu, Jialu1 aZhang, Lifang1 aShi, Peijian0 tForests.g2018 Aug. 16, v. 9, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f90805003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03042naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245013500153300001800288500002000306520151800326592002801844650002801872650001901900650003601919650001001955650001701965650001701982650001201999650002302011650002602034650002102060650001102081650003102092650001502123650002202138650002302160650001602183650002502199700005502224700001802279700001602297700001602313773014902329856007302478852000902551655001202560IND60596408520221119190850.0180619e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059640852DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.89002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuan, Wei10aWhey protein isolate with improved film properties through cross‐linking catalyzed by small laccase from Streptomyces coelicolor  ap. 3843-3850.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: The effects of small laccase (SLAC) from Streptomyces coelicolor on the properties of whey protein isolate (WPI) films were studied. RESULTS: WPI was catalyze by SLAC without phenolic acid assistance. Particle size distribution results showed that some complexes with higher relative molecular weight formed in WPI samples treated with SLAC. The content of α‐helixes decreased while those of β‐sheets and random coils increased following SLAC treatment according to circular dichroism results. Fourier transform infrared spectral analysis suggested that some conformational changes occurred in WPI following SLAC treatment. Analysis of WPI films prepared by casting after SLAC treatment indicated that their film properties were all improved, including mechanical properties, solubility, water vapor, oxygen and carbon dioxide barrier properties, film color, light transmission, transparency and thermal properties. Compared with that of the control film, some obvious differences in the morphology of the WPI films were observed following SLAC treatment. This report demonstrates that laccase can directly catalyze protein cross‐linking, which may be useful to improve the performance of protein films. CONCLUSION: In this study, SLAC was applied to WPI edible film during the film‐making process. The results showed that SLAC can catalyze WPI cross‐linking without phenolic acid assistance, and WPI film properties were improved after SLAC treatment. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptomyces coelicolor 3acarbon dioxide 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3acolor 3acrosslinking 3aedible films 3alaccase 3alight transmission 3amechanical properties 3amolecular weight 3aoxygen 3aparticle size distribution 3asolubility 3aspectral analysis 3athermal properties 3awater vapor 3awhey protein isolate1 aZhang, Chong1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7916-51361 aZheng, Meixia1 aLu, Zhaoxin1 aLu, Fengxia0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2018 Aug., v. 98, no. 10 p.3843-3850dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48536x0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.89003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02932naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245011700159300001800276500002000294520143100314592002801745650002601773650002701799650001501826650001401841650002201855650002101877650001601898650001401914650001401928650001501942650001601957650001401973650000701987650003901994650002002033650001602053650001102069650001702080650001002097650001602107650001102123700001802134700001602152700001602168700003102184773010502215856007302320852000902393655001202402IND60585715720221119202248.0171113e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058571572DNAL7 a10.1111/anu.125102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodriguez, Y.E.12aA new approach to fishery waste revalorization to enhance Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) digestion process  ap. 1351-1361.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe main goal of this research was to analyse in vitro compatibility of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) digestive proteinases and enzymes recovered from species comprising fishery waste as Pleoticus muelleri, Artemesia longinaris and Patagonotothen ramsayi. It evaluated the use of exogenous enzymes as feed supplements to increase digestion efficiency in tilapia fingerlings and juveniles (3.5 ± 0.11 g and 11.6 ± 1.5 g, respectively). We successfully have obtained proteinases from fishery waste as source of exogenous enzymes. P. muelleri and A. longinaris enzymes had more activity of acid and alkaline proteinases than P. ramsayi. SDS‐PAGE gels demonstrated that Nile tilapia digestive proteinases keep their activity when combined with each exogenous proteinase. Exogenous enzymes varied in their ability to enhance hydrolysis of different feed ingredients. P. muelleri by‐products are the best candidates to be employed as feed supplements for tilapia juveniles. Enzymes from this by‐product did not affect the activity and integrity of fish digestive enzymes, improved the hydrolysis of different protein sources (fish meal, squid meal, shrimp meal and soybean meal), and maintained its activity after being exposed to high temperatures and acid pHs. Our findings are applicable to other places where O. niloticus is raised utilizing local fishery waste, and also to different cultured species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aPatagonotothen ramsayi 3abyproducts 3adigestion 3adigestive enzymes 3afeed supplements 3afingerlings 3afish meal 3afisheries 3ahydrolysis 3aingredients 3ajuveniles 3apH 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aprotein sources 3aproteinases 3ashrimp 3asoybean meal 3asquid 3atemperature 3awastes1 aPereira, N.A.1 aHaran, N.S.1 aMallo, J.C.1 aFernández‐Gimenez, A.V.0 tAquaculture nutrition.g2017 Dec., v. 23, no. 6 p.1351-1361dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1353-57737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/anu.125103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02407naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245014700163300001800310520138800328592002801716650002301744650001301767650001501780650001101795650002101806650001101827650002601838650002301864700002101887773008001908856008401988852000902072655001202081IND60092261420221120160423.0141103e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009226142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2011.12.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Ying12aA theoretical evaluation of the effects of carbon nanotube entanglement and bundling on the structural and mechanical properties of buckypaper  ap. 1793-1806.  aStructural formation mechanisms of carbon nanotube (CNT) buckypaper and their effects on its mechanical properties are studied with numerical simulations. A bond swap algorithm, resulting from coupling the molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo methods, has been developed to equilibrate initial structures of buckypaper, generated by a random walk approach. Entanglement and bundling mechanisms are found to affect major structural features of buckypaper. Both mechanisms are evaluated quantitatively by calculating the entanglement network and pore size of buckypaper. Compared with (8,8)-(12,12) double-walled CNT, the structure of (5,5) single-walled CNT buckypaper is mainly dominated by entanglement, due to its smaller adhesion energy. We show that the pore size of modeled buckypaper, containing both types of CNTs, can be tuned from 7nm to 50nm by increasing the double-walled CNT content from 0wt% to 100wt%, due to the transformation from entanglement-dominated to bundling-dominated structures. Such an observation agrees exceptionally well with experimental results. Both entanglement and bundling mechanisms are also found to play important roles in the mechanical properties of buckypaper. The findings open a way to tailor both structural and mechanical properties of buckypaper, such as Young’s modulus or Poisson’s ratio, by using different CNTs and their mixtures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3aadhesion 3aalgorithms 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3aenergy 3amechanical properties 3amolecular dynamics1 aKröger, Martin,0 tCarbon.g2012 Apr., v. 50, no. 5 p.1793-1806dElsevier Ltdx0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2011.12.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03137naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245014700158300002000305520181100325592002802136650003702164650001902201650001302220650001302233650001302246650001502259650002502274650000902299650001402308650001002322650001602332650002102348650002002369700001602389700001702405700001702422700001302439700001502452700001702467773012402484856007402608852000902682655001202691IND60618305120221120214813.0181029e20180420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061830512DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ra00234g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeshpande, P.10aTribocatalytic behaviour of a TiO₂ atmospheric plasma spray (APS) coating in the presence of the friction modifier MoDTC: a parametric study  ap. 15056-15068.  aRecent engine design and emission trends have led to the commercial use of Atmospheric Plasma Spray (APS) coatings for cylinder liner applications like the TiO₂ APS coating. It was shown in our previous work that this type of coating showed better friction results compared to steel lubricated with MoDTC. To further investigate this feature, a parametric study was carried out involving the effect of MoDTC concentration, test temperature, Hertzian contact pressure and the change of counterpart materials from steel balls to ceramic balls (Al₂O₃ and ZrO₂). Ball-on-flat tribotests were carried out on a reciprocating (ball-on-flat) tribometer lubricated with base oil containing MoDTC. Results show that for all the test conditions used including the concentration of MoDTC, test temperature and the contact pressure, lower friction and wear is observed for the TiO₂ APS coating compared to reference steel. To explain the low friction behavior, tribofilm compositions were investigated and it was observed that MoS₂ is always formed in the case of TiO₂ APS with no oxysulphide species. For the reference steel, MoOₓSy species are mainly detected in the tribofilms. XPS analyses performed on TiO₂ APS flats when the counterpart material was changed from steel balls to ceramic balls suggested the formation of MoS₂ (Mo in +iv oxidation state) and Mo–C (Mo in +iv or +ii oxidation state) species with a negligible amount of MoO₃ (Mo in +vi oxidation state). It was also shown that a significant amount of molybdenum atoms inside the tribofilm, originating from MoDTC (Mo in +v oxidation state) were reduced in the tribological contact. A mechanism for the decomposition of MoDTC on the basis of tribocatalytic behaviour hypothesized in our previous work was proposed and discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aaluminum oxide 3aceramics 3acoatings 3afriction 3amolybdenum 3amolybdenum disulfide 3aoils 3aoxidation 3asteel 3atemperature 3atitanium dioxide 3azirconium oxide1 aMinfray, C.1 aDassenoy, F.1 aLe Mogne, T.1 aJose, D.1 aCobian, M.1 aThiebaut, B.0 tRSC advances.g2018 Apr. 20, v. 8, no. 27 p.15056-15068dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra00234g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02428naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245010800155300001800263520122100281592002801502650002501530650001501555650001401570650001201584650001901596650001901615650001501634650002101649650001601670650001501686700001801701700001401719700001701733700001201750700001601762700001601778773014101794856007401935852000902009655001202018IND60626988920221122161008.0190128e20190122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062698892DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ta10254f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Yahui10aSelf-healing and superwettable nanofibrous membranes for efficient separation of oil-in-water emulsions  ap. 1629-1637.  aThe development of a practical and efficient separation membrane is significant for the purification of emulsified oily wastewater; however, circumventing certain critical limitations such as low flux, membrane fouling and poor durability remains a challenge. Herein, a self-healing and superwettable electrospun nanofibrous and hydrophilic branched poly(ethylenimine)-poly(acrylic acid)/hyaluronic acid (bPEI-PAA/HA, named PPH) membrane was fabricated by adopting a simple strategy combining electrospinning and layer-by-layer assembly. Layer-by-layer self-assembling polymers greatly increase the strength and toughness of the composite membrane. The PAN@PPH composite membranes possess an uneven bulge microstructure with intriguing superhydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity as a result of the synergy between the uneven bulge surface and the hydrophilic polymeric matrix. More importantly, the membranes exhibit self-healing properties by repairing damage such as fractures in the presence of water, which significantly enhances their durability and service life in practical applications. This simple but novel and effective membrane system shows promise for large-scale oily wastewater remediation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasymmetric membranes 3adurability 3aemulsions 3afouling 3ahydrophilicity 3amicrostructure 3ananofibers 3apolyacrylic acid 3aremediation 3awastewater1 aChen, Dongyun1 aLi, Najun1 aXu, Qingfeng1 aLi, Hua1 aHe, Jinghui1 aLu, Jianmei0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2019 Jan. 22, v. 7, no. 4 p.1629-1637dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ta10254f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02639naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100001700165245013100182300001400313520100300327592002801330650002601358650002601384650002701410650001201437650003701449650001601486650001501502650003401517650001201551650004001563650003701603650003001640650002701670650003201697650002401729650005701753650006201810700001901872700002401891700001901915700002101934773011101955856008202066852000902148655001202157IND4447790220221118235011.0141112e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444779022DNAL7 a205383092pmid7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2010.05.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yifan10aComparison of phenotypic methods in predicting methicillin resistance in coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) from animals  ap. 23-25.  aPhenotypic detection of methicillin resistance in coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) of animal origin has been challenging due to the heterogeneous expression of mecA. To compare different phenotypic methods in predicting the mecA presence in CoNS, a total of 87 CoNS isolates from agricultural animals were analyzed in this study by agar dilution, disk diffusion, and broth microdilution. mecA was present in 81 CoNS isolates. Broth microdilution demonstrated the highest sensitivity of 100% in predicting the mecA presence, followed by 72.8% by agar dilution and 70.4% by disk diffusion. The results indicate that broth microdilution may be more suitable for predicting the presence of mecA in CoNS from animals than the other two methods, although staphylococcal species may also be a factor affecting the sensitivities of the methods as the top three staphylococcal species in this study were Staphylococcus lentus, Staphylococcus sciuri, and Staphylococcus xylosus (a total of 75 of 87).  aPublisher supplied data 3aStaphylococcus lentus 3aStaphylococcus sciuri 3aStaphylococcus xylosus 3aanimals 3acoagulase negative staphylococci 3amethicillin 3aprediction 2aAnimal Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacology 2aCoagulasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMethicillinxpharmacology 2aMethicillin Resistance 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSpecies Specificity 2aStaphylococcal Infectionsxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aStaphylococcusxclassificationxdrug effectsxenzymology.1 aWang, Xiaogang1 aLeJeune, Jeffrey T.1 aZervos, Marcus1 aBhargava, Kanika0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2011 Feb., v. 90, no. 1 p.23-25dElsevier India Pvt Ltd.x0034-52887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2010.05.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02999naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245010700174520168500281592002801966650001901994650001702013650002302030650001402053650001102067650001802078650004102096650001302137650001002150650001202160650003202172650003102204651001202235700002602247700001902273700002002292700002302312700002102335773012702356856008502483852000902568655001202577IND60760701420221119041118.0211223e20211123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076070142DNAL7 a10.3390/horticulturae71205162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJamal Mohammed, T.,10aVolatile Profile Characterization of Commercial Peach (Prunus persica) Cultivars Grown in Georgia, USA  aPeach production in Georgia, USA, extends from mid-May to mid-August. Multiple cultivars are commercially grown in the U.S., and each cultivar has unique fruit quality characteristics, which could influence consumer perception and acceptability. Among those, peach flavor has been minimally characterized among cultivars. Headspace-solid phase microextraction (HS–SPME) combined with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) was used to characterize the volatile profile of 42 peach cultivars commercially grown in 2016. The goal of this research was to understand the aroma composition and content of peach cultivars grown in Georgia, USA. Thirty-six volatile compounds were identified. Significant differences (p ≤ 0.0001) were observed for all the flavor volatiles across all cultivars being evaluated. Esters were the major compounds isolated from the 42 peach cultivars, followed by lactones, alcohols, aldehydes, and terpenoids, in that order. Lactones, benzaldehyde, and linalool, which are known to be peach aroma compounds, exhibited the highest mean concentrations among the cultivars with ɣ- and δ-decalactones having a concentration of approximately 180 ng·g⁻¹ and 60 ng·g⁻¹, respectively. Among the cultivars, “Majestic” had the highest mean concentration of ɣ-decalactone, followed by “Southern Pearl” with approximately 503 ng·g⁻¹ and 443 ng·g⁻¹, respectively. “Southern Pearl” and “Fairtime” also exhibited the highest average concentration of δ-decalactone. The results obtained will help provide an understanding of the distribution of the various volatile organic compounds found in Georgia-grown peach cultivars.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPrunus persica 3abenzaldehyde 3aconsumer attitudes 3acultivars 3aflavor 3afruit quality 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3alinalool 3aodors 3apeaches 3asolid phase microextraction 3avolatile organic compounds 3aGeorgia1 aBelisle, Catherine E.1 aWang, Shangci 1 aItle, Rachel A.1 aAdhikari, Koushik 1 aChavez, Dario J.0 tHorticulturae.g2021 Nov. 23, v. 7, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27142x2311-75247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/horticulturae71205163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02018naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245012300160300001800283520076200301592002801063650001501091650002201106650002301128650002301151650001301174650001901187650002101206650001301227700002201240700001801262700001701280700001701297700002401314700002001338700001501358700002001373773013201393856007401525852000901599655001201608IND60640023120221118142147.0190503e20190502xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064002312DNAL7 a10.1039/c9cc02578b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeng, Guangrong10aGraphene oxide catalyzed ketone α-alkylation with alkenes: enhancement of graphene oxide activity by hydrogen bonding  ap. 5379-5382.  aDirect α-alkylation of carbonyl compounds represents a fundamental bond forming transformation in organic synthesis. We report the first ketone-alkylation using olefins and alcohols as simple alkylating agents catalyzed by graphene oxide. Extensive studies of the graphene surface suggest a pathway involving dual activation of both coupling partners. Notably, we show that polar functional groups have a stabilizing effect on the GO surface, which results in a net enhancement of the catalytic activity. The method represents the first alkylation of carbonyl compounds using graphenes, which opens the door for the development of an array of protocols for ketone functionalization employing common carbonyl building blocks and readily available graphenes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkylation 3aalkylation agents 3acarbonyl compounds 3acatalytic activity 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3ahydrogen bonding 3amoieties1 aPatel, Mehulkumar1 aLuo, Feixiang1 aLi, Qingdong1 aFlach, Carol1 aMendelsohn, Richard1 aGarfunkel, Eric1 aHe, Huixin1 aSzostak, Michal0 tChemical communications.g2019 May 2, v. 55, no. 37 p.5379-5382dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9cc02578b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03219naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005900140245008400199300001600283500002000299520156300319592002801882596007201910596003501982650002202017650002302039650002302062650002902085650001102114650001002125650001802135650001402153650001702167650003502184650001702219650001402236650001602250651001002266651001402276651001702290700001302307700001802320700002402338700002302362700001802385700006202403773012702465856007502592961001302667852000902680655001202689IND60789378120221120173804.0220820e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078937812DNAL7 a10.1002/plr2.200432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBajgain, Prabin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3093-558210aRegistration of KUWNSr, a wheat stem rust nested association mapping population  ap. 467-473.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA spring wheat nested associated mapping (NAM) population, KUWNSr (Kenyan and U.S. wheat nested association mapping population for stem rust resistance), was developed at the University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN, USA. KUWNSr (Reg. no. MP‐12, NSL 533796 MAP, experimental designation SrNAM) was primarily developed to genetically characterize stem rust resistance as the 10 male parents—nine Kenyan and one University of Minnesota wheat cultivars—exhibited medium to high adult plant resistance to African and North American races of the stem rust pathogen (Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici). Each parent was crossed to the stem rust susceptible line LMPG‐6, and populations were developed via single‐seed descent. Aggregately, the resulting 10 populations, consisting of 852 recombinant inbred lines, formed the KUWNSr population. KUWNSr was evaluated in four environments: two in the United States and one each in Kenya and South Africa. A high‐density genetic map was developed using genotyping‐by‐sequencing, resulting in 11,221 single nucleotide polymorphism markers mapped to all 21 chromosomes. In addition to stem rust resistance, the population segregates for other disease resistance traits such as leaf and stripe rust and agronomic traits such as plant height, spike morphology, and days to heading. As one of the first wheat NAM populations developed, KUWNSr is a valuable resource for understanding the genetic architecture of wheat growth and development, morphology, and resistance or tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses.  aPublisher supplied data  a2011‐68002‐30029cUSDA Agriculture and Food Research Initiative  cBorlaug Global Rust Initiative 3aPuccinia graminis 3achromosome mapping 3adisease resistance 3agenotyping by sequencing 3aleaves 3amales 3amature plants 3apathogens 3aplant height 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aspring wheat 3astem rust 3astripe rust 3aKenya 3aMinnesota 3aSouth Africa1 aJin, Yue1 aTsilo, Toi J.1 aMacharia, Godwin K.1 aReynolds, Susan E.1 aWanyera, Ruth1 aAnderson, James A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4655-65170 tJournal of plant registrations.g2020 Sept., v. 14, no. 3 p.467-473dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:6195x1936-52097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/plr2.200433Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02538naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003800135040001800173100001500191245010000206300001400306506007600320520083100396592002801227506003701255650001201292650001301304650001401317650002301331650002301354650001001377650001101387650001001398650001501408650001401423650001801437650001201455650001301467650001301480651001401493651001301507653002201520653001501542653001201557653002401569653001401593700001701607700001601624700006901640700001601709700001901725773012201744856008501866852000901951655001201960IND60593843520221207125818.0200517e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059384352DNAL7 aPMC60319612pmcid7 a299888032pmid7 a10.1016/j.ijppaw.2018.01.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVélez, J.10aOccurrence of endoparasites in wild Antillean manatees (Trichechus manatus manatus) in Colombia  ap. 54-57.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe recognized impact of parasites in wildlife populations demands surveillance of endangered species like the Antillean manatees (Trichechus manatus manatus) in Colombia.

Biopiles were used to dispose of slaughterhouse-residuals and determine the occurrence and persistence patterns of indicators of pathogenic bacteria. The indicator bacteria included the family Enterobacteriaceae, total coliforms, Escherichia coli, nalidixic acid-resistant E. coli, and Streptococcus fecalis. The slaughterhouse-residual biopiles remained static for 164 d in 2006 and 141 d in 2007. In biopile effluent samples, exponentially decreasing populations of the indicator bacteria were observed. Indicator bacteria presence in biopile and soil samples suggested their retention and persistence in, but not migration from, the media. Though the family Enterobacteriaceae, total coliforms, and Escherichia coli shared behavioral correlations, they exhibited different fates in all media compared to S. fecalis, which was observed to persist and re-grow. The behavior of inoculated nalidixic acid-resistant E. coli suggested that inactivation was the primary process in the biopiles. However, the biopiles constituted continual sources of the indicator bacteria due to their persistence in isolated and protected locations, and changes in dominant species. While biopiling slaughterhouse-residuals was effective to inactivate >99% (log reductions) of indicator bacteria, tertiary methods and biopiling phases should be employed to ensure inactivation of pathogenic bacteria in animal waste biopiles. The fate of bacterial indicators in this system exhibited trends not-as-yet observed for animal waste biopiling activities, which generates numerous questions for further research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aStreptococcus 3aacid tolerance 3aanimal wastes 3acoliform bacteria 3adominant species 3ahealth effects assessments 3aindicator species 3alivestock 3amortality 3apathogen occurrence 3apathogens 3asoil sampling 3avirulent strains1 aGordon, Robert1 aJamieson, Rob1 aStratton, Glenn0 tResources.g2017 Sept. 26, v. 6, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21558x2079-92767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/resources60400493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02949naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245011000159300001800269500002000287520135400307592002801661650002801689650001501717650000901732650002101741650002501762650001801787650001101805650001701816650001701833650001001850650001401860650001401874650001001888650001601898650002301914650001401937650001701951650001101968650001301979650002801992650001702020650001602037650001702053650001502070700001802085700002302103700001802126700001802144700002202162773010502184856007302289852000902362655001202371IND60585716120221119202105.0171113e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058571612DNAL7 a10.1111/anu.125122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMansano, C.F.M.10aDigestibility of nutrients and energy in ingredients for bullfrogs during different phases of development  ap. 1368-1378.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe ability of frogs to digest dietary nutrients changes with growth, with the animals becoming more or less demanding. The objective of this study was to determine the apparent digestibility coefficients of protein, energy and ether extract of 14 ingredients used in bullfrog diets (spray‐dried blood meal, hydrolysed feather meal, poultry by‐product meal, red blood cell concentrate, tilapia by‐product meal, sardine fishmeal, salmon fishmeal, meat and bone meal, corn gluten meal, soybean meal, corn, wheat bran, soy protein concentrate and soybean oil). A total of 2,325 bullfrogs (Lithobates catesbeianus) in different phases of development were used: early phase (mean weight of 30–50 g), growth phase (80–110 g) and finishing phase (150–200 g). Faeces were collected using the method of dissection. Marked differences in digestibility of the ingredients were observed between the different phases of frog development. Among the ingredients studied, salmon fishmeal and corn gluten meal showed good utilization of the protein (78.9% and 86.7%, respectively) and energy fraction (89.4% and 83.3%, respectively). The salmon fishmeal, poultry by‐product meal, sardine fishmeal, soy protein concentrate, wheat bran and soybean oil exhibited good ether extract utilization (81.2%–92.8%), recommending their use in bullfrog diets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLithobates catesbeianus 3ablood meal 3acorn 3acorn gluten meal 3adevelopmental stages 3adigestibility 3aenergy 3aerythrocytes 3afeather meal 3afeces 3afinishing 3afish meal 3afrogs 3aingredients 3ameat and bone meal 3anutrients 3apoultry meal 3asalmon 3asardines 3asoy protein concentrate 3asoybean meal 3asoybean oil 3aspray drying 3awheat bran1 aMacente, B.I.1 aNascimento, T.M.T.1 aPinto, D.F.H.1 aPereira, M.M.1 aDe Stéfani, M.V.0 tAquaculture nutrition.g2017 Dec., v. 23, no. 6 p.1368-1378dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1353-57737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/anu.125123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02636naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001700161245010400178300001800282500000900300520125500309592002801564650003301592650001601625650001801641650001201659650002101671650002601692650001601718650002201734650001301756650001501769650001701784650001401801650001501815650003701830651001201867700002001879700001801899700001701917773015101934856009602085852000902181655001202190IND60668017820221121101106.0191125e199209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066801782DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1992.03615995005600050021x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhite, J.

This study was conducted to determine the effects of irrigation and fertilization on VAM fungal establishment in mycotrophic plants growing on mined lands in an arid environment. Colonization of mycotrophic plants by VAM fungi at a mine study site in the Red Desert region of southwestern Wyoming was accelerated by the reclamation practice of supplemental irrigation. Frequency of VAM fungal colonizations in three grass species were substantially increased in plots irrigated at rates of 5 and 10 cm mo⁻¹ in the first 2 yr of reclamation. Irrigation at a rate >5 cm mo⁻¹ was less important to fungal colonizations than irrigation scheduling during vegetative establishment. Colonization of mycotrophic plants by VAM fungi was not affected by fertilization with an 18-46-0 (N-P-K) fertilizer during the first year of reclamation. Densities of VAM fungal spores in minesoil plots were unaffected by either irrigation rate, irrigation schedule, or fertilization. A limited time-course study in the third season of reclamation delineated a functional VAM fungal presence within reclaimed minesoil.  aPublisher supplied data 3adry environmental conditions 3afertilizers 3afungal spores 3agrasses 3airrigation rates 3airrigation scheduling 3amined soils 3amycorrhizal fungi 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3aplant growth 3apotassium 3avegetation 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3aWyoming1 aWilliams, S.

A Review, Part II: Irrigation and Fertigation  aIncreasing agricultural systems’ resource efficiency is the key action for producing adequate food quantities in semi-arid Mediterranean regions while coping with water scarcity, environmental constraints and economic issues. Optimisation of irrigation and fertigation practices imposes different approaches, considering plant-water-soil relationships based on prevailing greenhouse microclimatic conditions, ensuring optimal production per drop of water and unit of fertiliser. In the content of "precision agricultural farming systems", nutrient uptake modelling, phyto-sensing, smart and sustainable technologies must be applied for monitoring and evaluating water and nutrients crops supply. However, in many cases, the use of irrigation and fertigation recipes given in the literature may not be compatible in the Mediterranean, as they usually originated based on northern European climatic conditions. The objective of this work is an attempt to understand various aspects of irrigation and fertigation management in vegetable fruiting crops such as tomato and cucumber towards nutrients and water resource sustainability in Mediterranean greenhouses.  aPublisher supplied data 3acucumbers 3aenergy 3afertigation 3agreenhouses 3airrigation 3amicroclimate 3anutrient uptake 3atomatoes 3awater shortages1 aNeocleous, Damianos 1 aChristou, Anastasis 1 aPolycarpou, Polycarpos 1 aKitta, Evangelini 1 aKatsoulas, N.q(Nikolaos),0 tHorticulturae.g2021 Dec. 03, v. 7, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27142x2311-75247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/horticulturae71205483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02632naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245008100179300001600260500001900276520101300295536016601308592002801474596010701502650001301609650001501622650002501637650003001662650001701692650001401709650001901723650002401742650001601766651001501782651001801797651001801815653001701833653001101850653001501861653002501876653001601901653001601917700002101933773010201954856008502056852000902141655001202150IND60695552720221119161935.0200517e20180704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069555272DNAL7 a10.1080/00275514.2018.14785382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOtálora, Mónica A.

Phylogenetic analyses using nuclear (nuc) rDNA 5.8S-ITS2 (ITS2) and mitochondrial (mt) cytochrome oxidase subunit 3 (CO3) show that Puccinia species occurring on Lyciae are grouped in two major lineages, one New World and one Old World. We assessed the value of morphological traits and geographic range as important features for discriminating lineages. The morphology of teliospore pedicels and rust geographic ranges explained the relationships within this Puccinia species group. Four Puccinia species are recognized on Lycieae in the New World lineage and four in the Old World lineage. Puccinia tumidipes from North America is resurrected and P. dimidipes described as new from South America. In addition, P. spinulosa from Madagascar is reduced to a synonym of P. engleriana.

A short-term pretreatment with high CO₂ levels was investigated for its effect on prolonging shelf life and improving flavor. Mature red fruits treated with 20% or 60% CO₂ initially had significantly higher respiration after 3 hours of treatment compared to a control; respiration then declined to normal levels during storage. Fruits treated with CO₂ produced significantly less ethylene than the control on the day of treatment. High CO₂ treatments had no significant effect on firmness and fruit color. Fruits treated with 20% CO₂ had a lower decay rate than the control; however, high temperature and the 60% CO₂ treatment induced decay. Fruits treated with 20% CO₂ and stored at 12°C for 10-15 days tended to have the highest levels of titratable acidity and the lowest pH. In addition, individual organic acid contents of cherry tomatoes were altered after CO₂ treatment. High CO₂ treatments significantly increased tartaric acid levels during storage at 12°C or 20°C for 10 or 15 days, respectively. Citric acid content was lower at the end of the storage period, but fruits treated with 60% CO₂ still had relatively high levels when fruits were stored at 12°C. Malic and oxalic acid contents showed little response to high CO₂ treatments. Fumaric acid content significantly increased and was associated with severe deterioration at the end of storage at 20°C. These results suggest that a 20% CO₂ treatment with storage at 12°C can reduce deterioration of cherry tomatoes by altering organic acid content.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3acarbon dioxide 3acherry tomatoes 3acitric acid 3acolor 3aethylene 3afirmness 3aflavor 3afruits 3afumaric acid 3aoxalic acid 3apH 3ashelf life 3astorage time 3atartaric acid 3atemperature 3atitratable acidity1 aBae, Yeoung-Seuk1 aYi, Chŏng-su,1 aChoi, Hyun-Jin1 aChoi, Ji-Weon1 aPark, Me-Hea0 tHorticulture, environment and biotechnology.g2017 Apr., v. 58, no. 2 p.127-135dKorean Society for Horticultural Sciencex2211-34527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13580-017-0198-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05855naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100002200140245005500162300001600217500000900233500001500242520468300257592002804940650001504968650002804983650001405011650001005025650002305035650001305058650001505071650001105086650002305097650002005120653002405140700001805164773020105182852000905383856007705392655001205469IND2042262420221119045402.0191122e199404  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204226242DNAL7 a10.2134/jpa1994.02302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeuselinck, P. R.10aManagement of Annual Lespedeza for Seed or Herbage  ap. 230-232.  aepub  a2019-12-04  aAnnual lespedezas are warm-season forage legumes used for reseeding pasture, hay, or seed production. The two annual lespedeza species used most in the USA are commonly referred to as striate [Kummerowia striata (Thunb.) Schindler] and korean [K. stipulacea (Maxim.) Makino] lespedeza. The objective of this study was to evaluate herbage removal and regrowth to determine effective managements of annual lespedeza for optimum seed or herbage production, or both. ‘Marion’ (K. striata) and ‘Summit’ (K. stipulacea) lespedezas were harvested biweekly between mid-June to mid-October in 1987 and 1988. Regrowth herbage was harvested from each plot in mid-October. Seed was threshed from regrowth herbage. Yield of herbage, regrowth herbage, and seed were compared. Summit yielded more herbage at each harvest, but Marion yielded more regrowth and seed. Harvest of herbage reduced subsequent regrowth and seed yield. Producers seeking to maximize seed yields should avoid management practices that remove herbage after mid-June as seed yields will be reduced. Producers managing their annual lespedeza as a reseeding forage crop could reduce seed yields below levels required to regenerate stands if Summit or Marion were harvested after early- or late-September, respectively. Producers intending to harvest herbage and seed can achieve this from the same production site, but yields will be significantly less than stands managed for a single purpose. Research QuestionAnnual lespedezas are grown alone or in pasture mixtures across a substantial portion of the grazing lands in the southeastern USA. They are warm-season, short-day flowering, herbage legumes. Frequently, farmers that grow annual lespedeza for herbage want to produce a commercial seed crop in the same growing season. Managing lespedeza for high hay yields can lead to poor seed production and failures of stands to persist through reseeding. Stands can renew annually through natural reseeding if managed properly. The objective of this study was to analyze herbage removal and regrowth of annual lespedeza to determine how to effectively manage this crop for optimum seed production, herbage production, or both. Literature SummaryThe two annual lespedeza species used most in the USA are Kummerowia striata (Thunb.) Schindler and K. stipulacea (Maxim.) Makino, which are commonly referred to as striate and korean lespedeza, respectively. Annual lespedezas are dependable reseeders, relatively tolerant of drought and pests, provide nutritious, nonbloating herbage, and are easily and inexpensively established. They are probably the easiest of the major legumes to establish as the seed can simply be broadcasted over existing grass sod or cereals in mid- to late-winter. Double cropping with small grain and annual lespedeza was a common practice in the 1930 to 1950s that provided producers with the options of using the annual lespedeza as pasture, hay, green manure, or a seed crop after the small grain was harvested. Little information is available on the growth and seed production of these commonly grown species. Study Description‘Marion’ and ‘Summit’ annual lespedeza were sown in the field at 18 lb/acre at the Agronomy Research Center located near Columbia, MO (38° 49′ N lat) in April 1987 and 1988. Beginning on 15 June 1987 and 13 June 1988, all herbage was hand harvested 2.0 in. above the soil surface from a 10.8 sq ft subplot in each cultivar main plot replicated four times. Harvests of a new plot within each replication continued every 2 wk for 10 consecutive harvests. Plots that were harvested initially to determine amount of herbage produced since establishment as seedlings, were harvested again on 18 October to determine herbage regrowth. Herbage and regrowth herbage harvested from each plot were dried at 100 °F and weighed. Seed was threshed from regrowth herbage and from herbage harvested on 18 October, cleaned, and weighed. Applied QuestionIs there an optimum management timetable for the production of annual lespedeza herbage, seed, or both? Producers of annual lespedeza can employ effective management schemes for the different options. To maximize seed production, producers should refrain from mowing, haying, or grazing past mid-June as yields will be reduced. Producers looking to harvest both herbage and seed, in the same year, should not harvest Marion lespedeza after late-August or Summit lespedeza after late-July, because subsequent seed yields from the regrowth would not be commercially acceptable. Producers seeking to ensure a reseeding crop of annual lespedeza for herbage should not harvest or graze herbage after early-September.  aPublisher supplied data 3aharvesting 3ainterspecific variation 3aLespedeza 3aseeds 3aKummerowia striata 3aregrowth 3acrop yield 3aforage 3aseasonal variation 3acrop management 0aspecies differences1 aMcGraw, R.

The output power of this system increased with the temperature and mass flow rate of the flue gas (m˙f), which had positive and negative effects, respectively, on the effectiveness (εFT) of the FTHE. Furthermore, εFT increased with the evaporation temperature (Tₑᵥₐ). The system performance and economy can be increased and decreased, respectively, through an increase in Tₑᵥₐ, especially for as the m˙f less than the design conditions. A method in which the flow rate of the working fluid is restricted through adjustment of the rotation speed of the expander is proposed to reduce the heat absorbed by the evaporator when the evaporation temperature increases. At a low evaporation heat transfer rate, when the rotation speed of the expander decreased from 1350 to 900 rpm, the evaporation pressure increased from 1.36 to 1.77 MPa, and system efficiency and output power increased by 1.0% and 204.7 W, respectively. Finally, results of the experiment confirmed that increasing evaporation pressure can increase system performance under low heat transfer rate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomic analysis 3aenergy 3aevaporation 3aflue gas 3aheat exchangers 3amass flow 3atemperature 3awaste heat recovery 0aWaste heat recovery 0aFin tube heat exchanger (FTHE) 0aOrganic rankine cycle (ORC) 0aFluctuation 0aScroll 0aFlue gas1 aLai, Chun-Chieh1 aChen, Yen-Hsun0 tEnergy.g2022 Nov. 01, v. 258 p.124866-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2022.1248663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02238naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100001600159245009700175300001600272500000900288520110700297592002801404650002901432650003101461650001901492650003101511650001001542650001801552650001401570700001701584773020801601856009401809852000901903655001201912IND60666537520221120232804.0191028e199409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066653752DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq1994.00472425002300050017x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGale, P.

High gross primary productivity in the lake (1.4 ± 0.3 kg C m⁻² yr⁻¹) was not significantly correlated with any water chemistry parameters measured. This suggested that the phytoplankton community was functioning at maximum levels and under nutrient nonlimiting conditions. Major C input to the lake is through gross primary productivity, of which 90% is lost through heterotrophic and microbial respiration processes within the water column. Resuspension of the bottom sediments was a major input of C into the water column, contributing 720 g C m⁻² yr⁻¹. In comparison, diffusive flux of dissolved organic C from the sediment was minimal (1.2 g C m⁻² yr⁻¹), as were external inputs into the water column (20 g C m⁻² yr⁻¹). High productivity of this system has resulted in a net accumulation of C (as sediments) of 118 g C m⁻² yr⁻¹. Contribution of the Florida Agric. Exp. Stn. Journal Ser. no.

In the tolerance test of simulated digestive juice in vitro, the viable rate of Lactobacillus brevis subsp. coagulans (Labre) processed with chocolate (Labre-in-chocolate) is significantly increased, approximately one hundred times higher, compared to those of freeze-dried Labre powder and Labre contained in beverage. This protective effect depends on the content of water in chocolate for the probiotics processing. Differences in tolerance of metabolic activity were investigated with Labre-in-chocolate and freeze-dried Labre powder, both treated with simulated digestive juice in vitro. The enzyme activity of Labre-in-chocolate remained significantly even though that of the freeze-dried Labre powder was inactivated.

This study investigated the feasibility of basing corn N recommendations on soil- and year-specific data rather than on yield goals. Soil-specific data from multiyear corn N rate studies, which included several soils and locations, were separated into high- and low-yielding groups based on each year's maximum yield. Based on a 24-yr corn N rate study on a Rozetta silt loam soil (finesilty, mixed, mesic Typic Hapludalfs) at Lancaster, WI, economic optimum N rates in high- and low-yielding years were nearly identical (160 to 170 lb N/acre). Economic optimum N rates in individual years were poorly correlated (R² = 0.02) with grain yields even though maximum yields ranged from 70 to 170 bu/acre. Similar results were obtained with other soils and locations. Greater N uptake with high yields does not require more applied N due to higher apparent recovery of available N in years with favorable growing conditions. A preplant soil nitrate test effectively adjusted optimum N rates for year-specific variations in soil nitrate content and greatly improved the accuracy of N recommendations. This test also provides a strategy for minimizing potential nitrate losses to groundwater. Our results indicate that the optimum N rate for corn is a soilspecific characteristic and should not be adjusted according to yield goal. Corn N recommendations based on soil-specific data and used in conjunction with a preplant soil nitrate test offer an improved approach for identifying optimum N rates. Research QuestionIdeally, N recommendations for corn should allow profitable production and minimize nitrate-N losses to the environment. Nitrogen recommendations based on soil- and year-specific data may provide a more accurate estimate of crop N needs than currently used yield goal-based recommendations. The objective of this work was to investigate an alternative rationale for corn N recommendations in Wisconsin based on soil- and year-specific data. Literature SummaryNitrogen recommendations for corn are based on yield goal in most of the USA, and a factor of about 1.2 Ib N/bu of expected yield is widely used to calculate N application rates. Excess N applications due to selection of unrealistic yield goals, lack of consensus on how yield goals should be determined, and reports of poor relationships between observed optimum N rates and current recommendations provide an incentive to investigate alternative approaches to development of corn N recommendations. Study DescriptionTo evaluate the relationship between corn yields and N recommendations, data from a 24-yr corn N rate study on a Rozetta silt loam soil at Lancaster, WI, were separated into high- and low-yielding groups based on the maximum yield attained each year. Years with a significant response to added N were identified using an analysis of variance and the response was characterized using a quadratic model. The economic optimum N rates in the high- and low-yielding groups were calculated using a N/corn price ratio of 0.075 bu/lb of N. Results from the Rozetta soil were compared with optimum N rates found in high- and low-yielding years for other soils and locations in Wisconsin. The year-specific effects of preplant soil nitrate content on economic optimum N rates for corn were determined at all site-years where N response was measured at uniform soil nitrate-N values. Applied QuestionsDoes the optimum N rate for corn vary with the yield obtained? Based on data from 22 N-responsive years between 1967 and 1990 in the Lancaster experiment, optimum N rates were 160 to 170 lb N/acre in both high- and low-yielding year groups (Fig. 1). When data from each year were considered separately, optimum N rates were poorly correlated with grain yields even though maximum yields ranged from 70 to 170 bu/acre. These findings are consistent with results from other soils and locations, and indicate that the optimum N rate for a specific soil is not closely related to the corn yield obtained. Fig. 1Corn yield response to applied N and economic optimum N rates in high- and low-yielding years. Why are optimum N rates similar at high and low yield levels? High corn yields usually result in more crop N uptake than lower yields. Our results indicate, however, that the greater N uptake with high yields does not require more applied N due to higher apparent recovery of available N by the crop in years with favorable growing conditions. Conditions promoting high corn yields, such as adequate moisture and temperature, apparently improve the efficiency of available N use by the crop resulting in a constant requirement for added N to optimize yields. Is year-specific information needed in a N recommendation system based on soil N response data? Soil N tests capable of detecting annual variations in N availability are a key component of N recommendations based on soil-specific data. In our work, a preplant soil nitrate test was very effective for making these year-specific adjustments and greatly improved the accuracy of the corn N recommendations. RecommendationThe optimum N rate for corn is a soil-specific characteristic and should not be adjusted for year-to-year variations in expected yield. Applying insurance N with the expectation of high yields or applying lower N rates with the expectation of a poor growing season probably will reduce profits. A preplant soil nitrate N test calibrated for specific cropping systems can be used to adjust the optimum N rate for annual variations in soil nitrate content.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3afertilizer requirements 3anitrate nitrogen 3aedaphic factors 3asoil test values 3aapplication rate 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aWisconsin 0aoptimization 0anitrogen content1 aBundy, L.

The PD granules of high nitrite production were cultivated with an excellent mean nitrate-to-nitrite transformation rate (NTR) of 56.39% in just 30 days. The granules size was improved from the initial size of 0.09 ± 0.01 mm in diameter to a size above 2 mm when the extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) content increased from 80.21 ± 10.20 mg/g MLVSS to 777.00 ± 22.13 mg/g MLVSS. Acyl-homoserine lactone signals (AHLs) ultimately increased ten-fold more than the initially through 30 days of cultivation. Meanwhile, Thauera had been identified as the main function bacteria of PD, which enriched from 0.47% to 10.67%. Results demonstrated that AHLs, EPS, PD bacteria and the PD granules cultivation were closely associated. Semi-starvation fluctuation produced oligotrophic stress on bacterial community, a part of bacteria would be eliminated on starvation for oligotrophic stress and AHLs of bacteria regarded as distress signals resulted in the rapid formation of PD granules. A mechanism for PD granular cultivation with semi-starvation fluctuation was proposed from the aspect of oligotrophic stress. A better strategy for rapid PD granules cultivation was obtained and it could be useful for the mainstream granule-based PD combined with the anammox process application in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThauera 3aanaerobic ammonium oxidation 3abacterial communities 3adenitrification 3adistress 3ametabolites 3anitrites 3apolymers 3aresearch 3asludge 3astarvation 0aPartial denitrification 0aSemi-starvation fluctuation 0aGranulation 0aOligotrophic stress 0aAHLs 0aBiopanning1 aHan, Yi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3637-79451 aGuo, Jianbo1 aZhang, Jianbing1 aHou, Yanan1 aSong, Yuanyuan1 aLu, Caicai1 aLi, Haibo0 tEnvironmental research.g2021 May, v. 196 p.110938-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.1109383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02973naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012300168300001600291520177400307592002802081650002102109650002102130650001702151650001402168650004302182650000902225650005002234650004002284700002502324700002202349700002002371700001902391773011102410856008102521852000902602655001202611IND60468518720221118194707.0151211e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046851872DNAL7 a10.1007/s00441-015-2228-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohammadi, Elham10aEndothelial juxtaposition of distinct adult stem cells activates angiogenesis signaling molecules in endothelial cells  ap. 597-609.  aEfficacy of therapeutic angiogenesis needs a comprehensive understanding of endothelial cell (EC) function and biological factors and cells that interplay with ECs. Stem cells are considered the key components of pro- and anti-angiogenic milieu in a wide variety of physiopathological states, and interactions of EC-stem cells have been the subject of controversy in recent years. In this study, the potential effects of three tissue-specific adult stem cells, namely rat marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (rBMSCs), rat adipose-derived stem cells (rADSCs) and rat muscle-derived satellite cells (rSCs), on the endothelial activation of key angiogenic signaling molecules, including VEGF, Ang-2, VEGFR-2, Tie-2, and Tie2-pho, were investigated. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and rat lung microvascular endothelial cells (RLMECs) were cocultured with the stem cells or incubated with the stem cell-derived conditioned media on Matrigel. Following HUVEC-stem cell coculture, CD31-positive ECs were flow sorted and subjected to western blotting to analyze potential changes in the expression of the pro-angiogenic signaling molecules. Elongation and co-alignment of the stem cells were seen along the EC tubes in the EC-stem cell cocultures on Matrigel, with cell-to-cell dye communication in the EC-rBMSC cocultures. Moreover, rBMSCs and rADSCs significantly improved endothelial tubulogenesis in both juxtacrine and paracrine manners. These two latter stem cells dynamically up-regulated VEGF, Ang-2, VREGR-2, and Tie-2 but down-regulated Tie2-pho and the Tie2-pho/Tie-2 ratio in HUVECs. Induction of pro-angiogenic signaling in ECs by marrow- and adipose-derived MSCs further indicates the significance of stem cell milieu in angiogenesis dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aadult stem cells 3aangiogenesis 3acoculture 3ahuman umbilical vein endothelial cells 3arats 3avascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 3avascular endothelial growth factors1 aNassiri, Seyed Mahdi1 aRahbarghazi, Reza1 aSiavashi, Vahid1 aAraghi, Atefeh0 tCell and tissue research.g2015 Dec., v. 362, no. 3 p.597-609dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0302-766X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-015-2228-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03341naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245016200168300001400330520182600344592002802170650001702198650002402215650002302239650002102262650001502283650002302298650000902321650001802330650002002348650001002368650001002378650002302388650000802411650001602419650001302435650001902448653001702467653000902484653002302493653002502516700001702541700001902558700001702577700001802594700001802612773009902630856008502729852000902814655001202823IND60533810120221121022748.0190415e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053381012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.livsci.2014.08.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Jung-Jin10aEffects of β-mannanase supplementation on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, and nitrogen utilization of Korean native goat (Capra hircus coreanae)  ap. 83-87.  aThe use of agricultural by-products possessing high β-mannan content as an animal feed ingredient has become increasingly important in achieving cost-effective agriculture. Recent studies showed improvement in growth performance from a diet containing high β-mannan concentrations by the addition of β-mannanase in monogastric animals. Few studies, however, have been conducted to examine the value of β-mannanase supplementation in ruminant diets. In the present study, the effects of β-mannanase supplementation on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, and nitrogen (N) utilization were investigated in growing Korean native goats (Capra hircus coreanae). Twelve Korean native goats (13±1.9kg) were divided into three groups and randomly allocated into one of the following treatments: (1) control (CON), (2) 0.1% β-mannanase supplementation (TRT1), or (3) 0.3% β-mannanase supplementation (TRT2) in a concentrate mix based on dry matter (DM). Diets composed of 40% of tall fescue hay and 60% of each concentrate mix were formulated to meet the National Research Council requirements for indigenous goats. No difference was observed among treatments in terms of DM intake and highest DM and organic matter digestibility (P<0.05) were observed in goats fed CON. However, β-mannanase supplementation significantly increased the average daily gain (P<0.05) and improved feed conversion ratio (P<0.05) as well as N retention (P<0.05). The N intake (P<0.05) and biological value (P<0.10) increased linearly by increasing the dosage of supplementation of β-mannnase. No difference was observed between the two levels of β-mannanase supplementation. In conclusion, β-mannanase supplementation may promote growth and feed efficiency in ruminant animals receiving feedstuffs with high β-mannan concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapra hircus 3aFestuca arundinacea 3aaverage daily gain 3abeta-mannosidase 3abyproducts 3acost effectiveness 3adiet 3adigestibility 3afeed conversion 3afeeds 3agoats 3agrowth performance 3ahay 3aingredients 3anitrogen 3aorganic matter 0aβ-mannanase 0aGoat 0aGrowth performance 0aNitrogen utilization1 aSeo, Jakyeom1 aJung, Jae Keun1 aLee, Junsung1 aLee, Jae-Hwan1 aSeo, Seongwon0 tLivestock science.g2014 Nov., v. 169 p.83-87dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl5113x1871-14137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2014.08.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03941naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245015400166520205500320592002802375650001202403650002402415650001502439650001702454650002002471650001002491650001202501650000902513650004202522650001902564650001002583650001702593650001402610650002002624653001402644653003202658653004102690653001002731653002002741653001002761700002002771700006002791700006002851700001902911700006102930700002102991700001603012700002203028700001803050700002103068700005903089773012403148856008203272852000903354655001203363IND60719899820221118014019.0220103e20210115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071989982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.abb.2020.1087212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Wijk, Koen10aHeterozygous disruption of ALAS1 in mice causes an accelerated age-dependent reduction in free heme, but not total heme, in skeletal muscle and liver  a5-Aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is the rate-limiting intermediate in heme biosynthesis in vertebrate species; a reaction catalyzed by the mitochondrial ALA synthase 1 (ALAS1) enzyme. Previously we reported that knockdown of the ubiquitously expressed ALAS1 gene in mice disrupts normal glucose metabolism, attenuates mitochondrial function and results in a prediabetic like phenotype when animals pass 20-weeks of age (Saitoh et al., 2018). Contrary to our expectations, the cytosolic and mitochondrial heme content of ALAS1 heterozygous (A1+/-) mice were similar to WT animals. Therefore, we speculated that regulatory “free heme” may be reduced in an age dependent manner in A1+/- mice, but not total heme.Here, we examine free and total heme from the skeletal muscle and liver of WT and A1+/- mice using a modified acetone extraction method and examine the effects of aging on free heme by comparing the amounts at 8–12 weeks and 30–36 weeks of age, in addition to the mRNA abundance of ALAS1. We found an age-dependent reduction in free heme in the skeletal muscle and liver of A1+/- mice, while WT mice showed only a slight decrease in the liver. Total heme levels showed no significant difference between young and aged WT and A1+/- mice. ALAS1 mRNA levels showed an age-dependent reduction similar to that of free heme levels, indicating that ALAS1 mRNA expression levels are a major determinant for free heme levels. The free heme pools in skeletal muscle tissue were almost 2-fold larger than that of liver tissue, suggesting that the heme pool varies across different tissue types. The expression of heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) mRNA, which is expressed proportionally to the amount of free heme, were similar to those of free heme levels. Taken together, this study demonstrates that the free heme pool differs across tissues, and that an age-dependent reduction in free heme levels is accelerated in mice heterozygous for ALAS1, which could account for the prediabetic phenotype and mitochondrial abnormality observed in these animals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetone 3aaminolevulinic acid 3abiophysics 3abiosynthesis 3agene expression 3agenes 3aglucose 3aheme 3aheme oxygenase (biliverdin-producing) 3aheterozygosity 3aliver 3amitochondria 3aphenotype 3askeletal muscle 0aFree heme 0a5-Aminolevulinic acid (ALA) 0a5-Aminolevulinate synthase 1 (ALAS1) 0aAging 0aSkeletal muscle 0aLiver1 aAkabane, Takeru1 aKimura, Tomohiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0361-46331 aSaitoh, Shinichi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7523-81771 aOkano, Satoshi1 aKelly, Vincent P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7067-54071 aTakagi, Michiaki1 aKodama, Ken1 aTakahashi, Kiwamu1 aTanaka, Tohru1 aNakajima, Motowo1 aNakajima, Osamu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9352-24460 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g2021 Jan. 15, v. 697 p.108721-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11658x0003-98617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2020.1087213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02449naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245003800162300002000200500000900220520116800229592002801397650004301425650002501468650002301493650001401516650002201530650001501552650001401567650002001581650001501601650002201616650000901638650001501647650001601662650001701678700001901695700001901714773020801733856007701941852000902018655001202027IND60666537820221122065420.0191028e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066653782DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq2007.04592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO'Connor, G.

Intentional reuse of degraded waters (e.g., wastewater effluents, irrigation return flows, concentrated animal feeding operations [CAFO] effluents, stormwater, and graywater) as substitutes for fresh waters could be one solution to the challenge. We describe the various degraded water types and reuse options and limitations and restrictions to their use. Emphasis is given to reuse scenarios involving degraded water applications to soil. The potential for degraded water reuse is enormous, but significant barriers exist to widespread adoption. Barriers include research questions (some addressable by traditional soil science approaches, but others requiring novel techniques and advanced instrumentation), the lack of unifying national regulations, and public acceptance. Educational programs, based on hard science developed from long-term field studies, are imperative to convince the public and elected officials of the wisdom and safety of reusing degraded waters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconcentrated animal feeding operations 3aeconomic development 3aeducation programs 3aeffluents 3afood availability 3afreshwater 3agreywater 3ainstrumentation 3airrigation 3apopulation growth 3asoil 3astormwater 3awater reuse 3awater supply1 aElliott, H.

This study was aimed at determining the status of fishery and establishing the levels of exploitation that will give sustainable yields. The FAO-ICLARM stock assessment tool (FISAT II) software was used to estimate population parameters. The growth parameters obtained from the seasonalised Von Bertalanffy growth function were L∞ = 10.24 cm total length, K/year = 1.40, C = 0.85; and WP = 0.79 (September). Using a length-converted catch curve, total mortality (Z) was estimated at 9.50/year, natural mortality (M) at 3.04/year, while fishing mortality (F) was estimated at 6.46/year. From the probability of capture estimation, the length-at-first capture (Lc) for M. felicinum was 4.55 cm. One major recruitment peak per year was established for M. felicinum, while the relative yield-per-recruit analysis predicted the maximum exploitation rate (Emax) of 0.42 against the current exploitation rate (E) of 0.68, suggesting M. felicinum is being over-fished. The management efforts should therefore be concentrated on regulating the mesh sizes of the traps as a means of reducing the fishing pressure on M. felicinum in Lower Taylor Creek.  aPublisher supplied data 3ariver deltas 3aprobability 3arivers 3aMacrobrachium 3ashrimp 3acomputer software 3atraps 3afisheries 3amortality 3aNigeria 0abasket traps 0arecruitment 0aprawns 0agrowth1 aHart, Aduabobo Ibitoruh0 tZoology and ecology.g2012 Dec. 1, v. 22, no. 3-4 p.160-165dRoutledgewJournal:12157x2165-80137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21658005.2012.704187  aDNAL 7aarticle03455naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245016700173300001600340520185500356592002802211650002202239650001602261650001302277650001102290650001202301650001702313650002102330650002102351650002002372650002402392650002002416650001202436650001002448650001402458650002102472650002702493650002602520653002202546653002102568653002302589653002802612653002602640700001402666700002102680700001502701700001402716773010102730856008502831852000902916655001202925IND60533810320221121022801.0190415e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053381032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.livsci.2014.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartin-Collado, D.10aDefining farmer typology to analyze the current state and development prospects of livestock breeds: The Avileña-Negra Ibérica beef cattle breed as a case study  ap. 137-145.  aWe developed a general farmer socioeconomic typology to help in analyzing the herd dynamics and farmers׳ decision making and in designing strategies for the development of local animal breeds. The typology was built on few measurable socioeconomic factors that are often used as indicators of the economic and cultural capital of farmers. We used a sample of 85 farmers of the Spanish Avileña-Negra Ibérica (ANI) local cattle breed to illustrate and test the procedure. The farmer types were defined by a hierarchical cluster analysis with a set of canonical variables derived from five socioeconomic factors: formal educational level and age of a farmer, year since the farmer started keeping the ANI breed, percentage of the total household income covered by the farm and percentage of the total farm land owned by the farmer. Five farmer types were determined based on the formal educational level of a farmer and on the percentage of the total household income covered by the farm: (1) Land owners, medium educated; (2) Owners of part of the farm land, low educated; (3) Owners of part of the farm land, high educated; (4) Landless farmers, medium educated; and (5) Landless farmers, low educated. The farmer types were found to be linked to several other attributes used in summarising farm profiles. The farmer types also differed in how farmers make farm management decisions about herd size and breed composition, breeding aims and collaborative activities with other farmers. In addition, the farmer types had a variable dependency on subsidy payments suggesting that the changes in subsidy programme will lead to a redistribution of farmers across the types. We conclude that typologies based on farmers׳ cultural and economic capital, could be a useful tool to foresee farmers׳ decision-making concerning the on-farm breed development  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3abeef cattle 3abreeding 3abreeds 3acapital 3acase studies 3acluster analysis 3acultural capital 3adecision making 3aeconomic indicators 3afarm management 3afarmers 3afarms 3aherd size 3ahousehold income 3alow educational status 3asocioeconomic factors 0aFarmer typologies 0aCultural capital 0aLocal animal breed 0aAvileña-Negra Ibérica 0aAgriculture subsidies1 aSoini, K.1 aMäki-Tanila, A.1 aToro, M.A.1 aDíaz, C.0 tLivestock science.g2014 Nov., v. 169 p.137-145dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl5113x1871-14137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2014.09.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03051naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003200150245010900182520153600291592002801827650001101855650002801866650001601894650001601910650001701926650002901943650002201972650004101994650001102035650003302046650001402079650001302093650001002106653001602116653001802132653001902150653002802169653001002197700002002207700001702227700002102244700005902265700001702324700001902341773010302360856008502463852000902548655001202557IND60729957720221119224509.0210926e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072995772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2021.1109412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartínez, María-Ángeles,10aHuman biomonitoring of bisphenol A along pregnancy: An exposure reconstruction of the EXHES-Spain cohort  aThis study was aimed at reconstructing the exposure to bisphenol (BPA) of 60 pregnant women from the EXHES-Spain cohort. A biomonitoring study was conducted by determining BPA levels in urine samples over the three trimesters of pregnancy. Moreover, the correlations between BPA levels and the role of different potential exposure sources, with special emphasis on the dietary intake, were also studied. Urine samples were subjected to dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction and the subsequent analysis via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. BPA was detected in 76% of the urine samples. A significant decrease of urinary BPA levels was observed along pregnancy, as mean concentrations of creatinine-adjusted BPA were 4.64, 4.84 and 2.51 μg/g in the first, second and third trimester, respectively. This decrease was essentially associated with changes in the dietary habits of the pregnant women, including a lower intake of canned food and drinks. However, the potential role of other pregnancy-related biochemical or physiological factors should not be disregarded. Very interestingly, significant differences in urine BPA levels were found according to the fruit consumption pattern, as women who ate more citrus fruits showed lower BPA concentrations in urine. The reconstructed exposure to BPA was estimated in 0.072, 0.069 and 0.038 μg BPA/kg of body weight/day in the first, second and third trimesters, respectively. These values are far below the temporary tolerable daily intake (t-TDI) established by the EFSA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aacceptable daily intake 3abisphenol A 3abody weight 3acanned foods 3aenvironmental monitoring 3afruit consumption 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahumans 3aliquid-phase microextraction 3apregnancy 3aresearch 3aurine 0aBisphenol a 0aBiomonitoring 0aPregnant women 0aExposure reconstruction 0aUrine1 aGonzález, Neus1 aMarti, Anna,1 aMarquès, Montse1 aRovira, Joaquim1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4399-61381 aKumar, Vikas1 aNadal, Martí,0 tEnvironmental research.g2021 May, v. 196 p.110941-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.1109413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03172naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245014600166300001600312520149400328592002801822650001301850650001401863650001601877650002401893650001401917650001501931650001001946650001801956650001201974650002201986650000902008650001402017650001702031650004102048650002002089650002002109650000902129650001402138653001302152653001202165653001802177653001902195653001202214653001202226653001402238653001602252653001002268700002002278700002302298700001502321700002602336773012902362856008202491852000902573655001202582IND60535986620221116205339.0190416e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053598662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bcab.2015.09.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBabu, Santosh10aSynergistic action of PGP agents and Rhizobium spp. for improved plant growth, nutrient mobilization and yields in different leguminous crops  ap. 456-464.  aThe effect of Rhizobium inoculation alone and in conjunction with plant growth promoting (PGP) microbial inoculants was evaluated in three leguminous crops – chickpea, pea and lentil. Significant enhancement in soil polysaccharide content and plant dry weight was recorded over control, in all those treatments receiving microbial inoculation. Nitrogen fixation (measured as ARA, acetylene reducing activity) in the treatment involving Anabaena laxa (RPAN8) showed a two folds increase over both Rhizobium inoculation and control in lentil, and in Trichoderma–Rhizobium treatment in pea crop. An increase of two-four folds in leghaemoglobin content and a doubling of yields was recorded in the combined microbial inoculation treatments, as compared to both Rhizobium inoculation or control, particularly in chickpea crop. A significant positive correlation was observed between nitrogen fixation with plant biomass and yields in all the three crops. Among the treatments, the use of cyanobacterium Anabaena laxa (RPAN8) and Anabaena–Pseudomonas fluorescens biofilmed inoculant, were most promisimg, besides biofilmed inoculants of Trichoderma or Anabaena with Rhizobium being among the top ranking treatments. These investigations illustrate the promise of cyanobacterial inoculants in various leguminous crops. Future focus needs to be towards understanding signalling mechanisms between Rhizobium and cyanobacteria and their positive feedback on plant growth and yield of legumes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnabaena 3aRhizobium 3aTrichoderma 3aacetylene reduction 3achickpeas 3acrop yield 3acrops 3aleghemoglobin 3alentils 3anitrogen fixation 3apeas 3aphytomass 3aplant growth 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3aplant nutrition 3apolysaccharides 3asoil 3asynergism 0aAnabaena 0aBiofilm 0aCyanobacteria 0aLeghaemoglobin 0aLegumes 0aNodules 0aRhizobium 0aTrichoderma 0aYield1 aPrasanna, Radha1 aBidyarani, Ngangom1 aNain, Lata1 aShivay, Yashbir Singh0 tBiocatalysis and agricultural biotechnology.g2015 Oct., v. 4, no. 4 p.456-464dElsevier LtdwJournal:23286x1878-81817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcab.2015.09.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02699naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002300166245012200189300001800311520106700329592002801396650002501424650002201449650002501471650002501496650001001521650001501531650001301546650001401559650001301573650001401586650002301600650001301623650001901636651001101655651001801666651001301684653001301697653001901710653001901729653001001748653001401758653001401772653001401786653001801800700002301818700003101841700006301872773012001935856008102055852000902136655001202145IND60651225820221120212217.0190711e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065122582DNAL7 a296812492pmid7 a10.1017/S00311820180005132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarooq, Hassan Ali10aEndemic infection of the common mynah Acridotheres tristis with Trichomonas gallinae the agent of avian trichomonosis  ap. 1548-1552.  aAvian trichomonosis is an architypal disease of wild columbids and those birds that predate them. Increasingly though, it has been reported in passerines; a recent and ongoing epidemic in the chaffinches and greenfinches of Europe and outbreaks amongst house finches, American goldfinches and purple finches in North America. The parasite, Trichomonas gallinae, causes lesions in the upper respiratory tract which can cause mortality associated with dehydration and emaciation. This paper reports for the first time, the widespread, endemic and often asymptomatic infection of common mynah (Acridotheres tristis) around the Faisalabad District, Pakistan. Parasite typing was used to investigate the potential for transmission among the frequently sympatric species. Type C parasites were found in mynah, and while this is analagous to the pandemic finch strain which is Type A, it is the first known example of passerine infections of this parasite genotype. Subtype analysis showed the strain to be C4 a subtype which has a widespread distribution in columbids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcridotheres tristis 3aCarduelis chloris 3aCarpodacus mexicanus 3aTrichomonas gallinae 3abirds 3aemaciation 3agenotype 3amortality 3apandemic 3aparasites 3arespiratory system 3asympatry 3atrichomoniasis 3aEurope 3aNorth America 3aPakistan 0aColumbid 0aFe-hydrogenase 0aITS1/5.8S/ITS2 0amynah 0apasserine 0asturnidae 0asubtyping 0aTrichomonosis1 aKhan, Hammad Ahmad1 aAlrefaei, Abdulwahed Fahad1 aTyler, Kevin Morris1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0647-81580 tParasitology.g2018 Oct., v. 145, no. 12 p.1548-1552dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45572x1469-81617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00311820180005133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02156naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245007400164300001600238520096500254592002801219650001901247650001101266650001901277650002901296650002101325650001901346650000901365650002201374650001601396653001701412653001901429653001501448653003201463700002601495700001601521773013401537856007801671852000901749655001201758IND60596877020221119002953.0180620e20171201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059687702DNAL7 a10.1515/jwld-2017-00892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTurbiak, Janusz10aCarbon dioxide emission from raised bog surface after peat extraction  ap. 237-242.  aResearch on CO₂ emission from a raised bog after completion of peat extraction was performed in 2011–2013.

However, considerable time lags between groundwater recharge and extraction complicate source attribution and remedial responses. We construct a historic N mass balance of two agricultural regions of California to understand trends and drivers of past and present N loading to groundwater (1945–2005). Changes in groundwater N loading result from historic changes in three factors: the extent of agriculture (cropland area and livestock herd increased 120 and 800%, respectively), the intensity of agriculture (synthetic and manure waste effluent N input rates increased by 525 and 1500%, respectively), and the efficiency of agriculture (crop and milk production per unit of N input increased by 25 and 19%, respectively). The net consequence has been a greater-than-order-of-magnitude increase in nitrate (NO₃⁻) loading over the time period, with 163 Gg N yr⁻¹ now being leached to groundwater from approximately 1.3 million ha of farmland (not including alfalfa [Medicago sativa L.]). Meeting safe drinking water standards would require NO₃⁻ leaching reductions of over 70% from current levels through reductions in excess manure applications, which accounts for nearly half of all groundwater N loading, and through synthetic N management improvements. This represents a broad challenge given current economic and technical conditions of California farming if farm productivity is to be maintained. The findings illustrate the growing tension—characteristic of agricultural regions globally—between intensifying food, feed, fiber, and biofuel production and preserving clean water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMedicago sativa 3aalfalfa 3acropland 3adrinking water 3afarms 3afuel production 3agroundwater 3agroundwater recharge 3aherds 3aintensive farming 3aleaching 3alivestock 3amilk production 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3apollution load 3asource attribution 3awastes 3aCalifornia1 aLiptzin, Daniel1 aDzurella, Kristin1 aFryjoff-Hung, Anna1 aHollander, Allan1 aJensen, Vivian1 aKing, Aaron1 aKourakos, George1 aMcNally, Alison1 aPettygrove, G.

In particular, this study examined how reward sensitivity, a biologically-based predisposition to approach rewards (such as appetitive foods) in the environment, influenced participants' vulnerability to television food advertising and subsequent food consumption. Ninety-eight participants were randomly assigned to a cue condition (food cues versus non-food cues) and then viewed a 30 min documentary interrupted by advertising featuring a mix of food and neutral advertising (food cue condition) or only neutral advertising (non-food cue condition). Participants' reward sensitivity, approach motivation measured as urge to eat, and food consumption were recorded. Moderated mediation regression analyses revealed the positive association between reward sensitivity and food consumption was mediated by an increase in urge to eat, but only when participants were exposed to food advertising. These findings suggest heightened reward sensitivity, exposure to appetitive food cues, and approach motivation are key interacting mechanisms that may lead to maladaptive eating behaviours.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeating habits 3afood advertising 3afood consumption 3afoods 3amotivation 3aregression analysis 3atelevision 0aTelevision 0aAdvertising 0aReward 0aFood 0aPersonality 0aCue1 aLoxton, Natalie J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7681-64580 tPhysiology & behavior.g2018 May 01, v. 188 p.276-282dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11731x0031-93847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2018.02.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01569naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245007400169300001600243520047900259592002800738650001400766650001400780650001000794651001800804651001200822651001100834653001500845653001400860653001600874653001100890653001000901653001200911653001700923653002300940700002500963700001900988773009201007856005101099852000901150655001201159IND50088167820221119130822.0140414e20121201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008816782DNAL7 a10.1080/21658005.2012.7296592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBukejs, Andris10aReview of Latvian Nanophyinae (Coleoptera: Curculionoidea: Brentidae)  ap. 190-197.  aThe faunal and bionomial information on Latvian Nanophyinae (Coleoptera: Brentidae) is summarised.

Floristic surveys were conducted in the meadows in years 2001 and 2013 under the conditions of natural succession of the communities Poa pratensis-Festuca rubra. The area is situated in the northern part of the Lublin Voivodeship, in the physiographic mesoregion the Łęczna-Włodawa Lakeland. Those communities were characterized by average species richness and floristic diversity index values. The cover index decreased considerably in the case of 8 species, and increased for 12 species. A large increase in the cover index of Holcus lanatus, Deschampsia caespitosa, Galium mollugo, Anthriscus sylvestris and Polemonium caeruleae is particularly noteworthy. In 2001, 39 species of plants were recorded in all relevés, compared to 41 species recorded in 2013. Over 12 years, 11 species disappeared, but 13 new ones emerged. For the time being, the average species richness N increased from 12 to 16 per relevé. The biodiversity index H' increased from 2.8 to 3.6.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnthriscus sylvestris 3aDeschampsia cespitosa 3aFestuca rubra 3aGalium mollugo 3aHolcus lanatus 3aPoa pratensis 3aPolemonium 3aconservation areas 3adrainage 3aforests 3ameadows 3apeatlands 3aplant communities 3aspecies diversity 3asurveys 3avegetation cover 3aPoland 0adiversity index 0arelevés 0ariver valley 0aspecies richness1 aGrzywna, Antoni0 tJournal of water and land development.g2017 Dec. 1, v. 35, no. 1 p.243-248dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:jnl4334744x2083-45357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/jwld-2017-00903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03180naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245011900174300001600293520167500309592002801984650002202012650001802034650002002052650002102072650001502093650001202108650002702120650001302147650000902160650001202169653002402181653002102205653002302226653001102249653001602260653001502276700002402291700002202315700002502337700002202362700001602384700002402400700006302424773010502487856008502592852000902677655001202686IND60612899920221122231811.0180911e20180501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061289992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2018.02.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSouza, Leonardo C.10aAgomelatine's effect on circadian locomotor rhythm alteration and depressive-like behavior in 6-OHDA lesioned rats  ap. 298-310.  aParkinson's disease (PD) patients often suffer from circadian locomotor rhythms impairment and depression, important non-motor symptoms. It is known that toxin-based animal models of PD can reproduce these features. In a 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) intranigral model, we first investigated the possible disturbances on circadian rhythms of locomotor activity. The rats were divided into 6-OHDA and Sham groups. After a partial dopaminergic lesion, the 6-OHDA group showed slight alterations in different circadian locomotor rhythms parameters. In a second experiment, we hypothesized agomelatine, an melatoninergic antidepressant with potential to resynchronize disturbed rhythms, could prevent neuronal damage and rhythm alterations in the same 6-OHDA model. The animals were divided into four groups: 6-OHDA+vehicle, 6-OHDA+ago, Sham+vehicle and 6-OHDA+ago. However, the treated animals (agomelatine 50 mg/kg for 22 days) showed an impaired rhythm robustness, and agomelatine did not induce significant changes in the other circadian parameters nor neuroprotection. Finally, in a third experiment, we examined the effects of agomelatine in the 6-OHDA model regarding depressive-like behavior, evaluated by sucrose preference test. The animals were also divided into four groups: 6-OHDA+vehicle, 6-OHDA+ago, Sham+vehicle and 6-OHDA+ago. The toxin infused animals showed a decrease in sucrose preference in comparison with the vehicle infused animals, however, agomelatine did not prevent this decrease. Our findings indicate that agomelatine worsened circadian locomotor rhythm and was not able to reverse the depressive-like behavior of rats in the 6-OHDA PD model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParkinson disease 3aanimal models 3aantidepressants 3acircadian rhythm 3alocomotion 3aneurons 3aneuroprotective effect 3apatients 3arats 3asucrose 0aParkinson's disease 0aCircadian rhythm 0aLocomotor activity 0a6-OHDA 0aAgomelatine 0aDepression1 aMartynhak, Bruno J.1 aBassani, Taysa B.1 aTurnes, Joelle de M.1 aMachado, Meira M.1 aMoura, Eric1 aAndreatini, Roberto1 aVital, Maria A.B.F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2611-24600 tPhysiology & behavior.g2018 May 01, v. 188 p.298-310dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11731x0031-93847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2018.02.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03118naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245009100168520161200259592002801871650002201899650002001921650001601941650002001957650001601977650002001993650002402013650001302037650002902050650004402079650001002123651001002133653001602143653001002159653001302169653001902182653001602201700001402217700001902231700001902250700001602269700001602285700001302301700001602314700001902330700005402349773010302403856008502506852000902591655001202600IND60729958020221119224633.0210926e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072995802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2021.1109452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Yi-Jing10aDetection of antibiotics in the urine of children and pregnant women in Jiangsu, China  aExposure to low concentrations of antibiotics links to multiple health hazards, such as drug resistance of bacteria, and childhood obesity. In this study, seven antibiotics were measured in the urine of 107 children and 126 pregnant women in Jiangsu Province by ultra-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). The overall urinary antibiotics detection rate was 38.6%. Most (98.3%) of the participants’ antibiotics concentrations were no more than 10 ng/mL. Children had a significantly higher detection rate than pregnant women (47.7% vs. 31.0%, P = 0.009), as well as the concentration (95th percentile: 6.49 vs. 4.08 ng/mL, P = 0.002). The detection rates of individual antibiotics ranged from 0.4% to 15.0%, and the concentrations ranged from lower than the limit of detection (LOD) through up to 31.96 ng/mL individually. Two or more antibiotics were detected in 11.2% of the urines. Tetracyclines were more frequently detected than phenicols (30.9% vs.12.4%). Oxytetracycline was the most frequently detected (15.0%). Multivariate logistic regression showed that consuming puffed food every day was associated with a significantly increased likelihood of detection, and higher concentration of overall antibiotics, and of doxycycline. Children were more likely to be detected of doxycycline and florfenicol, and to have elevated concentration of doxycycline, compared with pregnant women. This study highlights the relatively heavier antibiotics exposure in children, and a possible impact of puffed food on it, which needs to be warranted in future studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3achildhood obesity 3adetection limit 3adoxycycline 3adrug resistance 3aflorfenicol 3aoxytetracycline 3aregression analysis 3aresearch 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 3aurine 3aChina 0aAntibiotics 0aUrine 0aChildren 0aPregnant women 0aPuffed food1 aZhu, Feng1 aZheng, Dong-Yu1 aGao, Ming-ming1 aGuo, Bao-Fu1 aZhang, Ning1 aMeng, Yu1 aWu, Gao-lin1 aZhou, Yong-lin1 aHuo, Xiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5968-68740 tEnvironmental research.g2021 May, v. 196 p.110945-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.1109453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03062naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004200113040001800155100001900173245006200192300001600254520137000270592002801640650002501668650001701693650002001710650001601730650002001746650001001766650001801776650001901794650002101813650001401834650002501848650001401873650001701887650001501904650001401919650001301933650001201946650001001958650001101968650002101979650001402000650001902014650005502033650003002088650001602118650005002134650001102184650002002195650005502215650003702270773010102307856005502408852000902463655001202472IND50059031120221117100246.0121011e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005903112DNAL7 a224586962pmid7 a10.1111/j.1753-4887.2011.00467.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDreher, Mark L10aPistachio nuts: composition and potential health benefits  ap. 234-240.  aThe pistachio is a nutrient‐dense nut with a heart‐healthy fatty‐acid profile as well as protein, dietary fiber, potassium, magnesium, vitamin K, γ‐tocopherol, and a number of phytochemicals. The pistachio's unique green and purple kernel color is a result of its lutein and anthocyanin content. Among nuts, pistachios contain the highest levels of potassium, γ‐tocopherol, vitamin K, phytosterols, and xanthophyll carotenoids. Five published randomized cardiovascular trials have shown that pistachios promote heart‐healthy blood lipid profiles. Exploratory clinical studies suggest that pistachios help maintain healthy antioxidant and anti‐inflammatory activity, glycemic control, and endothelial function. When consumed in moderation, pistachios may help control body weight because of their satiety and satiation effects and their reduced net metabolizable energy content. One study with subjects in a weight‐loss program demonstrated lower body mass index and triglyceride levels in individuals who consumed pistachios compared with those who consumed an isocaloric pretzel snack. Emerging research suggests that the addition of pistachios to high‐glycemic meals may lower the overall postprandial glycemic response. This review examines the nutrients and phytochemicals in pistachios as well as the potential health effects of these nuts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3ablood lipids 3abody mass index 3acarotenoids 3aclinical trials 3acolor 3adietary fiber 3aenergy content 3aglycemic control 3amagnesium 3ametabolizable energy 3anutrients 3aphytosterols 3apistachios 3apotassium 3aproteins 3asatiety 3aseeds 3asnacks 3atriacylglycerols 3avitamin K 3aweight control 2aAntioxidantsxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aBody Weight 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxprevention & control 2aHumans 2aNutritive Value 2aPhytosterolsxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aPistaciaxchemistryxphysiology.0 tNutrition reviews.g2012 Apr., v. 70, no. 4 p.234-240dBlackwell Publishing Incx0029-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1753-4887.2011.00467.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02998naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245010100168300001600269520165100285592002801936650001801964650001201982650001001994650001302004650001202017650001002029650001502039650002502054650001702079650001602096650000902112650001102121650001102132650001202143650001702155650002002172650001302192650001902205700002502224700002602249700001902275700002102294773011102315856008102426852000902507655001202516IND60468519420221118195405.0151211e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046851942DNAL7 a10.1007/s00441-015-2251-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahman, Ahmed A.10aAlterations in the distal colon innervation in Winnie mouse model of spontaneous chronic colitis  ap. 497-512.  aThe gastrointestinal tract is innervated by extrinsic sympathetic, parasympathetic and sensory nerve fibers as well as by intrinsic fibers from the neurons in myenteric and submucosal ganglia embedded into the gastrointestinal wall. Morphological and functional studies of intestinal innervation in animal models are important for understanding the pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The recently established Winnie mouse model of spontaneous chronic colitis caused by a point mutation in the Muc2 mucin gene develops inflammation due to a primary epithelial defect. Winnie mice display symptoms of diarrhea, ulcerations and rectal bleeding similar to those in IBD. In this study, we investigated myenteric neurons, noradrenergic, cholinergic and sensory nerve fibers in the distal colon of Winnie (Win/Win) mice compared to C57/BL6 and heterozygote littermates (Win/Wt) using histological and immunohistochemical methods. All Win/Win mice used in this study had inflammation with signs of mucosal damage, goblet cell loss, thickening of muscle and mucosal layers, and increased CD45-immunoreactivity in the distal colon. The density of sensory, cholinergic and noradrenergic fibers innervating the myenteric plexus, muscle and mucosa significantly decreased in the distal colon of Win/Win mice compared to C57/BL6 and Win/Wt mice, while the total number of myenteric neurons as well as subpopulations of cholinergic and nitrergic neurons remained unchanged. In conclusion, changes in the colon morphology and innervation found in Winnie mice have multiple similarities with changes observed in patients with ulcerative colitis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3acolitis 3acolon 3adiarrhea 3aganglia 3agenes 3ahemorrhage 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainflammation 3ainnervation 3amice 3amucins 3amucosa 3amuscles 3anerve fibers 3apathophysiology 3apatients 3apoint mutation1 aRobinson, Ainsley M.1 aJovanovska, Valentina1 aEri, Rajaraman1 aNurgali, Kulmira0 tCell and tissue research.g2015 Dec., v. 362, no. 3 p.497-512dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0302-766X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-015-2251-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02094naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245008900166300001400255520086300269592002801132650002501160650001101185650001201196650001701208650001301225650001601238650001901254650001601273653002101289653001801310653001901328653001901347653002901366700001501395700002901410700002501439773012501464856008601589852000901675655001201684IND60775396220221118201328.0220424e20120901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077539622DNAL7 a10.1556/aalim.41.2012.suppl.52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFekete, B.10aUse of irradiation to improve the mirobiological safety of some fresh pre-cut fruits  ap. 52-61.  aFruits and vegetables are increasingly consumed as a part of healthy diets.

Effects of low dose irradiation on the microbiota, antioxidant capacity, total polyphenol contents, firmness and sensory properties of pre-cut apple, orange and banana were investigated. Dose of 2.0 kGy was able to reduce considerably the microbiological contamination of fruits, apple, orange, banana, but microorganisms surviving the irradiation are able to recover and grow during refrigerated storage. Two kGy was an acceptable radiation dose for the treatment of these products, having no significant effect on the mentioned quality parameters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aapples 3abananas 3acold storage 3afirmness 3airradiation 3amicroorganisms 3apolyphenols 0afood irradiation 0apre-cut apple 0apre-cut banana 0apre-cut orange 0amicrobiological analysis1 aKiskó, G.1 aStefanovits-Bányai, É.1 aMohácsi-Farkas, Cs.0 tActa alimentaria.g2012 Sept. 1, v. 41, no.

The present study was aimed at investigating the concentrations and composition of total suspended particles (TSPs) and PM₂.₅ at various industrial/commercial sites of Guangzhou, a megacity of Southern China. Major and trace elements, ions and carbonaceous fraction were determined and main components were calculated. In addition, in order to assess the potential toxic on the respiratory system of these PM, cytotoxicity of size-fractionated particles (PM₁₀₋₅.₆, PM₅.₆₋₃.₃, PM₃.₃₋₁.₁, PM₁.₁₋₀.₄₃) for a human lung cancer cell line (A549) was also investigated. Correlations between PM constituents and toxicity were assessed. Median levels of TSPs and PM₂.₅ in industrial/commercial sites were 206 and 57.7 μg/m³, respectively. Nickel, Cu, Mo, Mn, Pb, and Ti were the most abundant metals in TSPs and PM₂.₅. Industrial activities and coal combustion were the most important sources of carbonaceous particles in the zone. MTT assays showed that PM₁₀₋₅.₆ and PM₁.₁₋₀.₄₃ had the highest and the lowest cytotoxicity to A549 cell lines, respectively. Inhalable particles around the manufacturing of metal facilities and formal waste treatment plants showed a high cytotoxicity to A549 cell lines. In general terms, no significant correlations were found between main components of PM and toxicity. However, W showed a significant correlation with cell viability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3acell viability 3acities 3acoal 3acombustion 3acytotoxicity 3ahumans 3alung neoplasms 3aneoplasm cells 3anickel 3aresearch 3arespiratory system 3awaste treatment 3aChina 0aAirborne particles 0aTrace elements 0aIndustrial/commercial activities 0aCytotoxicity 0aA549 cell line1 aRovira, Joaquim1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4399-61381 aSierra, Jordi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4265-93861 aBlanco, Jordi1 aChen, She-Jun1 aMai, Bi- Xian1 aSchuhmacher, Marta1 aDomingo, José L.0 tEnvironmental research.g2021 May, v. 196 p.110953-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.1109533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02982naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002800188245011500216300001600331506007600347520128400423592002801707506003701735650001901772650002001791650001801811650002301829650002101852650001501873650001101888650002101899650001501920650001801935650000901953650001201962650001501974700001701989700002202006700002202028700001802050700001902068700002402087700002202111700001902133700002302152700002602175700002602201773011102227856008102338852000902419655001202428IND60468519520221207140004.0151211e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046851952DNAL7 a10.1007/s00441-015-2248-y2doi7 aPMC46796812pmcid7 a262463982pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYokohama-Tamaki, Tamaki10aCXCR4/CXCL12 signaling impacts enamel progenitor cell proliferation and motility in the dental stem cell niche  ap. 633-642.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDental stem cells are located at the proximal ends of rodent incisors. These stem cells reside in the dental epithelial stem cell niche, termed the apical bud. We focused on identifying critical features of a chemotactic signal in the niche. Here, we report that CXCR4/CXCL12 signaling impacts enamel progenitor cell proliferation and motility in dental stem cell niche cells. We report cells in the apical bud express CXCR4 mRNA at high levels while expression is restricted in the basal epithelium (BE) and transit-amplifying (TA) cell regions. Furthermore, the CXCL12 ligand is present in mesenchymal cells adjacent to the apical bud. We then performed gain- and loss-of-function analyses to better elucidate the role of CXCR4 and CXCL12. CXCR4-deficient mice contain epithelial cell aggregates, while cell proliferation in mutant incisors was also significantly reduced. We demonstrate in vitro that dental epithelial cells migrate toward sources of CXCL12, whereas knocking down CXCR4 impaired motility and resulted in formation of dense cell colonies. These results suggest that CXCR4 expression may be critical for activation of enamel progenitor cell division and that CXCR4/CXCL12 signaling may control movement of epithelial progenitors from the dental stem cell niche.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCXCR4 receptor 3acell aggregates 3acell division 3acell proliferation 3achemokine CXCL12 3achemotaxis 3aenamel 3aepithelial cells 3aepithelium 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3amutants 3astem cells1 aOtsu, Keishi1 aHarada, Hidemitsu1 aShibata, Shunichi1 aObara, Nobuko1 aIrie, Kazuharu1 aTaniguchi, Akiyoshi1 aNagasawa, Takashi1 aAoki, Kazunari1 aCaliari, Steven R.1 aWeisgerber, Daniel W.1 aHarley, Brendan A.

Neurovascular coupling (NVC) is the close temporal and regional relationship of CBF to changes in neural activity and may aid in explaining the localized CBF response with cognitive activation. High-altitude related cognitive impairment is likely affected by hypocapnic cerebral vasoconstriction that may influence regional CBF regulation independent of hypoxia. We assessed neurocognition and NVC following 30 min of acute exposure to isocapnic hypoxia (decreased partial pressure of end-tidal oxygen; PETO2) during moderate hypoxia (MOD HX; 55 mm Hg PETO2), and severe hypoxia (SEV HX; 45 mm Hg PETO2) in 10 healthy individuals (25.5 ± 3.3 yrs). Transcranial Doppler ultrasound was used to assess mean posterior and middle cerebral blood velocity (PCAv and MCAv, respectively) and neurocognitive performance was assessed via validated computerized tests. The main finding was that reaction time (i.e., kinesthetic and visual-motor ability via Stroop test) was selectively impaired in SEV HX (−4.6 ± 5.2%, P = 0.04), but not MOD HX, while complex cognitive performance (e.g., psychomotor speed, cognitive flexibility, processing speed, executive function, and motor speed) was unaffected with hypoxia (P > 0.05). Additionally, severity of hypoxia had no effect on NVC (PCAv CON vs. SEV HX relative peak response 13.7 ± 6.4% vs. 16.2 ± 11.5%, P = 0.71, respectively). In summary, severe isocapnic hypoxia impaired reaction time, but not complex cognitive performance or NVC.

Colleters are secretory structures that protect meristems and developing organs from dehydration and attack by herbivores or pathogens. Colleters are common in Gentianaceae; however, there is little research from an anatomical perspective. This study evaluated three Prepusa species (P. connata, P. hookeriana, and P. viridiflora) that are endemic to rock outcrops associated with the Atlantic Forest to investigate the distribution, anatomy, and histochemical composition of secretion of the their colleter throughout leaf growth and maturation. Samples of young, mature, and senescent leaf bases were collected, fixed, and processed following routine techniques in anatomical and micromorphological studies. In the three species, the colleters are located at the base of the leaves, on the adaxial surface. They are non-vascularized and have a short peduncle and a multicellular secretory portion coated by the cuticle. They develop asynchronously, as they are active in young leaves, and cease their activity in fully expanded leaves, but they are not deciduous. They have intercellular spaces, in which polysaccharide and protein secretions accumulate. Moreover, lipids were observed only in P. hookeriana and P. connata. Phenolic compounds are common and occur during colleter senescence, which is characterized by total cell collapse. Even though this study examined congeneric species from similar environments, the results confirm alterations in secretion composition and structural and chemical changes throughout leaf growth and maturation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGentianaceae 3adrought tolerance 3aflora 3aforests 3aleaves 3ameristems 3apeduncle 3apolysaccharides 3asecretion 3atrichomes 0aAnatomy 0aHistochemistry 0aMucilage 0aRock outcrops 0aSecretion 0aSecretory structures1 aRocha, Diego Ismael1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6683-09611 aKuster, Vinícius Coelho1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1236-486X1 aFernandes, Valéria Ferreira1 aDelgado, Marina Neves1 aFrancino, Dayana Maria Teodoro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9160-18931 aDalvi, Valdnéa Casagrande1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9325-20250 tFlora.g2022 Sept., v. 294 p.152120-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl51878x0367-25307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.flora.2022.1521203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05101naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100002000140245007800160300001600238500000900254520392100263592002804184650001304212650001004225650001004235650001404245650001504259650001204274650001304286650001904299650002104318650002304339700002204362700002404384700002004408773020104428852000904629856007704638655001204715IND2042523220221120132559.0191122e199407  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204252322DNAL7 a10.2134/jpa1994.03352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilson, Dale O.10aEffect of Harvest and Conditioning on Vigor of Shrunken-2 Sweet Corn Seed  ap. 335-341.  aepub  aShrunken-2 (sh-2) sweet corn (Zea mays L.) generally exhibits lower and more variable seed vigor than sweet corn based on the sugary (su) gene. We hypothesized that seeds expressing the sh-2 trait may react unfavorably to established harvesting and conditioning practices. This study was performed to test the effect of harvest and conditioning steps on viability and vigor of sh-2 sweet corn seed. Ten commercial sh-2 sweet corn seedlots in 1989 and nine seedlots in 1990 were sampled periodically during production and conditioning. Samples were taken at black layer, immediately prior to harvest, before husking, after husking, before shelling, after shelling, and at the end of the conditioning procedure. Shelling was the only operation that consistently damaged the seed, reducing standard germination from 72 to 60% in 1989 and from 71 to 66% in 1990, when averaged across all seedlots. Shelling reduced the final stand in the field from 24 to 16% in 1989 and 48 to 43% in 1990. Even when 1990 seed was treated with fungicide before planting, shelling still reduced final stand from 73 to 68%. Preharvest factors were more important determinants of vigor than conditioning operations, with final stands (untreated) produced from samples taken just prior to harvest ranging from 9 to 44% (median 27%) in 1989, and 19 to 81% (median 45%) in the 1990 samples. Germination percentages from the accelerated aging test and leachate conductance values were highly correlated with final stand experiment wide in 1989 and 1990 (0.45 < r < 0.58), but were usually not correlated with final stand within seedlot, suggesting that performance of the seed in vigor tests was associated mainly with preharvest factors. Research QuestionPoor and inconsistent stand-producing ability of supersweet corn seed is a significant production constraint for sweet corn growers. Kernel maturation, seed shape, and fragility of these hybrids are different from those of conventional sweet corn, and the seed crop is usually harvested at a kernel moisture content above 50%. This study was performed to identify possible detrimental effects of conventional seed harvest and conditioning procedures. Literature SummaryVery little published material exists about shrunken-2 (sh-2) sweet corn seed production. Results with other endosperm types have shown that pericarp cracking can impair seed performance. Shrunken-2 corn kernels appear to be damaged during both husking and shelling. Study DescriptionNineteen commercial sh-2 seedlots were sampled before, during, and after harvest and conditioning in 1989 and 1990. Fields were located in southwestern Idaho, mostly on silt loam soils, and were irrigated. As needed, samples were brought to the dry seed stage by manual methods thought to minimize seed damage. Samples were tested for germination, seed vigor, and field emergence. Applied QuestionsDo commercial harvest or conditioning operations impair seed quality of sh-2 corn? Only the shelling step measurably reduced seed quality. This was manifested by an average 8% decline in final stand, with both untreated and fungicide treated seed. This damage was detectable in the standard germination and leachate conductivity tests, but not in the accelerated aging test. How important are conditioning operations compared with preharvest factors in determining seedlot quality? Differences in performance between seedlots were much greater than any differences among different stages of the conditioning operation within seedlots. Lots had been harvested at different stages of maturity. Maturity, in addition to inherent genetic differences between hybrids, may have caused the large differences between seedlots. Results suggest that, in the context of standard, careful commercial practices, harvesting and conditioning operations are not as important as preharvest factors as sources of variability in sh-2 sweet corn seed vigor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3aseeds 3avigor 3aviability 3aharvesting 3ahulling 3ashelling 3aseed dressings 3aseed germination 3aseedling emergence1 aMohan, S.

An indoor experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) and PFSAs on soil respiration, sucrase activity, and urease activity at 0, 7, 14, and 28 d for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), and perfluorobutyric acid (PFBA), and at 14 and 28 d for perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorohexanoic sulfonic acid (PFHxS), and perfluorobutyric sulfonic acid (PFBS). PFCAs significantly inhibited soil respiration, with a significant negative correlation between respiration and PFBA (P < 0.05) at 28 d. Sucrase activities were initially inhibited by PFCAs, and then recovered. Urease activities were inhibited by PFOA at 14 d and by PFHxA at 14 and 28 d, but not by PFBA. PFOS and PFBS briefly enhanced soil respiration. PFOS inhibited sucrase activity. PFSAs significantly decreased urease activity in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. The chain-length dependence of the ecotoxicity of PFASs varied depending on concentration and time. Toxicity demonstrated a trend of initial decrease followed by increase with carbon chain length. Our results first revealed that the chain-length dependences of PFASs were also related to concentrations and exposure time.  aThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41807039) and the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2016M602168).  aPublisher supplied data  a41807039  a2016M602168 3acarbon 3aecotoxicology 3aenvironmental science 3aenzyme activity 3aexposure duration 3aperfluorohexane sulfonic acid 3aperfluorohexanoic acid 3aperfluorooctane sulfonic acid 3aperfluorooctanoic acid 3asoil respiration 3asucrose alpha-glucosidase 3asulfonic acids 3atoxicity 3aurease 0aPerfluoroalkyl substances 0asoil enzyme activity 0achain length dependence1 aXie, Yangyang1 aYu, Hui1 aSun, Tao1 aSong, Liping1 aWang, Fenghua0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2022 Apr. 3, v. 57, no. 4 p.284-296dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl11541x1532-41097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03601234.2022.20475633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03093naa a2200817 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100001900143245009300162300001600255520086300271592002801134650003101162650002601193650001301219650001301232650001101245650001301256650001701269650002101286650002601307650001601333650001001349650001201359650002101371650000901392650001901401650001601420650002401436650001501460700001501475700001601490700001801506700002301524700001901547700001901566700002601585700001701611700001601628700001601644700002401660700001401684700001101698700001501709700001601724700001701740700001301757700001701770700001801787700001701805700001901822700002201841700001801863700001601881700001501897700001701912700001601929700001701945700001401962700001601976700001801992700001702010700001902027773012502046856008302171852000902254655001202263IND6021047020221120213922.0170526e20111028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND602104702DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12115482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEpstein, J.

Pf sporozoites (PfSPZ) administered by mosquito bites are the only immunogens shown to induce such protection in humans. Such protection is thought to be mediated by CD8+ T cells in the liver that secrete interferon-γ (IFN-γ). We report that purified irradiated PfSPZ administered to 80 volunteers by needle inoculation in the skin was safe, but suboptimally immunogenic and protective. Animal studies demonstrated that intravenous immunization was critical for inducing a high frequency of PfSPZ-specific CD8+, IFN-γ–producing T cells in the liver (nonhuman primates, mice) and conferring protection (mice). Our results suggest that intravenous administration of this vaccine will lead to the prevention of infection with Pf malaria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCD8-positive T-lymphocytes 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aPrimates 3aantigens 3ahumans 3aimmunity 3aimmunization 3ainterferon-gamma 3aintravenous injection 3airradiation 3aliver 3amalaria 3amalaria vaccines 3amice 3amosquito bites 3asporozoites 3avaccine development 3avolunteers1 aTewari, K.1 aLyke, K.

The samples (feathers and faeces) used for DNA extraction were collected non-invasively from different localities of Lithuania in 2008–2010. In order to amplify the short but variable region of the left domain in the CR of mitochondrial DNA, a new primer pair (BON-F and BON-R) specific to the Hazel Grouse was designed. The selected 116 bp long fragment of the mitochondrial CR exhibited very high polymorphism. Among 51 novel sequences from Lithuania, 23 variable sites and 21 haplotypes with frequency values ranging from 1.96 to 17.65% were defined. The haplotype diversity (H) and nucleotide diversity (π) among haplotypes were 0.928 (± 0.018) and 0.03955 (± 0.00277), respectively. In order to compare genetic variability among Hazel Grouse populations, the newly obtained CR sequences, representing the Lithuanian population, were combined with sequences derived from GenBank, including 21 haplotypes from Poland. The haplotype network analysis revealed a complicated evolutionary history of the species. The neighbour-joining tree derived from 42 Hazel Grouse haplotypes shows a clear separation of two clades of evolutionarily distinct haplogroups both in Lithuania and Poland and some evidence of clustering related to sampling locations.  aPublisher supplied data 3afeathers 3afeces 3agene banks 3agenetic variation 3agrouse 3ahaplotypes 3amitochondrial DNA 3aLithuania 3aPoland 0aHazel Grouse 0aBonasa bonasia 0agenetic variability 0amitochondrial control region 0ahaplotype variability 0anon-invasive sampling1 aButkauskas, Dalius0 tZoology and ecology.g2012 Dec. 1, v. 22, no. 3-4 p.150-159dRoutledgewJournal:12157x2165-80137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21658005.2012.744868  aDNAL 7aarticle02133naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245014100164300001400305520090600319592002801225650001401253650001801267650002401285651002101309653002601330653002601356653002601382653001401408653002201422653001701444653002401461653001701485653002101502700002101523773011301544856008101657852000901738655001201747IND60775396720221120072542.0220424e20000701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077539672DNAL7 a10.1556/comec.1.2000.1.82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSadler, K.

Substratum affinities were characterized for dominant bryophytes. Logistic regression analysis was used to gain insight into the ecological determinants of fine scale (0.1 m2) bryophyte distribution by examining the predictive relationship between bryophyte species occurrence and localized environmental conditions, as well as the coverage of other bryophytes. The predictive relationships were compared to evaluate the relative importance of environmental factors versus interspecific interactions in structuring bryophyte communities. The results indicate that bryophytes show unique responses in their relationships to environmental conditions and other bryophytes. Positive feedback appears to be an important process among terrestrial bryophytes in subalpine forests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBryophyta 3amicrohabitats 3aregression analysis 3aBritish Columbia 0aMultivariate analysis 0aMultivariate analysis 0aMultivariate analysis 0aBryophyte 0aCommunity pattern 0aFacilitation 0aLogistic regression 0aMicrohabitat 0aSubalpine forest1 aBradfield, G.

(Moraceae), four Diels-Alder type adducts (DAs) [morusalbins A−D], one isoprenylated flavonoid [albanin T], together with twenty-one known phenolic compounds were isolated from its root bark. The chemical structures were established using NMR, MS, and ECD spectra. The DAs including morusalbins A−D, albasin B, macrourin G, yunanensin A, mulberrofuran G and K, and albanol B exhibited strong inhibitory activities against both protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) (IC50, 1.90−9.67 μM) and α-glucosidase (IC50, 2.29−5.91 μM). In the kinetic study, morusalbin D, albasin B, and macrourin G showed noncompetitive PTP1B inhibition, with Ki values of 0.33, 1.00, and 1.09 μM, respectively. In contrast, these DAs together with yunanensin A produced competitive inhibition of α-glucosidase, with Ki values of 0.64, 0.42, 2.42, and 1.19 μM, respectively. Furthermore, molecular docking studies revealed that these active DAs have high affinity and tight binding capacity towards the active site of PTP1B and α-glucosidase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMorus alba 3aactive ingredients 3aactive sites 3aalpha-glucosidase 3abark 3abinding capacity 3achalcone 3acomputer simulation 3acycloaddition reactions 3aenzyme inhibition 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amedicinal properties 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphenolic compounds 3aprotein-tyrosine-phosphatase 0aMorus alba 0aMoraceae 0aDiels–Alder type adducts 0aIsoprenylated flavonoid 0aProtein tyrosine phosphatase 1B 0aα-Glucosidase 0aMolecular docking1 aSeong, Su Hui1 aNguyễn, Tiến Đạt,1 aCho, Won-Kyung1 aAh, Kim Jeong1 aMa, Jin Yeul1 aWoo, Mi Hee1 aChoi, Jae Sue1 aMin, Byung Sun0 tPhytochemistry.g2018 Nov., v. 155 p.114-125dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44710x0031-94227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2018.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03149naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003700148245012900185300001600314520163900330592002801969650002201997650002402019650001702043650002002060650001502080650001702095650002902112650001702141650001402158650001502172653001902187653002902206653002202235653002602257653001902283653002802302700003502330700001802365700002502383700002702408700002402435773012902459856008202588852000902670655001202679IND60535987520221116205630.0190416e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053598752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bcab.2015.09.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDias, Fernanda Furlan Gonçalves10aSimplex centroid mixture design to improve l-asparaginase production in solid-state fermentation using agroindustrial wastes  ap. 528-534.  aAgroindustrial wastes, such as wheat bran, soybean meal, cottonseed meal and orange peel, were used individually or in mixtures as fermentation feedstock for l-asparaginase production from Aspergillus niger LBA 02 under solid-state fermentation using a simplex centroid mixture design. At 24h of fermentation, most of the interaction effects observed were antagonistic and the highest l-asparaginase activity was obtained with cottonseed meal as the feedstock. At 48h of fermentation, synergistic effects were found for two binary formulations and one quaternary formulation and increase in the l-asparaginase activity ranged from 0.69 to 73.44 fold. At 72h of fermentation, synergistic effects were also found for two binary and one quaternary formulation and increase ranged from 0.47 to 4.26 fold. At 96h of fermentation, synergistic effects were found for four binary and one quaternary formulation and increase ranged from 0.44 to 17.84 fold. The enzyme production reached the highest value after 96h of fermentation, and the optimum conditions predicted for l-asparaginase production were found to be a ternary mixture of wheat bran (1/3), soybean meal (1/3) and cottonseed meal (1/3) with increases of 71.53, 13.53 and 13.53 fold in l-asparaginase production as compared to the individual feedstocks, respectively. The predicted activity was 94.21Ug−1, which showed no significant difference (p<0.05) from the experimental l-asparaginase activity of 89.22Ug−1. Therefore, mixtures contained wheat bran (1/3), soybean meal (1/3) and cottonseed meal (1/3) may be added to improve the l-asparaginase production with low cost.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus niger 3aagricultural wastes 3aasparaginase 3acottonseed meal 3afeedstocks 3aorange peels 3asolid state fermentation 3asoybean meal 3asynergism 3awheat bran 0al-asparaginase 0aSolid-state fermentation 0aAspergillus niger 0aAgroindustrial wastes 0aMixture design 0aResponse surface design1 ade Castro, Ruann Janser Soares1 aOhara, André1 aNishide, Tânia Goia1 aBagagli, Marcela Pavan1 aSato, Hélia Harumi0 tBiocatalysis and agricultural biotechnology.g2015 Oct., v. 4, no. 4 p.528-534dElsevier LtdwJournal:23286x1878-81817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcab.2015.09.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02922naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245015800158300001800316520127300334592002801607650001501635650001101650650001701661650001201678650001201690650001501702650003101717650002001748650001601768650002101784650001901805650001401824650001101838650001301849650000701862650001501869650002101884650002301905650001301928650001601941650001601957650001301973700001901986700001602005700001502021700001902036700001602055700003402071700001502105700001902120773012202139856007402261852000902335655001202344IND60618302620221123003147.0181029e20180228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061830262DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ra00166a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Shaogang10aPerformance of a zeolite modified with N,N-dimethyl dehydroabietylamine oxide (DAAO) for adsorption of humic acid assessed in batch and fixed bed columns  ap. 9006-9016.  aFactors that affect adsorption of a synthetic humic acid (HA) on a zeolite modified with the surfactant N,N-dimethyl dehydroabietylamine oxide (DAAO) (SMZ) were investigated in batch and fixed bed column experiments. Adsorption increased with increasing HA concentrations and contact time, but decreased with increasing pH, temperature, and ionic strength. Adsorption of HA on SMZ was increased by the presence of the cations Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺, whereas anions such as NO₃⁻, HCO₃⁻, SO₄²⁻, and PO₄³⁻ showed the opposite trend, and competed with HA adsorption. HA adsorption on SMZ was well-fitted by pseudo-second order kinetics, and described by the Langmuir isotherm model. The maximum adsorption capacity in batch experiments calculated from the Langmuir adsorption isotherm was about 126 mg g⁻¹. Thermodynamic calculations showed that HA adsorption on the zeolite with bilayer DAAO coverage was spontaneous and exothermic. Optimum desorption was obtained using 0.1 M NaOH with a recovery of 94%. The HA adsorption capacity of SMZ at the breakthrough point was greatly influenced by bed depth, and could be described by the Thomas model. Adsorption mechanisms are interpreted as involving mainly hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aanions 3abicarbonates 3acalcium 3acations 3adesorption 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aheat production 3ahumic acids 3ahydrogen bonding 3aionic strength 3amagnesium 3amodels 3anitrates 3apH 3aphosphates 3asodium hydroxide 3asorption isotherms 3asulfates 3asurfactants 3atemperature 3azeolites1 aZhang, Wenzhen1 aTan, Xuecai1 aZhao, Fang1 aHuang, Wanting1 aDu, Hanchun1 aGoodman, B.

Fe/Al₂Oₓ catalysts were deposited on the surface of Al₂O₃ beads by sputtering and SWCNTs were grown on the beads by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) using C₂H₂ as a feedstock. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy showed that SWCNTs of 2–4nm in diameter grew and formed vertically aligned arrays of 0.5mm in height. Thermogravimetric analysis showed that the SWCNTs had a catalyst impurity level below 1wt.%. Furthermore, they were synthesized at a carbon yield as high as 65at.% with a gas residence time as short as <0.2s. Our fluidized-bed CVD, which efficiently utilizes the three-dimensional space of the reactor volume while retaining the characteristics of SWCNTs on substrates, is a promising option for mass-production of high-purity, sub-millimeter-long SWCNT arrays.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3acatalysts 3aceramics 3afeedstocks 3afluidized beds 3ascanning electron microscopy 3athermogravimetry 3atransmission electron microscopy 3avapors1 aSugime, Hisashi1 aHasegawa, Kei1 aOsawa, Toshio1 aNoda, Suguru0 tCarbon.g2012 Apr., v. 50, no. 4 p.1538-1545dElsevier Ltdx0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2011.11.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02759naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002700146245013000173300001800303520153200321592002801853650002101881650002601902650001001928650002301938650001701961650002101978650002501999650003102024650001902055700002002074700002602094700002902120700002402149773012102173856008202294852000902376655001202385IND60562126120221118032739.0170131e20160623xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056212612DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b027832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEleftheriou, Kleopatra10aComparative Experimental and Computational Study of Monoalkyl Chain Phosphatidylcholine-Containing Thermoresponsive Liposomes  ap. 5417-5428.  aLiposomes containing lysophospholipids are intensively studied as drug delivery systems that are stable at normal body temperature but exhibit fast release of their drug load at slightly elevated temperatures. In this study, the stability and release properties of dipalmitoylglycerophosphocholine (DPPC)-based liposomes incorporating the commonly used lysophosphatidylocholine (lyso-PC), and a series of monoalkyl chain ether-linked phosphatidylcholine, i.e., the biologically relevant monoalkyl chain platelet activating factor (PAF) and its derivatives lyso-PAF and methyl-PAF, were investigated. To this end a series of PEGylated small unilamellar liposomes with DPPC:monoalkyl lipid compositions of 5% and 10% molar ratio were prepared and compared with regard to stability (37 °C) and release properties at elevated temperatures (38–43 °C). All systems were characterized with respect to size distribution, ζ-potential, and phase transition characteristics. The presence of ether–lipids endows liposomes with superior (∼10% increase) release properties at 5% incorporation compared to lyso-PC, while at 10% molar ratio the formulations do not differ significantly, the release being close to 90%. The findings are supported by atomistic molecular dynamics simulations that suggest a correlation between the enhanced permeability and increased penetration of water molecules within the bilayers with density fluctuations resulting from the increased area-per-lipid and the disorder of the lysolipids alkyl chains.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody temperature 3adrug delivery systems 3adrugs 3amolecular dynamics 3apermeability 3aphase transition 3aphosphatidylcholines 3aplatelet-activating factor 3azeta potential1 aSideratou, Zili1 aThanassoulas, Angelos1 aPapakyriakou, Athanasios1 aTsiourvas, Dimitris0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2016 June 23, v. 120, no. 24 p.5417-5428dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcb.6b027833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01873naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245005500164300001800219520080500237592002801042650002301070650003701093650001101130650000901141650001301150650000901163650003301172650003701205650001101242700001901253700001801272700001901290700001701309773008001326856008401406852000901490655001201499IND60092258120221123025903.0141103e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009225812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2011.11.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, A.10aRapid synthesis of few-layer graphene over Cu foil  ap. 1546-1553.  aWe report a unique process for rapid synthesis of few-layer graphene films on Cu foil by microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD).

The process can produce films of controllable quality from amorphous to highly crystalline by adjusting plasma conditions during growth processes of ∼100s duration and with no supplemental substrate heating. Films have been characterized using Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results help to identify the stages involved in the MPCVD deposition of thin carbon films on Cu foil, and the findings open new pathways for a rapid growth of few-layer graphene films.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acopper 3afoil 3agraphene 3aheat 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atransmission electron microscopy 3avapors1 aVoevodin, A.A.1 aZemlyanov, D.1 aZakharov, D.N.1 aFisher, T.S.0 tCarbon.g2012 Apr., v. 50, no. 4 p.1546-1553dElsevier Ltdx0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2011.11.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03067naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006200147245010500209300001800314500002000332520152200352592002801874596005101902650001201953650001201965650001101977650001901988650001002007650001202017650001202029650001502041650001402056650001502070650001302085650002102098650001902119650000702138650001502145650001402160650001302174650001102187650000902198650002202207650001702229651001302246700002202259700001902281700001902300773011502319856008202434852000902516655001202525IND60585713420221120080708.0220815e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058571342DNAL7 a10.1007/s11284-017-1522-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChikorowondo, Gift1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8748-338010aInfluence of abandoned cattle enclosures on plant assemblages and herbivory in a semi‐arid savanna  ap. 1023-1033.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn semi‐arid savannas, abandoned cattle (Bos taurus) enclosures or kraals have been demonstrated to be nutrient‐hotspots for large herbivores. In this study, we examined the interaction between herbivory and forage quality, structure and diversity at 12 kraals (abandoned for 22 years) paired with savanna control plots in Save Valley Conservancy, Zimbabwe. Plant diversity was not different between sites. Herbaceous cover was higher and woody species density lower on abandoned kraals than control plots. Furthermore, abandoned kraals had higher herbaceous productivity and foliar nutrient concentration for grasses than forbs. The abandoned kraals had higher concentration of soil nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na), organic carbon (C) compared with control plots and a slightly acidic pH. Grasses were grazed more than forbs on nutrient‐rich abandoned kraals. Only herbaceous biomass for grasses had a significant influence on the interaction between plants and herbivory. No clear relationships were observed between forage quality and herbivory and plant species diversity. Abandoned kraals provide patches of nutrient‐rich forage, increasing savanna heterogeneity and in turn influence grazing patterns of large herbivores, and therefore influence ecosystem functioning. A conservation monitoring programme is recommended on such nutrient‐rich patches as they serve as foraging‐hotspots for herbivores in a dystrophic African semi‐arid savanna.  aPublisher supplied data  cDeutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD) 3abiomass 3acalcium 3acattle 3aforage quality 3aforbs 3agrasses 3agrazing 3aherbivores 3amagnesium 3amonitoring 3anitrogen 3anutrient content 3aorganic carbon 3apH 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3asavannas 3asodium 3asoil 3aspecies diversity 3awoody plants 3aZimbabwe1 aMuvengwi, Justice1 aMbiba, Monicah1 aGandiwa, Edson0 tEcological research.g2017 Nov., v. 32, no. 6 p.1023-1033dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl3870047x0912-38147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11284-017-1522-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02373naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005900140245005300199300001600252500002000268520098800288592002801276596004401304596004201348596002901390650003801419650002301457650001601480650001101496650001401507650001301521650001701534650001301551650001301564650001601577651001301593700002301606700002401629700002001653700002001673773012501693856007501818961001301893852000901906655001201915IND60789375320221120031006.0220820e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078937532DNAL7 a10.1002/plr2.200512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKelly, James D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5319-412610aRegistration of ‘Coho’ light red kidney bean  ap. 134-138.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a‘Coho’ light red kidney bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) (Reg. no. CV‐330, PI 692133), developed by Michigan State University AgBioResearch, was released in 2019 as an upright, full‐season cultivar that possesses acceptable canning quality and partial resistance to common bacterial blight and root rots. Coho was developed using the pedigree breeding method to the F₄ generation followed by pure line selection for disease, agronomic, and quality traits. In 4 yr of field trials, Coho yielded 3,644 kg ha⁻¹, flowered in 39 d, and matured in 99 d on average. Plants averaged 50 cm in height, with lodging resistance score of 1.1 and seed weight of 53.8 g 100 seed⁻¹. Coho is resistant to race 73 of anthracnose and produced a top necrosis reaction to strain NL 3 of Bean common mosaic necrosis virus. Coho produces seed that meets industry standards for dry seed packaging and was rated satisfactory in overall canned bean quality in the light red kidney bean seed class.  aPublisher supplied data  cMichigan State University AgBioResearch  cMichigan Crop Improvement Association  cMichigan Bean Commission 3aBean common mosaic necrosis virus 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aanthracnose 3ablight 3acultivars 3aindustry 3akidney beans 3anecrosis 3apedigree 3aseed weight 3aMichigan1 aVarner, Gregory V.1 aChilvers, Martin I.1 aCichy, Karen A.1 aWright, Evan M.0 tJournal of plant registrations.g2020 May, v. 14, no. 2 p.134-138dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:6195x1936-52097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/plr2.200513Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02822naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245016100157300001800318520145600336592002801792650001401820650001401834650002301848650002701871650002301898650002001921650001801941650001201959650001801971650001301989650001102002650001702013650001602030650002502046650001902071650001502090700001902105700002602124700001702150773012602167856007402293852000902367655001202376IND60640020520221118142025.0190503e20171211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064002052DNAL7 a10.1039/c7gc03279j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerma, Divya10aUltrasound-assisted high-yield multicomponent synthesis of triazolo[1,2-a]indazole-triones using silica-coated ZnO nanoparticles as a heterogeneous catalyst  ap. 5885-5899.  aWe report here comprehensively detailed systematic investigations into a new method of an ultrasound-assisted synthesis of 4(a–m) triazolo[1,2-a]indazole-triones (TAITs) using the multicomponent condensation reaction among dimedone, 4-phenylurazole and various individual aryl aldehydes in the presence/absence of SiO₂, ZnO and SiO₂-coated ZnO (ZnO@SiO₂) nanoparticles (NPs) or nanorods as heterogeneous catalysts in deionized water (DIW) at considerably low temperature (∼60 °C). For this, the nanorods are synthesized in an efficient, facile and scalable wet chemical route in DIW at 27 °C. Oxygen-excessive ZnO nanorods of ∼21 nm diameter with up to nearly 259 nm length become oxygen-deficient ZnO@SiO₂ of about 48 nm diameter with rather complicated internal structures and a smooth-looking surface. Remarkably, attributed to oxygen deficiency, ZnO@SiO₂ NPs exhibit excellent catalytic activities with good to high yields of TAIT products, brilliant recyclability up to six runs, over −30 mV zeta potential (ζ) values, the smallest hydrodynamic diameter (HD) of 752 nm, best dispersion stability and largest specific surface area of 97.5 m² g⁻¹. Therefore, the greenest reaction medium for the syntheses of both these catalysts as well as TAITs was realized, making it an environmentally friendly doubly green reaction with a wide application potential due to its high efficiency, ease of handling and cost effectiveness.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaldehydes 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acondensation reactions 3acost effectiveness 3agreen chemistry 3ahydrodynamics 3ahypoxia 3ananoparticles 3ananorods 3asilica 3asurface area 3atemperature 3aultrasonic treatment 3azeta potential 3azinc oxide1 aSharma, Vikash1 aOkram, Gunadhor Singh1 aJain, Shubha0 tGreen chemistry.g2017 Dec. 11, v. 19, no. 24 p.5885-5899dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7gc03279j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01231naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245016600160300001300326520023000339592002800569650001200597650001300609650002000622650001100642700002300653700002300676700002300699773012400722856007400846852000900920655001200929IND60640020720221118142017.0190503e20170403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064002072DNAL7 a10.1039/c7gc90023f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlipour, Siamak10aCorrection: High yield 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural production from biomass sugars under facile reaction conditions: a hybrid enzyme- and chemo-catalytic technology  ap. 1782.  aCorrection for ‘High yield 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural production from biomass sugars under facile reaction conditions: a hybrid enzyme- and chemo-catalytic technology’ by Siamak Alipour, Green Chem., 2016, 18, 4990–4998.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3afurfural 3agreen chemistry 3asugars1 aRelue, Patricia A.1 aViamajala, Sridhar1 aVaranasi, Sasidhar0 tGreen chemistry.g2017 Apr. 3, v. 19, no. 7 p.1782-1782dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7gc90023f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03600naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245015400184300001800338520173300356592002802089650002102117650002402138650001702162650001502179650001402194650001202208650001402220650001602234650001002250650001502260650001202275650001302287650003002300650001302330650003802343650005502381650002102436650004502457650004202502650003102544650002002575650004502595650001602640650003902656650004702695650004802742700002302790700001902813700001702832773011602849856004802965852000903013655001203022IND50066437320221118234622.0130714e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006643732DNAL7 a229408022pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-012-4366-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Liu-Tzea10aDirected evolution of poly[(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate] depolymerase using cell surface display system: functional importance of asparagine at position 285  ap. 4859-4871.  aPoly[(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate] (PHB) depolymerase from Ralstonia pickettii T1 (PhaZRpiT1) consists of three functional domains to effectively degrade solid PHB materials, and its catalytic domain catalyzes the ester bond cleavage of the substrate. We performed the directed evolution of PhaZRpiT1 targeted at the catalytic domain in combination with the cell surface display method to effectively screen for mutants with improved p-nitrophenyl butyrate (pNPC4) activity. Mutated PhaZRpiT1 genes generated by error-prone PCR were fused to the oprI gene to display them as fusion proteins on Escherichia coli cell surface. Some cells displaying the mutant enzymes showed a two- to fourfold increase in pNPC4 hydrolysis activity relative to cells displaying wild-type enzyme. These mutant genes were recombined by a staggered extension process and the recombined enzymes were displayed to result in a five- to eightfold higher pNPC4 hydrolysis activity than the wild type. To further evaluate the mutation effects, unfused and undisplayed enzymes were prepared and applied to the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl esters having different chain lengths (pNPCn; n = 2-6) and PHB degradation. One specific second-generation mutant showed an approximately tenfold increase in maximum rate for pNPC3 hydrolysis, although its PHB degradation efficiency at 1 μg/mL of enzyme concentration was approximately 3.5-fold lower than that of the wild type. Gene analysis showed that N285D or N285Y mutations were found in six of the seven improved second-generation mutants, indicating that Asn285 probably participates in the regulation of substrate recognition and may be more favorable for PHB degradation process than other amino acid residues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aRalstonia pickettii 3aactive sites 3aasparagine 3abutyrates 3aenzymes 3aevolution 3agene fusion 3agenes 3ahydrolysis 3amutants 3amutation 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aproteins 2aAsparaginexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCarboxylic Ester Hydrolasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCatalytic Domain 2aCell Surface Display Techniquesxmethods 2aDirected Molecular Evolutionxmethods 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aGene Expression 2aMembrane Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMutagenesis 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aRalstonia pickettiixenzymologyxgenetics. 2aRecombinant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aHiraishi, Tomohiro1 aKumar, Sudesh,1 aMaeda, Mizuo0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2013 June, v. 97, no. 11 p.4859-4871dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-012-4366-8  aDNAL 7aarticle02240naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001700161245012000178300001600298500000900314520105600323592002801379650002801407650002701435650002001462650000901482650001301491650001301504650002201517650001901539650002401558650000901582650001201591651001101603773014701614856009601761852000901857655001201866IND60668015320221122041237.0191125e197805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066801532DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1978.03615995004200030014x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHagedorn, C.10aEffectiveness of Rhizobium trifolii Populations Associated with Trifolium subterraneum L. in Southwest Oregon Soils  ap. 447-451.  aepub  aIndigenous Rhizobium trifolii populations were found to nodulate Trifolium subterraneum L. (c.v. Mt. Barker) but were largely ineffective or poorly effective in nitrogen fixation with this host. The rhizobia were isolated from numerous locations in southwest Oregon which contained subclover stands of widely varying quality. Rhizobium populations were greater in soils containing subclover stands while smaller populations were detected both in soils which had previously contained a subclover stand and those soils which had never been planted to subclover. Regression analysis of soil and rhizobia data showed significant correlations between the size of the rhizobial populations, the degree of fineness of texture (% silt + % clay) and the organic matter content while effectiveness was associated with the level of base saturation and the content of exchangeable bases. The requirements for a high quality inoculum in the presence of large ineffective populations and the agronomic implications for increasing subclover production are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhizobium leguminosarum 3aTrifolium subterraneum 3abase saturation 3aclay 3afineness 3ainoculum 3anitrogen fixation 3aorganic matter 3aregression analysis 3asilt 3atexture 3aOregon0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1978 May, v. 42, no. 3 p.447-451dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1978.03615995004200030014x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03508naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005900140245010000199300001600299500002000315506002800335506003000363520150100393592002801894596008301922596007902005596005602084596005602140596004302196596008702239506003702326650002902363650003702392650001002429650001402439650001402453650002002467650001602487650001202503650002302515650001702538650001702555650001502572651001702587700002602604700001602630700002002646700002402666700002102690773012502711856007502836903002202911852000902933655001202942IND60789375720221207074540.0220820e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078937572DNAL7 a10.1002/plr2.200132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOsorno, Juan M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0905-352310a‘ND Pegasus’, a new great northern bean with upright plant architecture and high seed yield  ap. 110-116.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Access  aWiley License Information  a‘ND Pegasus’ great northern bean (PVP‐201900176, Reg. no. CV‐328, PI 690448) is a new cultivar developed by the dry bean breeding program at North Dakota State University and released by the North Dakota Agricultural Experiment Station. Great northern bean is a market class of significant economic importance in the United States. In North Dakota especially, biotic and abiotic stresses are the main factors for seed yield reductions. Between 2013 and 2018, ND Pegasus, along with great northern cultivars commonly grown in the region, was tested across more than 35 environments in North Dakota and other states. Seed yield of ND Pegasus was significantly higher by 560, 414, and 571 kg ha‐¹ compared with ‘Matterhorn’, ‘Aries’, and ‘Powderhorn’, respectively. However, seed yield of ND Pegasus and ‘Taurus’ were similar. ND Pegasus has an excellent upright architecture that improves the efficiency of direct harvest. Based on greenhouse and DNA marker data, ND Pegasus is resistant to Bean common mosaic virus and has improved resistance to white mold. ND Pegasus has excellent seed quality (color, shape, and size) and is larger than most commercial cultivars commonly grown in the region. ND Pegasus has acceptable canning quality based on some pilot testing. The average plant height of ND Pegasus is 71 cm, and 100‐seed weight 36.8 g. It matures in approximately 103 d. Other agronomic traits of economic importance are within commercial acceptable ranges.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cNorth Dakota Department of Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100011462  aND01508cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture  aND01589cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture  cNorth Dakota Department of Agriculture  aDry Bean Improvement for the Northern PlainscNortharvest Bean Growers Association0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBean common mosaic virus 3aagricultural experiment stations 3acolor 3acultivars 3adry beans 3agenetic markers 3agreenhouses 3amarkets 3aplant architecture 3aplant height 3aseed quality 3aseed yield 3aNorth Dakota1 aVander Wal, Albert J.1 aPosch, John1 aSimons, Kristin1 aGrafton, Kenneth F.1 aPasche, Julie S.0 tJournal of plant registrations.g2020 May, v. 14, no. 2 p.110-116dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:6195x1936-52097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/plr2.200133Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aDNAL 7aarticle04004naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245016600162520207800328592002802406650002002434650002102454650001702475650001102492650001202503650001302515650002602528650001202554650002702566650002602593650002402619650002602643650001202669650001402681650002202695650002302717650001302740650001602753650002102769650001102790650001702801650001802818650002602836650000902862650002102871650001702892651001402909700002102923700002002944700001902964700005202983700001803035700002103053700006503074700002803139773012203167856008003289852000903369655001203378IND60651359720221122051559.0190711e20170717xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065135972DNAL7 a10.3390/resources60300262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrau, Felix10aImpact of Fecal Sludge and Municipal Solid Waste Co-Compost on Crop Growth of <em>Raphanus Sativus</em> L. and <em>Capsicum Anuum</em> L. under Stress Conditions  aCo-composted dewatered faecal sludge (FS) with organic fractions of municipal solid waste (MSW) has a high potential to be used as an agricultural resource in Sri Lanka. In addition to options for cost recovery in waste management, closing the nutrient and carbon cycles between urban and rural areas, substitution of mineral fertilizers, reduced pollution. and the restoration of degraded arable land are possible with important benefits. Up to now little is known about the usage of FS-MSW as fertilizer and it needs to be studied in order to achieve a better understanding and generate application recommendations. The aim of these experiments has been to evaluate the possibility of substituting mineral fertilization. Two field experiments were conducted on sandy loam to assess the effects of MSW compost and FS-MSW co-compost, its pelletized forms, and mineral-enriched FS-MSW on crop growth. As a short-term crop Raphanus sativus “Beeralu rabu” (radish) was studied for 50 days in a randomized complete block design (RCDB). Results show that, under drought conditions, FS-MSW co-compost increased the yield significantly, while MSW and FS-MSW compost enabled the highest survival rate of the plants. Similarly, the second field trial with a long-term crop, Capsicum anuum “CA-8” (capsicum), was planted as RCBD, using the same treatments, for a cultivation period of 120 days. Results display that during a drought followed by water saturated soil conditions co-compost treatments achieved comparable yields and increased the survival rate significantly compared to the control, fertilized with urea, triple super phosphate, and muriate of potash. Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) revealed that pelletizing decreased the monetary benefits if only fertilizer value is considered. It can be concluded that, under drought and water stress, co-compost ensures comparable yields and enables more resistance, but might not be economical viable as a one-crop fertilizer. These findings need to be validated with further trials under different climate regimes and soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapsicum annuum 3aRaphanus sativus 3aarable soils 3acarbon 3aclimate 3acomposts 3acost benefit analysis 3adrought 3afertilizer application 3afield experimentation 3amineral fertilizers 3amunicipal solid waste 3apellets 3apollution 3apollution control 3apotassium chloride 3aradishes 3arural areas 3asandy loam soils 3asludge 3asoil quality 3asurvival rate 3atriple superphosphate 3aurea 3awaste management 3awater stress 3aSri Lanka1 aDrechsel, Nikita1 aHaering, Volker1 aTrautz, Dieter1 aWeerakkody, Weerakkodige Jayantha Sisira Kumara1 aDrechsel, Pay1 aMarschner, Bernd1 aDissanayake, Dissanayake Mudiyanselage Priyanga Sashikanjali1 aSinnathamby, Vijayapala0 tResources.g2017 July 17, v. 6, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21558x2079-92767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/resources60300263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02820naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245009400173300001800267520139400285592002801679650002301707650001301730650002501743650001701768650001301785650001601798650001701814650001501831650001101846650002101857650002301878650001801901650001101919650002301930650002001953650001401973650001501987650002602002650002302028650002702051650001302078650001302091650001902104773011302123856008102236852000902317655001202326IND50059912320221120212042.0160903e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005991232DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-012-1350-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoganlar, Zeynep Banu10aPhysiological and Genetic Responses to Pesticide Mixture Treatment of Veronica beccabunga  ap. 6201-6212.  aThe effects of a five-pesticide mixture on pesticide accumulation, phytohormone levels (indole-3-acetic acid, gibberellic acid, jasmonic acid, and salicylic acid), pigment contents (total chlorophyll and carotenoid), antioxidant enzyme (catalase and guaiacol peroxidase) activities, lipid peroxidation product (malondialdehyde), and DNA profiles were investigated in the leaves of Veronica beccabunga. Laboratory-acclimatized plants were treated with a mix of five pesticides (atrazine, disulfoton, chlorpyrifos, metalaxyl, and ethion) in doses of 50 ppt, 1 ppb, 100 ppb, and 1 ppm for 1, 3, and 6 days. The accumulation of each pesticide, from highest to lowest, was as follows: chlorpyrifos, atrazine, metalaxyl, disulfoton, and ethion. The amounts of total chlorophyll and protein decreased with increased pesticide concentration. Antioxidant enzyme activities and malondialdehyde amount increased linearly with increasing pesticide exposure. However, the highest pesticide concentration caused decreases in guaiacol peroxidase (POD) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) content at all treatment times. Both jasmonic and salicylic acid levels increased with pesticide exposure and decreased gradually after. It was also determined that application of the pesticide mixture affected the DNA profiles of V. beccabunga. The most band changes were detected on the sixth day of treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA fingerprinting 3aVeronica 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aatrazine 3achlorophyll 3achlorpyrifos 3adisulfoton 3aethion 3agibberellic acid 3aindole acetic acid 3ajasmonic acid 3aleaves 3alipid peroxidation 3amalondialdehyde 3ametalaxyl 3aperoxidase 3apesticide application 3apesticide mixtures 3aphysiological response 3apigments 3aproteins 3asalicylic acid0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2012 Nov., v. 223, no. 9 p.6201-6212dSpringer Netherlandsx0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-012-1350-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03050naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245010700163300001800270500000900288520164700297592002801944650001501972650002601987650001202013650002002025650001202045650002602057650002102083650001202104650001302116650001402129650001902143650001302162650001802175650001302193650002402206650001202230650001702242650000902259650002102268651002802289651002302317773014002340856007902480852000902559655001202568IND60668015620221121235347.0191228e200409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066801562DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj2004.17202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFox, Thomas R.10aNitrogen Mineralization Following Fertilization of Douglas-fir Forests with Urea in Western Washington  ap. 1720-1728.  aepub  aNitrogen mineralization following repeated applications of urea fertilizer was determined in the A horizon soil from two stands of Douglas-fir [Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco] in the Cascade Mountains of Washington. Repeated applications of urea at rates ranging from 0 to 600 kg N ha⁻¹ were made at annual and 5-yr intervals over a 6-yr period. Nitrogen fertilization increased N mineralization potential in these soils. However, soil N mineralization followed a quadratic relationship with the total amount of N applied in fertilizer over the 6-yr treatment period, increasing up to total application rates of 450 kg N ha⁻¹ and then declining at higher rates. The decrease in N mineralization rates at the high N fertilization rates may be due to changes in the quality of soil organic matter, which reduced the effectiveness of extracellular enzymes and decreases the rate of decomposition and mineralization. Soil pH dropped following urea fertilization, with greater declines observed in the highest rates of urea fertilizer. Decreases in extractable Ca and Mg levels in the soil accompanied the decline in soil pH. These results suggest that high rates of nitrification occurred and that nitrate leaching was stripping Ca and Mg from the cation-exchange complex in these soils. It appears that repeated applications of urea fertilizer at low to intermediate rates may increase long-term N availability and thus improve soil quality. However, annual applications of high rates of urea may decrease soil quality because under these circumstances N mineralization did not increase and there was a loss of cations from the soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aA horizons 3aPseudotsuga menziesii 3acalcium 3acation exchange 3acations 3aextracellular enzymes 3afertilizer rates 3aforests 3aleaching 3amagnesium 3amineralization 3anitrates 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3asoil organic matter 3asoil pH 3asoil quality 3aurea 3aurea fertilizers 3aCascade Mountain region 3aWashington (state)0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2004 Sept., v. 68, no. 5 p.1720-1728dSoil Science SocietywJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2004.17203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03644naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005900140245013300199300001600332500002000348506002800368506003000396520153100426592002801957596008301985596007902068596008702147596005602234596005602290596007202346506003702418650002902455650003702484650002102521650001102542650001402553650001402567650001402581650001702595650001202612650001202624650001702636650001402653650001502667651001702682651001702699700002602716700001602742700002002758700002402778700002102802773012502823856007502948903002203023852000903045655001203054IND60789375920221207074553.0220820e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078937592DNAL7 a10.1002/plr2.200122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOsorno, Juan M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0905-352310a‘ND Whitetail’, a new white kidney bean with high seed yield and intermediate resistance to white mold and bacterial blights  ap. 102-109.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Access  aWiley License Information  a‘ND Whitetail’ (Reg. no. CV‐327, PI 690447; PVP‐201900175) is a new white kidney bean cultivar developed by the dry bean breeding program at North Dakota State University and released by the North Dakota Agricultural Experiment Station. Within the Andean gene pool, kidney beans are the most economically important market classes worldwide, with dark‐red kidney bean being the most commonly grown class, followed by light‐red and white kidneys. There is an increased interest in white kidney bean in the United States, mostly stimulated by novel research claiming additional health benefits related to its consumption. However, biotic and abiotic stresses still limit the full seed yield potential of kidney bean cultivars. Averaged across environments, the seed yield of ND Whitetail was significantly higher by 650, 976, and 459 kg ha⁻¹ than ‘Beluga’, ‘Silver Cloud’, and ‘Snowdon’, respectively. ND Whitetail has an average plant height of 52 cm and matures in approximately 101 d. Results from canning tests showed that ND Whitetail received a canning score of 5.1. ND Whitetail has high levels of resistance to white mold and Bean common mosaic virus (BCMV) along with intermediate resistance to bacterial diseases. Given the superior seed yield quality and agronomic performance, useful agronomic traits such as seed size, BCMV resistance, white mold and halo blight resistance, and superior canning quality, ND Whitetail could become an important white kidney cultivar in the United States.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cNorth Dakota Department of Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100011462  aDry Bean Improvement for the Northern PlainscNortharvest Bean Growers Association  aND01508cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture  aND01589cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture  aSpecialty Crop Block GrantscNorth Dakota Department of Agriculture0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBean common mosaic virus 3aagricultural experiment stations 3aagronomic traits 3ablight 3acultivars 3adry beans 3agene pool 3akidney beans 3akidneys 3amarkets 3aplant height 3aseed size 3aseed yield 3aAndes region 3aNorth Dakota1 aVander Wal, Albert J.1 aPosch, John1 aSimons, Kristin1 aGrafton, Kenneth F.1 aPasche, Julie S.0 tJournal of plant registrations.g2020 May, v. 14, no. 2 p.102-109dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:6195x1936-52097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/plr2.200123Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aDNAL 7aarticle02878naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245012600167300001400293520113800307592002801445650003401473650000801507650001501515650002701530650002601557650003001583650002901613650002501642650001701667650001601684650001401700650001501714650002101729650002301750650001301773650002201786650001001808650001101818650002701829650001301856651002101869653001401890653001401904653001501918653001501933653001801948700001801966700002301984700002302007700001702030700002202047700002202069773009302091856008302184852000902267655001202276IND60593841420221120131530.0190417e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059384142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fbio.2018.02.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaba, Waqas N.10aSome nutraceutical properties of fenugreek seeds and shoots (Trigonella foenum-graecum L.) from the high Himalayan region  ap. 31-37.  aThe antioxidant activity of fenugreek seeds and shoots of the fenugreek plant were compared in three different solvents (methanol, diethyl ether and water) using a cold extraction and soxhlet extraction. Various antioxidant assays i.e., DPPH• scavenging activity, FRAP, reducing power and lipid peroxidation were done. Samples were further studied for total phenolics, flavonoids and proanthocyanidins. Soxhlet extraction was more effective than cold extraction and hence soxhlet extracts of both shoots and seeds were further analyzed for DNA damage and antibacterial properties. Diethyl ether extracts of both seeds and shoots showed high DNA protective properties. Methanolic extracts of the shoots showed the highest antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with maximum zones of inhibition of 15 and 14 mm, respectively, at 500 mg/ml. In all of the assays the fenugreek shoot extracts showed higher antioxidant, antimicrobial and DNA protective properties than fenugreek seeds, suggesting that the fenugreek shoots are the better source of antioxidant compounds than fenugreek seeds.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aTrigonella foenum-graecum 3aantibacterial properties 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aethyl ether 3afenugreek 3aflavonoids 3afunctional foods 3alipid peroxidation 3amethanol 3aproanthocyanidins 3aseeds 3ashoots 3asolid phase extraction 3asolvents 3aHimalayan region 0aFenugreek 0aPhenolics 0aFlavonoids 0aDNA damage 0aAntimicrobial1 aTabasum, Qazi1 aMuzzaffar, Sabeera1 aMasoodi, Farooq A.1 aWani, Idrees1 aGanie, Showkat A.1 aBhat, Mohd Munaff0 tFood bioscience.g2018 June, v. 23 p.31-37dElsevier LtdwJournal:21610x2212-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fbio.2018.02.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04578naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245012800170300001600298500001900314520172900333536082002062592002802882596012902910596009403039596007103133596008203204650003203286650002503318650002003343650001303363650001203376650001603388650001903404650001503423650003303438650001403471650001603485650001403501650001303515653001403528653001803542653001503560653001303575653001503588700002203603700002003625700001903645700002803664700001703692700002803709700002003737700002303757773010203780856008503882852000903967655001203976IND60695550120221119161909.0200517e20180304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069555012DNAL7 a10.1080/00275514.2018.14481672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAshrafi, Samad10aInhabiting plant roots, nematodes, and truffles—Polyphilus, a new helotialean genus with two globally distributed species  ap. 286-299.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFungal root endophytes, including the common group of dark septate endophytes (DSEs), represent different taxonomic groups and potentially diverse life strategies. In this study, we investigated two unidentified helotialean lineages found previously in a study of DSE fungi of semiarid grasslands, from several other sites, and collected recently from a pezizalean truffle ascoma and eggs of the cereal cyst nematode Heterodera filipjevi. The taxonomic positions and phylogenetic relationships of 21 isolates with different hosts and geographic origins were studied in detail. Four loci, namely, nuc rDNA ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 (internal transcribed spacer [ITS]), partial 28S nuc rDNA (28S), partial 18S nuc rDNA (18S), and partial RNA polymerase II second-largest subunit (RPB2), were amplified and sequenced for molecular phylogenetic analyses. Analyses of similar ITS sequences from public databases revealed two globally distributed lineages detected in several biomes from different geographic regions. The host interaction of isolates from nematodes was examined using in vitro bioassays, which revealed that the fungi could penetrate nematode cysts and colonize eggs of H. filipjevi, confirming observations from field-collected samples. This is the first report of a DSE, and we are not aware of other helotialean fungal species colonizing the eggs of a plant-parasitic nematode. Neither conidiomata and conidia nor ascomata formation was detected in any of the isolates. Based on molecular phylogenetic analyses, these isolates represent a distinct lineage within the Helotiales in the Hyaloscyphaceae. For this lineage, we propose here the new genus Polyphilus represented by two new species, P. sieberi and P. frankenii.  aThis work was supported by the Hungarian Scientific Research Fund (NKFIH/OTKA K109102), the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), and the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre (CIMMYT).

Economy of scale has been demonstrated to provide the ultimate selection factor driving the evolution of masting, for example, in terms of the predator‐satiation and pollination‐efficiency hypotheses; however, its physiological mechanism is still poorly understood. The resource budget (RB) model assumes that an individual plant requires more resources to flower and fruit than it gains in a year, and therefore only flowers when a specific threshold amount of stored resources is surpassed. Although the RB models have been well explored theoretically, including for resource depletion and pollen coupling, empirical data to support these assumptions are still disputed. Here, we explore the extent to which the RB model applies to masting tree species, focusing on the dynamics of carbon and nitrogen resources in natural temperate forests. There is little empirical evidence that plants use carbohydrates stored over several years to produce fruits; however, nitrogen stores in temperate trees are more commonly depleted after masting. We review the internal nitrogen cycle including resorption during leaf senescence, storage and remobilization, discussing the effect of masting on these processes. Overall, carbohydrates and nitrogen are clearly involved in the proximate mechanisms driving mast seeding, but the determinant resource seems to be species specific.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbohydrates 3acarbon 3acrops 3aeconomies of scale 3afruits 3aleaves 3amodels 3anitrogen 3anitrogen cycle 3aperennials 3apollen 3aresorption 3asowing 3atemperate forests 3atrees1 aKabeya, Daisuke0 tEcological research.g2017 Nov., v. 32, no. 6 p.771-778dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl3870047x0912-38147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11284-017-1494-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01131naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001100140245010800151300001300259520017000272592002800442650001400470650002000484650002100504700001800525700001500543700001600558700001700574700001700591773012600608856007400734852000900808655001200817IND60640021220221118142010.0190503e20171211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064002122DNAL7 a10.1039/c7gc90120h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Lu10aCorrection: Design of a thermoregulated phase-separable system for homogeneous enzymolysis of cellulose  ap. 5971.  aCorrection for ‘Design of a thermoregulated phase-separable system for homogeneous enzymolysis of cellulose’ by Lu Li et al., Green Chem., 2015, 17, 3067–3074.  aPublisher supplied data 3acellulose 3agreen chemistry 3athermoregulation1 aLiu, Xianhong1 aYu, Shitao1 aLiu, Shiwei1 aLiu, Fusheng1 aXie, Congxia0 tGreen chemistry.g2017 Dec. 11, v. 19, no. 24 p.5971-5971dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7gc90120h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02410naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245008400167520136600251592002801617650001201645650001301657650002101670650001501691650002601706650001701732650002001749650001501769650001501784650001101799651001801810700002101828773012201849856008001971852000902051655001202060IND60651360020221121164404.0190711e20170720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065136002DNAL7 a10.3390/resources60300292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrakauer, Nir Y.10aInterannual Variability and Seasonal Predictability of Wind and Solar Resources  aSolar and wind resources available for power generation are subject to variability due to meteorological factors. Here, we use a new global climate reanalysis product, Version 2 of the NASA Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2), to quantify interannual variability of monthly-mean solar and wind resource from 1980 to 2016 at a resolution of about 0.5 degrees. We find an average coefficient of variation (CV) of 11% for monthly-mean solar radiation and 8% for wind speed. Mean CVs were about 25% greater over ocean than over land and, for land areas, were greatest at high latitude. The correlation between solar and wind anomalies was near zero in the global mean, but markedly positive or negative in some regions. Both wind and solar variability were correlated with values of climate modes such as the Southern Oscillation Index and Arctic Oscillation, with correlations in the Northern Hemisphere generally stronger during winter. We conclude that reanalysis solar and wind fields could be helpful in assessing variability in power generation due to interannual fluctuations in the solar and wind resource. Skillful prediction of these fluctuations seems to be possible, particularly for certain regions and seasons, given the persistence or predictability of climate modes with which these fluctuations are associated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3alatitude 3apower generation 3aprediction 3aretrospective studies 3asolar energy 3asolar radiation 3awind power 3awind speed 3awinter 3aArctic region1 aCohan, Daniel S.0 tResources.g2017 July 20, v. 6, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21558x2079-92767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/resources60300293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04786naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245016400172300001600336500001900352520148900371536115301860592002803013596008503041596008303126596008303209596008303292596008303375596008303458596003503541650001603576650001103592650001503603650001003618650001403628650001603642650001403658650001503672651001103687651002803698653002203726653001403748653001803762653001803780653001503798653001503813700002503828700002603853700001803879700002603897700002303923700002103946700002103967773010203988856008504090852000904175655001204184IND60695550220221119162809.0200517e20180102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069555022DNAL7 a10.1080/00275514.2018.14481982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhite, Merlin M.10aNew species and emendations of Orphella: taxonomic and phylogenetic reassessment of the genus to establish the Orphellales, for stonefly gut fungi with a twist  ap. 147-178.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe consolidate and present data for the sexual stages of five North American species of Orphella, fungal members of trichomycetes previously classified within Harpellales. Three species emendations accommodate the newly recognized characters, including not only the coiled zygospores and accompanying cells but also other morphological traits not provided in the original descriptions for O. avalonensis, O. haysii, and O. hiemalis. We describe three new species, Orphella cataloochensis from both the Smoky Mountains in USA and two provinces in Canada as well as O. pseudoavalonensis and O. pseudohiemalis, both from the Cascade Range, in Oregon, USA. Key morphological features for all known species are summarized and reviewed, with illustrations of some of the North American taxa to update and supplement the literature. The entire suite of morphological characters is discussed, with emphasis on species relationships and hypotheses on possible vicariant origins. We also present a molecular phylogeny based on nuc rDNA 18S and 28S, which supports Orphella as a lineage distinct from Harpellales, and we establish a new order, Orphellales, for it. With the combination of sexual features, now known for 12 of the 14 species of Orphella, and new molecular data, the group is now better characterized, facilitating and hopefully also promoting future studies toward a better understanding of their relationships, origins, and evolutionary history as stonefly gut–dwelling fungi.  aFunding from numerous agencies for and toward our various institutes and research programs has offered the opportunity to generate data over a number of years that have coalesced into this production, which is a contribution toward a broader and ongoing National Science Foundation (NSF) Collaborative Research effort deemed ZyGoLife.

Blood-borne molecules must therefore be able to circumvent the tightly sealed vasculature of the blood–brain barrier to rapidly access their target neurons. However, how information encoded by circulating appetite-modifying hormones is conveyed to central hypothalamic neurons remains largely unexplored. Using in vivo multiphoton microscopy together with fluorescently labeled ligands, we demonstrate that circulating ghrelin, a versatile regulator of energy expenditure and feeding behavior, rapidly binds neurons in the vicinity of fenestrated capillaries, and that the number of labeled cell bodies varies with feeding status. Thus, by virtue of its vascular connections, the hypothalamus is able to directly sense peripheral signals, modifying energy status accordingly.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ablood-brain barrier 3aenergy expenditure 3afeeding behavior 3aghrelin 3ahomeostasis 3ahypothalamus 3aligands 3amicroscopy 3aneurons 0ahormone diffusion 0ain vivo imaging 0amedian eminence 0ametabolism1 aLanglet, Fanny1 aLafont, Chrystel1 aMolino, François1 aHodson, David J.1 aRoux, Thomas1 aLamarque, Laurent1 aVerdié, Pascal1 aBourrier, Emmanuel1 aDehouck, Bénédicte1 aBanères, Jean-Louis1 aMartinez, Jean1 aMéry, Pierre-François1 aMarie, Jacky1 aTrinquet, Eric1 aFehrentz, Jean-Alain1 aPrévot, Vincent1 aMollard, Patrice0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 Jan. 22, v. 110, no. 4 p.1512-1517dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12121371103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02992naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245012800175300001600303520171800319592002802037653001602065653005002081653001102131653001902142653002302161653001702184653002002201653000902221653000802230653001002238700001702248700002402265700001802289700002902307773017902336856008202515852000902597655001202606IND60593841820221120152108.0180508e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059384182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaip.2017.12.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChristensen, Morten J.10aExercise Lowers Threshold and Increases Severity, but Wheat-Dependent, Exercise-Induced Anaphylaxis Can Be Elicited at Rest  ap. 514-520.  aWheat-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis (WDEIA) is a severe form of allergy in which exercise is being considered as mandatory. The diagnosis is often complex and the clinical reproducibility low.The aims of this study were to establish a standardized challenge method for the diagnosis of WDEIA and to investigate whether exercise is an essential trigger factor or alternatively an augmentation factor able to lower threshold and increase severity.We investigated 71 patients (age, 18.6-73.7 years) with a case history of WDEIA. Skin prick test (SPT) and measurement of specific IgE (sIgE) were followed by an oral food challenge with gluten at rest and in combination with treadmill exercise.A clinical reaction was elicited in 47 of 71 (66%), and in 26 of these (37%) the reaction could be elicited at rest. The median dose required at rest was 48 g (8-80 g) and in combination with exercise 24 g (4-80 g). Severity was significantly higher with exercise (2.3) than at rest (1.1) using Sampson severity score. In the challenge, SPT was positive to wheat in 93.6% (44 of 47) and to gluten in 95.7% (45 of 47). sIgE to wheat, gliadin, and omega-5 gliadin was present in 78.7% (37 of 47), 76.5% (36 of 47), and 91.4% (43 of 47) of the patients. Receiver operating characteristic–curve analysis for sIgE to omega-5 gliadin, a component of the gluten fraction and the major allergen in WDEIA, showed best sensitivity (91%) and specificity (92%) when gluten was combined with exercise.A challenge test with gluten at rest and combined exercise is a safe confirmatory test for WDEIA. A reaction can be elicited at rest (without exercise), but exercise is able to lower the threshold and increase the severity.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAnaphylaxis 0aWheat-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis 0aGluten 0aoral challenge 0aExercise challenge 0aSpecific IgE 0aSkin prick test 0asIgE 0aSPT 0aWDEIA1 aEller, Esben1 aMortz, Charlotte G.1 aBrockow, Knut1 aBindslev-Jensen, Carsten0 tJournal of allergy and clinical immunology.g2018 Mar.,  Apr., v. 6 p.514-520dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Academy of Allergy, Asthma & ImmunologywJournal:23463x2213-21987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaip.2017.12.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03636naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245007100171300001600242500001900258520095800277536109601235592002802331650001102359650003202370650001902402650001002421650001402431650002002445650001602465650003102481650001702512653001002529653001202539653001402551653001802565653001302583653001502596700002102611700002702632700002802659700002302687700002002710700002102730700002302751700002302774700001902797700001902816700001702835700002202852773010202874856008502976852000903061655001203070IND60695550420221119161825.0200517e20180304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069555042DNAL7 a10.1080/00275514.2018.14511402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlvarado, Pablo10aPhylogenetic studies in Genabea, Myrmecocystis, and related genera  ap. 401-418.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA multigene phylogenetic analysis of Genabea, Myrmecocystis, and related genera in Pyronemataceae was conducted to establish genetically supported generic limits. The nuc rDNA 28S gene, translation elongation factor 1-α gene (TEF1), and RNA polymerase II second-largest subunit gene (RPB2) significantly supported the monophyly of several distinct genera of hypogeous Pyronemataceae. The genetic identity of Genabea fragilis is established, and the new species Genabea hyalospora, G. urbana, Myrmecocystis mediterranea, and M. microspora are proposed to accommodate undescribed lineages. Two rare species, M. sphaerospora and M. spinospora, are tentatively identified based on collections that are morphologically similar to the original descriptions. The genus Genea was found to be monophyletic, except for G. cazaresii, which is nested among epigeous species of Humaria. The new combination Humaria cazaresii is proposed to accommodate this species.  aMolecular studies of KR specimens, SEM work, and truffle field studies with truffle dogs in southwest Germany were financed by a Klimopass grant (Research Ministry of Baden-Württemberg) to M. Scholler.

Core-shell particles were prepared from conductive nickel-plated core particles and positively charged polystyrene (PSt) shell particles carrying phosphonium groups on their surface by the heterocoagulation technique. The effect of alkyl chain lengths (ethyl, n-butyl, and n-octyl) of (4-vinylbenzyl)trialkylphosphonium chloride on the interfacial properties was investigated by surface tension measurement. Monodisperse PSt shell particles with a controlled particle size were successfully synthesized by emulsifier-free emulsion polymerization of styrene, (4-vinylbenzyl)triethylphosphonium chloride, and n-butyl acrylate. The effects of stirring time, temperature, NaCl concentration, and PSt shell particle concentration on heterocoagulation between the nickel-plated core particles and PSt shell particles were investigated. Uniform core-shell particles with a coverage of 60% could be prepared even though the heterocoagulation temperature was below the glass transition temperature and the NaCl concentration was below the critical coagulation concentration of the PSt shell particles. When the core-shell particles obtained through the heterocoagulation process were heated above the glass transition temperature of the shell particles for 6 h, a smooth polymeric insulating layer with melted shell particles was successfully formed on the surface of the nickel-plated core particles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3acoagulation 3aemulsions 3aglass transition temperature 3aparticle size 3apolymerization 3apolystyrenes 3astyrene 3asurface tension 0aEmulsifier-free emulsion polymerization 0aCore-shell particles 0aHeterocoagulation 0aNickel-plated particles 0aContinuous polymeric insulating layer1 aChikazawa, Takumi1 aKohri, Michinari1 aTaniguchi, Tatsuo1 aKishikawa, Keiki1 aKaratsu, Takashi0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 Aug. 20, v. 647 p.129169-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1291693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02615naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006100140245004500201300001600246500002000262520127600282592002801558650001701586650003001603650001701633650001501650650001401665650001601679650001801695650001201713650000901725650001301734650001801747650001001765651001701775700001301792700001401805700001301819700001701832700001501849700002201864700001901886700001701905773012701922856007502049852000902124655001202133IND60789376320221120040902.0220820e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078937632DNAL7 a10.1002/plr2.200742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaffe‐Treml, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9838-203X10aRegistration of oat cultivar ‘Natty’  ap. 281-287.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe development of oat (Avena sativa L.) cultivars with improved grain yield and excellent test weight is necessary to increase the profitability of oat production. ‘Natty’ (Reg. no. CV‐385, PI 676027) was developed by the South Dakota State University (SDSU) oat breeding program and was released in 2014. The pedigree of Natty is SD020701//SD030888/ND030349. Natty exhibited high grain yield potential and excellent test weight when evaluated in the South Dakota Crop Performance Testing Oat Variety Trials and in the Uniform Early Oat Performance Nursery. The grain of Natty is characterized by a large proportion of plump kernels and groats with low beta‐glucan and oil content. Natty is resistant to smut, moderately susceptible to susceptible to crown rust, and moderately tolerant to Barley yellow dwarf virus. Natty is a tall and early‐maturing cultivar suited for the production of oat grain for the feed market. Although its milling quality is good, the low beta‐glucan content of Natty is not desirable for the food market. Based on its height, Natty is also suited for straw production. Three of the oat cultivars released by SDSU were named after Lon Hall's grandchildren; Natty is one of them. Lon Hall was oat breeder at SDSU from 2001 to 2014.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAvena sativa 3aBarley yellow dwarf virus 3abeta-glucans 3acrown rust 3acultivars 3agrain yield 3alipid content 3amarkets 3aoats 3apedigree 3aprofitability 3astraw 3aSouth Dakota1 aHall, L.1 aBauer, R.1 aHall, N.1 aKleinjan, J.1 aGraham, C.1 aIngemansen, J.

Simulation results show that in-plane misalignments require little energy and a large variation in the energy bandgap (EG) can be observed. Based on the resulting atomic configurations due to the misalignments, the details of the observed relationship between bandgap and the lattice mismatch are investigated. It is observed that in general, misalignment in the transverse direction results in a decrease in the interaction between the two layers, giving rise to a larger EG. On the other hand, misalignment in the longitudinal direction, i.e. along the edges, leads to an oscillation in EG due to the periodic change of the GNR stacking order. A combination of these movements results in a complex variation of EG, which introduces great uncertainty in electronic devices. However, such a phenomenon could also be used in various kinds of nanoelectromechanical systems as it provides a large change in electronic properties with a small movement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectronic equipment 3aenergy 3agraphene 3auncertainty1 aLam, Kai-Tak1 aLee, Chengkuo1 aLiang, Gengchiau0 tCarbon.g2012 Apr., v. 50, no. 4 p.1659-1666dElsevier Ltdx0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2011.12.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03263naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245010300172300001600275500001900291520154800310536014201858592002802000596003402028596003402062650001602096650001402112650001702126650001502143650001502158650001602173650001102189650001502200650002002215650002202235650001602257650002102273650001302294650001402307651000902321651001102330653001802341653003602359653002002395653002102415653001502436700001902451700002202470700002102492773010202513856008502615852000902700655001202709IND60695550520221119161923.0200517e20180304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069555052DNAL7 a10.1080/00275514.2018.14516972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZiegler, Rebekka10aDismantling a complex of anther smuts (Microbotryum) on carnivorous plants in the genus Pinguicula  ap. 361-374.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe anther smuts of the genus Microbotryum are known from host plant species belonging to the Caryophyllaceae, Dipsacaceae, Lamiaceae, Lentibulariaceae, Montiaceae, and Primulaceae. Of these, the anther smuts on Caryophyllaceae, in particular on Silene spp., are best known because they include model organisms studied in many disciplines of fungal biology. For Microbotryum species parasitic on Caryophyllaceae, a high degree of host specificity was revealed and several cryptic species were described. In contrast, the host specificity within Microbotryum pinguiculae occurring in anthers of different Pinguicula species (Lentibulariaceae) has not been investigated in detail until now. The anther smuts on Pinguicula alpina, P. villosa, and P. vulgaris, on which M. pinguiculae was described, were analyzed using nuc rDNA ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 and nuc rDNA 28S D1–D2 sequences and morphology to determine if they belong to one polyphagous species or rather represent three host-specific species. The results of the morphological investigations revealed no decisive differences between the anther smuts on different Pinguicula species. However, genetic divergence and molecular phylogenetic analyses, which split the specimens according to host plant species, supported host specificity of the anther smuts on different Pinguicula species. Accordingly, in addition to Microbotryum pinguiculae s. str. on Pinguicula vulgaris, M. alpinum sp. nov. on P. alpina from Europe and M. liroi sp. nov. on P. villosa from Asia are described and illustrated.  aThe work of J.P. and M.P. was supported by the statutory funds of the W.

Mutations in the Sox9 gene or changes in expression levels can be attributed to many congenital diseases. Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the human SOX9 gene cause Campomelic dysplasia, a semi-lethal skeletal malformation syndrome. Disruption of Sox9 by conventional gene targeting leads to perinatal lethality in heterozygous mice, hence hampering the feasibility to obtain the homozygous Sox9 null mice for in vivo functional studies. In this study, we generated a conditional allele of Sox9 (Sox9 tm4.Tlu ) by flanking exon 1 with loxP sites. Homozygous mice for the Sox9 tm4.Tlu allele (Sox9 flox/flox ) are viable, fertile and indistinguishable from wildtype (WT) mice, indicating that the Sox9 tm4.Tlu allele is a fully functional Sox9 allele. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Cre-mediated recombination using a Col2a1-Cre line resulted in specific ablation of Sox9 activity in cartilage tissues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabnormal development 3aadulthood 3acartilage 3agene expression regulation 3agene targeting 3ahumans 3amice 3amutation 3anull alleles 2aAlleles 2aAnimals 2aCloning, Molecular 2aCollagen Type IIxgenetics 2aEmbryo, Mammalian 2aForelimbxembryologyxpathology. 2aGene Dosage 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmentalxgenetics 2aGene Knockout Techniquesxmethods 2aGene Targeting 2aHistocytochemistry 2aIntegrasesxgenetics 2aMice 2aMice, Knockout 2aModels, Genetic 2aMusculoskeletal Developmentxgenetics 2aSOX9 Transcription Factorxgenetics 2aSpinexembryologyxpathology.1 aXing, Xing1 aKraus, Petra1 aSivakamasundari, V.1 aChan, Hsiao Yun1 aLufkin, Thomas0 tBiotechnology letters.g2011 Aug., v. 33, no. 8 p.1551-1558dSpringer-Verlagx0141-54927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-011-0608-6  aDNAL 7aarticle02319naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245011900166520104300285592002801328650001101356650001401367650002301381650001901404650002001423650000901443653004401452653001801496653002201514653001501536653002501551653001801576700001401594700001701608700001801625700001601643700001501659700002001674773010701694856008701801852000901888655001201897IND60777466920221120064341.0220621e20220905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077746692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1291712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yun10aBiomass-based diatomite coating to prepare a high-stability zinc anode for rechargeable aqueous zinc-ion batteries  aThe metallic zinc has the advantages of suitable redox potential, low cost, and high safety, it has attracted much attention from scientific researchers. However, irreversible side reactions such as dendrite growth, corrosion and passivation within the zinc anode significantly damage its cycle stability and life. Here, we reported that a biomass-based diatomite coating prepared a high-stability zinc anode for the first time. The coating has a confinement effect on zinc ions, guiding zinc ions’ orderly deposition to form a high-quality deposition layer. In addition, the coating effectively improves the hydrophilicity of the zinc anode, creates even zinc nucleation, and reduces the resistance to charge transfer. Therefore, the modified cell still maintained a high discharge capacity of 113.9 mAh g⁻¹ after 1000 cycles with a high current density of 1.5 A g⁻¹. This result is much higher than that of a bare Zn cell (94.6 mAh g⁻¹). This work contributes to rechargeable water-based zinc-ion batteries in new fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acorrosion 3adiatomaceous earth 3ahydrophilicity 3aredox potential 3azinc 0aRechargeable aqueous zinc-ion batteries 0aBiomass-based 0aDiatomite coating 0aZinc anode 0aSurface modification 0aDendrite-free1 aXie, Peng1 aHuang, Kerui1 aFan, Shaogang1 aDeng, Aihua1 aShe, Jiyun1 aHuang, Xiaobing0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 Sept. 05, v. 648 p.129171-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1291713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02632naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245009000170520163100260592002801891650001801919650002501937650001801962650002201980650001702002650001702019651001702036700002502053700001902078773012702097856008502224852000902309655001202318IND60760700020221119040519.0211223e20211201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076070002DNAL7 a10.3390/horticulturae71205312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNwafor, Ifeoma 10aConstraints to Cultivation of Medicinal Plants by Smallholder Farmers in South Africa  aGrowing demand for therapeutic products from indigenous medicinal plants has led to increased interest in its cultivation, which presents a viable option for improving smallholder farmers’ livelihoods, as well as sustaining the availability of these resources for future generations. Serious bottlenecks however exist for subsistent farmers in the cultivation of these valuable plants. It was pertinent to probe whether the cultivation of medicinal plants provides feasible solutions to rural poverty, while effectively conserving threatened indigenous biodiversity. The paper employed a comprehensive review of existing literature to explore issues constraining smallholder farmers from involvement in a potentially lucrative plant value chain. Findings indicate challenges such as inadequate domestication of valuable plants species, continued over-harvesting from wild populations, poor knowledge of required agronomic practices, low efficacy perception regarding derivatives from cultivated plants, among others. These constraints occur alongside the conservation-oriented strategy driven by international conservation agencies and wholly adopted by the South African government. Recommendations to improve smallholder involvement in the cultivation of medicinal plants include support to research and extension, targeted inducement to smallholders, contracting and off-take agreements, aimed at promoting an alternative poverty-alleviation-focused economic development strategy. The review adds to the conceptual discourse related to plant diversity, resource conservation, poverty alleviation, and economic development  aPublisher supplied data 3adomestication 3aeconomic development 3arural poverty 3aspecies diversity 3asupply chain 3atherapeutics 3aSouth Africa1 aNwafor, Christopher 1 aManduna, Idah 0 tHorticulturae.g2021 Dec. 01, v. 7, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27142x2311-75247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/horticulturae71205313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03668naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005600139245010900195300001800304500002000322520213100342592002802473596005002501650002202551650002602573650001502599650002602614650002902640650002202669650001702691650001402708650001002722651001102732700005802743700005902801700006102860700001902921700002502940700005702965773013003022856007303152852000903225655001203234IND60672497020221121073110.0191016e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067249702DNAL7 a10.1111/ddi.129772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStride, Gail1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9834-324110aDivergent tree seedling communities indicate different trajectories of change among rain forest remnants  ap. 1751-1762.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: To examine plant community composition within rain forest remnants, and whether communities in different fragments follow similar trajectories of change in composition. We investigate whether plant communities in rain forest fragments either diverge from, or become more similar to, plant communities in other fragments, in order to understand the biodiversity value of forest fragments. LOCATION: Rain forest fragments embedded within agricultural landscapes in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. METHODS: We examined 14 forest fragments (39–120,000 ha) and five sites in continuous forest, and compared pre‐isolation (trees >5 cm dbh) and post‐isolation (seedlings <1 cm dbh) plant community composition. We used Chao‐Sørensen dissimilarity metric to compute beta diversity between all pairwise combinations of sites, and then used Non‐Metric Multidimensional Scaling to reduce 18 pairwise values per site to a single site value, which we used to test whether fragment area and/or isolation are associated with changes in plant communities. We compare analyses for trees and seedlings, and whether community changes arise from recruitment failure. RESULTS: Seedlings in fragments have diverged most from other communities, and divergence was greatest between seedling communities in small fragments, which have not only diverged more from tree communities in the same fragment, but also from seedling communities at other sites. This finding is partly associated with recruitment failure: the number of genera represented by both trees and seedlings is positively associated with site area. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Seedling communities are diverging in forest remnants, associated primarily with reductions in fragment area, whilst tree communities have not diverged, possibly due to extinction debts. Divergence is likely to continue as seedling cohorts mature, resulting in communities in fragments following different trajectories of change. Individual plant communities in each fragment may become impoverished, but they can support different communities of plants and hence contribute to landscape‐scale diversity.  aPublisher supplied data  a1505102cNatural Environment Research Council 3aagricultural land 3abotanical composition 3aextinction 3ahabitat fragmentation 3amultidimensional scaling 3aplant communities 3arain forests 3aseedlings 3atrees 3aBorneo1 aThomas, C.

Here an efficient nano-photosensitizer delivery system based on noncovalent interactions between Ce6 and single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) is proposed. By utilization of high surface area of SWCNTs, Ce6 was loaded on them with a high drug loading content by noncovalent π–π interactions. Then, the Ce6–SWCNT complexes were wrapped by chitosan to improve aqueous solubility and biocompatibility. The chemical characteristics of Ce6–SWCNTs and chitosan–Ce6–SWCNTs were evaluated by different analysis methods, including transmission electron microscopy, UV–Visible absorption spectra, and Fourier transform infrared spectra. The high cellular uptake of chitosan–Ce6–SWCNTs was confirmed by flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy. According to the WST-1 assay, the chitosan–Ce6–SWCNTs exhibited low dark toxicity and efficient PDT efficacy to HeLa cancer cells. These results indicate that chitosan–Ce6–SWCNTs are a potential photosensitizer delivery system for PDT.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abiocompatibility 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3achitosan 3achlorins 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3adrugs 3aflow cytometry 3aneoplasm cells 3asolubility 3asurface area 3atherapeutics 3atoxicity 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aZhu, Bangshang1 aWang, Dali1 aPang, Yan1 aHe, Lin1 aMa, Xiaofei1 aWang, Ruibin1 aJin, Chengyu1 aChen, Yan1 aZhu, Xinyuan0 tCarbon.g2012 Apr., v. 50, no. 4 p.1681-1689dElsevier Ltdx0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2011.12.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02465naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001400146245007800160520145800238592002801696650001401724650002301738650001301761650002701774650001401801650001301815650002401828651001001852651001101862651001701873700002601890773012201916856008002038852000902118655001202127IND60651360820221121202301.0190711e20171025xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065136082DNAL7 a10.3390/resources60400612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeo, Yuna10aAnalyzing Platinum and Palladium Consumption and Demand Forecast in Japan  aPlatinum and palladium are used in small but essential quantities in a variety of advanced industrial sectors. Platinum and palladium are used as catalysts in various industrial sectors, especially in the car industry. However, their sources are typically concentrated in South Africa and Russia, and there are concerns about supply security. In terms of resource security, it is important to verify domestic platinum and palladium consumption trends and future demand. In order to understand the domestic platinum and palladium consumption trends in Japan, we tracked the historical platinum and palladium consumption structures from 2001 to 2013, applying a bottom-up approach, and illustrated recent domestic platinum and palladium flow by using a substance flow analysis. The results showed that catalytic converters (9.1–12.8 t) and jewelry (5.3–15.5 t) for platinum, and catalytic converters (14.2–20.0 t) and dental use (9.5–16.4 t) for palladium, have marked the biggest consumption sectors during 2001–2013, where the total consumption of platinum and palladium have fluctuated by 18.4–31.6 t for platinum and from 33.0–46.3 t for palladium. We also forecasted the demand for each end-use of both up to the year 2025 using multiple regression analysis. Our results suggest that platinum demand could decrease from 18.9 t in 2013 to 11.9 t in 2025 and palladium demand could slightly decrease from 33.0 t in 2013 to 13.8 t in 2025.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aindustry 3amaterial flow analysis 3apalladium 3aplatinum 3aregression analysis 3aJapan 3aRussia 3aSouth Africa1 aMorimoto, Shinichirou0 tResources.g2017 Oct. 25, v. 6, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21558x2079-92767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/resources60400613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03616naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100001600159245006800175300001600243500000900259520219300268592002802461650001502489650001302504650001502517650002102532650001302553650002502566650000902591650001402600650001402614650001302628650001502641650001602656650001502672650000902687650002602696650001302722650001502735650001802750650001902768700001802787700001902805773020702824856009403031852000903125655001203134IND60666535720221122042448.0191028e198910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066653572DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq1989.00472425001800040007x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHall, J.

In general, maximum herbicide concentrations detected and mean total amounts in PLP were higher in 1985 than 1984 for both CT and NT, and were greater under NT conditions where more leachate was collected each year than in CT. Concentrations and amounts of simazine (6-chloro-N, N′-diethyl-1, 3,5-triazine-2, 4-diamine) and atrazine (6-chloro-N-ethyl-N′-(1-methylethyl)-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine) were generally more substantial in PLP than cyanazine (2-[[4-chloro-6-(ethylamino)-1, 3,5-triazin-2yl] amino]-2-methylpropanenitrile), and metolachlor (2-chloro-N-(2-ethyl-6-methylphenyl)-N-(2-methoxy-1-methylethyl) acetamide, particularly under NT conditions. In 1984, mean areal leaching losses (NT) were 0.6% (simazine, atrazine) and 0.15% (cyanazine, metolachlor) of applied rates (1.7 and 2.2 kg ha⁻¹, respectively). In 1985, mean areal losses (NT) were 3.4% (simazine, atrazine) and 1.6% (cyanazine, metolachlor). Respective CT losses were <0.1% (1984) and ranged from 0.4 to 1.0% (1985). Where worst-case conditions were considered (1985), mean leaching losses (simazine, atrazine) were 0.15 kg ha⁻¹, therefore, at least 91% (1.55 kg ha⁻¹) was retained and/or degraded within the soil profile or in the corn tissue after absorption. Soil core analysis corroborated PLP results revealing that simazine and atrazine were the most persistent and mobile herbicides, and were consistently detected at all soil depths to 122 cm. Differences in the yearly extent and magnitude of leaching losses were related strongly to rainfall distribution and number of leaching events proximal to the herbicide spray date.

METHODS: A prospective study of male (n = 482) and female (n = 879) Korean twins and family members who were weighed and assessed twice (baseline visit from December 2005 to December 2008, follow-up visit 2.7 ± 0.9 y later) using eating behavior subscales (external, emotional, and restrained eating) as measured by the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire. RESULTS: After adjusting for family variables, eating behavior subscales at baseline, changes in emotional and restrained eating, age, education, weight, and lifestyle at baseline, and menopausal status at baseline (for women), an increase in external eating was significantly associated with weight gain in men (1.08, 95% confidence interval 0.41–1.74) and in women (0.63, 95% confidence interval 0.13–1.12). None of the three eating behavior subscales at baseline or changes in emotional and restrained eating were associated with weight change. Eating behavior at baseline and changes in those eating behaviors accounted for 4% and 1% of the changes in weight in men and women, respectively. Additive genetic effects in women contributed to 18% of weight change, whereas in men there was no genetic contribution. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that an increase in external eating may predict adult weight gain in men and women. However, the relative contribution of eating behavior to weight change was very small, whereas the contribution of genetic effects on weight change was significant in women.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKoreans 3abehavior change 3aconfidence interval 3aeating habits 3aeducation 3aingestion 3alifestyle 3amen 3aprospective studies 3aquestionnaires 3atwins 3aweight gain 3awomen 2aAdult 2aAsian Peoplexgeneticsxpsychology. 2aBody Weightxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aFamily 2aFeeding Behaviorxphysiologyxpsychology. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aProspective Studies 2aSex Characteristics 2aTwins, Dizygoticxgeneticsxpsychology. 2aTwins, Monozygoticxgeneticsxpsychology. 2aWeight Gainxgeneticsxphysiology. 0aKorea (South)1 aLee, Kayoung1 aSung, Joohon1 aYang, Yun Joo0 tNutrition.g2013 Jan., v. 29, no. 1 p.66-70dElsevier Inc.x0899-90077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2012.03.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02958naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002100137245008800158300001600246500001900262520159700281592002801878650002101906650001101927650001901938650001001957650002301967650002301990650001802013650001402031650001102045650002102056650001002077650001002087650001402097653002102111653001702132653003002149653001702179653003202196653001802228653001002246700002302256773011702279856007102396852000902467655001202476IND60719898020221118013929.0201208s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071989802DNAL7 a10.1071/BT200472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWatson, Penny J.10aEffects of fire frequency and microhabitat on the ground layer in a grassy woodland  ap. 425-438.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aGrassy woodlands worldwide are vertically structured by trees, a ground layer of grasses and forbs, and a variable mid-storey. In Western Sydney’s Cumberland Plain Woodland this mid-storey is increasingly dominated by the prickly shrub Bursaria spinosa Cav. subsp. spinosa. We investigated whether tree and shrub vegetation affects species richness and composition of ground layer microhabitats in this woodland, and whether fire frequency directly affects the ground layer in addition to any indirect effects via overstorey vegetation. Replicate sites were located in areas that had burnt with a frequency that was high, moderate or low. All sites had a similar time since last fire. Three microhabitats (open, under Bursaria, around tree) within each site were sampled for species richness and composition of native and exotic species. Native species richness was not significantly affected by either microhabitat or fire frequency, for total species, grasses or forbs; however the relative abundance of native grasses decreased significantly as fire frequency declined, while the relative abundance of native forbs increased. Exotic species richness was lowest at high fire frequency and significantly higher at low fire frequency. Species composition was significantly affected by both microhabitat and fire frequency combining independently. Planned burning at relatively short intervals can help managers retain grassy habitat for open patch species, habitat for ground layer species that do best under frequent fire, and a robust Themeda triandra Forssk. sward antagonistic to weeds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThemeda triandra 3abotany 3afire frequency 3aforbs 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3amicrohabitats 3aoverstory 3ashrubs 3aspecies richness 3asward 3atrees 3awoodlands 0aBursaria spinosa 0aCAP analysis 0aCumberland Plain Woodland 0aencroachment 0aendangered grassy woodlands 0afire interval 0apatch1 aMorris, E.

This is particularly true for the role the biosphere played in the inceptual formation of atmospheric oxygen, and subsequently in its potential role in the evolution of higher life forms. Quantifying the change in atmospheric oxygen with geologic time is extremely challenging, with the redox sensitive isotope and element models subject to contradictory outcomes. Here, we present a new approach in determining past atmospheres, by a) directly measuring (DM) the amount of atmospheric oxygen trapped in fluid-gas inclusions of primary and unaltered halite, and by b) using a back-calculation method (BCM) applied to trapped halite fluid inclusion gas contents subjected to post-depositional biogeochemical reactions to calculate the amount of atmospheric oxygen.On average (±standard error), atmospheric oxygen content during the latest Ediacaran was 17.4 ± 2.1% compiled from DM of 17.4 ± 1.3% and from BCM of 17.3 ± 2.9%. For the earliest Cambrian average oxygen was 19.3 ± 1.4% compiled from DM of 18.8 ± 1.5% and from BCM of 19.8 ± 1.3%. The oxygen content during the mid and late Ordovician was relatively invariant with 15.6 ± 1.8% [15.4 ± 1.4% (DM), 15.8 ± 2.2% (BCM)], and 16.2 ± 1.2% [15.7 ± 1.7% (DM), 16.6 ± 0.7% (BCM)], respectively. The relatively stable atmospheric oxygen levels continued into the Silurian of 15.9 ± 1.1% (12.9 ± 0.4 to 16.5%, DM; 14.3 ± 1.7 to 19.8 ± 2.1% BCM) except for a peak to about present levels during the late Silurian of 23.2 ± 1.9% (21.6% DM, 24.7 ± 3.7% BCM). Early Carboniferous atmospheric oxygen returned to relatively lower and invariant levels at about 15.3 ± 0.7 to 15.7 ± 1.0% (15.0%, 15.5 ± 0.1% DM, 9.4 ± 3.9 to 15.8 ± 1.9% BCM). Similarly, the average atmospheric oxygen content in fluid inclusion of halites from the late Permian was similar with 15.7 ± 1.3% with 16.9% (DM) to 14.5 ± 2.6% (BCM). Indeed, our study suggests that atmospheric oxygen was relatively constant for most of the Paleozoic at about 16.5% (±0.6 SE, ±2.2 SD). This puts our proxy result at odds with the values and trends suggested by the COPSE, GEOCARBSULF AND GEOCARBSULFOR models for the early Paleozoic atmospheric oxygen, and continues the discord with the GEOCARBSULF and GEOCARBULFOR models during the late Paleozoic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCambrian period 3aCarboniferous period 3aEarth atmosphere 3aEdiacaran period 3aOrdovician period 3aPermian period 3aSilurian period 3abiosphere 3aevolution 3aisotopes 3aoxygen 0aPaleozoic 0aHalite 0aFluid inclusions 0aMass spectrometry 0apO2 measurements 0aDirect and indirect proxies 0aRelatively constant atmospheric oxygen1 aDavis, Alyssa M.1 aShaver, Kristen K.1 aBlamey, Nigel J.F.1 aHeizler, Matt1 aLécuyer, Christophe,0 tEarth-science reviews.g2021 May, v. 216 p.103560-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11685x0012-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2021.1035603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01412naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245011600168300001600284520056500300592002800865650001500893650001000908650001100918650001000929650000900939700002300948773009400971856004801065852000901113655001201122IND4478910720221117101459.0121003e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447891072DNAL7 a10.1134/S00138738120101252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrivosheina, M.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the dominating loss area in a typical tubular pump using the combined energy analysis methods. The transient multi-condition flow through the pump system is simulated based on N–S equation integrating SST k-ω model. The power loss characteristics of each flow passage component are analyzed in terms of total pressure variation, entropy production and energy balance equation. The turbulent entropy generation power (PSD') in the entropy production and the turbulent kinetic energy production (PL₃) of the energy balance equation are the primary source of power loss, indicating that the fully developed turbulent flow tends to generate considerable loss in the pump system, followed by the power loss of solid wall (PSW and PLW). The distribution of power loss in the impeller and diffuser was comprehensively exhibited and it was found that the undesirable flow patterns are mainly caused by blades and walls. The rim region in impeller domain with volume fraction of 15% induces the energy loss of approximately 45% due to the presence of solid wall and tip leakage vortex (TLV). Furthermore, the individual grid volume is considered to better locate and visualize regions with our great interest, and a number of typical vortex structures are identified under several flow rates showing that the positive attack angle is more likely to caused flow instability and energy loss at low flow rate condition.  aPublisher supplied data 3abulbs 3aenergy balance 3aenergy transfer 3aentropy 3aequations 3akinetic energy 3amodels 3atransient flow 3aturbulent flow 0aBulb tubular pump 0aNumerical simulation 0aHydraulic performance 0aEntropy production 0aEnergy balance equation 0aVisualization analysis1 aPan, Qiang1 aZhang, Desheng1 aZhao, Ruijie1 aEsch, B.P.M.(Bart) van0 tEnergy.g2022 Nov. 01, v. 258 p.124794-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2022.1247943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01865naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245013000172300001600302520051600318592002800834650001300862650001700875650001000892650002000902650001000922653002200932653001700954653001700971653001000988653003000998653002601028700002601054700002001080700002101100700002101121700002301142700002601165700002001191773012901211856008201340852000901422655001201431IND60535984720221116205618.0190416e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053598472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bcab.2015.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBordón, Daniela L.10aWeeds as biocatalysts in the stereoselective synthesis of chiral phenylethanols used as key intermediates for pharmaceuticals  ap. 493-499.  aThis paper describes the search for novel vegetal biocatalysts for the stereoselective reduction of prochiral phenylketones.

We investigated the leishmanicidal activity of cariphenone A (1), isouliginosin B (2) and uliginosin B (3) isolated from Hypericum species. Promastigotes and amastigotes of Leishmania amazonensis were incubated with compounds 1–3 at concentrations 1–100 µm for 48 h. The anti-promastigote effect of compounds was also tested in combinations. The cytotoxicity against macrophages and human erythrocytes were determined using the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) method and hemolysis assay, respectively. The compounds 1–3 showed high leishmanicidal activity against promastigotes, IC₅₀ values of 10.5, 17.5 and 11.3 µm, respectively. Synergistic interactions were found to the associations of compounds 1 and 2 [Σ fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) = 0.41], and 2 and 3 (ΣFIC = 0.28) on promastigotes. All Hypericum compounds induced mitochondrial hyperpolarization and reactive oxygen species production in promastigotes. The compounds showed low cytotoxicity toward mammalian cells, high selectivity index and killed intracellular amastigotes probably mediated by oxidative stress. These results indicate that these compounds are promising candidates for the development of drugs against leishmaniasis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHypericum 3aLeishmania amazonensis 3aamastigotes 3aantileishmanial properties 3abioactive compounds 3acytotoxicity 3adrugs 3aerythrocytes 3ahemolysis 3ahumans 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aleishmaniasis 3amacrophages 3amitochondria 3aoxidative stress 3apromastigotes 3areactive oxygen species 3asynergism 0aCariphenone A 0aIsouliginosin B 0aLeishmanicidal activity 0aUliginosin B1 aMesquita, Camila Saporiti1 aDorneles, Gilson Pires1 aTeixeira, Vivian de Oliveira Nunes1 ade Barros, Francisco Maikon Corrêa1 aVidal Ccana-Ccapatinta, Gari1 aFonseca, Simone Gonçalves1 aMonteiro, Marta Chagas1 aJúnior, Luiz Carlos Rodrigues1 aPeres, Alessandra1 avon Poser, Gilsane Lino1 aRomão, Pedro Roosevelt Torres0 tParasitology.g2018 Aug., v. 145, no. 9 p.1199-1209dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45572x1469-81617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00311820180002033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02341naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245008800161300001800249500000900267520108700276592002801363650001301391650001201404650001701416650001501433650001501448650001301463650001301476650002101489650001401510650001501524650001501539650002001554650001301574700002101587700001701608773022001625856007701845852000901922655001201931IND60666536020221122051757.0191028e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066653602DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq2012.04822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarkhot, D.

In this study we determined the capacity of biochar, produced by pyrolyzing mixed hardwood feedstock at 300°C, to adsorb and retain or release two major nutrient ions: ammonium (NH₄⁺) and phosphate (PO₄³⁻). We conducted the experiment using a range of nutrient concentrations that represent those commonly observed in dairy manure effluent (0–50 mg L⁻¹ for PO₄³⁻ and 0–1000 mg L⁻¹ for NH₄⁺). Up to 5.3 mg g⁻¹ NH₄⁺ and 0.24 mg g⁻¹ PO₄³⁻ was adsorbed from manure by biochar (18 and 50% of total amount in the manure slurry, respectively). During the desorption phase of the experiment, biochar retained 78 to 91% of the sorbed NH₄⁺ and 60% of the sorbed PO₄³⁻ at reaction times <24 h. Our findings confirm that biochar can be used for recovering excess nitrogen and phosphorus from agricultural water, such as dairy manure effluent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3abiochar 3adairy manure 3adesorption 3afeedstocks 3ahardwood 3anitrogen 3anutrient content 3anutrients 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3asoil amendments 3asorption1 aGhezzehei, T.

Mesolimbic dopaminergic system has been proposed as a general motivational circuit; however in the literature it has been more related to the control of the motivational aspects of maternal than sexual motivation of females. Therefore, we aimed to assess the effect of antagonizing dopaminergic neurotransmission of PPE females on their preference for pups over a male. To achieve this objective we tested PPE rats in a Y-maze with three-choice chambers (one containing eight pups, the other a male and the last one no stimulus) after the systemic administration of the dopaminergic antagonist haloperidol (0.0; 0.025 or 0.05 mg/kg). Furthermore, to determine if this dopaminergic antagonist differentially affects maternal and sexual motivations when pups and male are not competing, we evaluated the effect of haloperidol in the preference of females for pups vs. a non-receptive female and for a male vs. a non-receptive female. In the preference test for pups vs. male, both doses of haloperidol decreased the time that females spent in pups' chamber while increased the time that they spent in male's chamber, resulting in a lack of preference between both incentives. Besides, haloperidol reduced the effort -attempts to get access to the stimuli- made by the females to obtain the pups. Conversely, 0.05 mg/kg of haloperidol did not affect the preference for both incentives when they were confronted to a non-receptive female. Together, these results indicate that the dopaminergic activity mediates pups' preference over male during the PPE and point toward a more relevant role of this system in females' behavioral output when incentives are competing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantagonists 3aestrus 3afemales 3ahaloperidol 3amales 3amotivation 3apups 3arats 0aPostpartum estrus 0aPups-male preference 0aMaternal motivation 0aSexual motivation 0aDopaminergic system 0aHaloperidol1 aUriarte, Natalia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3392-51171 aZuluaga, María José1 aFerreira, Annabel1 aAgrati, Daniella0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2018 May 01, v. 188 p.134-139dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11731x0031-93847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2018.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03133naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245008600170520154500256592002801801650001701829650001101846650002801857650000901885650002201894650000901916650002201925650002101947650001701968650002001985650001602005650002202021650001602043650002002059650001602079653001702095653002002112653001702132653001802149653001502167700001502182700002402197700001702221700001902238700001902257700001602276700001902292700001702311700001702328700001802345773010902363856008602472852000902558655001202567IND60792107620221122062354.0221004e20230103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079210762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2022.1114832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPang, Qianqian10aOmic analysis of anthocyanin synthesis in wine grape leaves under low-temperature  aAnthocyanins can be induced by environmental factors such as low- temperature, and play an important role in adapting to abiotic stress. In this study, the leaves of 'Cabernet Gernischt' grapes with different colors under natural low-temperature in autumn were collected and grouped into Green (Gre), Light-red (L-Red), Red (Red), and Dark-red (D-Red). Results showed that the total anthocyanin content and anthocyanin components were increased in turn from Gre to D-red. Under the same low-temperature, Gre was substantially damaged, L-Red was mildly damaged, Red and D-Red had no visible damage. RNA-seq data showed that a total of 3666 DEGs were screened out of all 28,306 genes detected, of which 1936 DEGs were upregulated and 1730 DEGs were downregulated in D-Red vs Gre. Transcriptomics and metabolomics showed that DEGs were significantly enriched in GO terms, such as in defense response, defense response to oomycetes, and response to reactive oxygen species, hydrogen peroxide, heat, salt stress, and biotic stimulus pathways. The KEGG analysis showed that DEGs were mainly enriched in secondary metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, energy metabolism, and lipid metabolism. Anthocyanin synthesis genes may be regulated by transcription factors such as ERF, MYB, NAC, bHLH and various LRR-type receptor-like protein kinase (LRR-RLK) family genes. In conclusion, the accumulation of anthocyanins significantly increased from green to red in grape leaves during autumn low-temperature, improving the cold resistance of grape leaves.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthocyanins 3aautumn 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3acold 3aenergy metabolism 3aheat 3ahydrogen peroxide 3alipid metabolism 3ametabolomics 3aprotein kinases 3asalt stress 3asequence analysis 3atemperature 3atranscriptomics 3awine grapes 0aAnthocyanins 0aLow-temperature 0aGrape leaves 0aTranscriptome 0aMetabolome1 aYu, Wenbin1 aSadeghnezhad, Ehsan1 aChen, Xueqin1 aHong, Pingjing1 aPervaiz, Tariq1 aRen, Yanhua1 aZhang, Yanping1 aDong, Tianyu1 aJia, Haifeng1 aFang, Jinggui0 tScientia horticulturae.g2023 Jan. 03, v. 307 p.111483-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2022.1114833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03170naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012200166520172500288592002802013650001602041650002802057650002202085650003402107650001102141650002202152650001702174650000902191650001302200650001302213650001002226651001102236651001302247653001102260653001302271653001902284653001602303653002002319700002602339700005702365700006502422700001802487773010402505856008202609852000902691655001202700IND60773168420221122065858.0220621e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077316842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nut.2022.1116812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarvalho, Rita10aIodine status, dietary iodine intake and iodized salt in school-aged children in São Miguel Island, Azores, Portugal  aSchool-aged children in São Miguel Island, Azores, Portugal, are a population with a long history of iodine deficiency, and a recent governmental program for iodized salt (IS) consumption was implemented. This study investigated urinary iodine concentration (UIC), household and school IS consumption, and iodine-rich food intake in school-aged children. In this cross-sectional study, spot urine samples and dietary iodine intake were collected. Urinary iodine concentration was evaluated using the fast colorimetric method. Dietary iodine intake was calculated by determining the iodine content of reported food intake using a Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ). The median UIC was 106.7 µg/L, and 55.5% of children had UIC >100 µg/L. Iodized salt was used by 100% of schools and 48.3% of school-aged children's households. Excluding iodine in IS, the median dietary iodine intake was 105.5 µg/d. No significant correlation was found between UIC and dietary iodine intake. Milk and dairy products, with a median intake of 311.1 g/d, provided 81.5 µg iodine/d. Seafood, with a median intake of 30.5 g/d, provided 16.8 µg iodine/d. Dairy product intake was not statistically correlated with UIC (P = 0.567). School-aged children in São Miguel Island did not have iodine deficiency after the governmental program for IS consumption. Adequate iodine status of school-aged children probably reflects not only an increase in iodine intake, through IS, but also an improvement of food intake patterns. Future studies are needed to ensure the sufficient iodine status of school-aged children in the Azores, and political commitment and efforts are required to prevent the possible reemergence of iodine deficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolorimetry 3across-sectional studies 3adairy consumption 3afood frequency questionnaires 3aiodine 3aiodine deficiency 3aiodized salt 3amilk 3apolitics 3aseafoods 3aurine 3aAzores 3aPortugal 0aIodine 0aChildren 0aDietary intake 0aSão Miguel 0aAzorean Islands1 aMoniz, Catarina Senra1 aMendes, Inês1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7956-288X1 aMendes, Armando Dias,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3049-58521 aSousa, Isabel0 tNutrition.g2022 July,  Aug., v. 99-100 p.111681-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2022.1116813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02650naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100001900143245006500162300001600227520152200243592002801765650001701793650002101810650002201831650001801853650002401871650002501895650001901920650001801939650001801957650002201975650000901997650001102006650001202017700001902029700001802048700002102066773009802087856004602185852000902231655001202240IND4473324820221122113203.0120815e199812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447332482DNAL7 a10.1023/A:10060656222512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSatō, Yutaka,10aIsolation and characterization of a rice homebox gene, OSH15  ap. 983-997.  aIn many eukaryotic organisms including plants, homeobox genes are thought to be master regulators that establish the cellular or regional identities and specify the fundamental body plan. We isolated and characterized a cDNA designated OSH15 (Oryza sativa homeobox 15) that encodes a KNOTTED-type homeodomain protein. Transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing the OSH15 cDNA showed a dramatically altered morphological phenotype caused by disturbance of specific aspects of tobacco development, thereby indicating the involvement of OSH15 in plant development. We analyzed the in situ mRNA localization of OSH15 through the whole plant life cycle, comparing the expression pattern with that of another rice homeobox gene, OSH1. In early embryogenesis, both genes were expressed as the same pattern at a region where the shoot apical meristem would develop later. In late embryogenesis, the expression pattern of the two genes became different. Whereas the expression of OSH1 continued within the shoot apical meristem, OSH15 expression within the shoot apical meristem ceased but became observable in a ring shaped pattern at the boundaries of some embryonic organs. This pattern of expression was similar to that observed around vegetative or reproductive shoots, or the floral meristem in mature plants. RNA in situ localization data suggest that OSH15 may play roles in the shoot organization during early embryogenesis and thereafter, OSH15 may be involved in morphogenetic events around the shoot apical meristem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aapical meristems 3acomplementary DNA 3aembryogenesis 3agene overexpression 3ahomeodomain proteins 3ahomeotic genes 3amature plants 3amessenger RNA 3aplant development 3arice 3ashoots 3atobacco1 aSentoku, Naoki1 aNagato, Yasuo1 aMatsuoka, Makoto0 tPlant molecular biology.g1998 Dec., v. 38, no. 6 p.983-997dSpringer-Verlagx0167-44127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1006065622251  aDNAL 7aarticle02204naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245014500167300001600312520086100328592002801189596005801217596005801275596005001333650001201383650001601395650001401411650001801425650003801443651001001481700001701491700001601508700001801524700001601542700001601558700001701574773012401591856008201715852000901797655001201806IND60588712720221122050757.0210207e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058871272DNAL7 a10.1007/s00606-017-1456-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Kongxiang10aIdentification of a new characteristic species of Nitella (Charophyceae) from southwestern China based on morphology and molecular phylogeny  ap. 123-132.  aNitella fuiana Lan & Qing sp. nov., a special kind of charophyte from Mingshan, Sichuan, China, was described in this study.

The results of morphology comparison showed that the charophyte possessed stipulodes and 10-cell coronula. Nuclear 18S rDNA and plastid rbcL sequences analysis revealed that N. fuiana was a single clade as clustered with other species of Nitella. Combined with the morphological and molecular analysis data, our study strongly supported that N. fuiana was a new species of Nitella. This is the first report of Nitelleae species with stipulodes, which increased the morphological diversity of charophytes. This study also reminds us to pay close attention to the characteristics of stipulodes for further research on charophytes.  aPublisher supplied data  a30470143cNational Nature Science Foundation of China  a40976092cNational Nature Science Foundation of China  a2014JY0171cSichuan Nature Science Foundation 3aNitella 3anew species 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal DNA 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3aChina1 aQing, Renwei1 aFu, Hualong1 aRen, Lingxuan1 aLiu, Kehuan1 aCao, Sujuan1 aLan, Liqiong0 tPlant systematics and evolution.g2018 Jan., v. 304, no. 1 p.123-132dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl6813x0378-26977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00606-017-1456-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02292naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245006200167300001400229520115200243592002801395650001601423650001801439650002701457650002101484650000901505650001401514650000901528650001001537650002001547650001701567650001201584653001401596653001801610653001301628653001501641653001701656773011801673856008201791852000901873655001201882IND60528503720221118143954.0190329e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052850372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dci.2016.02.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrugman, Sylvia14aThe zebrafish as a model to study intestinal inflammation  ap. 82-92.  aStarting out as a model for developmental biology, during the last decade, zebrafish have also gained the attention of the immunologists and oncologists. Due to its small size, high fecundity and full annotation of its genome, the zebrafish is an attractive model system. The fact that fish are transparent early in life combined with the growing list of immune cell reporter fish, enables in vivo tracking of immune responses in a complete organism. Since zebrafish develop ex utero from a fertilized egg, immune development can be monitored from the start of life. Given that several gut functions and immune genes are conserved between zebrafish and mammals, the zebrafish is an interesting model organism to investigate fundamental processes underlying intestinal inflammation and injury. This review will first provide some background on zebrafish intestinal development, bacterial colonization and immunity, showing the similarities and differences compared to mammals. This will be followed by an overview of the existing models for intestinal disease, and concluded by future perspectives in light of the newest technologies and insights.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aanimal models 3abacterial colonization 3adigestive system 3aeggs 3afecundity 3afish 3agenes 3aimmune response 3ainflammation 3amammals 0aZebrafish 0aEnterocolitis 0aImmunity 0aIntestines 0aInflammation0 tDevelopmental and comparative immunology.g2016 Nov., v. 64 p.82-92dElsevier LtdwJournal:11789x0145-305X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dci.2016.02.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04152naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245018200176520237000358592002802728650002002756650003202776650002102808650001402829650001202843650001302855650002102868650000802889650001802897650001402915650004302929650001902972650001302991650001203004650001603016650001003032651001203042651002903054651001303083651001503096651001603111651001003127651001103137651002503148700002103173700002203194700001803216700001603234700002003250700002103270700002503291700001803316773013403334856008503468852000903553655001203562IND60672748420221120075001.0191017e20190613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067274842DNAL7 a10.1093/cdn/nzz034.P10-073-192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarageorgou, Dimitra10aEstimated Global, Regional, and National Cardiometabolic Disease Burdens Related to Red and Processed Meat Consumption: An Analysis from the Global Dietary Database (P10-073-19)  aRed and processed meats are associated with cardiometabolic disease (CMD) risk; yet, corresponding global burdens are not well established. We aimed to quantify the impact of meat intake on coronary heart disease (CHD) and type 2 diabetes mortality by nation (n = 187), super-region (n = 9), age (20 + y), and sex using the largest standardized Global Dietary Database (GDD) available. A comparative risk assessment model estimated the absolute and % CHD and diabetes mortality attributable to suboptimal unprocessed red and processed meat consumption, incorporating data and corresponding uncertainty on: intakes from the GDD, estimated by a Bayesian hierarchical imputation model using national and sub-national surveys worldwide (266 surveys; 1630,069 individuals; 113/187 countries; 82% of the world's population); etiologic effects of meat intake on CHD and diabetes mortality from meta-analyses of prospective cohorts; optimal population meat intakes based on observed intakes associated with lowest risk; and disease-specific deaths from the Global Burden of Diseases. In 2010, suboptimal red meat intake was associated with 43,987 (95% uncertainty interval: 42,243–45,635) diabetes deaths, accounting for 3.5% (3.4–3.6%) of global diabetes mortality. Highest proportional mortality was estimated in Central African Republic, United Arab Emirates, and Gabon (Figure 1). Similar attributable mortality was seen in men (4%) vs women (3%), and higher in younger (25–54 y; 5–7%) vs older (55–85 y; 1–4%) adults. Processed meat intake was linked to 510,214 (482,092–541,175) CHD and 86,923 (83,832–90,488) diabetes deaths, accounting for 7.3% (6.9–7.8%) of global CHD and 6.9% (6.7–7.2%) of diabetes mortality. CHD mortality was highest in Panama, Costa Rica, and Colombia, and diabetes mortality in Panama, Belarus, and El Salvador (Figure 2). Attributable mortality was higher in men vs women (CHD: 9 vs 6%; diabetes: 8 vs 6%), and in younger vs older adults (14–15% vs 4–11%; 12–15% vs 3–9%). Meat-related CMD burdens in 1990 and 2015 will be presented at the meeting. Suboptimal processed meat intake contributed to substantial CMD mortality, greatly exceeding burdens attributed to unprocessed red meats. Such data highlight the need for strategies to reduce meat, particularly processed meat, consumption.

Interleukin (IL)-18 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of inflammatory diseases. Here, we analyzed IL-18 levels in the plasma of juveniles with T1D. Compared to control subjects, IL-18 levels were significantly elevated in patients with T1D. On the other hand, levels of IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP) and IL-37, two negative regulators of IL-18 function, remained unchanged when comparing T1D to control samples. Notably, however, although IL-18BP levels were not elevated, IL-18 and IL-18BP were found to be positively correlated in type 1 diabetics. Even so, free, unbound IL-18 remained significantly increased in diabetic patients. Additionally, correlation studies also revealed that IL-18 and IL-18BP are positively correlated with HbA1c levels in T1D patients, suggesting a potential link between IL-18 and metabolic control in these patients. Finally, we observed a significant increase in IL-18 protein expression within human pancreatic islet specimens collected from type 1 diabetics. These results further expand our knowledge of the role of IL-18 in T1D, may give insight into common pathogenic mechanisms associated with metabolic control in both T1D and T2D, and suggest that targeting this cytokine may improve therapeutic outcomes for T1D patients.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abinding proteins 3ablood serum 3achronic diseases 3acorrelation 3ahumans 3ainsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3ainterleukin-18 3aislets of Langerhans 3ajuveniles 3apathogenesis 3apatients 3aprotein synthesis 0aIL-18 0aType 1 diabetes 0aIL-18BP 0aIL-37 0aFree IL-18 0aAutoimmune diabetes1 aYarde, Danielle N.1 aGuinn, Zachary1 aLorenzo-Arteaga, Kristina M.1 aCorley, Kevin P.1 aCabrera, Monina S.1 aSarvetnick, Nora E.0 tMolecular Immunology.g2015 Apr., v. 64 p.306-312dElsevier Ltdx0161-58907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2014.12.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01969naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002100137245008100158300001600239500002000255520098500275592002801260650001501288650001401303650001201317650002001329650001001349650001101359650002201370651002801392773014301420856007101563852000901634655001201643IND60680202120221119223838.0200104e196411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068020212DNAL7 a10.2307/12365132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlexander, D. J.10aSome Features of West German Policy for Improving the Agricultural Structure  ap. 791-804.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis paper is a factual description of agricultural structural improvement policy as applied in West Germany. The three major items of long‐term investment by the state to create better income potential for farmers are consolidation of fragmented holdings, farm resettlement, and farm area enlargement. An underlying difficulty is scarcity of land, either for resettled farms or to enlarge existing ones. Putting into effect local minimum norms of size of farm business is a major problem for those engaged in the practical work of farm structural reorganisation. Apart from intervention by the authorities in favour of selected areas and farmer applicants, other means are used to influence structural change. Improvement of the man‐land ratio is central to the improvement of the income efficiency of German farming. As coercion is avoided as much as possible, future success of West German policy will largely depend on rate of migration out of full‐time farm employment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aemployment 3afarm area 3afarmers 3afarming systems 3afarms 3aincome 3aissues and policy 3aGerman Federal Republic0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g1964 Nov., v. 46, no. 4 p.791-804dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44932x0002-90927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/12365133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04354naa a2200913 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002200191245012100213300001600334506007600350520201000426592002802436506003702464650002202501650001802523650001802541650001602559650002102575650001402596650001802610650002702628650001402655650001302669650001002682650002002692650002202712650002002734650002102754650001702775650001502792650001302807650001302820653001002833653000902843653000802852653000802860653000902868653000802877653000902885653000902894653001402903653000802917653000902925653000802934653000902942653000802951653001002959653001002969653000802979653000802987653000902995653000703004653001003011653000803021653000803029653000803037653000803045653001003053653001303063653002203076653001203098653001403110653000803124653002403132700001903156700001603175700003203191700002803223773008403251856008403335852000903419655001203428IND60552013220221207131452.0161019e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055201322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molimm.2014.12.0132doi7 aPMC71724562pmcid7 a256820542pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHasan, Md.

Despite severe outbreaks and lack of antiviral drug, a mere progress has been made regarding to an epitope-based vaccine designed for CHIKV. In this study, we aimed to design an epitope-based vaccine that can trigger a significant immune response as well as to prognosticate inhibitor that can bind with potential drug target sites by using various immunoinformatics and docking simulation tools. Initially, whole proteome of CHIKV was retrieved from database and perused to identify the most immunogenic protein. Structural properties of the selected protein were analyzed. The capacity to induce both humoral and cell-mediated immunity by T cell and B cell were checked for the selected protein. The peptide region spanning 9 amino acids from 397 to 405 and the sequence YYYELYPTM were found as the most potential B cell and T cell epitopes respectively. This peptide could interact with as many as 19 HLAs and showed high population coverage ranging from 69.50% to 84.94%. By using in silico docking techniques the epitope was further assessed for binding against HLA molecules to verify the binding cleft interaction. In addition with this, the allergenicity of the epitopes was also evaluated. In the post therapeutic strategy, three dimensional structure was predicted along with validation and verification that resulted in molecular docking study to identify the potential drug binding sites and suitable therapeutic inhibitor against targeted protein. Finally, pharmacophore study was also performed in quest of seeing potent drug activity. However, this computational epitope-based peptide vaccine designing and target site prediction against CHIKV opens up a new horizon which may be the prospective way in Chikungunya virus research; the results require validation by in vitro and in vivo experiments.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aChikungunya virus 3aT-lymphocytes 3aallergenicity 3aamino acids 3aantiviral agents 3aarthritis 3abinding sites 3acell-mediated immunity 3adatabases 3aepitopes 3afever 3aimmune response 3aimmunoinformatics 3ain vivo studies 3amolecular models 3apharmacology 3aprediction 3aproteome 3avaccines 0aCHIKV 0aHLAs 0aBFV 0aRRV 0aONNV 0aSFV 0aSINV 0aORFs 0aUniPortKB 0aCTL 0aIC50 0aMHC 0aIEDB 0aTAP 0aSOPMA 0aGRAVY 0aFAO 0aWHO 0aRCSB 0a3D 0aCASTp 0aNAG 0aMAN 0aMSE 0aNDG 0aACToR 0aadmetSAR 0aChikungunya virus 0aVaccine 0aInhibitor 0aHLA 0aPharmacophore study1 aKhan, Md.

It is a complex multi-factorial disease and the exact etiology is largely unknown. Family based studies have indicated a genetic predisposition; however they cannot fully explain the disease pathogenesis. In addition to genetic susceptibility, environmental as well as gender and age related factors were also been found to be associated. Recently, imbalances in epigenetic networks are indicated to be causative elements in psoriasis. The present knowledge of epigenetic involvement, mainly the DNA methylation, chromatin modifications and miRNA deregulation is surveyed here. An integrated approach considering genetic and epigenetic anomalies in the light of immunological network may explore the pathogenesis of psoriasis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA methylation 3achromatin 3aepigenetics 3aetiology 3agender 3amicroRNA 3apathogenesis 3apsoriasis 0aGeneralized plaque type psoriasis 0aDNA methylation 0aMicro RNA 0aHistone modifications 0aSingle nucleotide polymorphism 0aGenome-wide association study1 aRay, Aditi1 aSenapati, Swapan1 aChatterjee, Raghunath0 tMolecular Immunology.g2015 Apr., v. 64 p.313-323dElsevier Ltdx0161-58907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2014.12.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02831naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245011400167300001600281520156400297592002801861650003401889650001101923650002101934650001001955650002101965650001401986650001602000650003202016650001602048650001702064653001702081653002202098653004602120653001602166653002002182700002302202773010002225856008702325852000902412655001202421IND60569131620221120045902.0190402e20171215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056913162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.05.0872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJoy, Minju10aBiogenic antioxidative and anti-inflammatory aryl polyketides from the venerid bivalve clam Paphia malabarica  ap. 169-180.  aChemical investigation of ethyl acetate-methanol extract of the venerid bivalve clam Paphia malabarica led to isolation of three unprecedented aryl polyketide derivatives, characterized as (E)-12-(17-ethyl-tetrahydro-16-hydroxy-15-(methyl pentanoate)-14-oxo-2H-pyran-13-yl)-9-methyl-but-11-enyl benzoate (1), isobutyl-13-(6-(benzoyloxy)-10-methylpentyl)-tetrahydro-13-methyl-2H-pyran-17-carboxylate (2) and (13-(methoxycarbonyl)-11-((E)-18-ethylhexa-16,19-dienyl)-12-propyl-cyclohex-10-enyl)-methyl-3-hydroxy benzoate (3). The structures of the polyketides were assigned by extensive spectroscopic experiments. Compound 1 displayed comparatively greater 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical quenching potential (50% inhibitory concentration, IC50 ∼0.59mg/mL) than commercially available α-tocopherol (IC50 0.63mg/mL). Potential pro-inflammatory 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) inhibition potential (IC50 0.76–0.92mg/mL) of the polyketides in consonant with significantly greater anti-inflammatory selectivity indices (anti-cyclooxygense-1IC50/anti-cyclooxygense-2IC50>1) than non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent ibuprofen (0.44) described the safety profile of the title compounds. Putative biosynthetic route by means of polyketide synthatase biocatalyzed pathways unambiguously established the structural assignments of the previously undescribed polyketide analogues. The potential of hitherto undescribed polyketides from P. malabarica as natural antioxidative and anti-inflammatory functional food ingredients was demonstrated in the present study.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aPaphia 3aalpha-tocopherol 3aclams 3afunctional foods 3aibuprofen 3aingredients 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3apolyketides 3aspectroscopy 0aBivalve clam 0aPaphia malabarica 0aUnprecedented aryl polyketide derivatives 0aAntioxidant 0aFunctional food1 aChakraborty, Kajal0 tFood chemistry.g2017 Dec. 15, v. 237 p.169-180dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.05.0873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02279naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245008400171300001600255520077400271592002801045650002201073650001701095650001401112650002001126650001801146650001601164650001801180650002101198650001701219650001101236650001201247650002301259650001701282650001501299650001701314653001101331653002001342653002201362653003001384700002201414700002301436700002201459700001901481700006201500773012001562856008201682852000901764655001201773IND60528504320221118144509.0190329e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052850432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dci.2016.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aProcaccini, Claudio10aLeptin as immune mediator: Interaction between neuroendocrine and immune system  ap. 120-129.  aLeptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone/cytokine that links nutritional status with neuroendocrine and immune functions. Initially described as an anti-obesity hormone, leptin has subsequently been shown to exert pleiotropic effects, being also able to influence haematopoiesis, thermogenesis, reproduction, angiogenesis, and more importantly immune homeostasis. As a cytokine, leptin can affect both innate and adaptive immunity, by inducing a pro-inflammatory response and thus playing a key role in the regulation of the pathogenesis of several autoimmune/inflammatory diseases. In this review, we discuss the most recent advances on the role of leptin as immune-modulator in mammals and we also provide an overview on its main functions in non-mammalian vertebrates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadaptive immunity 3aangiogenesis 3acytokines 3aheat production 3ahematopoiesis 3ahomeostasis 3aimmune system 3aimmunomodulators 3ainflammation 3aleptin 3amammals 3anutritional status 3apathogenesis 3apleiotropy 3areproduction 0aLeptin 0aInnate immunity 0aAdaptive immunity 0aNon-mammalian vertebrates1 aLa Rocca, Claudia1 aCarbone, Fortunata1 aDe Rosa, Veronica1 aGalgani, Mario1 aMatarese, Giuseppe1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9429-06160 tDevelopmental and comparative immunology.g2017 Jan., v. 66 p.120-129dElsevier LtdwJournal:11789x0145-305X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dci.2016.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01646naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002300137245008100160300001600241500002000257520065100277592002800928650001000956650002400966650001000990650001501000651001301015700003201028700002401060773014301084856007101227961001301298852000901311655001201320IND60680202320221119223820.0200104e196411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068020232DNAL7 a10.2307/12365162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGibson, W.

The assumptions and limitations of the analysis should be explicitly defined to aid subsequent users of the results in deciding what inferences may be validly drawn from the study.  aPublisher supplied data 3afarms 3amathematical theory 3asales 3astatistics 3aVirginia1 aBoxley, Robert F., Jr.cJr.1 aHoffnar, Bernard R.0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g1964 Nov., v. 46, no. 4 p.835-840dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44932x0002-90927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/12365163Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ERS  aDNAL 7aarticle03204naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245010000169520153800269592002801807650001001835650002101845650001901866650001401885650002001899650001201919650002101931650001201952650000901964650000901973650002501982651001102007651001402018651001402032651001102046651001002057651001102067651001202078651000902090651001002099651001102109651001902120651001402139653002202153653002202175653002102197653002102218653002602239700001302265700001802278700005802296700001702354700001402371773012002385856008802505852000902593655001202602IND60773169120221123044121.0220517e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077316912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2022.1063352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Xudong10aGlobal anthropogenic CH4 emissions from 1970 to 2018: Gravity movement and decoupling evolution  aIn recent years, the growth rate of global non-CO₂ greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has exceeded carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions, among which methane (CH₄) emissions gradually attracted increasing attention. Compared with CO₂ emissions, the sources of CH₄ emissions are more complex. Based on the gravity theory and decoupling analysis, this study aims to explore the long-term time-series characteristics of global anthropogenic CH₄ emissions from 1970 to 2018. The results showed that the overall gravity center of global CH₄ emissions moved towards the east after 2000. The main driving forces could be attributed to the emissions from solid fuel production in China and the oil & gas exploitation in the United States. Specifically, the gravity center of CH₄ emissions from animal husbandry and rice cultivation exhibited a southward shift. Besides, most of the countries and economies were in a decoupling state, driving the gravity center of these countries to the east. Among them, most of the developed countries including Australia, Germany, France, Poland, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan showed a strong decoupling state between CH₄ emissions and economic development. However, some developing countries such as Angola, Venezuela, Brazil, Argentina, Libya, and Iran showed a negative decoupling state. By identifying the gravitational movement and decoupling evolution from 1970 to 2018, this study provides practical strategies and implications towards CH₄ emission mitigation worldwide.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJapan 3aanimal husbandry 3acarbon dioxide 3aevolution 3afuel production 3agravity 3agreenhouse gases 3amethane 3aoils 3arice 3atime series analysis 3aAngola 3aArgentina 3aAustralia 3aBrazil 3aChina 3aFrance 3aGermany 3aIran 3aLibya 3aPoland 3aUnited Kingdom 3aVenezuela 0aMethane emissions 0aStructural change 0aGravity movement 0aDecoupling state 0aNon-CO2 GHG emissions1 aLi, Zeyu1 aCheng, Xuelei1 aGuan, Chenghe,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5997-418X1 aHan, Mengyao1 aZhang, Bo0 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2022 July, v. 182 p.106335-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2022.1063353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02675naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245007600165300001600241520157400257592002801831650002201859650002101881650001701902650001001919650001901929650002401948650001301972650001501985700001502000700001802015700001702033700001402050700002002064700001802084773009702102856008102199852000902280655001202289IND50073018120221118060649.0150212e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007301812DNAL7 a10.1007/s13213-013-0642-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Zhengchu10aExpression of modified xynA gene fragments from Bacillus subtilis BE-91  ap. 139-145.  aExpression of modified xynA gene fragments in Escherichia coli BL21 was studied, using the complete xynA gene from Bacillus subtilis BE-91 as the positive control. The technical workflow consisted of the following steps: (1) predicting protein structures relative to the xynA gene; (2) designing primers for modifiers; (3) amplifying the modifiers; (4) integrating the modifiers with the pET-28a(+) vector; (5) transferring the recombinant plasmids into E. coli BL21; (6) evaluating and analyzing the expression of modified cells. The results were: (1) the xynA gene from BE-91 with the untranslated region deleted on both ends was able to promote XynA activity by 28.9 %; (2) deletion of the 1- to 16-amino acid (AA) coding sequence in the open reading frame on the 5′-end, deletion of the 209- to 213-AA fragment on the 3′-end and deletion of the 20 AA on both ends could promote XynA activity by 27.2, 27.7 and 24.0 %,respectively; (3) deletion of the 1- to 29-AA fragment on the 5′-end and deletion of the 197- to 213-AA fragment on the 3′-end could reduce XynA activity dramatically by 95.6 and 74.8 %, respectively; (4) inactivation factors of XynA would be either the first β-fold and the hydrophilic structure domain or the last two α-screws and the seventeenth turn region. The results mean that any deletion in the catalytic domain would lead to a decline or inactivation in XynA activity while the deletion of any sequence outside the catalytic domain could effectively promote XynA activity, as such sequences are unnecessary for XynA function.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aEscherichia coli 3aactive sites 3agenes 3ahydrophilicity 3aopen reading frames 3aplasmids 3aprediction1 aXu, Junfei1 aDuan, Shenwen1 aZhang, Juzuo1 aZheng, Ke1 aFeng, Xiangyuan1 aCheng, Lifeng0 tAnnals of microbiology.g2014 Mar., v. 64, no. 1 p.139-145dSpringer-Verlagx1590-42617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13213-013-0642-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04123naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003200135040001800167100001900185245016000204300001200364506007600376520211900452592002802571506003702599650001302636650002002649650001302669650001602682650001702698650000802715650001502723650001502738650001302753650002802766650001602794650001002810650001002820650002102830650002002851650001702871650001902888650001302907650001102920650000902931650004202940650001102982650002702993650002003020650000903040650002103049650002303070650003103093650002603124650001603150650001903166650001603185650001603201700001703217773016103234856004503395852000903440655001203449IND50058749520221207131247.0201006e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005874952DNAL7 a218102222pmid7 aPMC31628762pmcid7 a10.1186/1479-5868-8-832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnson, Fiona14aThe association between weight loss and engagement with a web-based food and exercise diary in a commercial weight loss programme: a retrospective analysis  ap. 475.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The Internet provides a widely accessible platform for weight loss interventions. Automated tools can allow self-guided monitoring of food intake and other target behaviours that are established correlates of weight change. Many programmes also offer social support from the virtual community. The aim of this research was to assess associations between engagement with self-monitoring tools and social support, and weight loss in an online weight-control programme. METHODS: This paper describes a retrospective analysis of weight change among 3621 subscribers to a commercial Internet-based weight loss programme. Participants were all subscribers (2979 women; 642 men) joining the programme between July 2005 and November 2008 with two or more recorded weights spanning at least 28 days of participation in the programme. Engagement was indexed with frequency of using online diet and exercise diaries and with use of the social support forums. RESULTS: Programme engagement was associated with weight loss in both men and women after controlling for initial BMI and duration of participation. The three engagement variables accounted for 13% of variance in percentage weight loss in women (p < .001) and 19% in men (p < .001). In analyses including all the engagement variables, exercise diary use was an independent predictor of weight loss among men, but non-significant in women. In contrast, use of the online forums was associated with weight loss in women but not in men. Among participants who were overweight or obese, those in the highest tertile of engagement with food diaries (vs the lowest) were more likely to achieve clinically significant (> 5%) weight loss (men: OR = 3.45 p < .001; women: OR = 5.05 p < .001). Being in the highest tertile of engagement with exercise diaries was associated with clinically significant weight loss in men (OR = 3.48 p < .001) and, less strongly, in women (OR = 1.46 p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Use of self-monitoring tools and participation in online support are predictive of weight loss in the context of a commercial, online weight control programme.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aInternet 3abody mass index 3aexercise 3afood intake 3afood records 3amen 3amonitoring 3aoverweight 3avariance 3aweight control programs 3aweight loss 3awomen 2aAdult 2aBody Composition 2aBody Mass Index 2aDiet Records 2aDiet, Reducing 2aExercise 2aFemale 2aFood 2aHealth Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice 2aHumans 2aInternetxutilization. 2aLogistic Models 2aMale 2aObesityxtherapy 2aPatient Compliance 2aPatient Education as Topic 2aRetrospective Studies 2aSelf Report 2aSocial Support 2aWeight Loss 2aYoung Adult1 aWardle, Jane0 tinternational journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity.g2011 Dec., v. 8, no. 1 p.475-475dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:jnl4350546x1479-58687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1479-5868-8-83  aDNAL 7aarticle03902naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245019400170520232100364592002802685650001102713650000902724650001302733650001102746650002002757650001102777650001002788650001902798650001702817650000802834650001402842650001502856650002202871650002402893650002202917650002502939650001602964650001602980650001702996650001003013651001003023700001803033700001703051700002303068700001903091700001803110700001603128773013403144856008503278852000903363655001203372IND60672748920221120074955.0191017e20190613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067274892DNAL7 a10.1093/cdn/nzz034.P10-078-192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyen, Phuong10aUrbanization and the Double Burden: Trends and Inequalities in Under- and Over-nutrition by Residence and Wealth Among 1.22 Million Indian Children, Women and Men over 10 Years (P10-078-19)  aWe examined trends and inequities in the double burden of malnutrition among girls, boys, women and men by residence and wealth between 2006 and 2016 in India where 590 million individuals are expected to live in cities by 2030. Two rounds of National Family Health Survey data collected in 2006 and 2016 (n = 276,000 children 0–59 mo; 768,000 women 15–49y; and 178,000 men 15–54y) were used. Residence was categorized as rural (RUR), urban non-slum (U-NS) and urban slum (U-SL). Multivariate regression analyses were used to examine differences and changes over time in outcomes by residential group and gender. A socioeconomic status (SES) index was created for each residential area and inequalities were assessed using concentration and slope indices. Children in different residential areas were born with similar height-for-age Z-scores, but growth faltering during the first two years of life was most rapid among children in RUR areas, followed by U-SL and U-NS areas. Boys and girls were equally likely to be stunted (48% in 2006 to 38% in 2016) or overweight (7–8% at both times). SES gaps were large for undernutrition, small for overnutrition, and did not change greatly in the past decade. Among adults, underweight prevalence decreased equally across residential areas (4–5%) to reach 20% on average in both men and women. Overweight prevalence increased more rapidly among those living in RUR areas (7–9%) compared to U-SL (4–6%) and U-NS (1–3%) areas, and also reached ∼20%. The SES gap for underweight was narrower in 2016 than in 2006, mainly due to improvements among the poor in all residential areas. Overweight prevalence increased in all SES quintiles in RUR and U-SL areas and increased among the poor in U-NS areas. The double burden of malnutrition is now a reality among adults in India. Although undernutrition has been reduced in both rural and urban areas over the past decade, the rate of increase in overweight was much larger in rural compared to urban areas; and more so in slums compared to non-slum areas. A further examination of changing living conditions, food environments, and physical activity levels is needed to identify and address the causes for these rapid changes in nutrition outcomes.

Although previous studies have verified a linear relationship between nighttime light data (NTL) and CO₂ emissions at the provincial level, the consistent fitting coefficient adopted by cities ignored the socioeconomic characteristics of the city itself. Therefore, this study proposed a new method of using NTL to account city-level CO₂ by dividing all cities into seven types which were mainly characterized by resources-based, energy-produced, light industry-based, heavy industry-based, high-end service-based, general service-based, and others using K-means, and constructing multivariate regression and hierarchical regression model to correct fitting coefficients of NTL of each city. The results showed that the estimation in this study improved the accuracy of city-level direct CO₂ emissions compared with fitting results obtained directly by NTL. The high-emission cities concentrated in four urban agglomerations accounted for 32.68% of total emissions. Resources-based cities, energy-produced cities, and heavy industry-based cities showed higher CO₂ emissions intensity (CEI) and CO₂ emissions per capita (CEC) among seven-type cities. The contribution of population density to the cities with low CEI and CEC was obvious, but the trends of urbanization and GDP per capita were opposite. This study improved and enriched the methods of estimating city-level CO₂ emissions with NTL, and provided support for different-type cities to formulate targeted CO₂ emission reduction policies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3apopulation density 3aregression analysis 3aurbanization 0aCarbon emissions 0aCity-level 0aNighttime light 0aCity attributes 0aCarbon emissions intensity 0aCarbon emissions per capita1 aChen, Mingxing1 aTang, Zhipeng1 aZhao, You0 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2022 July, v. 182 p.106337-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2022.1063373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02940naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245008900131300001600220520154100236592002801777650001801805650002501823650002201848650001601870650002601886650001201912650001101924650001001935650002401945650001201969650001201981650002401993650001702017650001702034650001202051650002202063650001902085650002202104650001502126650001702141651001802158653002102176653003202197653003402229653001202263653002602275773012402301852000902425655001202434IND60706014420221119040705.0200807e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070601442DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGupta, Shalani10aCommercialization of transgenic horticultural crops: challenges and future prospects  ap. 129-134.  aGenetic approaches have been utilized extensively for crop improvement, and biotechnology has expanded the tools available to geneticists and breeders. Transgenic technologies offer many scientific advantages in breeding for improved horticultural crops’ quality and performance. However, in contrast to the increasing global adoption of transgenic/biotech field crops, biotechnology has had limited commercial success to date in horticultural crops, including fruits, vegetables, flowers and landscape plants. A very few genetically engineered horticultural crops have been released to farmers, either in the United States or overseas. Though, various traits that would be desired by growers and consumers of horticultural crops, including novel genetic methods for disease and insect pest protection, weed control, longer-lived flowers and slower-growing grass, etc have been developed and tested without as yet achieving commercialization. The number of field trials of biotech horticultural crops has recently dwindled to only a handful in fruits and vegetables. As a consequence of the disappointing past commercial results and current market outlook, many horticultural seed and nursery companies are reducing their investments in research involving genetic engineering. After more than two decades of intensive research, the market for transgenic crops is still dominated by applications of just a handful of methods and genes. In this paper, major challenges being faced by the horticultural biotechnology have been discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiotechnology 3abusiness enterprises 3acommercialization 3afield crops 3afield experimentation 3aflowers 3afruits 3agenes 3agenetic engineering 3agrasses 3agrowers 3ahorticultural crops 3ahorticulture 3ainsect pests 3amarkets 3aornamental plants 3aplant breeding 3atransgenic plants 3avegetables 3aweed control 3aUnited States 0aTransgenic crops 0aHorticultural biotechnology 0atransgenics commercialization 0ahurdles 0abiosafety regulations0 tAnnals of horticulture.g2014 Dec., v. 7, no. 2 p.129-134dHi-Tech Horticultural SocietywJournal:2107x0976-46237nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle04506naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245013200168520235500300592002802655650001302683650003002696650002202726650001802748650001902766650001902785650002002804650001602824650002202840650002002862650001602882650001802898650001202916650000902928650001102937650001102948650001902959650002902978650001203007650002503019650002803044650000903072650003003081650002303111650000903134650001203143650000903155650002203164650001903186650001903205650001003224650001303234650002403247650001003271650002003281650003703301650002103338650001103359650002303370650001003393651001203403700002003415700002403435700001803459700002403477700001903501773013403520856008503654852000903739655001203748IND60672749020221123041613.0191017e20190613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067274902DNAL7 a10.1093/cdn/nzz034.P10-079-192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNUPO, Sunday10aAssociation Between Dietary Diversity, Waist to Hip Ratio and Cardiovascular Diseases Among Selected African Women (P10-079-19)  aThis study investigated the association between the dietary diversity, waist to hip ratio and cardiovascular diseases among women African. A longitudinal study was carried out among randomly selected one thousand eight hundred and ninety eight ready and willing women in Nigeria. A pretested structured questionnaire was used to elicit information on socio-demographic characteristics and physical activity pattern of the respondents. Information on dietary diversity score (DDS) was obtained using a standardized Food and Nutrition Technical Assistant (FANTA) Project Questionnaire. Body Mass Index (BMI), Waist to Hip Ratio (WHR) and Mid Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) were calculated from anthropometric measurements and used to classify subjects’ nutritional status. Nutrient intake was obtained using 24-hour dietary recall technique. The blood pressures of the subjects were measured using sphygmomanometer and classified using World Health Organization standard. The total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low density lipoprotein (LDL), high density lipoprotein (HDL) and fasting blood sugar (FBS) were determined from collected blood samples of selected participants. Cardiovascular Risk was determined using American Heart Diseases software Version10. Data collected were analyzed using Statistical package for social science version 21. The DDS for cereals and grain (1.5 ± 0.2), Seeds, nuts and legumes (0.41 ± .4), starchy, roots and tubers (1.8 ± 5 and 1.59 ± 0.5), Fruits group (0.53 ± 0.19), meat and meat products (0.36 ± 0.4), fish and sea foods (1.09 ± 0.3), Oil and dairy group (0.17 ± 0.4).The BMI showed that 19% had obesity grade I, 8% had obesity grade II while WHR indicated that 6% were overweight and 10% obese. The mean energy intake was 2068 ± 957 kcal while the protein intake was 116 ± 59 g/day. Desirable TC level (<200 mg/dl) was found in 80% of the selected subjects while the normal TG (<150 mg/dl) and LDL (<129 mg/dl) was found in 95% and 90% subjects respectively. Cardiovascular disease risk showed that (93%) of the subjects had low risk while 7% had average risk. The study showed significant relationship (r < 0.05) between dietary diversity, waist to hip ratio, obesity as well as sedentary lifestyle and the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases.

A pair of isotope reagents (ω-bromoacetonylquinolinium bromide, BQB; ω-bromoacetonylquinolinium-d7 bromide, BQB-d7) were used to label thiols; while for the aldehydes, a pair of isotope reagents (4-(2-(trimethylammonio) ethoxy) benzenaminium halide, 4-APC; 4-(2-(trimethylammonio) ethoxy) benzenaminium halide-d4, 4-APC-d4) were used. The labeled thiols and aldehydes were extracted and purified with solid-phase extraction, respectively, followed by LC–MS analysis. Using the proposed SIL-SPE-LC-DPIS/DNLS-MS methods, 76 thiol and 25 aldehyde candidates were found in beer. Furthermore, we established SIL-SPE-LC-MRM-MS methods for the relative quantitation of thiols and aldehydes in different beer samples. The results showed that the contents of thiols and aldehydes are closely related to the brands and origins of beers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaldehydes 3abeers 3aisotope labeling 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3asolid phase extraction 3astable isotopes 3athiols 0aSolid phase extraction 0aIsotope labeling 0aDouble neutral loss scan 0aDouble precursor ion scan 0aMultiple reaction monitoring 0aAldehydes 0aThiols1 aWang, Ya-Lan1 aLiu, Ping1 aZhang, Zheng1 aYu, Lei1 aYuan, Bi-Feng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1107-53851 aFeng, Yu-Qi0 tFood chemistry.g2017 Dec. 15, v. 237 p.399-407dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.05.0903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03000naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245009800176520167100274592002801945650002101973650001701994650001202011650001102023650002302034650003302057650000902090650001802099650002502117650001702142650001602159650001902175653003802194653001602232653002402248653002202272700002302294700002602317700002002343773010702363856008702470852000902557655001202566IND60679737620221116200509.0200320e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067973762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2019.1054532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNagata, Gabriele A.10aAnalysis of the isothermal condition in drying of acai berry residues for biomass application  aSolid waste from acai berry (Euterpe oleracea Mart.) processing plants has gained attraction as biomass with great source of thermal energy. To increase the efficiency of thermochemical conversion process and improve its economic and environmental benefits, this bio-waste has to be submitted to drying, which is seen as a highly energy-intensive process. In this work, the coupling between heat and mass transfer established in convective drying of a spherical-shape biomass was investigated in order to obtain further information regarding to the isothermal approach. The experimental work consisted of the determination of temperature and moisture content of acai berry solid waste as function of the time at particle-level in a tunnel dryer. Experimental data was treated according to analytical solutions from heat and mass transfer diffusion theories, which provided the estimation of useful transport parameters to allow discussions of heat or mass transfer limiting and the approach to the isothermal condition. To facilitate this analysis, it was proposed a parameter called dimensionless penetration time. The experimental results showed that the temperature of the solid rapidly reached a stationary value closed to that for the gas, while the equilibrium moisture content took a longer time to be attained. In accordance to these findings, it was shown that heat and mass transfer phenomena are not strongly coupled for the reason that the dimensionless penetration time was much less than unity, indicating that the drying process is limited by moisture diffusion. Analysis of heat and mass transfer efficiencies was reported to strengthen such results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuterpe oleracea 3aacai berries 3abiomass 3adrying 3aecosystem services 3aequilibrium moisture content 3aheat 3amass transfer 3amoisture diffusivity 3asolid wastes 3atemperature 3athermal energy 0aHeat and mass transfer efficiency 0aSolid waste 0aThermal diffusivity 0aThermal treatment1 aSouto, Bernardo A.1 aPerazzini, Maisa T.B.1 aPerazzini, Hugo0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2020 Feb., v. 133 p.105453-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2019.1054533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02494naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006100149245013000210300001400340520107700354592002801431650002901459650001301488650001301501650001201514650002001526650002001546650001701566650002001583650002201603650003701625650001401662650001301676650001701689653002401706653001201730653001301742653002501755700001601780700002001796773013901816856008401955852000902039655001202048IND60528504720221118144310.0190318e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052850472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cimid.2016.06.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl-Azizi, Mohamed1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2815-142010aEfficacy of selected biocides in the decontamination of common nosocomial bacterial pathogens in biofilm and planktonic forms  ap. 60-71.  aThe efficacy and use of biocides to eliminate pathogens in the health care environment are based on their testing against planktonic bacteria. In the environment, bacteria exist in biofilms, as they do on medical devices, and as planktonic or viable non-culturable forms as well. This work aimed to evaluate the efficacy of four biocides against the biofilm and planktonic phases of nine common nosocomial bacteria. The bactericidal activity of the biocides against bacteria in the planktonic form was assessed using a broth microdilution technique. The killing activity of the biocides against biofilms was evaluated using cells grown on polyethylene tubes under a dynamic flow-cell system that was designed for biofilm growth. All biocides completely killed the planktonic bacteria at all concentrations; however, they did not eradicate the biofilms of the same pathogens. Our study highlights the need for an alternative strategy, one that utilizes chemicals that have been tested to disrupt or prevent biofilm growth, in order to enhance current disinfection practice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibacterial properties 3abacteria 3abiocides 3abiofilm 3across infection 3adecontamination 3adisinfection 3ahealth services 3amedical equipment 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3apathogens 3aplankton 3apolyethylene 0aPlanktonic bacteria 0aBiofilm 0aBiocides 0aNosocomial infection1 aFarag, Noha1 aKhardori, Nancy0 tComparative immunology, microbiology, and infectious diseases.g2016 Aug., v. 47 p.60-71dElsevier LtdwJournal:12359x0147-95717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cimid.2016.06.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02258naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245012100168520100200289592002801291650001101319650001901330650001101349650002501360650002601385650002701411650001501438651001001453653003401463653002201497653001501519653002701534653003101561700001501592700002101607700001501628773012001643856008801763852000901851655001201860IND60773169520221120034624.0220517e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077316952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2022.1063402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Fan10aPrediction of China's copper material flows under carbon emissions projections for the shared socioeconomic pathways  aThe production and utilization of metal resources are a major source of carbon emissions and will be constrained by future carbon peaking and carbon neutrality. Based on carbon emissions scenarios of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP1–5), we performed a life cycle assessment and material flow analysis to analyze future domestic copper production and utilization under the constraint of CO₂ budgets in China. Our findings indicates that secondary copper has potential to substitute primary copper as a major component of copper production in the future. Copper in-use stock shows a peaking trend, while the flow intensity is projected to show an overall decreasing trend, indicating the beginning of a transitional period relating to economic growth and copper utilization. Meanwhile, the increase of recovery level shows contributions to copper production. Conclusions above suggest the importance of active resource recovery and the decoupling of metal production from economic activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acopper 3aeconomic development 3alife cycle assessment 3amaterial flow analysis 3aprediction 3aChina 0aPeak carbon dioxide emissions 0aCarbon neutrality 0aCopper ore 0aMaterial flow analysis 0aCarbon emissions reduction1 aDing, Yuze1 aDeng, Xiangzheng1 aLiu, Litao0 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2022 July, v. 182 p.106340-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2022.1063403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03728naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245012400164300001400288520215900302592002802461650002302489650002102512650001802533650001002551650002302561650001802584650001002602650001302612650001102625650003002636650001702666650001902683650001302702650002202715650001202737650001702749650002302766650000902789650001102798650001602809650001502825650001102840651002102851651001002872700001902882700001702901700002102918700002102939773012702960856007803087852000903165655001203174IND60772778020221119110912.0220409e20220322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077277802DNAL7 a10.17221/159/2021-jfs2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPanda, Sucharita10aGrowth response of seven multipurpose tree species to climatic factors: A case study from northwestern Himalayas, India  ap. 83-95.  aIdentification of the species for dendrochronological studies is of great relevance to understand various aspects of climate change. However, in the northwestern Himalayan region, dendroclimatological investigations are confined to conifer species, with broadleaved species being disregarded. Thus, the present study was conducted to assess the growth response of seven multipurpose tree species (MPTs), namely Bauhinia variegata, Celtis australis, Grewia optiva, Paulownia fortunei, Toona ciliata, Ulmus villosa and Melia composita to local climate variables, viz. temperature as well as rainfall (seasonal, monthly, average) and CO2 level by evaluating the climatic signal in tree ring chronologies at Solan district, India (altitude 1 250 m) in the mid-hills of the northwestern Himalayas. The results indicated that only the maximum, rainy season temperature and CO2 level varied significantly (P &lt; 0.05) between 1991 and 2017. Only G. optiva exhibited a significant (P &lt; 0.05) tendency toward increased growth. C. australis has a remarkable negative correlation with temperature variables, viz. average, maximum, spring season, March temperature, whereas T. ciliata exhibits a positive correlation with temperature variables, such as rainy season, average and April temperature. Similarly, winter, total and December rainfall have a profound effect on P. fortunei, while March rainfall adversely affected the growth of B. variegata. On the other hand, G. optiva demonstrated sensitivity to both temperature (February and May) and rainfall variables (winter, February and May). U. villosa recorded a positive correlation with rainfall (autumn and October rainfall) but a negative correlation with temperature variables (maximum and April temperature). Elevated CO2 levels affected only two species (G. optiva, M. composita) out of the seven selected species. Our findings will contribute to a better understanding of the climate growth relationships of investigated tree species, as a result, to more accurate projections of the effects of climate change on these MPTs and directing future studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBauhinia variegata 3aCeltis australis 3aGrewia optiva 3aMelia 3aPaulownia fortunei 3aToona ciliata 3aUlmus 3aaltitude 3aautumn 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3aconifers 3adendroclimatology 3aforests 3agrowth rings 3amultipurpose trees 3arain 3aspring 3atemperature 3awet season 3awinter 3aHimalayan region 3aIndia1 aBhardwaj, D.R.1 aThakur, C.L.1 aSharma, Prashant1 aKumar, Dhirender0 tJournal of Forest Science.g, v. 68, no. 3 p.83-95dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21419x1212-48347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/159/2021-jfs3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02348naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245012000166520104500286592002801331650003401359650001701393650002101410650001501431650002001446650001701466653002401483653001201507653001301519653000901532653000701541653000901548653001201557653000701569653001001576653000901586700001801595700001401613700001601627700001801643700001601661700001301677773009401690856008501784852000901869655001201878IND60748053320221117231431.0211009e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074805332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phymed.2021.1537132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Haixia10aYiqi-Huoxue granule promotes angiogenesis of ischemic myocardium through miR-126/PI3K/Akt axis in endothelial cells  aYiqi-Huoxue granule (YQHX), consisting of four kinds of traditional Chinese medicine, is an empirical prescription for the treatment of coronary heart disease. It is known to promote angiogenesis, but the mechanism is unknown.This article investigates the possible mechanism of YQHX inducing angiogenesis in the ischemic myocardium.EAhy.926 cells were treated with YQHX hypoxic cardiomyocyte-conditioned medium (YHMCM) and the levels of VEGF, CD34, and phosphorylation of PI3K/Akt were detected by western blotting. Also, the effects on endothelial tube formation and migration were observed. The level of miR-126 was detected by qRT-PCR.YQHX promoted tube formation and migration of EAhy.926 cells and upregulated VEGF, CD34, and the phosphorylation of PI3K/AKT via regulating miR-126 levels. However, these effects were inhibited by a miR-126 inhibitor.In summary, YQHX improves angiogenesis by regulating the miR-126/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which indicates that YQHX could be a promising therapeutic strategy for ischemic myocardium.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aangiogenesis 3acoronary disease 3amyocardium 3aphosphorylation 3atherapeutics 0aYiqi Huoxue granule 0amiR-126 0aPI3K/Akt 0aHMCM 0aMI 0aPVDF 0aqRT-PCR 0aRT 0aYHMCM 0aYQHX1 aPeng, Chaojie1 aWu, Linke1 aGao, Shuibo1 aWang, Zhentao1 aDai, Liping1 aWu, Hong0 tPhytomedicine.g2021 Nov., v. 92 p.153713-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:12402x0944-71137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2021.1537133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02456naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005400153245012800207520103400335592002801369650001801397650002601415650001201441650002701453650002401480650001001504650001501514650001501529650002501544653001501569653003201584653002301616653002101639653003601660653003401696700001501730700001501745700005701760773012001817856008801937852000902025655001202034IND60773169620221120034544.0220517e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077316962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2022.1063412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Yanyan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9676-766814aThe interactions between microalgae and wastewater indigenous bacteria for treatment and valorization of brewery wastewater  aThis study aims to elucidate the changes in indigenous bacterial composition in four different microalgal cultures and compare brewery wastewater treatment efficiency, amino and fatty acids content of the four microalgal systems with and without indigenous bacteria. 16S rRNA gene sequences indicate that microalgae affect the bacterial community composition. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency was significantly higher in algal-bacterial culture (>80%) compared with algal culture (40%), and different bacterial compositions did not change COD removal for four algal species. C. vulgaris showed the highest TN (>94%) and TP removal capability among the four species. No significant differences in TN removal were found between mixed and algal cultures. Again, indigenous bacteria did not cause significant differences in TP removal except for C. vulgaris. Besides, the influence of indigenous brewery bacteria on the concentration of different amino and fatty acids in algal biomass was algal species-dependent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgae culture 3abacterial communities 3abiomass 3achemical oxygen demand 3acommunity structure 3agenes 3amicroalgae 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aMicroalgae 0aIndigenous brewery bacteria 0aBrewery wastewater 0aNutrient removal 0aBacterial community composition 0aAmino and fatty acids profile1 aZhu, Xinyu1 aZou, Rusen1 aZhang, Yifeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2832-22770 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2022 July, v. 182 p.106341-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2022.1063413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03778naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245015100160500002000311520178000331592002802111596006902139596006702208596006702275596006702342596007902409650001102488650001602499650001902515650001302534650001502547650002402562651001202586700005602598700005902654700001802713700005902731700001802790700005302808700005702861700005102918700005602969700005503025773013003080856007703210852000903287655001203296IND60778439120221122225535.0220527e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077843912DNAL7 a10.1029/2021WR0308272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Shuzhe12aA Novel Fusion Method for Generating Surface Soil Moisture Data With High Accuracy, High Spatial Resolution, and High Spatio‐Temporal Continuity  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSurface soil moisture (SSM) has a considerable impact on land‐atmosphere exchanges of water and energy fluxes. However, due to the inherent deficiencies of remotely sensed data (e.g., cloud contamination in thermal remote sensing and coarse resolutions for microwave remote sensing), none of the current algorithms alone can provide daily and seamless field‐scale (30 m) SSM information. To fill the gap, we proposed a novel SSM fusion framework to Generate high Resolution, Accurate, Seamless data using Point‐Surface fusion (GRASPS) based on remotely sensed, reanalysis, and in‐situ data sets. First, 30 m seamless continuous SSM correlated variables (land surface temperature, NDVI, and albedo) were downscaled by enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model. Then, downscaled auxiliary variables and other background variables were input into a deep learning model to produce 30 m daily and seamless SSM fields. To further improve the SSM estimation accuracy, a pixel classification‐based bias correction method was developed. The GRASPS method was validated over an in situ soil moisture sensor network (HOAL network) in Austria. The average Pearson correlation coefficient, root mean square error (RMSE), unbiased RMSE (ubRMSE), bias, and mean absolute error (MAE) over all validation sites achieved 0.78, 0.048, 0.033, −0.001, and 0.041 m3m−3 ${\mathrm{m}}^{3}{\mathrm{m}}^{-3}$, respectively. After bias correction, RMSE, ubRMSE, bias, and MAE decreased by 13%, 7%, 22%, and 18%, respectively. The proposed method maximizes the potential of data fusion and deep learning in generating field‐scale seamless SSM, which is promising for fine‐scale studies and applications in agricultural, hydrological, and environmental domains.  aPublisher supplied data  a2020CFB615cHubei Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China  a41890822cNational Natural Science Foundation of China Program  a41801339cNational Natural Science Foundation of China Program  a52179021cNational Natural Science Foundation of China Program  aOFSLRSS202114cOpen Fund of State Key Laboratory of Remote Sensing Science 3amodels 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3aresearch 3asoil water 3asurface temperature 3aAustria1 aZhang, Xiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1017-742X1 aChen, Nengcheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3521-99721 aMa, Hongliang1 aFu, P.q(Peng),1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1568-15181 aDong, Jianzhi1 aGu, Xihui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7414-53711 aNam, Won‐Ho1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9671-65691 aXu, Lei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6454-29631 aRab, Gerhard1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2271-275X1 aNiyogi, Dev1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1848-50800 tWater resources research.g2022 May, v. 58, no. 5 p.e2021WR030827-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021WR0308273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02632naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245011800170300001600288520125800304592002801562650002201590650001501612650002201627650000901649650001501658650001901673650001101692650001201703650001501715650001601730650001101746650001401757653001101771653003301782653001901815653002101834653001401855653001601869700001801885700001801903700001701921700001801938773010001956856008502056852000902141655001202150IND60609689920221122063431.0200809e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060968992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2017.06.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Joon-Phil10aAnalysis of the rheological behavior of Fe trimodal micro-nano powder feedstock in micro powder injection molding  ap. 253-260.  aThe rheological behavior of Fe trimodal powder feedstock for μ-PIM was investigated using torque rheometer analysis. The feedstock was prepared by mixing Fe micropowder (~4μm) and nanopowder agglomerates containing discrete particles with sizes of ~300nm and ~30nm, with low viscosity wax-based binders. During the feedstock mixing, a significant increase in mixing torque was observed at powder content above 72vol% in the feedstock, indicating the critical powder loading. The results obtained from the torque rheometer experiment at selected powder loadings of 66–74vol% were used as fundamental rheological parameters including flow behavior index (n), flow activation energy (E), and general moldability index (αₛₜᵥ). In addition, the influence of shear rate, temperature, and powder loading on feedstock viscosity was evaluated. It was found that the feedstock with 72vol% powder loading exhibited the best rheological behavior with the highest moldability parameter and homogeneous microstructure. Due to the lack of research on the trimodal system in the field of powder metallurgy and powder technology, this paper provides the possibility of applying the trimodal powder mixture to a near net-shape production technique such as PIM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3afeedstocks 3ainjection molding 3airon 3ametallurgy 3amicrostructure 3amixing 3apowders 3arheometers 3atemperature 3atorque 3aviscosity 0aμ-PIM 0aFe trimodal powder feedstock 0aPowder loading 0aTorque rheometer 0aViscosity 0aMoldability1 aPark, Jin-Soo1 aHong, Eui-Jin1 aLee, Won-Sik1 aLee, Jai-Sung0 tPowder technology.g2017 Sept., v. 319 p.253-260dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2017.06.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04000naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245010100176300001800277506007600295520210000371592002802471506003702499650002302536650002402559650002002583650001302603650001202616650001502628650001602643650001302659650001402672651001002686653001002696653001202706653001702718653002202735653001302757653001002770700001602780700002402796700001902820700005602839700001902895700002102914700002002935700002102955700002702976700002403003700001403027700002003041700002203061700001903083700002603102710005303128773009803181856008603279852000903365655001203374IND60768815720221207063908.0221004e20220503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076881572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2022.02.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBose, Anindya Sekhar10aNepal measles outbreak response immunization during COVID-19: A risk-based intervention strategy  ap. 2884-2893.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn 2020, National Immunization Programme (NIP) of Nepal implemented a measles outbreak response immunization (ORI) campaign, which was additional to an ongoing preventive measles-rubella SIA campaign. Both campaigns were implemented during ongoing COVID-19 transmission. By April, 220 measles cases and two deaths were confirmed from eight districts of Nepal. The NIP triangulated information from surveillance (measles and COVID-19), measles immunization performance and immunity profile, programme capacities and community engagement and applied a logical decision-making framework to the collated data to inform ‘Go/No-Go’ decisions for ORI interventions. This was reviewed by the National Immunization Advisory Committee (NIAC) for endorsement. Outbreak response with non-selective immunization (ORI), vitamin-A administration and case management were implemented in affected municipalities of four districts, while in the remaining districts outbreak response without ORI were undertaken. The structure and iterative application of this logical framework has been described. ORI was implemented without interrupting the ongoing measles-rubella vaccination campaign which had targeted children from 9 to 59 months of age. The age group for ORI was same as SIA in one sub-district area, while for the other three sub-district areas it was from 6 months to 15 years of age. More than 32,000 persons (97% coverage) were vaccinated in ORI response. Overall measles incidence decreased by 98% after ORI. The daily incidence rate of measles was 94 times higher (95% confidence interval: 36.11 – 347.62) before the ORI compared to two weeks after ORI until year end. Close attention to surveillance and other data to inform actions and seamless collaboration between NIP and core immunization partners (WHO, UNICEF), with guidance from NIAC were key elements in successful implementation. This was an example of feasible application of the global framework for implementation of a mass vaccination campaign during COVID-19 through application of a simple decision-making logical framework.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aconfidence interval 3adecision making 3aimmunity 3ameasles 3amonitoring 3avaccination 3avaccines 3avitamin A 3aNepal 0aNepal 0aMeasles 0aImmunization 0aOutbreak response 0aCOVID-19 0aNITAG1 aRai, Pasang1 aGupta, Binod Prasad1 aPradhan, Rahul1 aLacoul, Mona1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0979-58531 aShakya, Sushil1 aShrestha, Dipesh1 aGautam, Abhiyan1 aBhandari, Bharat1 aShrestha, Basanta Raj,1 aTinkari, Bhim Singh1 aJha, Runa1 aKhanal, Basudha1 aShrestha, Pradeep1 aBhusal, Sushma1 aGautam, Jhalak Sharma2 aNational Immunization Advisory Committeeeauthor0 tVaccine.g2022 May 03, v. 40, no. 20 p.2884-2893dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2022.02.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03374naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245011200169300001600281520146100297592002801758650001701786650001201803650002401815650002601839650002601865650002101891650002501912650003201937650001701969650003701986650002902023650002402052650001302076650002902089650001102118650002502129653002302154653004002177653002102217653002402238653003502262700005902297700001502356700005702371700001902428700005902447700001802506700001602524700002002540700002002560773011902580856008802699852000902787655001202796IND60635069120221120040520.0190523e20190701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063506912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.03.2722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHao, Liting10aEffects of levofloxacin exposure on sequencing batch reactor (SBR) behavior and microbial community changes  ap. 227-238.  aThe adaptation mechanisms of bacterial community for nitrogen removal performance exposed to fluctuated levels of levofloxacin (LVX) during wastewater treatment in SBRs were investigated. Although LVX is completely synthetic, the results of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC, 32 mg-LVX/L) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC, 512 mg-LVX/L) of the sampled sludge showed that the LVX resistance/tolerance for bacterial growth has already existed in the actual wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The key bacteria, i.e. Nitrosomonas sp. (ammonia-oxidizing bacteria), Nitrospira sp. (nitrite-oxidizing bacteria) and Thauera sp. (the predominant denitrifiers), decreased with LVX exposure, and the recovery of biological process in the reactor was disturbed due to LVX exposure. However, after stopping exposure their population was quickly increased and thus the performance was recovered. The results of the non-metric multidimensional scaling and microbial community by sequencing showed the LVX concentration was a crucial factor to the change of bacterial communities and controlled the quantitative evolution of the communities in our systems. This effect was more pronounced as the LVX concentration was higher. The results suggested the removal of residual antibiotics to accomplish under no effect concentration before biological treatment is important to suppress emerging and increasing of the antibiotic resistant bacteria in WWTPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNitrosomonas 3aThauera 3aantibiotic residues 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacterial communities 3abacterial growth 3abiological treatment 3adenitrifying microorganisms 3alevofloxacin 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3amultidimensional scaling 3anitrifying bacteria 3anitrogen 3anitrogen-fixing bacteria 3asludge 3awastewater treatment 0aLevofloxacin (LVX) 0aAntibiotics contaminated wastewater 0aNitrogen removal 0aMicrobial community 0aSequencing batch reactor (SBR)1 aOkano, Kunihiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9845-32241 aZhang, Chi1 aZhang, Zhenya1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2554-61681 aLei, Zhongfang1 aFeng, Chuanping1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5485-02601 aUtsumi, Motoo1 aIhara, Ikko1 aMaseda, Hideaki1 aShimizu, Kazuya0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 July 01, v. 672 p.227-238dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.03.2723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01347naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245011100153300002000264520044200284592002800726650001600754650001700770650001200787650001500799650002200814700001400836773012400850856007400974852000901048655001201057IND60640312120221120231347.0190504e20160226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064031212DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra27530j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKala, K.12aA carbazole based “Turn on” fluorescent sensor for selective detection of Hg²⁺ in an aqueous medium  ap. 22615-22619.  aWe developed a multimode Hg²⁺ selective sensor system based on carbazole-barbituric acid conjugate (CBA).

Alpine rivers and streams on the Qinghai‐Tibet Plateau (QTP) are especially vulnerable to disturbance owing to limited taxonomic complexity. The effects of flow have been studied using specific taxa, yet the flow‐biota relationships of assemblages are poorly understood. A multi‐metric habitat suitability model (MM‐HSM) was developed using integrated measures of entire macroinvertebrate assemblages to substitute for habitat suitability indices derived from individual taxa. The MM‐HSM was trained using macroinvertebrates data from three alpine rivers on the QTP, including the Yarlung Tsangpo, the Nujiang, and the Bai rivers, and then validated using data from a forth alpine river (the Lanmucuo). The model produced predictions using the training data set (R² = 0.587) and the validation data set (R² = 0.489). By coupling the MM‐HSM with hydrodynamic simulations, the relationship between weighted usable area and flow (0.11–1.99 m³ s⁻¹) for macroinvertebrate assemblages was established, whereby a unimodal response pattern was observed for the Lanmucuo River. This contrast with monotonically positive or negative relationships observed for individual indicator taxa further supported our hypothesis that the response pattern of entire macroinvertebrate assemblages to flow would differ from responses of individual indicator taxa. The MM‐HSM provides a novel framework to quantify flow‐biota relationships, which is a useful approach for integrated river management.  aPublisher supplied data  a91547204cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a51779120cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aU2243222cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2019QZKK0903cSecond Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program  a2019‐KY‐01cState Key Laboratory of Hydroscience and Engineering Project  aTISD201913cTsinghua University‐Inditex Sustainable Development Fund Project 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3ahabitats 3ahydrodynamics 3aindicator species 3amacroinvertebrates 3amodels 3aresearch 3arivers 3astream flow 3awater 3aChina1 aXu, M.

These proteins are identified by their characteristic four and a half cysteinerich LIM homeodomain. Five members have been categorized into the FHL subfamily, which are FHL1, FHL2, FHL3, FHL4 and activator of CREM in testis (ACT) in human. FHL2 is amongst the most examined members within the family. Fhl2, the gene that code for the protein, is transcriptionally regulated by diverse types of transcription factors, for example, p53, serum response factor (SRF), and specificity protein 1 (Sp1). The expression of FHL2 is found in different tissues and organs and has been reported as a critical participant influencing the wide types of cancer such as breast cancer, gastrointestinal (GI) cancers, liver cancer and prostate cancer. The expression profile of FHL2 appeared to have a significant functional role in the carcinogenesis of these cancers which are mediated by different types of transcription factor including both tumor suppressors and inducers. In this review, we will first describe the molecular network governing FHL2 expression, which focus on the transcription factors conveying FHL2-initiated responses. In the second part, FHL2-linked cancers and the underlying molecular machinery will be discussed. Factors other than transcriptional regulation which may involve the cancer progression such as mutations of fhl2 and posttranslational modifications of the protein will also be mentioned.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ablood serum 3abreast neoplasms 3acarcinogenesis 3adisease course 3agastrointestinal system 3agenes 3ahumans 3aliver neoplasms 3amutation 3apost-translational modification 3aprostatic neoplasms 3atestes 3atissues 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 0aFour-and-a-half Lim (FHL2) 0aTranscriptional regulation 0aNucleus translocation 0ap53 0aSerum response factor (SRF) 0aSpecificity protein 1 (SP1) 0aBreast cancer 0aGastrointestinal cancer (GI cancer) 0aLiver cancer 0aHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 0aProstate cancer 0aBioinformatics1 aMok, Simon Wing-Fai1 aCheng, Vincent Wing-Sang1 aTsui, Stephen Kwok-Wing0 tGene.g2015 Nov. 01, v. 572 p.1-7dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2015.07.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01916naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245007700162300001600239520093800255592002801193650002201221650001001243650001301253650002201266650001701288651002801305651001101333700003401344773013801378856007701516852000901593655001201602IND60523988520221120061418.0160701e20100630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052398852DNAL7 a10.5586/asbp.2010.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGalera, Halina10aCentral European botanic gardens as centres of dispersal of alien plants  ap. 147-156.  aThe aim of the work was to estimate the specific role that Central European botanic gardens play in the dispersal of alien plants, which results from the wide variety of plants cultivated in the gardens and regular international exchange of plant material between these institutions. We compared the results of recent field studies (in eight Polish botanic gardens) and a review of older literature data and herbarium collections (from Central European botanic gardens). We found that in Poland the proportion of botanic garden escapes was lower (3%) than would be expected from the "tens rule". Botanic gardens have played a considerable role in the development of the synanthropic flora of Central Europe in the last 200 years. We determined a group of species introduced through a network of botanic gardens and propose 5 theoretical patterns to describe the mode and pathways of the early stages of introduction of these species.  aPublisher supplied data 3abotanical gardens 3aflora 3aherbaria 3aintroduced plants 3asynanthropes 3aCentral European region 3aPoland1 aSudnik-Wójcikowska, Barbara,0 tActa Societatis Botanicorum Poloniae.g2010 June 30, v. 79, no. 2 p.147-156dPolish Botanical SocietywJournal:12967x0001-69777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5586/asbp.2010.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03473naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245011100171300001400282520180100296592002802097650002502125650002502150650003702175650002502212650002802237650002602265650001702291650001002308650001502318650002102333650001602354650001902370650004402389650001302433650002902446650001702475650001002492650002202502651001002524653002502534653001502559653001002574653002802584653002402612700001702636700001502653700001402668700001402682700001802696773009602714856008802810852000902898655001202907IND60590669920221117234651.0190318e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059066992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2018.01.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Guowei10aSpecialized metabolites from Ageratina adenophora and their inhibitory activities against pathogenic fungi  ap. 57-62.  aThe Asteraceae plant Ageratina adenophora (also called Eupatorium adenophorum) has became the most destructive invasive species in China, especially the southwestern region, and is gravely threatening the native biodiversity. Its high reproductive capacity is partly due to the developed root system. From the roots of A. adenophora, ten compounds including three previously undescribed benzofuran derivatives (7-hydroxy-dehydrotremetone, 7,10,11-trihydroxy dehydrotremetone, 10-oxo-7-hydroxy-nordehydrotremetone), a previously undescribed chromene derivative (5-β-glucosyl-7-demethoxy-encecalin) and a previously undescribed monoterpene glucoside (8-hydroxy-8-β-glucosyl-2-carene) were isolated and identified. The previously undescribed structures were established by spectroscopic studies including 1D and 2D-NMR and HR-MS analyses. Antifungal activity of six compounds against one strain of pathogenic fungus of A. adenophora, Alternaria alternata, and other four strains of agricultural pathogenic fungi, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, C. musae, Rhizoctonia solani and Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum were investigated. The most abundant compound we isolated from A. adenophora roots was 7-hydroxy-dehydrotremetone, which showed significant broad-spectral inhibitory activity against the growth of all tested fungal strains, with diameter of inhibitory zones ranging from 13.90 ± 1.05 mm to 17.28 ± 0.46 mm at 50 μg/disk (nystatin: 24.76 ± 1.19 mm to 36.64 ± 0.85 mm). Encecalin also showed weak inhibitory activity against F. oxysporum f. sp. niveum, while other compounds were not active. Our results suggested that 7-hydroxy-dehydrotremetone might function as a constitutive defense compound in the roots of A. adenophora against pathogenic fungi.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgeratina adenophora 3aAlternaria alternata 3aFusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum 3aGlomerella cingulata 3aThanatephorus cucumeris 3aantifungal properties 3abiodiversity 3afungi 3aglucosides 3ainvasive species 3ametabolites 3amonoterpenoids 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3anystatin 3areproductive performance 3aroot systems 3aroots 3aspectral analysis 3aChina 0aAgeratina adenophora 0aAsteraceae 0aRoots 0aSpecialized metabolites 0aAntifungal activity1 aLuo, Shihong1 aLi, Shifei1 aHua, Juan1 aLi, Weiqi1 aLi, Shenghong0 tPhytochemistry.g2018 Apr., v. 148 p.57-62dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44710x0031-94227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2018.01.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02445naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245013900209300001800348520146000366592002801826653001201854653001801866653002001884653001501904653001001919700002401929773011101953856008202064852000902146655001202155IND60532077320221117185253.0160726e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053207732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jece.2016.01.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMishra, Trilochan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9287-343912aA comparative study on enhanced arsenic(V) and arsenic(III) removal by iron oxide and manganese oxide pillared clays from ground water  ap. 1224-1230.  aStable iron and manganese oxide pillared clays were synthesized with high surface area and studied as adsorbents for the first time towards As(III) and As(V) so as to understand the role of both oxide pillars for both As(III) and As(V) adsorption. Both the pillared clay materials showed high surface area (>260m2/g) and thermal stability (up to 500°C). Equilibrium studies were carried out at different concentration using three different materials at pH of 6at 28°C. For both As(III) and As(V) adsorption the uptake capacity of pillared materials is found to be many fold in comparison to the starting clay. Manganese oxide pillared material shows better affinity towards As(III) due to in situ oxidation to As(V). Synergistic effect of high surface area and presence of active manganese oxide pillars helps in enhanced uptake of total arsenic including substantial amount of As(III). Studies on mixed arsenic solution with mixed adsorbent proved to be much better than the individual adsorbent particularly for the contaminated water with substantial amount of As(III). Arsenic uptake in presence of Fe(III) and Cl− shows negligible decrease in the efficiency. Both the pillared material performed much better when subjected to actual contaminated water continuously for ten times. No leaching of arsenic was observed which confirms the possibility of using these materials in actual field trial for enhanced arsenic removal for contaminated water.  aPublisher supplied data 0aArsenic 0aPillared clay 0aManganese oxide 0aIron oxide 0aWater1 aMahato, Dipak Kumar0 tJournal of Environmental Chemical Engineering.g2016 Mar., v. 4 p.1224-1230dElsevier Ltdx2213-34377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jece.2016.01.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02535naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245012100166300001400287520105800301592002801359650002501387650002501412650002501437650001401462650002301476650001901499650001501518650002601533650003001559650002401589650001301613650002201626650001501648651001101663700002901674700002301703700002501726700002701751700001601778700002501794700002401819773013601843856007701979852000902056655001202065IND60523988620221120061504.0160701e20121025xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052398862DNAL7 a10.5586/asbp.2012.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzczęśniak, Ewa,10aCurrent distribution of Pilularia globulifera L. in Poland – changes of geographical range and habitat preferences  ap. 37-46.  aPilularia globulifera is a subatlantic European fern threatened with extinction. In Poland, it reaches the eastern border of its continuous range. Up to the end of the 20th century, it was observed here in 21 stands; only 2 of them existed by the second half of the century, so the species was categorized as critically endangered. Five new locations have been found in western and northwestern Poland during the last 10 years. Abundant and permanent populations grow in 3 locations, while 2 stands were ephemeral. All the current stands are situated in anthropogenic habitats with spontaneous vegetation, in oligotrophic to eutrophic waters. One of the new localities is about 280 km distant from the eastern range of the limit known previously. Pilularia forms its own plant community Pilularietum globuliferae, enters plots of Ranunculo-Juncetum bulbosi and occurs in mesotrophic to eutrophic rushes of Eleocharis palustris, Phragmites australis, Typha angustifolia and Equisetum fluviatile. Specimens are vigorous and regularly produce sporocarps.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEleocharis palustris 3aEquisetum fluviatile 3aPhragmites australis 3aPilularia 3aTypha angustifolia 3aeutrophication 3aextinction 3aferns and fern allies 3ageographical distribution 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3aplant communities 3avegetation 3aPoland1 aRosadziński, Stanisław1 aSpałek, Krzysztof1 aSzymanowski, Mariusz1 aKreitschitz, Agnieszka1 aKruk, Jerzy1 aŚliwiński, Michał1 aKamiński, Ryszard,0 tActa Societatis Botanicorum Poloniae.g2012 Oct. 25, v. 82, no. 1 p.37-46dPolish Botanical SocietywJournal:12967x0001-69777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5586/asbp.2012.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02759naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100002100140245012100161300001800282500000900300520140200309592002801711650002301739650002201762650001901784650001001803650001001813650001101823650002401834650001401858650001001872650002001882650002801902650001101930650002201941650002501963650001301988700002202001700002202023773019402045852000902239856007702248655001202325IND4457495220221121044458.0191028e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445749522DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq2010.02212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilson, P.

Chlorothalonil is a common, broad-spectrum, foliar fungicide used for protecting plants from a variety of fungal diseases. This fungicide may also be acutely toxic to nontarget aquatic organisms due to its mode of action. This study evaluated the amount of chlorothalonil deposited on nontarget ground surfaces during normal sprayer applications at a commercial nursery using Teflon targets. One day following application, irrigation runoff events were initiated and runoff water samples were collected and analyzed for chlorothalonil. Discharge volumes were also measured to allow estimation of the total mass of chlorothalonil discharged during each event. Results indicated that 9.8 to 53.6% of the active ingredient applied landed on nontarget ground surfaces depending on plant size, spacing, and row lengths (short rows sprayed from one side vs. longer rows sprayed from both ends). On an entire production-area scale, 29.2% of the active ingredient applied was deposited on ground surfaces. Of the total nontarget deposition, 0.25 to 0.53% was detected in runoff water discharged from the production area. Concentrations ranged from 1.2 to 500 μg/L during the first runoff events following application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive ingredients 3aaquatic organisms 3achlorothalonil 3acrops 3afungi 3aleaves 3amechanism of action 3apathogens 3apests 3aplant nurseries 3apolytetrafluoroethylene 3arunoff 3arunoff irrigation 3aspatial distribution 3atoxicity1 aRiiska, Catherine1 aAlbano, Joseph P.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2010 Nov., v. 39, no. 6 p.2130-2137dAmerican Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, Soil Science SocietywJournal:jnl1642x1537-25377nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2010.02213Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02765naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006100146245010800207300001600315500001900331520111100350536012201461592002801583650002101611650001301632650001001645650001701655650001901672650001401691650002101705650001301726650002001739653002201759653003701781653000901818653001101827653001401838653002001852653001001872700002001882700002101902700006801923700002401991700001902015700002002034773011602054856008002170852000902250655001202259IND60709233920221119175031.0200904e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070923392DNAL7 a10.1177/03009858209341112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavis, Katelin L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3295-984110aDiagnosis of Collagen Type III Glomerulopathy Using Picrosirius Red and PASH/Masson’s Trichrome Stain  ap. 675-680.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCanine collagen type III glomerulopathy (Col3GP) is a rare juvenile nephropathy in which irregular type III collagen fibrils and fibronectin accumulate in glomerular capillary walls and the mesangium. Necropsy findings were reviewed from 5 puppies diagnosed with Col3GP at 6 to 18 weeks of age. Histologically, with hematoxylin and eosin stain, the glomerular capillary walls and mesangium were diffusely and globally expanded by homogeneous pale eosinophilic material. Ultrastructurally, the subendothelial zone and mesangium were expanded by fibronectin and cross-banded collagen type III fibrils, diagnostic of Col3GP. Two additional stains were employed to identify the material within glomeruli as fibrillar collagen using light microscopy. In all 5 cases, the material was red with picrosirius red and birefringent under polarized light, and was blue with periodic acid-Schiff/hematoxylin/trichrome (PASH/TRI), thereby identifying it as fibrillar collagen. Based on these unique staining characteristics with picrosirius red and PASH/TRI, Col3GP may be reliably diagnosed with light microscopy alone.  aFunding The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal pathology 3acollagen 3aeosin 3afibronectins 3aglomerulopathy 3ajuveniles 3alight microscopy 3anecropsy 3apolarized light 0acollagen type III 0acollagenofibrotic glomerulopathy 0adogs 0akidney 0atrichrome 0apicrosirius red 0arenal1 aBurnum, Anne L.1 aBeck, Jessica A.1 aKirejczyk, Shannon G.

The advantages of the Asymptotic Perturbed-based Extremum Seeking Control scheme in comparison with other Extremum Seeking Control proposals are evaluated as (1) cost and complexity of implementation, and (2) performance obtained based on four indicators: the searching resolution, tracking accuracy, tracking efficiency, and tracking speed. Four solutions are implemented in MATLAB/Simulink software® to evaluate the most efficient method to obtain the asymptotic dither based on the first harmonic of the output signal from controlled process, the Photovoltaic Array under Partially Shaded Conditions. The chosen variant from the four schemes was further analyzed as performance, robustness to Partially Shaded Conditions, fast changes of the irradiation, and environmental noise. Different patterns for the irradiance profile were used to test this control scheme in tracking of the Global Maximum Power Point generated by different Photovoltaic arrays. Two normalization gains are used to adapt the proposed control scheme to different Photovoltaic arrays. The other two gains (the dither’s gain and the loop’s gain) are designed for best performance in sweeping and tracking of Global Maximum Power Point. The performance obtained is similar or superior to the other algorithms used for tracking the Global Maximum Power Point.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3airradiation 3alight intensity 0aACS 0aANN 0aaPESC 0aaPESCs 0aaPESCH1 0aaPESCLy 0aBPF 0aDE 0aEA 0aESC 0aFFT 0aFLC 0aGA 0aGd 0aGMPP 0aGMPPT 0aGaPESC 0aGaPESCbpf 0aGaPESCd 0aGaPESCH1 0aHC 0aHPF 0aH1 0aIC 0aLMPP 0aLPF 0aMPP 0aMPPT 0aMV 0aPHC 0aPESC 0aPESCs 0aP&O 0aPSC 0aPSO 0aPV 0aRCC 0aExtremum Seeking Control (ESC) 0aPhotovoltaic (PV) 0aPartially Shaded Conditions (PSCs) 0aGlobal Maximum Power Point Tracking (GMPPT)0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2016 Feb. 01, v. 109 p.71-85dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2015.11.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03424naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245009700166300001400263520178600277592002802063650003002091650002202121650002302143650001702166650001402183650002502197650001702222650002302239650002202262650001302284650002302297650001502320650001302335650002002348650002202368650000902390650002502399650002502424650002302449651001902472653001902491653001602510653003202526653002202558700002302580700002502603700002302628700001702651773010802668856008502776852000902861655001202870IND60582620320221123031000.0180904e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058262032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsci.2015.10.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoyle, Cait12aA Functional Land Management conceptual framework under soil drainage and land use scenarios  ap. 39-48.  aAgricultural soils offer multiple soil functions, which contribute to a range of ecosystem services, and the demand for the primary production function is expected to increase with a growing world population. Other key functions on agricultural land have been identified as water purification, carbon sequestration, habitat biodiversity and nutrient cycling, which all need to be considered for sustainable intensification. All soils perform all functions simultaneously, but the variation in the capacity of soils to supply these functions is reviewed in terms of defined land use types (arable, bio-energy, broadleaf forest, coniferous forest, managed grassland, other grassland and Natura 2000) and extended to include the influence of soil drainage characteristics (well, moderately/imperfect, poor and peat). This latter consideration is particularly important in the European Atlantic pedo-climatic zone; the spatial scale of this review. This review develops a conceptual framework on the multi-functional capacity of soils, termed Functional Land Management, to facilitate the effective design and assessment of agri-environmental policies. A final functional soil matrix is presented as an approach to show the consequential changes to the capacity of the five soil functions associated with land use change on soils with contrasting drainage characteristics. Where policy prioritises the enhancement of particular functions, the matrix indicates the potential trade-offs for individual functions or the overall impact on the multi-functional capacity of soil. The conceptual framework is also applied by land use area in a case study, using the Republic of Ireland as an example, to show how the principle of multi-functional land use planning can be readily implemented.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagri-environmental policy 3aagricultural land 3aagricultural soils 3abiodiversity 3abioenergy 3acarbon sequestration 3acase studies 3aconiferous forests 3adeciduous forests 3adrainage 3aecosystem services 3agrasslands 3ahabitats 3aland use change 3aland use planning 3apeat 3aprimary productivity 3aproduction functions 3awater purification 3aIrish Republic 0aSoil functions 0aAgriculture 0aSustainable intensification 0aEcosystem service1 aCreamer, Rachel E.1 aSchulte, Rogier P.O.1 aO'Sullivan, Lilian1 aJordan, Phil0 tEnvironmental science & policy.g2016 Feb., v. 56 p.39-48dElsevier LtdwJournal:12413x1462-90117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2015.10.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02803naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245009600163520150700259592002801766650002201794650001401816650002301830650001301853650001101866650002101877650002501898650001801923650002101941650001901962650001701981650002501998651001202023700002602035700001902061700001902080700002602099700001902125700002002144773011902164856007702283852000902360655001202369IND60754272120221121224402.0211023e20211002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075427212DNAL7 a10.3390/land101010352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHorvatić, Vito 10aEvaluation of Land Potential for Use of Biosolids in the Coastal Mediterranean Karst Region  aThe aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of agricultural land in the coastal Adriatic Karst region (Šibenik region, Croatia) for biosolids application by integrating spatial data from different sources: digital maps and remote sensing, parcel identification system, GIS field observations and measurements focusing on specific land and soil properties. Due to the rapid development of the wastewater treatment industry, excessive accumulation of sewage sludge (SS) in wastewater treatment plants is a growing problem worldwide. Management options for land application of biosolids require a comprehensive characterization of both SS and SS-amended soils. The assessment of agricultural land in the study area for SS disposal was based on EU and national legislation. The evaluation revealed that agricultural land in the study area accounts for only 10% of the total area (25,736 ha), but only a quarter of the existing land (6065 ha) is suitable for biosolids application. Furthermore, the data indicate that the sewage sludge can be safely applied to the soil in terms of soil metals according to the Croatian legislation. The short-term potential of the soil to sustain this ecosystem service, namely soil improvement with biosolids, should be used to determine the inherent long-term potential based on resistance to soil degradation and resilience. However, caution is needed and the long-term effects should be investigated before biosolids are continuously used for soil application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3abiosolids 3aecosystem services 3aindustry 3akarsts 3aland application 3alaws and regulations 3asewage sludge 3asoil degradation 3asoil treatment 3aspatial data 3awastewater treatment 3aCroatia1 aBegić, Helena Bakić1 aRomić, Davor 1 aČerne, Marko 1 aGoreta Ban, Smiljana 1 aZovko, Monika 1 aRomić, Marija 0 tLand.g2021 Oct. 02, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land101010353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03095naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245013800172506010400310506007600414520163800490592002802128506003702156650002302193650001302216650002502229650001202254653002502266653001202291653001502303653002002318653001902338653001302357700006202370700005602432700002002488773009402508856008602602852000902688655001202697IND60794693320221207103024.0221004e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079469332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e107352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalameh, Anas A.10aModelling the significance of website quality and online reviews to predict the intention and usage of online hotel booking platforms  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aInnovative technologies are paving the way for the online purchase of products and services. The COVID-19 also harness online shopping and hotel booking in the post-COVID-19 era. Online hotel booking is becoming the norm among young consumers. The six determinants of the intention to use online hotel booking platforms (OHBPs) are information quality, integrity, perceived risks, perceived benefits, system quality, and service quality was utilized in the study. Cross-sectional data were collected through the online survey, and 884 valid responses were utilised for the data analysis. The analysis results showed that the perceived benefits, system quality, and service quality significantly predicted the intention to use the OHBPs. Meanwhile, the usefulness and quantity of online reviews and the intention to use OHBPs have a positive and significant effect on the usage of the OHBPs. The study results confirmed the insignificant moderating role of the usefulness and quantity of online hotel booking reviews in the relationship between the intention to use and the usage of OHBPs. The intention to use OHBPs had low predictive power, while the usage of OHBPs had high predictive power. This study’s findings have offered valuable theoretical and managerial contributions. The management of OHBPs needs to concentrate on information quality and integrity to help manage the associated risks of online hotel booking. Previous customers' reviews are vital to encourage the usage of OHBPs. Finally, social media usage and promoting the OHBPs by sharing satisfied users' experiences improve the intention and usage of the OHBPs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aInternet 3ahospitality industry 3asurveys 0aOnline hotel booking 0aReviews 0aUsefulness 0aService quality 0aSystem quality 0aMalaysia1 aAl Mamun, Abdullah1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9713-742X1 aHayat, Naeem1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0756-52261 aAli, Mohd Helmi0 tHeliyon.g2022 Sept., v. 8, no. 9 p.e10735-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e107353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03460naa a2200781 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245011900162300001600281520148600297592002801783650001801811650001301829650001001842650001001852650001301862650001101875650002001886650000901906650001201915650002401927650001301951650002101964650004301985650001802028650002402046650001602070650002102086650001202107653000802119653000702127653000702134653000702141653000702148653000802155653000702163653000902170653000802179653000802187653000702195653000702202653000702209653000902216653000802225653000802233653000802241653002302249653002202272653002802294653002402322653002502346700001702371700001502388700001502403700001302418700001802431700001802449700001802467700001602485773007402501856008202575852000902657655001202666IND60552505620221118012757.0161021e20151201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055250562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2015.07.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Huili10aEctopic cross-talk between thyroid and retinoic acid signaling: A possible etiology for spinal neural tube defects  ap. 254-260.  aPrevious studies have highlighted the connections between neural tube defects (NTDs) and both thyroid hormones (TH) and vitamin A. However, whether the two hormonal signaling pathways interact in NTDs has remained unclear. We measured the expression levels of TH signaling genes in human fetuses with spinal NTDs associated with maternal hyperthyroidism as well as levels of retinoic acid (RA) signaling genes in mouse fetuses exposed to an overdose of RA using NanoString or real-time PCR on spinal cord tissues. Interactions between the two signaling pathways were detected by ChIP assays. The data revealed attenuated DIO2/DIO3 switching in fetuses with NTDs born to hyperthyroid mothers. The promoters of the RA signaling genes CRABP1 and RARB were ectopically occupied by increased RXRG and RXRB but displayed decreased levels of inhibitory histone modifications, suggesting that elevated TH signaling abnormally stimulates RA signaling genes. Conversely, in the mouse model, the observed decrease in Dio3 expression could be explained by increased levels of inhibitory histone modifications in the Dio3 promoter region, suggesting that overactive RA signaling may ectopically derepress TH signaling. This study thus raises in vivo a possible abnormal cross-promotion between two different hormonal signals through their common RXRs and the subsequent recruitment of histone modifications, prompting further investigation into their involvement in the etiology of spinal NTDs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aetiology 3afetus 3agenes 3ahistones 3ahumans 3ahyperthyroidism 3amice 3amothers 3aneural tube defects 3aoverdose 3apromoter regions 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aretinoic acid 3asignal transduction 3aspinal cord 3athyroid hormones 3atissues 0aNTD 0aTH 0aRA 0aT3 0aT2 0arT3 0aTR 0aRXRs 0aRAR 0aHRE 0aER 0aDR 0aIR 0aChIP 0afT3 0afT4 0aSHH 0aNeural tube defect 0aThyroid signaling 0aRetinoic acid signaling 0aRetinoid X receptor 0aHistone modification1 aBai, Baoling1 aZhang, Qin1 aBao, Yihua1 aGuo, Jin1 aChen, Shuyuan1 aMiao, Chunyue1 aLiu, Xiaozhen1 aZhang, Ting0 tGene.g2015 Dec. 01, v. 573 p.254-260dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2015.07.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02253naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245011300174300001600287520068700303592002800990650001401018650002001032650002301052650001701075650001001092650002901102650001901131650001401150650004401164650002201208651001101230653002501241653001801266653001701284653001601301653001401317653002901331653001901360653002601379700002001405700002401425700002001449700002301469700002501492700002301517773009801540856008801638852000901726655001201735IND60590670220221121215437.0190318e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059067022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2018.01.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrstić, Gordana10aJatrophane diterpenoids with multidrug-resistance modulating activity from the latex of Euphorbia nicaeensis  ap. 104-112.  aSeven previously undescribed jatrophane diterpenoids, nicaeenin A–G, with eight known jatrophane diterpenoids, namely euphodendrophanes A–C, F, N, O, Q, S, were isolated from latex of Euphorbia nicaeensis collected in Serbia.

The administration of vaccine formulations intranasally has the advantage over parenteral routes that can induce a specific response at mucosal and systemic levels. This study aimed to evaluate and compare the immunogenicity and prophylactic effectiveness of two Trans-sialidase (TS)-based mucosal vaccines against T. cruzi administered intranasally. Vaccines consisted of a recombinant fragment of TS expressed in Lactococcus lactis formulated in two different adjuvants. The first, was an immunostimulant particle (ISPA, an ISCOMATRIX-like adjuvant), while the second was the dinucleotide c-di-AMP, which have shown immunostimulant properties at the mucosal level. BALB/c mice were immunized intranasally (3 doses, one every two weeks) with each formulation (TS + ISPA or TS + c-di-AMP) and with TS alone or vehicle (saline solution) as controls. Fifteen days after the last immunization, both TS + ISPA or TS + c-di-AMP induced an evident systemic humoral and cellular response, as judged by the increased plasma anti-TS IgG2a titers and IgG2a/IgG1 ratio and enhanced cellular response against TS. Plasma derived antibodies from TS + c-di-AMP also inhibit in vitro the invasion capacity of T. cruzi. Furthermore, specific secretory IgA was more enhanced in TS + c-di-AMP group. Protective efficacy was proved in vaccinated animals by an oral T. cruzi-challenge. Parasitemia control was only achieved by animals vaccinated with TS + c-di-AMP, despite all vaccinates groups showed enhanced CD8⁺IFN-γ⁺ T cell numbers. In addition, it was reflected during the acute phase in a significant reduction of tissue parasite load, clinical manifestations and diminished tissue damage. The better prophylactic capacity elicited by TS + c-di-AMP was related to the induction of neutralizing plasma antibodies and augmented levels of mucosal IgA since TS + ISPA and TS + c-di-AMP groups displayed similar immunogenicity and CD8⁺IFN-γ⁺ T-cell response. Therefore, TS + c-di-AMP formulation appears as a promising strategy for prophylaxis against T. cruzi.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChagas disease 3aLactococcus lactis 3aT-lymphocytes 3aTrypanosoma cruzi 3aadjuvants 3aantigens 3adisease prevention 3aimmunization 3aimmunogenicity 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aimmunostimulants 3anose 3aparasite load 3aparasitemia 3asodium chloride 3avaccines 0aTrypanosoma cruzi 0aMucosal vaccine 0aTrans-sialidase 0aOral infection 0ac-di-AMP 0aISPA1 aGonzález, Florencia Belén1 aDinatale, Brenda1 aBulfoni Balbi, Camila1 aVillar, Silvina Raquel1 aFarré, Cecilia1 aLupi, Giuliana1 aEspariz, Martín1 aBlancato, Víctor Sebastián1 aMagni, Christian1 aMarcipar, Iván1 aPérez Ransanz, Ana Rosa,0 tVaccine.g2022 Apr. 01, v. 40, no. 15 p.2311-2323dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2022.02.0713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01932naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245013200167300001600299520100300315592002801318650001501346650002401361650002501385650002201410650001401432650001001446650001101456773010601467856004801573852000901621655001201630IND50070382620221119115417.0131105e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007038262DNAL7 a10.1007/s12259-008-1011-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeredyuk, S.

A comparison of emission sources of the same kind in forest ecosystems of different taiga subzones allowed us to analyze changes in the structural arrangement of Elateridae complexes along the gradient of chemical pollution, to reveal adaptive mechanisms of Elateridae complexes to high industrially generated load, to observe general and specific zonal features of the reaction of click beetles to this kind of anthropogenic action. We succeeded in demonstrating that the latitudinal zoning is a base of the hierarchy of the factors that determine the structural divergence of the Elateridae communities. The hydrothermal regime of the middle taiga subzone under anthropogenic modification provides more favorable conditions for mesophile groups of pedobionts in comparison with the southern taiga.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElateridae 3acommunity structure 3aenvironmental impact 3aforest ecosystems 3apollution 3ataiga 3azoning0 tContemporary problems of ecology.g2008 Feb., v. 1, no. 1 p.104-110dSpringer-Verlagx1995-42557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12259-008-1011-3  aDNAL 7aarticle02724naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245011700167300001600284520144000300592002801740650000801768650002001776650001101796650001401807650001201821650000901833650002001842650002401862650001101886650001101897653000901908653003301917653001901950653003001969653003501999653002402034700001702058700001902075773010102094856008602195852000902281655001202290IND60562592820221116181951.0170208e20160201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056259282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2015.11.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Dong10aEvaluation of the thermal performance of an earth-to-air heat exchanger (EAHE) in a harmonic thermal environment  ap. 184-194.  aThe earth-to-air heat exchanger (EAHE) is a low-energy device used to improve the thermal condition of buildings, which is filled with the air directed from the outside and surrounded by the soil. The temperatures of both the air and soil are periodically fluctuating, leading to the EAHEs working in a harmonic thermal environment. However, most of the previous theoretical studies investigated the performance of EAHEs by ways of static and steady-state models, paying insufficient attention to the temperature phase shifting and fluctuation attenuation effects. The main purpose of this work is to develop an approach to predict the performance of EAHE subjected to harmonic thermal environments. The harmonic temperature signals transmitted from both the pipe inlet and the ground surface are incorporated in the model by means of the ‘excess fluctuating temperature’. The amplitude dampening and phase-shifting of the EAHE air temperature for both annually and daily fluctuating cycles are derived as explicit expressions. The analytical results are validated against numerical simulations. The model is applied in a hot-summer/cold-winter region. Results indicate that a deep-buried EAHE pipe can reduce the air temperature by 7°C on a summer day. The maximum cooling or heating capacities occur in spring/summer or autumn/winter transitional seasons. The use of an EAHE pipe can create a 3000-W cooling or heating capacity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair temperature 3aautumn 3abuildings 3acooling 3aheat 3aheat exchangers 3amathematical models 3aspring 3asummer 0aEAHE 0aHarmonic thermal environment 0aPhase shifting 0aCooling/heating potential 0aExcess fluctuating temperature 0aAnalytical solution1 aGuo, Yuanhao1 aZhang, Jinpeng0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2016 Feb. 01, v. 109 p.184-194dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2015.11.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03399naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005600142245012300198500002000321520173800341592002802079596005402107596004202161596006102203596001702264596003702281650001302318650001602331650002602347650001302373650001102386650002202397650002502419650001302444650002102457650001602478700006302494700006102557700005902618700006002677773013002737856007702867852000902944655001202953IND60778439820221122225447.0220527e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077843982DNAL7 a10.1029/2021WR0312892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHouben, Timo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8189-719210aFrom Dynamic Groundwater Level Measurements to Regional Aquifer Parameters— Assessing the Power of Spectral Analysis  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aLarge‐scale groundwater models are required to estimate groundwater availability and to inform water management strategies on the national scale. However, parameterization of large‐scale groundwater models covering areas of major river basins and more is challenging due to the lack of observational data and the mismatch between the scales of modeling and measurements. In this work, we propose to bridge the scale gap and derive regional hydraulic parameters by spectral analysis of groundwater level fluctuations. We hypothesize that specific locations in aquifers can reveal regional parameters of the hydraulic system. We first generate ensembles of synthetic but realistic aquifers which systematically differ in complexity. Applying Liang and Zhang’s (2013), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2012.11.044, semi‐analytical solution for the spectrum of hydraulic head time series, we identify for each ensemble member and at different locations representative aquifer parameters. Next, we extend our study to investigate the use of spectral analysis in more complex numerical models and in real settings. Our analyses indicate that the variance of inferred effective transmissivity and storativity values for stochastic aquifer ensembles is small for observation points which are far away from the Dirichlet boundary. Moreover, the head time series has to cover a period which is roughly 10 times as long as the characteristic time of the aquifer. In deterministic aquifer models we infer equivalent, regionally valid parameters. A sensitivity analysis further reveals that as long as the aquifer length and the position of the groundwater measurement location is roughly known, the parameters can be robustly estimated.  aPublisher supplied data  cHelmholtz Centre for Environmental Research (UFZ)  a02WGR1423A‐FcGlobal Resource Water  cGerman Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)  cIDAEA‐CSIC  a20S08708cBarcelona City Council 3aaquifers 3agroundwater 3aobservational studies 3aresearch 3arivers 3aspectral analysis 3atime series analysis 3avariance 3awater management 3awater table1 aPujades, Estanislao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2604-53761 aKalbacher, Thomas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7866-57021 aDietrich, Peter1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2699-23541 aAttinger, Sabine1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7798-70800 tWater resources research.g2022 May, v. 58, no. 5 p.e2021WR031289-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021WR0312893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02668naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006400151245014100215506011700356506007600473520104100549592002801590506003701618650001201655650003301667650002901700653002501729653003201754653003301786653003601819653002601855653002801881700006001909700006601969700005802035773009402093856008602187852000902273655001202282IND60794693620221207103022.0221004e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079469362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e107382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAcaru, Silviu Florin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6445-785X10aHydrothermal biomass processing for green energy transition: insights derived from principal component analysis of international patents  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAs efforts to achieve Net Zero are intensifying, there is a strong need to identify the technological positioning of green process innovations that can support the green energy transition. A veritable contender to support these efforts is the hydrothermal biomass processing technology. This process innovation comprises diverse techniques that can convert biomass substrates into valuable low-carbon fuels. Coordination across all available conversion approaches is encouraged to propel the application of those that consider the environmental and sustainability impacts. We assessed the innovation intensity for different techniques under this green process innovation through applying natural language processing and deployment of principal component analysis on patent data. We positioned our techniques within four distinctive groups (intense, dormant, emerging, and exploratory). In this way, we tracked which hydrothermal technique currently dominates international applications and which ones are gaining traction in the future.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiomass 3aprincipal component analysis 3arenewable energy sources 0aInnovation intensity 0aNatural language processing 0aPrincipal component analysis 0aHydrothermal biomass processing 0aPatent data analytics 0aGreen energy transition1 aAbdullah, Rosnah1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7962-67991 aLai, Daphne Teck Ching1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8290-89411 aLim, Ren Chong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2493-59490 tHeliyon.g2022 Sept., v. 8, no. 9 p.e10738-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e107383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03373naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005600146245008000202300001600282500001900298520143800317536012901755592002801884596003301912650001901945650002101964650002901985650001302014650001302027650002002040650001002060650001402070650001702084650001702101650000902118650002302127650001202150650002202162650001302184650001402197650001502211650002002226653001302246653001702259653002402276653003502300653001302335700001902348700001702367700002802384700002102412700002102433700001602454700001802470700002102488700002102509773011602530856008002646852000902726655001202735IND60709234320221121044649.0200904e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070923432DNAL7 a10.1177/03009858209392512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVogel, Peter1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7535-054510aProgressive Degenerative Myopathy and Myosteatosis in ASNSD1-Deficient Mice  ap. 723-735.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMice with an inactivating mutation in the gene encoding asparagine synthetase domain containing 1 (ASNSD1) develop a progressive degenerative myopathy that results in severe sarcopenia and myosteatosis. ASNSD1 is conserved across many species, and whole body gene expression surveys show maximal expression levels of ASNSD1 in skeletal muscle. However, potential functions of this protein have not been previously reported. Asnsd1⁻/⁻ mice demonstrated severe muscle weakness, and their normalized body fat percentage on both normal chow and high fat diets was greater than 2 SD above the mean for 3651 chow-fed and 2463 high-fat-diet–fed knockout (KO) lines tested. Histologic lesions were essentially limited to the muscle and were characterized by a progressive degenerative myopathy with extensive transdifferentiation and replacement of muscle by well-differentiated adipose tissue. There was minimal inflammation, fibrosis, and muscle regeneration associated with this myopathy. In addition, the absence of any signs of lipotoxicity in Asnsd1⁻/⁻ mice despite their extremely elevated body fat percentage and low muscle mass suggests a role for metabolic dysfunctions in the development of this phenotype. Asnsd1⁻/⁻ mice provide the first insight into the function of this protein, and this mouse model could prove useful in elucidating fundamental metabolic interactions between skeletal muscle and adipose tissue.  aFunding The authors received no external financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.  aPublisher supplied data  cLexicon Pharmaceuticals, Inc 3aadipose tissue 3aanimal pathology 3aaspartate-ammonia ligase 3abody fat 3afibrosis 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahistology 3ainflammation 3alipotoxicity 3amice 3amuscle development 3amuscles 3amuscular diseases 3amutation 3aphenotype 3asarcopenia 3askeletal muscle 0amyopathy 0amyosteatosis 0alipomatous myopathy 0amouse models of human diseases 0aknockout1 aDing, Zhi-Ming1 aRead, Robert1 aDaCosta, Christopher M.1 aHansard, Melissa1 aSmall, Daniel L.1 aYe, Gui-lan1 aHansen, Gwenn1 aBrommage, Robert1 aPowell, David R.0 tVeterinary pathology.g2020 Sept., v. 57, no. 5 p.723-735dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl13945x1544-22177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/03009858209392513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01704naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245006700166300001400233520068700247592002800934650002100962650002400983650001501007650002201022650001101044650001601055650001401071650001001085650001101095650001501106651001101121773013601132856007701268852000901345655001201354IND60523989220221123045245.0160701e20100331xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052398922DNAL7 a10.5586/asbp.2010.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTylkowski, Tadeusz10aDormancy breaking in Savin juniper (Juniperus sabina L.) seeds  ap. 27-29.  aSavin juniper (Juniperus sabina L.) is a relict shrub in Poland with only one natural stand in Pieniny Mts.

Microbial-mediated reduction plays a critical role in iron mineral transformation in natural environment. This study examined the transformation pathways of iron minerals mediated by bacteria and the changes of associated arsenic species in iron-rich mine tailings. Static and column reactions were designed to monitor variations of minerals and released iron and arsenic, a reactive transport model was simulated to support laboratory results. Laboratory experiments showed that major ferric minerals were preferentially dissolved and reduced by dissimilatory iron-reducing bacteria. The released Fe³⁺ in fluid promoted oxidative dissolution of pyrite and arsenopyrite, and precipitation of oxides and carbonates. The arsenic released to fluid was inferred to be immobilized by both pristine ferrihydrite and newly formed hydrous ferric oxides via surface complexation. The reaction system maintained a steady-state of iron mineral transformation and arsenic (im)mobilization. In the latter stage of column reactor experiments, continuous reaction and removal of dissolved Fe³⁺ and Fe²⁺ destabilized the state, leading to arsenic re-location and eventually rising concentration in fluid. The findings implicate that microbial-mediated iron mineral evolution remarkably influence the natural mineral assemblages and the fate of contaminant transport in the environment, and that deposition of iron oxides is essential in environmental protection and pollution recovery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic 3abacteria 3acarbonates 3aenvironmental protection 3aferric oxide 3aferrihydrite 3aheavy metals 3airon 3alaboratory experimentation 3amine tailings 3amineral content 3amodels 3apollution 3apyrite 3asediments 0aMicrobial reduction 0aIron oxides 0aColumn reactor 0aReactive transport 0aArsenic 0aMine tailings1 aLu, Xiancai1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8977-26611 aLi, Juan1 aLiu, Huan0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 June 20, v. 670 p.1008-1018dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.03.2853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02831naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100001600140245014500156300001800301500000900319520135700328592002801685650002401713650002601737650001601763650003401779650001501813650001901828650001601847650001801863650001501881650001301896650001501909650002001924650001401944650001201958650001601970651001301986700002001999700002502019700001602044700002102060773019402081852000902275856007702284655001202361IND4457498320221121032714.0191028e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445749832DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq2010.01142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKruse, Jens10aPhosphorus Speciation in Sequentially Extracted Agro-Industrial By-Products: Evidence from X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure Spectroscopy  ap. 2179-2184.  aepub  aThe phosphorus (P) in agro-industrial by-products—a potential source of freshwater eutrophication but also a valuable fertilizer—needs to be speciated to evaluate its fate in the environment. We investigated to what extent X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy at the P K- and L ₂,₃-edges reflected differences in sequentially extracted filter cakes from sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) (FIC) and niger seed (Guizotia abyssinica Cass.; NIC) processing industry in Ethiopia. The P fractionation removed more labile (54%) and H₂SO₄–P (28%) from FIC than from NIC (18% labile, 12% H₂SO₄–P). For the FIC residues after each extraction step, linear combination (LC) fitting of P K-edge spectra provided evidence for the enrichment of Ca-P after the NaOH-extraction and its almost complete removal after the H₂SO₄–treatment. The LC-fitting was unsuccessful for the NIC samples, likely because of the predominance of organic P compounds. The different proportions of Ca-P compounds between FIC (large) and NIC (small) were more distinctive in L ₂,₃- than in the K-edge XANES spectra. In conclusion, the added value of complementary P K- and L ₂,₃-edge XANES was clearly demonstrated, and the P fractionation and speciation results together justify using FIC and NIC as soil amendments in the tropics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGuizotia abyssinica 3aSaccharum officinarum 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3aabsorption 3aeutrophication 3afilter cake 3afractionation 3afreshwater 3aindustry 3aphosphorus 3asoil amendments 3asugarcane 3atropics 3avalue added 3aEthiopia1 aNegassa, Wakene1 aAppathurai, Narayana1 aZuin, Lucia1 aLeinweber, Peter0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2010 Nov., v. 39, no. 6 p.2179-2184dAmerican Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, Soil Science SocietywJournal:jnl1642x1537-25377nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2010.01143Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02314naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245007700158300002000235520118300255592002801438650002701466650003001493650002201523650001001545650001601555650001101571650001301582650002901595650001501624650001501639700001701654700001701671700001801688700001501706773012401721856007401845852000901919655001201928IND60640313220221120231258.0190504e20160209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064031322DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra27553a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRyu, Ka Young10aColorimetric chemosensor for multiple targets, Cu²⁺, CN⁻ and S²⁻  ap. 16586-16597.  aA simple and easily synthesized colorimetric chemosensor 1, (E)-2-(((2-((2,4-dinitrophenyl)amino)phenyl)imino)methyl)phenol, was designed and synthesized for the detection of Cu²⁺, CN⁻ and S²⁻. Receptor 1 showed a highly selective colorimetric response to copper(ii) ions by changing its color from pale yellow to orange immediately without any interference from other metal ions. Also, the sensitivity of UV-vis based assay (8.77 μM) for Cu²⁺ is below the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for drinking water (31.5 μM). In addition, chemosensor 1 could be used to quantify Cu²⁺ in water samples and the sensing mechanism of the 1–Cu²⁺ complex was explained by theoretical calculations. The 1–Cu²⁺ complex could be reversible simply through treatment with an appropriate reagent such as EDTA. Moreover, with the “naked eye” 1 could sense cyanide and sulfide by color changes from pale yellow to pale pink and deep pink, respectively, in aqueous solution. Furthermore, sensor 1 can detect both CN⁻ (0.28 μM) and S²⁻ (10.7 μM) below the given guidelines (WHO: 1.9 μM for CN⁻ and Environmental Protection Agency: 7.8 mM for S²⁻).  aPublisher supplied data 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aWorld Health Organization 3aaqueous solutions 3acolor 3acolorimetry 3acopper 3acyanides 3aenvironmental protection 3aguidelines 3ametal ions1 aLee, Jae Jun1 aKim, Jin-Ah,1 aPark, Dae Yul1 aKim, Cheal0 tRSC advances.g2016 Feb. 09, v. 6, no. 20 p.16586-16597dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra27553a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03297naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245025000171300001600421520169800437592002802135650000802163650001702171650002602188650001102214650001502225650002702240650001502267650001502282650003502297650003502332650003402367650003702401650001402438650001502452650003102467653002502498653001902523653001002542653001502552653002602567700001802593773011902611856008802730852000902818655001202827IND60635070120221117160948.0200110e20190620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063507012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.03.2862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Hee Seok10aProximity to chemical equilibria among air, water, soil, and sediment as varied with partition coefficients: A case study of polychlorinated dibenzodioxins/furans, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, phthalates, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.  ap. 760-769.  aTo capture the pollutant distribution status among environmental media and to understand how the distribution varies with the pollutants' properties, we assessed a total of 225 fugacity ratios (FRs) of 45 semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) (polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/furans (PCDDs/Fs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), phthalates, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)) for five medium pairs (air-water, air-soil, water-sediment, soil-water, and soil-sediment) using the nationwide multimedia monitoring data. For many of the pollutants, fugacity was greatest in air (PCDFs and 6 heavy PAHs) and in sediment (PBDEs and 9 light PAHs) while lowest in soil for most of the pollutants. PAHs and phthalates appeared to be farther away from equilibrium than PCDDs/Fs and PBDEs. The ratios of “equilibrium improbable” FRs to all the FRs in each chemical group were 2%, 0%, 33.3%, and 28.9% for PCDDs/Fs, PBDEs, phthalates, and PAHs, respectively. FRwₐₜₑᵣ/ₐᵢᵣ of PAHs, FRₛₒᵢₗ/ₐᵢᵣ, and FRₛₑdᵢₘₑₙₜ/wₐₜₑᵣ of the pollutant groups (except for PBDEs) decreased significantly (p < 0.01) with the partition coefficients, 1/Kₐᵢᵣ/wₐₜₑᵣ (1/Kₐw), Kₒcₜₐₙₒₗ/ₐᵢᵣ (Kₒₐ), and Kₒcₜₐₙₒₗ/wₐₜₑᵣ (Kₒw), respectively, even in the field conditions. The findings on FRs values provide valuable clues to identifying the media that would act as sink or source for certain chemicals and to using a more appropriate choice in the coherence test of environmental quality objectives, which should be important considerations in the management of chemical contamination in the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acase studies 3aenvironmental quality 3afurans 3amonitoring 3apartition coefficients 3aphthalates 3apollutants 3apolybrominated diphenyl ethers 3apolychlorinated dibenzodioxins 3apolychlorinated dibenzofurans 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3asediments 3asoil water 3avolatile organic compounds 0aChemical equilibrium 0aFugacity ratio 0aSVOCs 0aMultimedia 0aPartition coefficient1 aLee, Dong Soo0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 June 20, v. 670 p.760-769dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.03.2863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01595naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245017700163300001400340520064100354592002800995650001101023650001701034651001201051651001101063700002101074773013601095856007701231852000901308655001201317IND60523989420221123045234.0160701e20100331xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052398942DNAL7 a10.5586/asbp.2010.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCelka, Zbigniew10aSpontaneous occurrence and dispersion of Aronia ×prunifolia (Marshall) Rehder (Rosaceae) in Poland on the example of the "Bagna" bog complex near Chlebowo (western Poland)  ap. 37-42.  aThis study presents information on a new to Poland synanthropic species - Aronia ×prunifolia (purple chokeberry).Purple chokeberry is cultivated worldwide as a fruit and decorative plant.

However, little is known about its biology, pathology, tropism, and host interactions. In this study, the presence and disease progression of EEDV were evaluated following exposure of naïve juvenile lake trout to EEDV via bath immersion under controlled laboratory conditions (n = 84 infected; n = 44 control). Individual tissues (n = 10 per fish), collected over 6 weeks, were analyzed for viral load by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, gross and histopathologic changes, and virus cellular targets using in situ hybridization. Skin, fin, and ocular tissues were the earliest viral targets and yielded the highest viral loads throughout the course of infection. Early gross lesions included exophthalmia, ocular hemorrhage, fin congestion, and hyperemia of visceral blood vessels. Advanced disease was characterized by multifocal to coalescing erosions and ulcerations of the skin, and congestion of visceral organs. Microscopically, there was cellular degeneration and necrosis in the epidermis and spleen, and lymphohistiocytic perivasculitis of the dermis, omentum, and the epicardium. EEDV DNA was first detected by in situ hybridization in epithelial cells of the epidermis, with subsequent labeling in the epithelial lining of primary and secondary gill lamellae. During advanced disease, EEDV was detected in endothelial and dendritic cells as well as blood monocytes.

Here, the bifunctional molecule 1-FP was assembled onto rGO sheets. Subsequently, a Tyr molecule was immobilized on the 1-FP forming a biocompatible nanocomposite, which was further coated onto the working electrode surface of the SPE. The performance of as-prepared biosensor was investigated by the detection of phenol in the presence of molecular oxygen. Wide linear range, low detection limit and high sensitivity were obtained with this biosensor due to the good conductivity of rGO as well as the high bioactivity of Tyr well retained by the 1-FP/rGO platform. Finally, the proposed biosensor was successfully employed for the detection of phenol in real water samples with satisfactory results. These findings suggest that this novel biosensor could offer great potential for rapid, cost-effective and on-field analysis of phenolic compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive properties 3abiosensors 3acost effectiveness 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aenzymes 3agraphene oxide 3ananocomposites 3aoxygen 3aphenol1 aQin, Qin1 aBai, Xue1 aHuang, Xin1 aZhang, Qi0 tRSC advances.g2016 Mar. 08, v. 6, no. 30 p.25427-25434dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra27563f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01361naa a2200217 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100002200146245007100168300001600239520060900255592002800864650002800892773012000920852000901040856008201049655001201131IND8005138920221122005037.0181030e197910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND800513892DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517579049010022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarrowfield, B.V.14aThe Systematic Cutting and Stretch-Breaking of Disoriented Slivers  ap. 565-575.  aModels are presented of the systematic cutting and stretch-breaking of slivers in which the fibers arc considered to be straight but angled to the sliver axis. The efliciency with which cutting and breaking will shorten the longer fibers in the sliver is discussed. Cutting becomes more competitive than breaking when the fibers are highly misaligned. By increasing the draft, the efficiency of the breaker is improved. The production of short fiber by each technique is considered, and a simple experiment shows that the relative effectiveness of stretch breaking increases substantially with alignment.  aPublisher supplied data 3anonfood animal products0 tTextile research journal.g1979 Oct., v. 49, no. 10 p.565-575dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0040517579049010023Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03115naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006000142245011400202500002000316520181400336592002802150596004702178596004702225650001102272650002102283650001102304650002102315650001302336650001502349650001102364650001002375650001602385650001502401651001702416651001102433700005702444773013002501856007702631852000902708655001202717IND60778440420221120024916.0220527e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077844042DNAL7 a10.1029/2021WR0305552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChaudhari, Suyog1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7801-647310aAlteration of River Flow and Flood Dynamics by Existing and Planned Hydropower Dams in the Amazon River Basin  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aHydropower dams have received increased global attention due to their detrimental socioenvironmental ramifications. Such attention has led to an increase in studies on the impacts of reservoir operation on river flow; however, a holistic understanding of the compounded effects of hydropower dams on different hydrological characteristics is lacking, especially for large river basins such as the Amazon where hydropower development is on the rise. Here, we mechanistically quantify the historical impacts of existing dams and the potential impacts of the collective operation of existing and planned dams on a basin‐wide scale in the Amazon for the 1981–2019 period. We build on the recently developed high‐resolution (3‐arcmin; ∼5 km) river‐floodplain‐reservoir model, the CaMa‐Flood‐Dam, which is enhanced to realistically simulate hydropower dam operation considering maximized power production. Flood simulations are further downscaled to 3 arc‐seconds (∼90 m) resolution to investigate the impacts of dams on fine‐scale flood dynamics across the basin. Results indicate that existing dams have substantially altered downstream river flow and flooding patterns across the Amazon River basin. Specifically, large dams in the Amazonian subbasins, including the Xingu, Madeira, and Tocantins, have altered downstream river flow amplitude by up to 3 orders of magnitude. Further, the collective operation of existing and planned dams could increasingly alter river flow patterns, causing ∼10% decrease in flood duration in many parts of the Amazon mainstem. Our results provide quantitative evidence on the severity of the hydrologic impacts of large hydropower dams and have important implications for sustainable hydropower operation and development in the Amazon and worldwide.  aPublisher supplied data  a1639115cNational Science Foundation (NSF)  a1752729cNational Science Foundation (NSF) 3abasins 3adams (hydrology) 3amodels 3apower generation 3aresearch 3ariver flow 3arivers 3awater 3awater power 3awatersheds 3aAmazon River 3aBrazil1 aPokhrel, Yadu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1367-216X0 tWater resources research.g2022 May, v. 58, no. 5 p.e2021WR030555-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021WR0305553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02820naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245013200171300001600303520169500319592002802014650001302042650001802055650001102073650001302084650001202097650001602109653002002125653001802145653000802163653001602171653001802187653002802205700001902233773010002252856008502352852000902437655001202446IND60609691320221120145952.0200809e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060969132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2017.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLudwig, Wojciech10aModeling of particle velocities in an apparatus with a draft tube operating in a fast circulating dilute spout-fluid bed regime  ap. 332-345.  aThe objective of this paper was to verify the applicability of the EE (Euler-Euler) model for the description of hydrodynamics of particle flow in an apparatus with circulating dilute spout-fluid bed, as well as to test the impact of the model parameters, such as interphase momentum coefficient, restitution coefficient and packing limit on the velocity results of the dispersed phase.It was found that the inter-phase momentum exchange coefficient has the greatest impact on the particle velocities in the specific hydrodynamic conditions in the tested apparatus (high velocity of particle circulation, very low volume fraction of the dispersed phase in all zones). It was established that the value of the restitution coefficient considerably affects the granular temperature and the remaining parameters that are relative to it. This, in turn, results in the variations in the determined particle velocities, which are discernible only in the zone of the draft tube. The packing limit affects the value of the radial distribution function, and the increase of its value leads to the increase of the particle velocities. For the optimum set of model parameters (packing limit 0.55, restitution coefficient 0.9, inter-phase momentum exchange model by Gidaspow), the mean calculation error regarding the particle velocities for all initial bed heights was equal to maximum 9% in the zone of the draft tube and 19% in the annulus. The research confirmed the applicability of the EE model for the description of the gas-solid flow in the spout-fluid system with an original design applied for dry coating. The developed model will serve for the future description of the dry coating process.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoatings 3ahydrodynamics 3amodels 3amomentum 3apowders 3atemperature 0aSpout-fluid bed 0aHydrodynamics 0aCFD 0aEuler-Euler 0aPacking limit 0aRestitution coefficient1 aZając, Daniel0 tPowder technology.g2017 Sept., v. 319 p.332-345dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2017.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02854naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245012700180300001800307520131300325592002801638650002801666650001401694650002201708650002101730650002101751650001601772650001101788650004101799650001001840650001401850650001801864650001001882651001301892653001701905653001601922653001401938653002601952700003101978700002902009700002302038700001802061700001802079700002002097773014902117856008502266852000902351655001202360IND60654104720190906000000.0190722e20190919xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065410472DNAL7 a10.1080/03650340.2019.15669542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZaheer, Muhammad Saqlain10aInvestigating the effect of Azospirillum brasilense and Rhizobium pisi on agronomic traits of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)  ap. 1554-1564.  aPlant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) play an important role in improving crop growth but have not been studied sufficiently. A wire house experiment was conducted in Pakistan to determine the combined effect of inoculating wheat seeds with PGPR on the subsequent growth and yield of the wheat. The experiment included four treatments: T₀ – no-inoculation (control), T₁ – Azospirillum brasilense inoculation, T₂ – Rhizobium pisi inoculation and T₃ – co-inoculation with A. brasilense and R. pisi. Development and growth attributes, as well as final yield of wheat, were studied. Co-inoculation of seeds with both strains increased significantly wheat grain yield, the number of grains per plant and 1000-grain weight by 36%, 11% and 17%, respectively, compared to non-inoculated control. While crop growth rate increased for, respectively, 5.5% and 33% at tillering and flag leaf stages, corresponding values for T₃ were about 9% and 14% higher than values for sole inoculations in T₁ and T₂. Co-inoculation also significantly increased leaf epicuticular wax and relative water content as compared to the control treatment. Thus, inoculation of wheat seeds with A. brasilense and R. pisi and their combination is a promising method to improve growth, yield and quality of wheat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAzospirillum brasilense 3aRhizobium 3aTriticum aestivum 3aagronomic traits 3aepicuticular wax 3agrain yield 3aleaves 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3aseeds 3atillering 3awater content 3awheat 3aPakistan 0aGrowth stage 0ainoculation 0aleaf area 0anet assimilation rate1 aRaza, Muhammad Aown Sammar1 aSaleem, Muhammad Farrukh1 aKhan, Imran Haider1 aAhmad, Salman1 aIqbal, Rashid1 aManevski, Kiril0 tArchiv für Acker- und Pflanzenbau und Bodenkunde.g2019 Sept. 19, v. 65, no. 11 p.1554-1564dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl4585x1476-35677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03650340.2019.15669543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03633naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245014600167300001600313520235000329592002802679650001502707650001302722650002302735650001202758650001302770650001002783650002002793650001302813650001402826650001902840650002402859650001102883650002502894650001102919650001102930650001202941650001002953651001102963773013902974856007703113852000903190655001203199IND60523986920221120082653.0160701e20100930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052398692DNAL7 a10.5586/asbp.2010.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPawlikowski, Pawel,10aBaeothryon alpinum (L.) T.V. Egorova (Cypercaeae) in the Polish Lowlands: distribution, population decrease and implications for conservation  ap. 215-223.  aA total of 47 localities of Baeothryon alpinum, hosting population of more than 100 000 shoots, were recorded in the lowland part of Poland during field surveys in the years 2003-2009. Among them were 25 populations discovered for the first time. Out of 57 sites of the species known from literature and unpublished (including herbarium) sources, 35 were not confirmed during the survey, 27 of them being definitely extinct. B. alpinum shows a clear pattern of distribution in Poland, with three main areas of occurrence: 1) the north-easternmost Poland (Lithuanian Lake District with the adjacent parts of the Masurian Lake District and the upper Biebrza river valley in North Podlasie Lowlands), which is part of the species boreal main range; 2) scattered localities in north-western Poland; 3) mountain mires at higher altitudes in the Sudetes and Tatra mountains and the adjacent part of southern Poland. The main aggregation of localities is found in Augustów Forest (including the Sejny Lakeland and Wigry National Park), and in the Góry Sudawskie region with adjacent areas. The biggest Polish population in the "Kobyla Biel" fen near Augustów consisted of several dozens of thousands of shoots. The Lithuanian Lake District is an area of general importance for the conservation of B. alpinum in Poland. The species is threatened, first of all, due to secondary succession (mires overgrowing with shrubs, trees and reed) and requires conservation measures as well as establishing nature reserves in places where it occurs. The degree that B. alpinum decreases in number is strikingly different in particular regions of Poland - it has lost most of its localities in north-western Poland and in Masurian Lake District, while in the Lithuanian Lake District and the upper Biebrza valley there are minor losses only. Depending on the region (from the west to the east and from the south-west to the north-east), the species should be given extinct or critically endangered (regions of north-western and southern Poland), endangered (Masurian Lake District), vulnerable (North Podlasie Lowlands) and near threatened (Lithuanian lake District) status. Although the disappearance of the populations beyond the species main range is a common phenomenon, the presented pattern is man-related and connected with differences in land management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEleocharis 3aaltitude 3aconservation areas 3aforests 3aherbaria 3alakes 3aland management 3alowlands 3amountains 3anational parks 3apopulation dynamics 3arivers 3asecondary succession 3ashoots 3ashrubs 3asurveys 3atrees 3aPoland0 tActa Societatis Botanicorum Poloniae.g2010 Sept. 30, v. 79, no. 3 p.215-223dPolish Botanical SocietywJournal:12967x0001-69777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5586/asbp.2010.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02827naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245012400158300002000282520131400302592002801616650002201644650003701666650001401703650002301717650001101740650001701751650002201768650001601790650001301806650001401819650001701833650001401850650003301864650001101897650001101908650002001919650001901939650002001958650001601978650001201994650003702006650001602043650003702059700001802096773012402114856007402238852000902312655001202321IND60640310320221121001729.0190504e20160303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064031032DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra27488e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Liang-Yi10aSalt-induced formation of hollow and mesoporous CoOₓ/SiO₂ spheres and their catalytic behavior in toluene oxidation  ap. 24304-24313.  aHollow and mesoporous CoOₓ/SiO₂ spheres (denoted as CoOₓ/hSiO₂ and CoOₓ/mSiO₂) were synthesized via salt-assisted ultrasonic spray pyrolysis. Precursor solutions containing sodium silicate solution, a mineral acid (hydrochloric acid or nitric acid) and a cobalt salt were ultrasonically aerosolized and pyrolyzed. Results showed that CoOₓ/SiO₂ spheres with hollow or mesoporous structure can be fabricated by using the NaCl and NaNO₃ salts as in situ formed templates. Significantly, this approach avoids the need for post-calcination for template elimination, instead permitting aqueous removal with water. The influence of the sodium salts on the characteristics of CoOₓ/SiO₂ spheres was investigated by means of XRD, nitrogen physisorption, SEM/TEM, ICP-MS, UV-Vis, XPS and H₂-TPR. On the basis of the experimental results, a possible mechanism on the formation of hollow and mesoporous spheres was proposed. The CoOₓ/SiO₂ spheres were tested as catalysts for toluene oxidation. The mesoporous CoOₓ/mSiO₂ was found to exhibit superior activity to hollow CoOₓ/hSiO₂, probably attributed to a combination of several factors, including the predominant existence of a Co₃O₄ active phase, high surface Co³⁺ content, and easy reducibility of Co³⁺ at low temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acobalt 3acobalt oxide 3ahydrochloric acid 3anitric acid 3anitrogen 3aoxidation 3aporous media 3apyrolysis 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilica 3asodium 3asodium chloride 3asodium nitrate 3asodium silicate 3atemperature 3atoluene 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultrasonics 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aBai, Hsunling0 tRSC advances.g2016 Mar. 03, v. 6, no. 29 p.24304-24313dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra27488e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01869naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100001500146245010300161300001600264520099700280592002801277650001901305650001601324700001601340700001601356773011901372852000901491856008201500961000901582655001201591IND7907361620221119152312.0181030e197908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND790736162DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517579049008012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLawson, R.10aRelation of Cotton Fiber Maturity and Strength Uniformity to Change in Tenacity with Mercerization  ap. 433-437.  aBolls of eight cultivars of Gosspium hirsutum L. were harvested 26, 32, 38, and 44 days postanthesis.

Strength uniformity was negatively correlated with the increase in tenacity on both slack and tension mercerization (tenacity ratio) on samples within a harvest date. When all harvest dates were included, this relationship was nonsignificant. Within a cultivar this correlation was strong and positive. The relationship of XaOH maturity to the tenacity ratio was not significant on samples from one harvest date, but it increased to significance when the range in maturity was extended to include samples from all harvest dates. Within a cultivar this relation was strong and negative.

Distributed hydrological models are generally computationally intensive, and their calibration may require several hours or days which can be an issue for many operational contexts. Different optimization algorithms have been developed over the years and exhibit different strengths when applied to the calibration of computationally intensive hydrological models. This paper shows how the dynamically dimensioned search (DDS) and the mesh adaptive direct search (MADS) algorithms can be combined to significantly reduce the computational time of calibrating distributed hydrological models while ensuring robustness and stability regarding the final objective function values. Five transitional features are described to adequately merge both algorithms. The hybrid approach is applied to the distributed and computationally intensive HYDROTEL model on three different river basins located in Québec (Canada).  aFunding for this study was provided by a PhD scholarship granted to the first author by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [290944911].  aPublisher supplied data  a290944911cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canadadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100000038 3aalgorithms 3ahydrologic models 3asystem optimization 3awatersheds 3aQuebec 0adistributed hydrological model 0acomputationally intensive simulation model 0aoptimization algorithm 0aefficient calibration 0adynamically dimensioned search (DDS) algorithm 0amesh adaptive direct search (MADS) algorithm1 aPoulin, A.,cJr.,d1938-1996,1 aAudet, C.1 aAlarie, S.0 tHydrological sciences journal.g2019 July 27, v. 64, no. 10 p.1204-1222dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2013x2150-34357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2019.16249223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02909naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005400142245007800196500002000274520164600294592002801940596004501968650002002013650001302033650001302046650002102059650001502080650001302095650001402108650001702122650001002139700005702149700005802206700005502264773013002319856007702449852000902526655001202535IND60778437820221121050141.0220527e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077843782DNAL7 a10.1029/2021WR0314902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaager, F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7329-700X10aEffect of Macrorough Sidewalls on Flow Resistance in Steep Rough Channels  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPrevious studies showed that macrorough sidewalls increase the stability of step‐pool sequences in steep narrow channels due to grain‐sidewall interactions (i.e., jamming) and bed shear stress reduction due to sidewall friction. The main goal of this study was to quantify sidewall and bed shear stress for six types of macrorough sidewalls using physical model tests. Experiments were conducted in a tilting flume with initial slopes of 4%–10% with fixed rough beds without step‐pool sequences and mobile rough beds containing step‐pool sequences. A hydraulic geometry relation to predict mean flow velocity was extended with the relative sidewall roughness to account for friction effects of macrorough sidewalls, resulting in mean prediction errors below 8% for the mobile bed experiments. Furthermore, the study presents a method to estimate flow resistance caused by the macrorough sidewalls by applying a modified sidewall correction. For the fixed rough bed, the macrorough sidewalls accounted for 10%–70% of the total shear stress. In the mobile bed experiments, the bed freely adjusted to the flow leading to the formation of step‐pool sequences. Consequently, sidewall friction accounted for 5%–40% of the total shear stress because the step‐pool structures induced larger flow resistance compared to the fixed bed experiments. Overall, the results allow to determine bed and sidewall shear stress in steep channels with macrorough bed and sidewalls, thereby enabling future studies to better quantify the mechanisms responsible for the increase in bed stability in step‐pool channels with macrorough sidewalls.  aPublisher supplied data  cSwiss Federal Office for the Environment 3aflow resistance 3afriction 3ageometry 3ahydraulic flumes 3aprediction 3aresearch 3aroughness 3ashear stress 3awater1 aHohermuth, B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8218-04441 aWeitbrecht, V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3008-51671 aBoes, R.

The data on sequential occurrence of rainfall in consecutive days is considered. The outcomes are classified as rainfall in both days, rainfall in one of the consecutive days, and no rainfall in both days. The occurrence of rainfall in consecutive days is analyzed by using statistical models with covariate dependence and classification tree for the period from 1980 to 2014. We have used relative humidity, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, sea level pressure, sunshine hour, and cloud cover in the model as covariates. The binary outcome variable is defined as the occurrence or non-occurrence of rainfall. Five regions of Bangladesh are considered in this study and one station from each region is selected on the basis of two criteria: (i) contains fewer missing values and (ii) representative of the regional characteristics geographically. Several measures are used to compare the models based on Markov chain and classification tree. It is found that for yearly data, both the Markov model and classification tree performed satisfactorily. However, the seasonal data show variation of rainfall. In some seasons, both models perform equally good such as monsoon, pre-monsoon, and post-monsoon, but in the winter season, the Markov model works poorly whereas classification tree fails to work. Additionally, we also observe that the Markov model performed consistently for each season and performs better compared with the classification tree. It has been demonstrated that the covariate-dependent Markov models can be used as classifiers alternative to the classification tree. It is revealed that the predictive ability of the covariate-dependent Markov model based on Markovian assumption performs either better or equally good compared with the classification tree. The joint models also consistently showed better predictive performance compared with regressive model for whole year data as well as for several seasonal data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMarkov chain 3aartificial intelligence 3acloud cover 3ameteorological data 3amonsoon season 3arain 3arelative humidity 3asea level 3asolar radiation 3astatistical models 3atemperature 3awinter 3aBangladesh1 aIslam, M.

Tailoring the geometric configuration of the device in line with the operating conditions can improve the device performance. Consequently; in the present study, the influence of the pin geometric configuration on the thermoelectric generator performance is investigated. The dimensionless tapering parameter is introduced and its effect on the first and second law efficiencies is examined for various operating conditions including the external load resistance and the temperature ratio. It is found that the first and second law efficiencies are significantly influenced by the pin geometry. The dimensionless tapering parameter (a), increasing tapering of the thermoelectric pins, within the range of 2⩽a⩽4 results in improved first and second law efficiencies. However, the dimensionless tapering parameter maximizing the first and second law efficiencies does not maximize the device output power. This behavior is associated with the external load resistance which has a considerable influence on the device output power such that increasing external load resistance lowers the device output power.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric generators 3aenergy conversion 3ageometry 3aheat 3arenewable energy sources 3atemperature 0aThermoelectric generator 0aPin geometry 0aThermal performance 0aFirst law efficiency 0aSecond law efficiency1 aCauhdarī, Hādī ʻAlī,0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2015 Aug., v. 100 p.138-146dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2015.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03337naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245009800171300001400269500001500283520181600298592002802114650001402142650001902156650002302175650002502198650001602223650001502239650002002254650002102274650002002295650001402315650001902329650002302348650001202371650002602383650001402409650001702423650001302440650002202453653001002475700002302485700002002508700001902528700002402547700002702571700001502598700001802613773010702631856004802738852000902786655001202795IND4434685420221119225357.0120726e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443468542DNAL7 a10.1007/s10327-010-0221-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChattopadhyay, Soumen10aEvaluation of mulberry germplasm for resistance to powdery mildew in the field and greenhouse  ap. 87-93.  a2019-12-06  aPowdery mildew caused by the ascomycete Phyllactinia guttata (syn. P. corylea) is a major foliar disease worldwide of the unique mulberry (Morus spp.) for silkworm feed. Genetic resistance to powdery mildew, the most sustainable and economical strategy for disease control, is still elusive for tropical mulberry. About 147 germplasm sources, representing 18 countries of origin, were screened for resistance to P. guttata in six seasonal fields and greenhouse trials after exposure to natural and artificial inoculum, respectively. In the field, the level of plant responsiveness to disease was assessed from 30 to 62 days after pruning in each season as variations in the disease severity index (DSI), disease incidence (DI%) and area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC). These measures differed significantly among the germplasm. Of 147 germplasm sources, ~6.8% had useful resistance (two high and nine moderately resistant) to the powdery mildew pathogen on the basis of DSI. The AUDPC values were 13.5-fold higher in the most susceptible accession—(Philippines) than the least responsive (Vietnam-2). The results of DSI were strongly correlated with the obtained DI values (r = 0.92; P < 0.01) and AUDPC (r = 0.89; P < 0.01). Moreover, field screening results were highly correlated (R 2 = 0.839) with values from the greenhouse evaluation using artificial inoculum. However, the DSI values in field and greenhouse screenings for three sources (Non-nayapati, Nao-khurkul and Tista Valley) varied significantly. A relatively low disease reaction of 09 resources (Vietnam-2, Ankara and 07 others) using different assessment scales after natural and artificial inoculation prove, for the first time, that they have potential in breeding for resistance in tropical mulberry to powdery mildew.  aPublisher supplied data 3agermplasm 3aplant breeding 3agenetic resistance 3agermplasm evaluation 3agreenhouses 3amulberries 3adisease control 3adisease severity 3afoliar diseases 3apathogens 3apowdery mildew 3adisease resistance 3apruning 3afield experimentation 3ascreening 3aPhyllactinia 3ainoculum 3adisease incidence 0aMorus1 aAli, Kabiul Akhter1 aDoss, S.

Microcystis aeruginosa is a toxic HAB causing alga, which causes serious economic losses and health problems. In this study, a strain J25 with the high algicidal activity isolated from an eutrophic Qu Jiang Lake, was identified as Acinetobacter sp. based on its morphological features and phylogenetic analysis by sequencing of 16S rDNA. Its algae-lysing characteristics on M. aeruginosa, was tested under the different conditions. The results showed that the strain J25 had good tolerance of acid and alkali, and full illumination played a positive role in the algae removal. Furthermore, this was the first report about the relationship between algicidal and denitrification activities. The maximum denitrification rate (1.62mg NO3−–NL−1h−1) was observed within 6 days at 15% of inoculum.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAlgicidal bacterium 0aMicrocystis aeruginosa 0aAlgicidal activities 0aDenitrification1 aShao, Si cheng1 aHuang, Ting lin1 aMa, Fang1 aLu, Jin suo1 aZhang, Kai0 tJournal of Environmental Chemical Engineering.g2016 Mar., v. 4 p.1002-1007dElsevier Ltdx2213-34377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jece.2016.01.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03628naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245008300166300001300249520197600262592002802238650001302266650002002279650001902299650002802318650001602346650001102362650001502373650001302388650001702401650001202418650002302430650002002453650001102473650001702484650001302501650001702514650001802531650001102549650001902560650001502579651001502594651001202609653002302621653002002644653001602664653001902680653002902699700001602728700001802744700001802762700001702780700001802797700001602815773008902831856008502920852000903005655001203014IND60590668420221117234536.0190318e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059066842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pedobi.2017.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIvask, Mari10aSpringtails of flooded meadows along Matsalu Bay and the Kasari River, Estonia  ap. 1-10.  aThe brackish conditions of the Baltic Sea create special habitats in coastal meadow soils surrounding Matsalu Bay. The floodplains of the Kasari River are periodically flooded by fresh water. In the eastern part of Matsalu Bay and in the delta of the river, brackish and fresh water can be mixed due to strong winds from the west or due to exceptionally large amounts of fresh water flowing from the river in the spring. The aim of this study was to find out how flood and habitat soil salinity influence the abundance and diversity of springtail communities on flooded meadows. The studied meadows were grouped to four types by distance of study sites from the open sea and by soil electroconductivity: fresh floodplain, wet floodplain, transitional and coastal grasslands. Springtail communities on temporarily flooded meadows along Matsalu Bay and the Kasari River consist of 20 − 30 species per meadow type, species Metaphorura affinis, Willemia anophthalma, Brachystomella parvula, Folsomia quadrioculata were abundant in soil of all types of meadows. Our results confirmed that flooding is an important factor in shaping soil communities. Long-term flood had strong negative effect on springtail communities’ abundance and diversity. However, there was no such negative effect of flood on meadows with shorter flooding period, for several species the flood was positive factor increasing the abundance. Flooding brackish sea water is the reason for higher electroconductivity of meadow soils negatively influencing the diversity of springtail communities. The abundance of several species was the highest in soil of coastal grasslands (Agrenia bidenticulata, Folsomia sexoculata, Podura aquatica, Sminthurides schoetti) despite the higher salinity of soil. The impact of flood duration on the composition of communities by life forms seemed to be less important than the impact of soil salinity, saline soil was not a suitable habitat for euedaphic springtails.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFolsomia 3aPodura aquatica 3abrackish water 3aelectrical conductivity 3afloodplains 3afloods 3afreshwater 3ahabitats 3ameadow soils 3ameadows 3apopulation density 3apopulation size 3arivers 3asaline soils 3aseawater 3asoil ecology 3asoil salinity 3aspring 3awind direction 3awind speed 3aBaltic Sea 3aEstonia 0aFloodplain meadows 0aCoastal meadows 0aSpringtails 0aFlood duration 0aSoil electroconductivity1 aKuu, Annely1 aMeriste, Mart1 aKutti, Sander1 aPalo, Anneli1 aRaamets, Jane1 aKilki, Siim0 tPedobiologia.g2018 Jan., v. 66 p.1-10dElsevier GmbHwJournal:1957x0031-40567nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pedobi.2017.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02245naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245009600153300002000249520108000269592002801349650002401377650001201401650001301413650002201426650001801448650001301466650002001479650002501499650001901524650001601543650001501559650001101574700001901585700001601604700002001620773012401640856007401764852000901838655001201847IND60640310620221121002020.0190504e20160315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064031062DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra27493a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Li10aEnhanced antibiotic removal by the addition of bamboo charcoal during pig manure composting  ap. 27575-27583.  aWhile composting is generally an effective way to minimize the adverse environmental impacts of manure prior to land application, some issues may also be introduced during compositing, such as the increased presence of recalcitrant antibiotic residues from feed additives. This study suggested that the addition of bamboo charcoal (BC) during pig manure composting was beneficial for the removal of three antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, chlorotetracycline, and norfloxacin). Addition of 9% (w/w) BC decreased the concentration of ciprofloxacin residues by 98.9% (from 1.85 to 0.02 mg kg⁻¹ dry weight) in 45 days, and decreased the content of norfloxacin and chlorotetracycline below detection limits in less than 5 and 10 days, respectively. In comparison, without added BC, ciprofloxacin levels were decreased by only 82.7% (from 1.85 to 0.32 mg kg⁻¹ dry weight) after 45 days of composting. This indicated that BC could enhance the removal of antibiotics during manure composting, thus reducing the risk of antibiotic residue runoff when composts are used in agriculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotic residues 3abamboos 3acharcoal 3achlortetracycline 3aciprofloxacin 3acomposts 3adetection limit 3aenvironmental impact 3afeed additives 3anorfloxacin 3apig manure 3arunoff1 aChen, Guangcai1 aOwens, Gary1 aZhang, Jianfeng0 tRSC advances.g2016 Mar. 15, v. 6, no. 33 p.27575-27583dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra27493a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01888naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245015700157300001800314520054300332592002800875650002200903650002500925650002500950650001600975650002300991650001101014650004401025650002201069650001401091700002701105700001401132700001701146700001801163700001301181700001801194700001301212700002001225700001901245773010601264856007501370852000901445655001201454IND60578811220221120231821.0170814e20141219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057881122DNAL7 a10.1021/ol503230s2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Shi-Hong10aUnraveling the Metabolic Pathway in Leucosceptrum canum by Isolation of New Defensive Leucosceptroid Degradation Products and Biomimetic Model Synthesis  ap. 6416-6419.  aSeven new leucosceptroid degradation products possessing a C₂₀, C₂₁, or C₂₅ framework, norleucosceptroids D–H (1–5), leucosceptroids P (6), and Q (7), have been isolated from Leucosceptrum canum.

We compared four quantitative methods for enumeration of atrazine-degrading bacteria in rhizosphere environments and utilized the optimal probe-based real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)–based method in an ongoing bioremediation experiment to monitor atzA copy number over time. We compared three quantitative PCR (qPCR) based methods—quantitative competitive PCR and two real-time qPCR methods—to traditional dilution-plate counting techniques. The optimal real-time qPCR assay was then used to monitor atzA copy number over time in the robust atrazine-degrading Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP–spiked rhizosphere environment. The use of sensitive and reliable probe-based real-time qPCRs for the enumeration of bacterial catabolic genes allows for their detection from soil samples and monitoring of potential degradative populations over time. The addition of atrazine-biodegrading bacteria into atrazine-contaminated sites to remove entrapped atrazine is a promising approach for mitigating atrazine pollution and its metabolites. The methodology contained herein will allow for optimal monitoring of atzA in rhizosphere soil with or without the addition of biodegradative Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP of bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas 3aadenosine diphosphate 3aatrazine 3aatrazine chlorohydrolase 3abioremediation 3agenes 3ametabolites 3amonitoring 3aplate count 3apollution 3aquantitative analysis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arhizosphere 3arhizosphere bacteria 3asoil 3asoil sampling1 aLin, Chung-Ho1 aHsieh, Hsin-Yeh1 aKremer, R.

Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), an essential fatty acid mainly found in vegetable sources, has been associated with anti-inflammatory effects and improving lipid profile. This systematic review and meta-analysis investigate the effects of supplementation with vegetable sources of ALA on inflammatory marker and lipid profile in individuals with CKD. This review included studies with adult or elderly patients with CKD, including those receiving dialysis, using oral supplementation or food or combined interventions containing vegetable sources of ALA. All studies were randomized trials and The Cochrane Collaboration's tool was use for assessing risk of bias. 19 studies provided data for meta-analyses. ALA had significant effect on reducing C-reactive protein (CRP) after supplementation (WMD: −1.32; 84.5% CI, −2.35 to −0.29, P = 0.012), on the other hand, had no significant effect on total cholesterol (WMD: −2.85; 90.1% CI, −14.43 to 8.73, P = 0.629), high density lipoprotein (WMD: 1.09; 92.4% CI, −1.82 to 3.99, P = 0.463), low density lipoprotein (WMD: −3.87; 86.7% CI, −12.62 to 4.89, P = 0.387) and triglycerides (WMD: −16.42; 87.7% CI, −47.83 to 14.98, P = 0.305). Vegetables sources of ALA showed beneficial effects on reducing inflammatory marker CRP in CKD patients but had no effect on lipid profile. Future well-designed studies are needed to investigate the effectiveness of vegetables sources of ALA, particularly in CKD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC-reactive protein 3aalpha-linolenic acid 3acholesterol 3aclinical nutrition 3adialysis 3aelderly 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3ahyperlipidemia 3ainflammation 3akidney diseases 3alipid composition 3alow density lipoprotein 3ameta-analysis 3amorbidity 3amortality 3asystematic review 3avegetables 0aChronic kidney disease 0aInflammation 0aDyslipidemia 0aCardiovascular disease 0aAlpha linolenic acid 0aC-reactive protein1 aCopetti, Cândice Laís Knöner1 aHauschild, Daniela Barbieri1 aDi Pietro, Patricia Faria1 aWazlawik, Elisabeth0 tClinical nutrition.g2022 June, v. 41, no. 6 p.1434-1444dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000059x0261-56147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2022.02.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01205naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245007300155300001800228520031200246592002800558650002400586650001100610650003300621700001900654700002100673700001600694773012200710856007400832852000900906655001200915IND60640310920221121002040.0190504e20160120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064031092DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra27500h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Hui10aBu₄NI-catalyzed construction of tert-butyl peresters from alcohols  ap. 8465-8468.  aA new method for the synthesis of tert-butyl peresters directly from available alcohols catalyzed by Bu₄NI at room temperature in an aqueous system was developed.

During serum-starvation, we noted that the translation levels of DDB2 were increased. To evaluate whether the 5′-UTR of DDB2 harbors an IRES element, we used a bicistronic luciferase plasmid with the 5′-UTR of DDB2 inserted between two cistron coding regions. We found that DDB2 5′-UTR could initiate the downstream reporter, demonstrating that the 5′-UTR of DDB2 contained an IRES. The 5′-UTR of DDB2 was predicted into a relatively stable secondary structure by the Mfold program. We deleted the stem-loops in turn to analyze the core part of IRES and found that full length of the 5′-UTR was significant for the IRES activity. Furthermore, our data demonstrated that the DDB2 IRES activity was promoted during stress conditions. These results reveal a novel mechanism contributing to DDB2 expression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aDNA repair 3aapoptosis 3agenes 3aluciferase 3aplasmids 0aBSA 0aΔ 0aDDB2 0aEtdBr 0akDa 0aLa 0aoligo 0ap 0aPAGE 0aSDS 0aUTR 0aUV 0aIRES 0aDDB2 0aInternal ribosome entry segment 0aIRES activity 0aTranslation1 aMa, Wennan1 aLi, Qi1 aTao, Yifen1 aDing, Pengpeng1 aZhu, Ruiyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8192-05351 aJin, Jian0 tGene.g2015 Nov. 15, v. 573 p.57-63dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2015.07.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01963naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245007400169300001800243520097400261592002801235653002201263653002101285653000901306653002101315653001601336700002201352700002101374700002001395700002001415773011101435856008201546852000901628655001201637IND60532076020221120195842.0160726e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053207602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jece.2016.01.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeybros, Antoine10aCesium removal from contaminated sand by supercritical CO2 extraction  ap. 1076-1080.  aSupercritical CO2 extraction is a promising process among existing decontamination methods. Feasibility of supercritical CO2 extraction processing for decontamination of contaminated soils has been studied with non-radioactive cesium as contaminant. Extractant system considered was a mixture of DB18C6 crown ether and HPFOA that gave a synergistic effect when combined. Process parameters influence such as operating pressure (25–29MPa) and temperature (40–80°C), initial cesium/extractant/cationic exchanger amounts (molar ratio between 1/12/12 and 1/100/100) and soil moisture (0–6%wt) has been tested. Low temperature (40°C) and high pressure (29MPa) allow to optimize process ability for cesium removal. A compromise should be established, for a fixed CO2 flow rate, between amounts of extractants and cationic exchangers. Efficiency of cesium removal seems to be optimized at 3%wt matrix moisture. Extraction from sand is successful with yields up to 95%.  aPublisher supplied data 0aSupercritical CO2 0aMetal extraction 0aSand 0aSoil remediation 0aCrown ether1 aGrandjean, Agnès1 aSegond, Nathalie1 aMessalier, Marc1 aBoutin, Olivier0 tJournal of Environmental Chemical Engineering.g2016 Mar., v. 4 p.1076-1080dElsevier Ltdx2213-34377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jece.2016.01.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01614naa a2200217 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100002200146245004900168300001600217520089400233592002801127651001801155773012001173852000901293856008201302655001201384IND7900471420221119152535.0181030e197812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND790047142DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517578048012052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHafez, Osman M.A.10aYarn-Strength Prediction of American Cottons  ap. 701-705.  aA system of predicting skein strength in Egyptian cottons was, with minor modifications, applied for predicting skein strength of American cottons of the hirsutum type (Uplands) and of the barbadense type (Pima), using the same linear equation. The independent variable in the prediction equation is a simple function of two of the measured properties of the fibers: staple length and fiber tenacity with specified yarn number. The dependent variable is a function of the observed skein strength, the specified number, and the specified turns per meter. By means of such configuration of variables, it was possible to extend the prediction process through a wide range of fiber properties, yarn counts, and yam twists. The correlation coefficient was high (+0.97), while the average absolute deviation from regression was 31.6 N for samples of individuals and 12 N for samples of averages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited States0 tTextile research journal.g1978 Dec., v. 48, no. 12 p.701-705dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0040517578048012053Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02169naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005600147245012300203300001600326500001900342520090500361592002801266650001401294650001601308650001601324650001701340650002201357650001001379651002001389653001701409653001201426653001601438653001601454653002201470700005701492773014401549856008101693852000901774655001201783IND60709232720221121035042.0200904e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070923272DNAL7 a10.1017/S17421705190001272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaylor, John1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0689-903210aCollection of Jaltomata darcyana (Solanaceae), previously unrecorded in cultivation, from a home garden in Chicago, IL  ap. 490-492.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEvidence has been slowly accumulating that the urban home gardens of immigrants or transnational migrants in the USA conserve food plant diversity with roots in the developing world. Published species lists for home gardens indicate that, at least at the species level, this diversity is not novel but consists of widely grown, culturally important plant species that are also available through the horticultural trade. In 2018, we returned to the home garden of a Mexican-origin household in Chicago and confirmed the identity of a plant provisionally identified as Jaltomata darcyana during an earlier inventory of the garden. A recently named species of Central America, J. darcyana has not been previously recorded in cultivation. Collection of this species from a Chicago garden suggests that urban gardens may harbor other novel species awaiting documentation by urban ecologists and botanists.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJaltomata 3aagriculture 3afood plants 3ahome gardens 3aspecies diversity 3atrade 3aCentral America 0aBiodiversity 0aChicago 0aethnobotany 0ahome garden 0aurban agriculture1 aMione, Thomas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2944-75570 tRenewable agriculture and food systems.g2020 Oct., v. 35, no. 5 p.490-492dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl3649527x1742-17137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17421705190001273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03201naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245008100210300001600291520220200307592002802509650002502537650001302562650001402575650001102589650003002600650001102630651001102641651001102652773013302663856008202796852000902878655001202887IND60673893520221119081054.0191020e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067389352DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-019-02837-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFalarz, Malgorzata1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0478-273510aAzores High and Hawaiian High: correlations, trends and shifts (1948–2018)  ap. 417-431.  aThe paper focuses on investigation of ‘twin’ subtropical oceanic highs of the Northern Hemisphere, i.e. the Azores High (AH) and the Hawaiian High (HH) in January and July based on gridded 2.5° × 2.5° data of Reanalysis Project of the National Center for Atmospheric Research for the period 1948–2018. The aim is to answer three questions: (1) Are there any connections between AH and HH (both within and between the systems)? (2) What is the long-term variability and trends of the basic characteristics of AH and HH? (3) Do the AH and HH move, and if so, in what directions? The most important results are as follows: (1) the long-term trend of sea level air pressure in the AH centre in January is positive, statistically significant with the increase of 0.63 hPa/10 years, (2) pressure in both centres significantly relates with the latitude of each system; variables characterising the HH in January explain 11% of variation of the variables of the AH in July, (3) the NE-SW/SW-NE index proves the shifting of the AH in January from the south-west to the north-east until the 1990s of the twentieth century and again to the south-west in the twenty-first century, (4) the HH in January and July moved generally from the north-east to the south-west until the end of the twentieth century and shifted again to north-east during the twenty-first century, (5) the AH in July was characterised by complicated displacement system with the prevalence of the shifting from the north-east to the south-west with the exception for the period 1980–1990. In winter, the AH moves towards the land area of Europe in the second half of the twentieth century, while the HH moves towards the open Pacific. The statistically significant increase of pressure in the centre of the AH in January is closely related to the shifting of the system to the north-east. The positive pressure trend in the centre of the AH in January combined with the zero trend in July is the cause of diminishing difference between summer and winter air pressure value of the high. Due to increased sea surface temperature of the Atlantic, the AH does not lose its strength in winter as it used to a few decades ago.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric pressure 3alatitude 3asea level 3asummer 3asurface water temperature 3awinter 3aAzores 3aEurope0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2019 Oct., v. 138, no. 1-2 p.417-431dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl3932171x0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-019-02837-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03328naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100002300140245010200163300001800265500000900283520187300292592002802165650001502193650001202208650002002220650001202240650000902252650001802261650001302279650001902292650001902311650001402330650001402344650000702358650001702365650001502382650001102397650000902408650001802417650003402435650003302469650001102502650001902513700002202532773019402554852000902748856007702757655001202834IND4457492620221121092418.0191028e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445749262DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq2010.01562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBradford, Scott A.10aImplications of Cation Exchange on Clay Release and Colloid-Facilitated Transport in Porous Media  ap. 2040-2046.  aepub  aColumn experiments were conducted to study chemical factors that influence the release of clay (kaolinite and quartz minerals) from saturated Ottawa sand of different sizes (710, 360, and 240 μm). A relatively minor enhancement of clay release occurred when the pH was increased (5.8 to 10) or the ionic strength (IS) was decreased to deionized (DI) water. In contrast, clay release was dramatically enhanced when monovalent Na⁺ was exchanged for multivalent cations (e.g., Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺) on the clay and sand and then the solution IS was reduced to DI water. This solution chemistry sequence decreased the adhesive force acting on the clay as a result of an increase in the magnitude of the clay and sand zeta potential with cation exchange, and expansion of the double layer thickness with a decrease in IS to DI water. The amount of clay release was directly dependent on the Na⁺ concentration of the exchanging solution and on the initial clay content of the sand (0.026–0.054% of the total mass). These results clearly demonstrated the importance of the order and magnitude of the solution chemistry sequence on clay release. Column results and scanning electron microscope (SEM) images also indicated that the clay was reversibly retained on the sand, despite predictions of irreversible interaction in the primary minimum. One plausible explanation is that adsorbed cations increased the separation distance between the clay–solid interfaces as a result of repulsive hydration forces. A cleaning procedure was subsequently developed to remove clay via cation exchange and IS reduction; SEM images demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach. The transport of Cu²⁺ was then shown to be dramatically enhanced by an order of magnitude in peak concentration by adsorption on clays that were released following cation exchange and IS reduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acalcium 3acation exchange 3acations 3aclay 3aclay fraction 3acleaning 3aimage analysis 3aionic strength 3akaolinite 3amagnesium 3apH 3aporous media 3aprediction 3aquartz 3asand 3asand fraction 3ascanning electron microscopes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asodium 3azeta potential1 aKim, Hyŏn-jŏng,0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2010 Nov., v. 39, no. 6 p.2040-2046dAmerican Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, Soil Science SocietywJournal:jnl1642x1537-25377nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2010.01563Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03297naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245013800163300001400301500001500315520164200330592002801972650001302000650002402013650002002037650002402057650001302081650002102094650001802115650001802133650000902151650002702160650002002187650001602207650001902223650001402242650002502256650001502281650002402296650002502320651001002345653002402355700002402379700001902403700001902422700002402441773011902465852000902584856008102593930003302674945002502707946001102732655001202743IND4393571320221121024252.0160903e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439357132DNAL7 a10.1007/s10705-006-9070-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiaobin10aCrop residue, manure and fertilizer in dryland maize under reduced tillage in northern China: II nutrient balances and soil fertility  ap. 17-34.  a2019-12-06  aA long-term experiment was carried out in the dryland of northern China to assess the effects of applications of maize stover, cattle manure and NP (1:0.44) fertilizer on partial nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) balances, extractable soil N (SEN), P and K, and soil organic matter (SOM) in a spring maize cropping system, under reduced tillage conditions. The experiment was set-up according to an incomplete, optimal design, with three factors at five levels and 12 treatments, including a control with two replications. Statistical analyses using multiple regression models showed that the partial N, P and K balances were strongly influenced by annual variations in the amounts of soil water at seeding (SWS) and growing season rainfall (GSR). Most treatments had positive P but negative N and K balances. Cumulative P and K balances were reflected in extractable soil P (P-Olsen) and K (exchangeable K), but the weak relationships indicated that the sorption of P and buffering of K were strong. Cumulative balances of effective organic carbon (C) were weakly related to soil organic C (SOC) content after 12 years. Negative C balances were related to decreases in SOC, but positive C balances were not translated into increases in SOC. The analysis of nutrient balances and soil fertility indices revealed that nutrient inputs in most treatments were far from balanced. It is concluded that the concepts of ‘ideal soil fertility level’ and ‘response nutrient management’ provide practical guidelines for improving nutrient management under the variable rainfall conditions of dry land areas in northern China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3anutrient management 3aplant nutrition 3asoil organic carbon 3anitrogen 3afertilizer rates 3acrop residues 3acattle manure 3acorn 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3adryland farming 3agrain yield 3asoil fertility 3apotassium 3aconservation tillage 3aphosphorus 3aorganic fertilizers 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aChina 0asoil organic matter1 aHoogmoed, Willem B.1 aCai, Dianxiong1 aPerdok, Udo D.1 aOenema, O.q(Oene),0 tNutrient cycling in agroecosystems.g2007 Sept., v. 79, no. 1 p.17-34dKluwer Academic Publishersx1385-13147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10705-006-9070-63Available from publisher's site  a20080402b20080502c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/11/28  aNon-US 7aarticle02288naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245008500172300001600257520107800273592002801351650002001379650001501399650001101414650001501425650002401440650002301464651001001487653002801497653002801525653003201553653002101585700002301606700002401629700002001653700002401673773009801697856008601795852000901881655001201890IND60562591620221116182127.0170208e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056259162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2015.05.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Rosa, Mattia12aA novel TRNSYS type for short-term borehole heat exchanger simulation: B2G model  ap. 347-357.  aModels of ground source heat pump (GSHP) systems are used as an aid for the correct design and optimization of the system. For this purpose, it is necessary to develop models which correctly reproduce the dynamic thermal behavior of each component in a short-term basis. Since the borehole heat exchanger (BHE) is one of the main components, special attention should be paid to ensuring a good accuracy on the prediction of the short-term response of the boreholes. The BHE models found in literature which are suitable for short-term simulations usually present high computational costs. In this work, a novel TRNSYS type implementing a borehole-to-ground (B2G) model, developed for modeling the short-term dynamic performance of a BHE with low computational cost, is presented. The model has been validated against experimental data from a GSHP system located at Universitat Politècnica de València, Spain. Validation results show the ability of the model to reproduce the short-term behavior of the borehole, both for a step-test and under normal operating conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aheat exchangers 3aheat pumps 3amodels 3aprediction 3asystem optimization 3athermal properties 3aSpain 0aGround source heat pump 0aBorehole heat exchanger 0aHeating and cooling systems 0aDynamic modeling1 aRuiz-Calvo, Félix1 aCorberán, José M.1 aMontagud, Carla1 aTagliafico, Luca A.0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2015 Aug., v. 100 p.347-357dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2015.05.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02731naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245009100166300001800257520155200275592002801827653001901855653001101874653002201885653003501907653005001942653002501992700002102017700001702038700001702055700002302072700001802095700002402113700001802137773011102155856008202266852000902348655001202357IND60532076520221117173024.0160726e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053207652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jece.2016.01.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSasaki, Keiko10aRemoval mechanism of high concentration borate by co-precipitation with hydroxyapatite  ap. 1092-1101.  aCo-precipitation of borate in a wide range of concentration with hydroxyapatite (HAp) was investigated using Ca(OH)2 as a mineralizer in the presence of phosphate. The sorption data of borate was fitted to Freundlich model. The maximum sorption density of B/Ca to maintain a mono-phase of HAp was found around 0.40. In higher B concentrations, borate was still immobilized, however, the crystalization of hydroxyapatite was inhibited, where the solid residues were accompanied with amorphous CaB2O4, as well as HAp. Based on 11B-NMR and elemental analysis for solid residues in addition to solution chemistry, the removal mechanism of high concentration borate can be explained by the surface complexation of triborate on Ca(OH)2, subsequently decomposition of triborate into monoborate to release [CaB(OH)4]+ and B(OH)4−, followed by co-precipitation with HAp. These tetragonal B species were immobilized in the solid residues including amorphous HAp. During the process there was a trend to eliminate carbonate from the solid phase. TEM images suggested that the HAp particles precipitated at room temperatures were in a fibrous shape consisting of a number of short rods when borate species are not added. When borate species were immobilized, the HAp particles have gotten swelled with losing fibrous shapes. When further higher borate concentrations were encapsulated in co-precipitated products, the morphologies were dramatically changed, that is, nano-sized and less crystalline HAp particles were enveloped by possibly amorphous CaB2O4.  aPublisher supplied data 0aHydroxyapatite 0aBorate 0aX-ray diffraction 0a11B-nuclear magnetic resonance 0aTransmission electron microscopic observation 0aSurface complexation1 aToshiyuki, Kenta1 aIdeta, Keiko1 aMiki, Hajime1 aHirajima, Tsuyoshi1 aMiyawaki, Jin1 aMurayama, Mitsuhiro1 aDabo, Ismaila0 tJournal of Environmental Chemical Engineering.g2016 Mar., v. 4 p.1092-1101dElsevier Ltdx2213-34377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jece.2016.01.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01431naa a2200229 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100002200146245008000168300001600248520065500264592002800919650001100947700002000958773012000978852000901098856008201107655001201189IND8005139520221119152156.0181030e197910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND800513952DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517579049010092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaylor, Robert A.10aNew Spindle Tip Reduces Spinning Yarn Tension and Tension-Related Ends Down  ap. 608-616.  aA newly-developed spindle tip to control yarn tension was mounted on the top of a conventional ring-frame spindle.

Samples are pretreated through liquid–liquid extraction and solid-phase extraction. This method is time consuming and requires the intensive use of solvents. To improve analytical efficiency and reduce costs, our study incorporated QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe) techniques to establish a new method of multiresidue analysis of β-agonists in animal muscle and viscera. The pretreatment time was shortened and solvent usage was minimized. The modified analysis was conducted using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) and quantification was performed using multiple reaction monitoring. The results demonstrated that the correlation coefficients of the tissue calibration curve were higher than 0.99 and the limit of quantification (LOQ) was 1 ppb. The average recoveries in spiked samples varied from 70% to 120%, and the relative difference between duplicated analysis results was lower than 10%. On the basis of the results, the proposed method was concluded to be an appropriate procedure for determining the presence of β-agonists, and demonstrated the advantages of high recovery rates in spiked samples, high precision, reduced analysis time and solvent usage, and lower costs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFood and Drug Administration 3aanimal organs 3aanimals 3abeta-adrenergic agonists 3acorrelation 3acost effectiveness 3adrug residues 3afoods 3aliquid chromatography 3aliquid-liquid extraction 3amonitoring 3amultiresidue analysis 3amuscles 3asolid phase extraction 3asolvents 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aveterinary drugs 3aTaiwan 0aβ-agonists 0aLC–MS/MS 0amultiresidue analysis 0aQuEChERS1 aLee, Ying-Lin1 aHung, Chien-Ya1 aHuang, Wen-Jeng1 aLin, Sheng-Che0 tYàowù shípǐn fēnxī.g2017 Apr., v. 25, no. 2 p.275-284dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23274x1021-94987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfda.2016.06.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04045naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245010200207300001600309500001900325520224900344592002802593650002202621650002202643650002202665650001602687650001202703650001302715650001602728650001202744650001102756650001602767650001702783650001802800650002902818650001002847650002102857650001902878650001302897650002502910650002102935650001502956650000902971650001202980653004102992653001503033653002503048653002803073653003103101653001003132700002303142700002103165700002303186773014403209856008103353852000903434655001203443IND60709233020221119175317.0200904e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070923302DNAL7 a10.1017/S17421705190001522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaskin, Julia W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2131-682410aUsing the cover crop N calculator for adaptive nitrogen fertilizer management: a proof of concept  ap. 550-560.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLegume cover crops can supply a significant amount of nitrogen (N) for cash crops, which is particularly important for organic farmers. Because N mineralization from cover crop residue depends on the amount of biomass, cover crop quality, as well as environmental conditions such as soil moisture and temperature, predicting the amount of N mineralized and the timing of release has been difficult. We have developed a Cover Crop Nitrogen Calculator based on the N subroutine of the CERES crop model and evaluated the use of the predicted N credits on yields of fall broccoli [Brassica oleracea L.

Walp.) cover crop and no cover crop treatments, each at four N rates (0N, 0.5N, 1N and 1.5N, with 1N the target N rate of 112 kg N ha⁻¹ in 2013 and 168 kg N ha⁻¹ in 2014 and 2015) in a randomized complete block design. On-farm trials consisted of a cowpea or sunn hemp (Crotolaria juncea L.) cover crop at four N rates (0N, 0.5N, 1N and 1.5N) and no cover crop treatment at the 1N rate in a completely randomized design. Cover crop biomass and quality (N%, carbohydrates%, cellulose% and lignin%) were measured and used with a 5-yr average soil moisture and soil temperature from a local weather station to predict an N credit. In the cover crop treatments, the N rate was modified by the predicted credit, while the no cover crop treatment received the full N fertilizer rate either as feathermeal (certified organic fields) or as urea (conventional field). At the research farm, broccoli yield increased up to the 0.5N rate, and there was no difference in yield between the no cover 0.5N rate and the cover crop 0.5N rate in 2013, 2014 and 2105. On-farm, we saw an N response in two site-years. In these site-years, there was no difference between the no cover 1N rate and the cover crop 1N rate. At the third site-year, no N response was seen. Overall, our results showed using the cover crop credit predicted by the Calculator did not reduce yields. The use of a decision support tool such as the Calculator may help farmers better manage N fertilizer when cover crops are used, and increase cover crop adoption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica oleracea 3aCrotalaria juncea 3aVigna unguiculata 3aagriculture 3abiomass 3abroccoli 3acover crops 3acowpeas 3acredit 3acrop models 3acrop quality 3acrop residues 3adecision support systems 3afarms 3afertilizer rates 3amineralization 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3asoil temperature 3asoil water 3aurea 3aweather 0aBrassica oleracea L.

The approach can be simply divided into three steps. Firstly the in-situ synthesis of Ag NPs in PVP/N, N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc) solution, secondly the phase inversion of Ag NPs/PVA aqueous solution in acetone (AC) to get porous Ag/PVA sphere, finally the crosslinking of Ag/PVA porous sphere by glutaraldehyde using HCl as catalyst, and AgCl NPs were formed through the reaction between Ag NPs and HCl simultaneously. BET and SEM results showed that AgCl/PVA sphere had a porous structure, and its surface area was about 192m2/g. XRD and XPS data proved the formation process of NP from Ag ions to Ag NPs and then to AgCl NPs. TEM and EDX images revealed that AgCl NPs were mainly buried inside PVA matrix and their sizes were about 50–90nm. Even for 5th cycles of photodegradation of methyl orange (MO) in xenon lamp, AgCl/PVA porous sphere still showed a high photoactivity and a good photostability in the presence of chloride ions. The possible mechanism of photocatalysis was proposed finally.  aPublisher supplied data 0aPVA porous sphere 0aNanoparticles 0aAg–AgCl photoactivity 0aPhotocatalyst1 aHou, JiaoJiao1 aYang, Hu1 aXu, Zhen-Liang0 tJournal of Environmental Chemical Engineering.g2016 Mar., v. 4 p.1068-1075dElsevier Ltdx2213-34377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jece.2016.01.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03807naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005800151245017400209500002200383506010400405506007600509520208100585592002802666506003702694650002302731650002302754650002802777650001102805650002602816650002402842650002502866650001502891650001102906650002002917650001302937651001402950653004202964653001503006653000803021653002003029653001303049700002103062700002203083700002703105773008603132856008603218852000903304655001203313IND60794692320221207103023.0220929e20220915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079469232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e107242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZainal Abidin,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8718-322210aPerceived risk and attitude's mediating role between tourism knowledge and visit intention during the COVID-19 pandemic: implementation for coastal-ecotourism management  aPre-press version  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCMC Tiga Warna is one of the coastal area management for conservation and ecotourism in southern Malang, Indonesia. Despite fewer tourist visits, the COVID-19 pandemic did not dissuade locals from managing and protecting ecotourism in the coastal area. This study aims to: (a) to describe coastal ecosystem management; and (b) to analyze coastal ecotourist visit intention related to tourism knowledge, perceived health risk, and risk attitude in the post-COVID-19 era as a part of developing strategy for coastal ecosystem management in the study area from the perspective of ecotourists and destination management. CMC Tiga Warna management, community group supervisors, the local community, and a variety of experts were interviewed in order to gather data for the current strategy. Coastal ecotourist visit intention data from domestic ecotourists was gathered via online and offline surveys. Analyzing the visit intention data with Warp-PLS. Using the visit intention model and interview data, the coastline management strategy was described. This study found that the coastal environment management plan constantly involved ecotourists and locals. Tourism knowledge and risk attitude are positively related to the visit intention, however perceived health risk is negatively related to it. The significant positive relationship between tourism knowledge and ecotourist visit intention is mediated by perceived health risk and risk attitude. Development of the coastal ecosystem management plan could be supported by boosting visit intention, ecotourism visits, or economic incentive as a motive for sustaining the conservation program's consistency, and ecological and social rewards in a sustainable manner. This study added to the Theory of Reasoned Action by adding two additional factors, tourist knowledge and perceived health risk, in addition to the attitude to predict the visit intention. The ecotourism manager should provide varied tourist information and knowledge as needed, reduce COVID-19 exposure risk at tourist destinations, and increase risk attitude.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCOVID-19 infection 3acoastal ecosystems 3acoastal zone management 3acoasts 3aconservation programs 3aeconomic incentives 3aecosystem management 3aecotourism 3amodels 3arisk perception 3atourists 3aIndonesia 0aCoastal ecosystem management strategy 0aEcotourism 0aTRA 0aVisit intention 0aCOVID-191 aHandayani, Wahyu1 aZaky, Emeraldo A.1 aFaturrahman, Achmad D.0 tHeliyon.g2022 Sept. 15,  p.e10724-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e107243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02080naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245012500171300001800296500001900314520072600333536008701059592002801146596008401174650001701258650001501275650001401290650001401304650001901318651001201337653003201349653002201381653002001403700001601423700001801439700001601457773011401473856008601587852000901673655001201682IND60654102720221120224728.0190723e20190729xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065410272DNAL7 a10.1080/03066150.2018.14316232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPritchard, Bill10aStudying home gardens as if people mattered: Why don't food-insecure households in rural Myanmar cultivate home gardens?  ap. 1047-1067.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aExtensive research, mainly undertaken by nutrition scientists and economists, indicates that the presence of a home garden is positively associated with improved household nutrition in rural households of the global South.

This is problematic given rapidly changing social and economic landscapes, which reshape the place and scope for home gardens within households’ livelihood and food provisioning arrangements.

Researchers have used different methods to evaluate regional water security situations to ensure sustainable development. However, existing water security assessment models focus on the current status of water security in a static state and do not introduce flow characteristics of water resources into regional water security assessments. On the other hand, the quality of water resources should be reflected in not only current water security situations but also change trends of water security. Therefore, this paper attempts to integrate ecosystem service flows into a water security simulation using a simplified service path attribution networks (SPANs) model. Simultaneously, by simulating future scenarios and comparing future and current water security statuses, this paper systematically evaluates regional water security status and provides water security management and control suggestions that meet the requirements of regional development. The results show that water security in Henan Province and Shandong Province is lacking, and water resource management and control measures need to be strengthened to improve the water security in these areas. The water security assessment framework established in this paper not only reasonably assesses the status of water security but also provides a development model that meets the needs of the study area through a multiple scenario analysis. This study provides a scientific basis for government departments to formulate water management policies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystem services 3ahumans 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3asustainable development 3awater resources 3awater security 3aChina 0aEcosystem services flow 0aWater resources 0aWater security 0aWater management1 aLiu, Jingya1 aYan, Liwen1 aHuang, Haijun0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 June 20, v. 670 p.1037-1048dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.03.2633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03243naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245006100174300001400235520183700249592002802086650002002114650003102134650001502165650002302180650002302203650001002226650000902236650001702245650002302262650001002285650001402295650001502309650001102324650001402335650001902349650001302368650001002381650001802391650001402409651001402423653001702437653002302454653001502477653001502492773013802507856008302645852000902728655001202737IND60582619720221121074025.0190412e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058261972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.baae.2017.09.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoube, B.q(Bernard),10aEcosystem services provided by dung beetles in Australia  ap. 35-49.  aAlthough there are nearly 500 species of native dung beetles in Australia, most are adapted to small, hard, dry, pelletised marsupial droppings and not to dealing with the large, moist deposits of cattle. In 1788, Governor Arthur Phillip arrived at Botany Bay with five cows, two bulls, 44 sheep and seven horses: this signalled major changes in Australia. Now there are about 27 million cattle, whose annual dung production has a dry matter content of about 42 million tonnes. Until CSIRO introduced exotic dung beetles in the 1960s, the dung of these herbivores sat on the soil surface, sometimes for years, locking up organic matter, smothering pasture and polluting waterways. CSIRO introduced 53 exotic dung beetle species, of which 43 were released to the Australian mainland between 1965 and 1985. Twenty-three of these have become established, many of which have reached the natural limits of their distribution. I consider the reason for the failure of the other 30 species to establish and briefly review previous contributions to examining the role of dung beetles in delivering ecosystem services, noting that much of the published literature concerns laboratory studies. New field data are then examined on the way in which introduced species are transforming dung communities and the ecosystem services they provide. The capacity of deep-tunnelling dung beetles to transform the soil profile is examined along with their effects on pasture production and the flow of nutrients from dung on pasture. The biocontrol capacity of dung beetle activity is considered in relation to the native bush fly, Musca vetustissima, the introduced buffalo fly, Haematobia irritans exigua, and dung-borne intestinal parasites (helminths and Cryptosporidium). The rationale for introducing additional species to Australia is considered.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryptosporidium 3aHaematobia irritans exigua 3aMetatheria 3aMusca vetustissima 3abiological control 3abulls 3acows 3adung beetles 3aecosystem services 3afeces 3ahelminths 3aherbivores 3ahorses 3anutrients 3aorganic matter 3apastures 3asheep 3asoil profiles 3awaterways 3aAustralia 0aDung beetles 0aEcosystem services 0aHerbivores 0aGrasslands0 tBasic and applied ecology.g2018 Feb., v. 26 p.35-49dElsevier GmbHaGesellschaft für ÖkologiewJournal:jnl3925117x1439-17917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.baae.2017.09.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04001naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245008300173300001600256520197200272592002802244650002202272650001802294650001602312650002702328650002602355650001202381650002002393650001302413650001502426650001402441650001902455650001102474650001302485650001302498650002202511650001402533650001102547650001502558650001502573650002502588650001402613650001002627650001902637650002102656650001202677651001502689653001402704653001402718653001302732653001902745653001902764700002102783700002102804700001802825700002502843700006402868700002402932700002102956700002602977700001903003700002103022700002003043773011903063856008803182852000903270655001203279IND60635068920221120040459.0190502e20190625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063506892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.03.2642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaudsepp, Urmas10aShipborne nutrient dynamics and impact on the eutrophication in the Baltic Sea  ap. 189-207.  aThe Baltic Sea is a severely eutrophicated sea-area where intense shipping as an additional nutrient source is a potential contributor to changes in the ecosystem. The impact of the two most important shipborne nutrients, nitrogen and phosphorus, on the overall nutrient-phytoplankton-oxygen dynamics in the Baltic Sea was determined by using the coupled physical and biogeochemical model system General Estuarine Transport Model–Ecological Regional Ocean Model (GETM-ERGOM) in a cascade with the Ship Traffic Emission Assessment Model (STEAM) and the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. We compared two nutrient scenarios in the Baltic Sea: with (SHIP) and without nutrient input from ships (NOSHIP). The model uses the combined nutrient input from shipping-related waste streams and atmospheric depositions originating from the ship emission and calculates the effect of excess nutrients on the overall biogeochemical cycle, primary production, detritus formation and nutrient flows. The shipping contribution is about 0.3% of the total phosphorus and 1.25–3.3% of the total nitrogen input to the Baltic Sea, but their impact to the different biogeochemical variables is up to 10%. Excess nitrogen entering the N-limited system of the Baltic Sea slightly alters certain pathways: cyanobacteria growth is compromised due to extra nitrogen available for other functional groups while the biomass of diatoms and especially flagellates increases due to the excess of the limiting nutrient. In terms of the Baltic Sea ecosystem functioning, continuous input of ship-borne nitrogen is compensated by steady decrease of nitrogen fixation and increase of denitrification, which results in stationary level of total nitrogen content in the water. Ship-borne phosphorus input results in a decrease of phosphate content in the water and increase of phosphorus binding to sediments. Oxygen content in the water decreases, but reaches stationary state eventually.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aCyanobacteria 3aair quality 3aatmospheric deposition 3abiogeochemical cycles 3abiomass 3adenitrification 3adetritus 3aecosystems 3aestuaries 3aeutrophication 3amodels 3amoieties 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fixation 3anutrients 3aoxygen 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3aprimary productivity 3asediments 3aships 3atotal nitrogen 3atotal phosphorus 3atraffic 3aBaltic Sea 0aNutrients 0aModelling 0aShipping 0aNitrogen cycle 0aThe Baltic Sea1 aMaljutenko, Ilja1 aKõuts, Mariliis1 aGranhag, Lena1 aWilewska-Bien, Magda1 aHassellöv, Ida-Maja1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3216-05971 aEriksson, K.

Emergence of P. gaeumannii fungal fruiting bodies (pseudothecia) in Douglas‐fir stomata has been directly linked to premature needle loss, a symptom of Swiss needle cast disease. • Douglas‐fir trees (10‐yr‐old) naturally infected with P. gaeumannii were treated with soil applications of N fertilizer isotopically enriched with ¹⁵N to increase foliar N and track the movement of N from the host to the fungus. Foliar N, free amino acids, percent of stomata occluded by pseudothecia, N isotope and carbon (C) isotope levels were assessed on treated and control trees. • Higher foliar N resulted in increased %N and %C in P. gaeumannii, as well as increased fungal fruiting and thus disease severity. Comparisons of δ¹⁵N levels between P. gaeumannii pseudothecia and associated needles indicated an increase in δ¹⁵N of needles and a simultaneous decline in δ¹⁵N of pseudothecia coupled with increased levels of foliar and fungal percentage N. • These findings confirm that P. gaeumannii responds to host nutrient status and that increased N availability inside Douglas‐fir needles is linked to increased severity of Swiss needle cast disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhaeocryptopus 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aendophytes 3afruiting bodies 3anitrogen 3acarbon 3afungal diseases of plants 3adisease severity 3aPseudotsuga menziesii 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aisotope labeling 3aconifer needles 3afree amino acids1 aKavanagh, Kathleen1 aRose, Cathy1 aKanaan‐Atallah, Zahi0 tnew phytologist.g2004 July, v. 163, no. 1 p.139-147dBlackwell Science LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2004.01102.x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02580naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002900144245006000173520143500233592002801668650001601696650002001712650001701732650001101749650003101760650002101791650002001812650003601832700003401868700002401902700002701926700002601953700002601979773012602005856007802131852000902209655001202218IND60729203620221118025020.0210228e20210216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072920362DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox100202952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aViedma-Poyatos, Álvaro 10aProtein Lipoxidation: Basic Concepts and Emerging Roles  aProtein lipoxidation is a non-enzymatic post-translational modification that consists of the covalent addition of reactive lipid species to proteins. This occurs under basal conditions but increases in situations associated with oxidative stress. Protein targets for lipoxidation include metabolic and signalling enzymes, cytoskeletal proteins, and transcription factors, among others. There is strong evidence for the involvement of protein lipoxidation in disease, including atherosclerosis, neurodegeneration, and cancer. Nevertheless, the involvement of lipoxidation in cellular regulatory mechanisms is less understood. Here we review basic aspects of protein lipoxidation and discuss several features that could support its role in cell signalling, including its selectivity, reversibility, and possibilities for regulation at the levels of the generation and/or detoxification of reactive lipids. Moreover, given the great structural variety of electrophilic lipid species, protein lipoxidation can contribute to the generation of multiple structurally and functionally diverse protein species. Finally, the nature of the lipoxidised proteins and residues provides a frameshift for a complex interplay with other post-translational modifications, including redox and redox-regulated modifications, such as oxidative modifications and phosphorylation, thus strengthening the importance of detailed knowledge of this process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3aatherosclerosis 3acytoskeleton 3alipids 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aoxidative stress 3aphosphorylation 3apost-translational modification1 aGonzález-Jiménez, Patricia 1 aLanglois, Ophélie 1 aCompany-Marín, Idoia 1 aSpickett, Corinne M.,1 aPérez-Sala, Dolores 0 tAntioxidants.g2021 Feb. 16, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox100202953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02514naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245012000173300001600293520115600309592002801465650001301493650001201506650001001518650001001528650001101538650001101549650001001560650001401570650001601584650001001600650002801610650001901638650002301657651001101680653001401691653002001705653002701725653002001752653001301772700004201785700002201827773009701849856008901946852000902035655001202044IND60602122320221119225156.0180709e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060212232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2015.07.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHamada, Neusa12aA new species of Simulium (Chirostilbia) (Diptera: Simuliidae) from Mantiqueira mountain range, southeastern Brazil  ap. 143-158.  aSimulium (Chirostilbia) vitribasi n. sp. from the Mantiqueira mountain range, in São Paulo and Minas Gerais states, southeastern Brazil, is described and illustrated based on male, female, pupal and larval morphologies.

Bryophyte communities, as well as those of other plants and of animals, can be thought of in terms of individual species each utilizing particular portions of various resource or habitat continua. Quantitative studies carried out since 1981, particularly those involving niche breadth and overlap, are reviewed. Special attention is given to niche diversification in Sphagnum, Splachnaceae, bryophyte communities in streams, and to ephemeral bryophyte communities. Some bryophyte communities appear to have equilibrium characteristics and to contain species with relatively narrow niche breadths and with no or only partial niche overlap. In many habitats, however, bryophyte communites have non‐equilibrium characteristics and diversification of species in microhabitats is opportunistic. Do any bryophyte communities persist long enough for complete saturation by species which have realized niches determined by competitive interactions? Recent studies indicate that this is the case for at least some Sphagnum communities, but that it is the exception not the rule for bryophytes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBryopsida 3aSphagnum 3aanimals 3acompetitive exclusion 3amicrohabitats 3aniches 3astreams0 tBotanical journal of the Linnean Society.g1990 Sept., v. 104, no. 1‐3 p.187-213dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0024-40747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8339.1990.tb02218.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02935naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245012200171520167600293592002801969650001501997650001502012650001602027650001002043650001702053650002802070650001802098650001602116653001502132653002702147653003502174653002702209653002102236700001602257700005702273773012002330856009002450852000902540655001202549IND60736100220221123023930.0220314e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073610022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.postharvbio.2021.1115692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Dandan10aRelationship of the optical properties with soluble solids content and moisture content of strawberry during ripening  aTo understand the relationship of optical properties with soluble solids content (SSC) and moisture content of strawberry during ripening, a single integrating sphere system was built to estimate the absorption coefficient (μₐ) and reduced scattering coefficient (μₛ') of strawberry in white, color turning and red ripening stages over the wavelength range of 550−850 nm and 950−1650 nm. The relationship between optical properties and SSC and moisture content was analyzed, and the determination models for SSC and moisture content were established by using partial least squares regression and support vector machine methods based on the spectra of μₐ, μₛ', and μₐ together with μₛ'. The results showed that the absorption peaks of strawberry were at 675, 975, 1197 and 1411 nm, and the μₛ' generally decreased with increased maturity of strawberry. The μₐ was positively correlated with SSC and negatively correlated with moisture content, while the μₛ'was positively correlated with moisture content and negatively with SSC. The best correlations of μₐ with SSC and moisture content were found at 1411 nm with the correlation coefficients of 0.72 and -0.74, respectively. The established support vector machine models based on the μₐ spectra in 950−1650 nm and 550−850 nm had the smallest root-mean-squares error of calibration set of 0.98 % and 0.89 % for SSC and moisture content, respectively. This study indicates that SSC and moisture content mainly affect the absorption property of strawberry, and μₐ has greater potential than μₛ' and μₐ together with μₛ' in determining the internal quality of strawberry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aabsorption 3acalibration 3acolor 3astrawberries 3asupport vector machines 3awater content 3awavelengths 0aStrawberry 0aAbsorption coefficient 0aReduced scattering coefficient 0aSoluble solids content 0aMoisture content1 aLiu, Dayang1 aGuo, Wenchuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0550-772X0 tPostharvest biology and technology.g2021 Sept., v. 179 p.111569-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl47454x0925-52147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.postharvbio.2021.1115693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02582naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245011300169300001600282500002000298520111000318592002801428650001701456650001201473650002501485650003701510650002601547650002201573650001101595650002201606650001801628650002001646650001901666650002701685650002201712650002901734650001201763650001001775650002201785650001901807700003001826700001601856700001501872773011501887852000902002856008902011655001202100IND4363326620221118090017.0210417e200407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436332662DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.2004.01075.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFontaine, J.10a24‐Methyl/methylene sterols increase in monoxenic roots after colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi  ap. 159-167.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a• Characteristic sterols of transformed carrot (Daucus carota) and chicory (Cichorium intybus) roots colonized by different strains of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi were identified. • Sterols were extracted, analysed and identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC‐MS) from monoxenic cultures of mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal roots. After colonization by Glomus intraradices, Glomus proliferum and Glomus sp., carrot and chicory roots exhibited a significantly higher 24‐methyl/methylene sterol content. A correlation was established between the content of the sum of 24‐methyl cholesterol, 24‐methylene cholesterol and 24‐methyl desmosterol. • This study clearly established that the increment of these characteristic sterols is an appropriate indicator of colonization by AM fungi of transformed roots. • Metabolic origin and specificity of these sterols in mycorrhizal roots was researched. The 24‐methyl/methylene sterol increase was observed only when the interaction between fungus and plant was completely established and the fungus was present inside the roots.  aPublisher supplied data 3aphytosterols 3achicory 3aqualitative analysis 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3aquantitative analysis 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aGlomus 3atransgenic plants 3aDaucus carota 3avegetable crops 3aplant extracts 3amicrobial colonization 3amonoxenic culture 3aRhizophagus intraradices 3acarrots 3aroots 3aCichorium intybus 3atissue culture1 aGrandmougin‐Ferjani, A.1 aGlorian, V.1 aDurand, R.0 tnew phytologist.g2004 July, v. 163, no. 1 p.159-167dBlackwell Science LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2004.01075.x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03776naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006400148245011800212300001200330520240200342592002802744650001602772650001802788650001102806650001202817650001902829650001302848650001102861650001302872650001502885650001702900650003002917650001102947650001402958650001402972650001802986650001503004650000903019651001603028700002103044700002303065700002103088773010503109856008303214852000903297655001203306IND60712513220221122143839.0210921e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071251322DNAL7 a10.1186/s12870-020-02403-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlápště, Jaroslav1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5504-373510aEffect of trait’s expression level on single-step genomic evaluation of resistance to Dothistroma needle blight  ap. 205.  aBACKGROUND: Many conifer breeding programs are paying increasing attention to breeding for resistance to needle disease due to the increasing importance of climate change. Phenotyping of traits related to resistance has many biological and temporal constraints that can often confound the ability to achieve reliable phenotypes and consequently, reliable genetic progress. The development of next generation sequencing platforms has also enabled implementation of genomic approaches in species lacking robust reference genomes. Genomic selection is, therefore, a promising strategy to overcome the constraints of needle disease phenotyping. RESULTS: We found high accuracy in the prediction of genomic breeding values in the disease-related traits that were well characterized, reaching 0.975 for genotyped individuals and 0.587 for non-genotyped individuals. This compared well with pedigree-based accuracies of up to 0.746. Surprisingly, poorly phenotyped disease traits also showed very high accuracy in terms of correlation of predicted genomic breeding values with pedigree-based counterparts. However, this was likely caused by the fact that both were clustered around the population mean, while deviations from the population mean caused by genetic effects did not appear to be well described. Caution should therefore be taken with the interpretation of results in poorly phenotyped traits. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of genomic selection in this test population of Pinus radiata resulted in a relatively high prediction accuracy of needle loss due to Dothistroma septosporum compared with a pedigree-based approach. Using genomics to avoid biological/temporal constraints where phenotyping is reliable appears promising. Unsurprisingly, reliable phenotyping, resulting in good heritability estimates, is a fundamental requirement for the development of a reliable prediction model. Furthermore, our results are also specific to the single pathogen mating-type that is present in New Zealand, and may change with future incursion of other pathogen varieties. There is no doubt, however, that once a robust genomic prediction model is built, it will be invaluable to not only select for host tolerance, but for other economically important traits simultaneously. This tool will thus future-proof our forests by mitigating the risk of disease outbreaks induced by future changes in climate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDothistroma 3aPinus radiata 3ablight 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aconifers 3agenome 3agenomics 3agenotyping 3aheritability 3amarker-assisted selection 3amodels 3apathogens 3aphenotype 3aplant biology 3aprediction 3arisk 3aNew Zealand1 aDungey, Heidi S.1 aGraham, Natalie J.1 aTelfer, Emily J.0 tBMC plant biology.g2020 Dec., v. 20, no. 1 p.205-205dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-020-02403-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01411naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245010400157300001800261520027400279592002800553650001200581650002300593650001700616650003100633650000900664650002200673700002000695700002600715700002400741700002200765700002200787700002300809773013400832856007400966852000901040655001201049IND60617540120221121050110.0181025e20180628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061754012DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cc04366c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIsaac, Manon10aMRI and luminescence detection of Zn²⁺ with a lanthanide complex–zinc finger peptide conjugate  ap. 7350-7353.  aA bioinspired probe based on a zinc finger peptide functionalized by a lanthanide(iii)-DOTA monoamide complex turns out to be active for both luminescence and MRI detection of Zn²⁺, depending on the lanthanide cation.

Population dynamics shifted from the impressive growth of the post-industrial period into recent de-concentration processes determining the spillover of commercial and residential settlements across the surrounding rural areas. Based on long-term demographic data, the present study hypothesizes that urban expansion did not follow a one-way linear path from compactness to dispersion while reflecting differentiated growth patterns based on the specific socioeconomic context at the local scale. Along a sufficiently long time period non-linear expansion waves alternating settlement densification and scattering are expected to be found especially in complex urban contexts such as those developed in the Mediterranean region. This hypothesis was tested for a paradigmatic case study in southern Europe (Athens, Greece) using demographic data covering 160 years (1848–2011). Urban growth in Athens was assessed through the analysis of long-term census data made available on a district level. These data provide information on the spatial distribution of resident population and characterize distinct expansion waves according to the dominant socioeconomic context. Results of the study were discussed in the light of the debate on future development of the Mediterranean cities and the (changing) economic relations with the surrounding region.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acensus data 3acities 3aeconomic structure 3apopulation dynamics 3arural areas 3aurbanization 3aGreece 3aMediterranean region 3aSouthern European region0 tGeoJournal.g2016 Apr., v. 81, no. 2 p.319-332dSpringer Netherlandsx0343-25217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10708-015-9621-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02246naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245005200172300001600224520124900240592002801489650002301517650002201540650003701562650001501599650001401614650002601628650001901654700002301673700002001696773011401716856008101830852000901911655001201920IND60121011720221120053606.0150213e200208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012101172DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-002-1386-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVaidyanathan, Nithya10aSurface characterization of WO3/ZrO 2 catalysts  ap. 547-554.  aA series of WO₃/ZrO₂catalysts with tungsten (W) loadings ranging from 0.5 to 11.4 wt% was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation on a preformed ZrO₂support. The oxidic catalysts were characterized using XRD, Raman spectroscopy, XPS, ISS, and IR spectroscopy. XRD and Raman results showed that the ZrO₂support was predominantly present in the monoclinic form. XPS and Raman measurements indicated the formation of increasing amounts of W interaction species for catalysts with W loadings up to 8.8 wt% WO₃. In addition to the W interaction species, bulk WO₃was also observed for catalysts with W loadings ≥ 3.0 wt% WO₃. Comparison of the XPS results with coverage measurements by ISS and CO adsorption suggests that the W surface phase is in the form of two-dimensional polymeric patches for catalysts with W loadings 3.0 ≤ wt% WO₃≤ 4.5. For catalysts with W loadings >4.5 wt% WO₃, the results indicated an additional build-up of a bilayer (or multilayer) polymeric W species. Analysis of the hydroxyl region of ZrO₂by IR spectroscopy showed that initial additions of W occur on the high frequency hydroxyl group. A schematic for the structure of the catalysts has been proposed based on the above observations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3acatalysts 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3atungsten oxide1 aHercules, David M.1 aHoualla, Marwan0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2002 Aug., v. 373, no. 7 p.547-554dSpringer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-002-1386-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03407naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245012100164300001200285520171400297592002802011596007002039596006602109650002302175650001502198650001702213650002902230650000902259650001302268650001602281650001802297650001702315650001002332650003402342650001602376650002202392650001302414650001302427650001902440650002102459650001002480650001902490700001602509700001902525700001902544700001502563700001702578700001802595700001702613700001402630773010502644856008302749852000902832655001202841IND60712513520221122121148.0210921e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071251352DNAL7 a10.1186/s12870-020-02404-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Guomin10aGenome-wide association study leads to novel genetic insights into resistance to Aspergillus flavus in maize kernels  ap. 206.  aBACKGROUND: Fungus infection in staple grains affects the food storage and threatens food security. The Aspergillus flavus is known to infect multiple grains and produce mycotoxin Aflatoxin B1, which is mutagenic, teratogenic and causes immunosuppression in animals. However, the molecular mechanism of maize resistance to A. flavus is largely unknown. RESULTS: Here we used corn kernels to investigate resistance genes to A. flavus using genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 313 inbred lines. We characterized the resistance levels of kernels after inoculating with A. flavus. The GWAS with 558,529 SNPs identified four associated loci involving 29 candidate genes that were linked to seed development, resistance or infection, and involved in signal pathways, seed development, germination, dormancy, epigenetic modification, and antimicrobial activity. In addition, a few candidate genes were also associated with several G-protein signaling and phytohormones that might involve in synergistic work conferring different resistance during seed development. Expression of 16 genes out of 29 during kernel development was also associated with resistance levels. CONCLUSIONS: We characterized the resistance levels of 313 maize kernels after inoculating with A. flavus, and found four associated loci and 16 candidate maize genes. The expressed 16 genes involved in kernel structure and kernel composition most likely contribute to mature maize kernels’ resistance to A. flavus, and in particular, in the development of pericarp. The linked candidate genes could be experimentally transformed to validate and manipulate fungal resistance. Thus this result adds value to maize kernels in breeding programs.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017YFD0301306cKey Technologies Research and Development Program  aKJ2016A841cEducational Commission of Anhui Province of China 3aAspergillus flavus 3aG-proteins 3aaflatoxin B1 3aantimicrobial properties 3acorn 3adormancy 3aepigenetics 3afood security 3afood storage 3afungi 3agenome-wide association study 3agermination 3aimmunosuppression 3amutagens 3apericarp 3aplant hormones 3aseed development 3aseeds 3ateratogenicity1 aLi, Cuiping1 aXiang, Fangzhi1 aZhao, Qianqian1 aZhao, Yang1 aCai, Ronghao1 aCheng, Beijiu1 aWang, Xuewen1 aTao, Fang0 tBMC plant biology.g2020 Dec., v. 20, no. 1 p.206-206dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-020-02404-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01603naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245006600168300001600234520069600250592002800946650001500974650002000989650002001009650001601029650002101045650001201066700001901078773011401097856008101211852000901292655001201301IND60121011820221120053406.0150213e200208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012101182DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-002-1316-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSplawn, Bryan G.10aOn-chip absorption measurements using an integrated waveguide  ap. 519-525.  aSquare hollow waveguides are used to integrate measurement of absorption with chip-based electrophoresis.

Moreover, even if reforestation, currently led by various local actors (Waters and Forests, Agency of Social Development, Cooperatives and Associations of development) experienced a technical improvement, the plants used do not meet any selection criteria. Generally, unknown origin seedlings are used in reforestation and good seedlings are not reproduced. In this context, this study investigates through a choice of pilot sites the characterization in-situ of populations and/or argan trees with two selection criteria related to fruit: facility of crushing and oil content. For this purpose, and with the support of local population, the identification of performance trees, prospection and collection of fruits were realized in various sites representing five principal provinces of argan trees area (Essaouira; Taroudante; Agadir Ida Outanane; Chtouka-Ait Baha and Tiznit). Within each provenance, measurements related to 6750 fruits and the morphometric data were subjected to the analysis of the variance, according to the general linear model, where the genotype factor (mother tree) is hierarchical to provenance factor. This study offers preliminary information for the development of a breeding population and allows us to make a first selection of trees, having a clear superiority relating to the characters related to the production of oil and the facility of crushing seeds. At the present moment there is a genetic base large enough to initiate a breeding program.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aforest damage 3agenetic background 3agenetic variation 3alinear models 3alipid content 3amorphometry 3aoils 3aprovenance 3areforestation 3aspace and time 3avariance1 aAYADIDI, Fatima El1 aMSANDA, Fouad1 aMOUSADIK, Abdelhamid EL0 tNotulae botanicae Horti Agrobotanici Cluj-Napoca.g2010 Dec., v. 38, no. 3 p.293-301dAcademicPreswJournal:21431x1842-43097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.15835/nbha38349783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03712naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245011200171300001600283520206300299592002802362650001302390650003002403650002602433650001702459650001002476650001602486650001102502650002102513650001502534650002502549650001202574650001002586650000902596650001702605650001102622650001502633650001302648650001302661650001402674650001502688650000902703650001502712651001202727653001602739653002302755653002502778700001602803700002402819700001602843700001902859700001802878700001602896773009902912856009003011852000903101655001203110IND60597894320221120115010.0190628e20181001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059789432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2018.06.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHedberg, N.10aAntibiotic use in Vietnamese fish and lobster sea cage farms; implications for coral reefs and human health  ap. 366-375.  aSeveral papers have reported on the development of antibiotic resistance and implications for human medicine but fewer deal with environmental impacts of antibiotic use. Marine sea cage aquaculture in SE Asia is often established close to coral reef ecosystems. Large amounts of antibiotics are used in the cultivation of fish and lobster and hence released directly into the environment.This study investigates the antibiotic practices in sea cage farms producing fish and spiny lobster in Vietnam, mainly for the domestic market. There are approximately 3500 sea cage farms in Vietnam and we performed semi-structured interviews with 109 sea cage farmers asking them if they use antibiotics and if so; what sort/when/how often/how much.We found that the Vietnamese cage farmers are using antibiotics in an unstructured way, which seems to have little or no effect on the survival of the stock, or profit of the farm. The fact that the farmers live at their farm and use the sea next to the cages both for fishing and collecting filter-feeding bivalves for direct consumption, as well as a toilet, poses an additional risk for the spreading of human antibiotic resistant pathogens. Thirteen different antibiotics were found in the study. Eighty-two percentage of the lobster farmers and 28% of the fishfarmers used antibiotics. The average amounts used were over 5 kg per produced ton of lobster and about 0.6 kg per ton of fish, which is much higher than in other studies. Several antibiotic substances listed as “critical” and “highly important” for human medicine by WHO were used prophylactically and routinely with little control and enforcement of regulations.We tested and detected antibiotic resistance to Tetracycline, Vancomycin and Rifampicin in the coral associated bacteria Bacillus niabensis as far as 660 m from fish farms with resistance decreasing with distance from the cage farms. The antibiotics are likely to have negative effects on the coral-symbiont relationship adding further risks to an already stressed environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBivalvia 3aWorld Health Organization 3aantibiotic resistance 3acage culture 3acages 3acoral reefs 3acorals 3adomestic markets 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental impact 3afarmers 3afarms 3afish 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3ainterviews 3alobsters 3amedicine 3apathogens 3arifampicin 3arisk 3avancomycin 3aVietnam 0aAntibiotics 0aBacillus niabensis 0aSea cage aquaculture1 aStenson, I.1 aNitz Pettersson, M.1 aWarshan, D.1 aNguyen-Kim, H.1 aTedengren, M.1 aKautsky, N.0 tAquaculture.g2018 Oct. 01, v. 495 p.366-375dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2018.06.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03304naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001300144245014200157300002000299520155900319592002801878650002601906650001701932650002401949650001901973650001901992650000902011650001802020650003102038650001402069650001502083650001702098650002202115650002802137650001902165650002302184650001602207650001702223650002102240653001702261653001802278653002902296653002202325653002402347700001502371700001802386700001902404700001402423700001702437700005602454773014102510856007802651852000902729655001202738IND60595244420221120085353.0180531e20171220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059524442DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b147552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Yan12aA Small Molecule Nanodrug by Self-Assembly of Dual Anticancer Drugs and Photosensitizer for Synergistic near-Infrared Cancer Theranostics  ap. 43508-43519.  aPhototherapy including photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT) has attracted great attention. However, applications of some photosensitizers remain an obstacle by their poor photostability. To enhance the treatment efficiency of photosensitizers and tumor theranostic effect, herein, we reported a novel carrier-free, theranostic nanodrug by self-assembly of small molecule dual anticancer drugs and photosensitizer for tumor targeting. The developed carrier-free small molecule nanodrug delivery system was formed by hydrophobic ursolic acid, paclitaxel, and amphipathic indocyanine green (ICG) associated with electrostatic, π–π stacking, and hydrophobic interactions exhibiting water stability. The self-assembling of ICG on the dual anticancer nanodrug significantly enhanced water solubility of hydrophobic anticancer drugs and ICG photostability contributing to long-term near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging and effective chemophototherapy of tumor. The in vivo NIR fluorescence imaging showed that the theranostic nanodrug could be targeted to the tumor site via a potential enhanced permeability and retention effect proving the efficient accumulation of nanoparticles in the tumor site. Dramatically, chemophototherapy of tumor-bearing mice in vivo almost completely suppressed tumor growth and no tumor recurrence was observed. Encouraged by its carrier-free, prominent imaging and effective therapy, the small molecule nanodrug via self-assembly will provide a promising strategy for synergistic cancer theranostics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantineoplastic agents 3afluorescence 3ahydrophobic bonding 3ahydrophobicity 3aimage analysis 3amice 3ananoparticles 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3aneoplasms 3apaclitaxel 3apermeability 3aphotochemotherapy 3aphotosensitizing agents 3aphotostability 3aprecision medicine 3asurfactants 3aursolic acid 3awater solubility 0acarrier-free 0aself-assembly 0aNIR fluorescence imaging 0achemophototherapy 0acancer theranostics1 aJiang, Kai1 aShen, Zhichun1 aZheng, Guirong1 aFan, Lulu1 aZhao, Ruirui1 aShao, Jingwei1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2060-88870 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2017 Dec. 20, v. 9, no. 50 p.43508-43519dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b147553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02359naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245012400179300001600303520111700319592002801436650001101464650002501475650001701500650001201517650001301529650001401542650002401556650003701580651001501617653001101632653002101643653000901664653002001673700002701693700002301720773012501743856008401868852000901952655001201961IND60435889320221123004251.0151020e20151002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043588932DNAL7 a10.1080/08974438.2014.9189182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIgdir, Hajiyeh Babazadeh10aInvestigating the Role of Exporting Skills of Apple Exporters in Apple Export Development (Case Study: West Azerbaijan)  ap. 273-289.  aThe purpose of this research was to study the role of the exporting skills of apple exporters in export development.

In this study, the toxicological effects of fluoroquinolone antibiotics on Enchytraeus crypticus, including defence response, gut microbiome, and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), were studied. The cytochrome P450 enzyme activity and reactive oxygen species levels increased, activating the defense response. The superoxide dismutase and glutathione S-transferase activity, and the expression of immune defense molecules such as coelomic cytolytic factor, lysozyme, bactericidal protein fetidins and lysenin changed. Furthermore, the diversity of the gut microbiome decreased, and the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes decreased significantly at the phylum level but increased in pathogenic and antibiotic-secreting bacteria (Rhodococcus and Streptomyces) at the genus level. However, the soil microbiome was not significantly different from that of the control group. The relative abundance of ARGs in the gut and soil microbiome significantly increased with enrofloxacin concentration, and the fluoroquinolone ARGs were significantly increased in both the soil (20.85-fold, p < 0.001) and gut (11.72-fold, p < 0.001) microbiomes. Subtypes of ARGs showed a positive correlation with Rhodococcus, which might increase the risk of disease transmission and the probability of drug-resistant pathogens. Furthermore, mobile genetic elements significantly promote the spread of ARGs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroidetes 3aEnchytraeus 3aStreptomyces 3aanimal manures 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotics 3acytochrome P-450 3adigestive system 3adisease transmission 3aenrofloxacin 3aenzyme activity 3afluoroquinolones 3aglutathione transferase 3aimmune response 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alysozyme 3amicrobiome 3areactive oxygen species 3arisk 3asoil 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil pollution 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atoxicology 0aFluoroquinolone antibiotics 0aEnchytraeus crypticus 0aDefense response 0aGut microbiome 0aAntibiotic resistance genes1 aZhang, Qi1 aZhao, Wen-Lu1 aLi, Zhi-Heng1 aQian, Hai-Feng1 aYang, Xiao-Ru1 aZhu, Yong-Guan1 aLiu, Hui-Jun0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 Feb. 15, v. 424 p.127509-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1275093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03000naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003300133040001800166100002200184245009700206300001800303506007600321520156100397592002801958506003701986650002302023650001202046650001302058650002002071650004002091650002002131650002302151650002302174650001602197650003602213700002102249700002202270700002302292700002202315773017402337856004602511852000902557655001202566IND4481654420221207120250.0120502e20120327xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448165442DNAL7 a223715642pmid7 aPMC33239732pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.11199101092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGood, Benjamin H.10aDistribution of fixed beneficial mutations and the rate of adaptation in asexual populations  ap. 4950-4955.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWhen large asexual populations adapt, competition between simultaneously segregating mutations slows the rate of adaptation and restricts the set of mutations that eventually fix. This phenomenon of interference arises from competition between mutations of different strengths as well as competition between mutations that arise on different fitness backgrounds. Previous work has explored each of these effects in isolation, but the way they combine to influence the dynamics of adaptation remains largely unknown. Here, we describe a theoretical model to treat both aspects of interference in large populations. We calculate the rate of adaptation and the distribution of fixed mutational effects accumulated by the population. We focus particular attention on the case when the effects of beneficial mutations are exponentially distributed, as well as on a more general class of exponential-like distributions. In both cases, we show that the rate of adaptation and the influence of genetic background on the fixation of new mutants is equivalent to an effective model with a single selection coefficient and rescaled mutation rate, and we explicitly calculate these effective parameters. We find that the effective selection coefficient exactly coincides with the most common fixed mutational effect. This equivalence leads to an intuitive picture of the relative importance of different types of interference effects, which can shift dramatically as a function of the population size, mutation rate, and the underlying distribution of fitness effects.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3agenetic background 3amutants 3amutation 3apopulation size 2aAdaptation, Physiologicalxgenetics 2aGenetic Fitness 2aMutationxgenetics 2aPopulation Density 2aProbability 2aReproduction, Asexualxgenetics1 aRouzine, Igor M.1 aBalick, Daniel J.1 aHallatschek, Oskar1 aDesai, Michael M.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 Mar. 27, v. 109, no. 13 p.4950-4955dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1119910109  aDNAL 7aarticle03786naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245009600165300001600261520191900277592002802196650001402224650001202238650001502250650001302265650001202278650002402290650001302314650001102327650001502338650002002353650001202373650001002385650002202395650002302417650002602440650001302466650002102479650000702500650001502507650001602522650001302538650001402551650001602565650001602581650001602597650001902613650002402632650002302656650003002679650001002709650001102719651001002730653001902740653001102759653002502770653002802795653001202823700001602835700001602851700001802867773011002885856008402995852000903079655001203088IND60123222920221118035711.0150325e20140304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012322292DNAL7 a10.1080/00380768.2014.8822192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTu, Zhihua10aRhizosphere soil enzymatic and microbial activities in bamboo forests in southeastern China  ap. 134-144.  aBamboo has been introduced to coastal sandy areas in southeastern China to protect and restore coastal ecosystems. An understanding of the chemistries and enzymatic and microbial activities in the soils of these bamboo forests will aid our understanding of how bamboo plantations can improve soil fertility and will provide scientific evidence for policy makers for encouraging the planting of bamboo in other coastal areas. We investigated the physical and chemical properties of the rhizosphere soil [soil moisture content (SMC), pH, and contents of soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), available nitrogen (AN), total phosphorus (TP), available phosphorus (AP), total potassium (TK) and available potassium (AK)], enzymatic activities (sucrase, protease, urease and catalase) and microbial properties (counts of bacteria, fungi and actinomycetes) in five bamboo forests. The bamboo forests had significantly higher levels of SOM, TN, AN, TP, AP, TK, and AK and lower pH relative to a control soil sample from an area devoid of plants. Soil enzymatic activities and microbial communities were considerably higher in the bamboo forests than in the soil from the barren land. The chemical contents, enzymatic activities and microbial counts of the soil and the litter and root biomasses were higher in forests with the bamboo species Dendrocalamopsis oldhami and Pseudosasa amabilis than in forests with the other three species (Acidosasa edulis, Dendrocalamopsis vario-striata , and Dendrocalamopsis beecheyana var. pubescens), which suggests that these two species could adapt to sandy soil and grow well in a hostile environment. These results indicate that planting bamboo may help to both enrich soil fertility and increase the diversity of tree species in coastal ecosystems. The difference between aboveground and belowground biomass may have been responsible for these changes in soil properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcidosasa 3aBambusa 3aPseudosasa 3abacteria 3abamboos 3abelowground biomass 3acatalase 3acoasts 3aecosystems 3aenzyme activity 3aforests 3afungi 3aissues and policy 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobial communities 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3apH 3aphosphorus 3aplantations 3aplanting 3apotassium 3aproteinases 3arhizosphere 3asandy soils 3asoil fertility 3asoil organic matter 3asoil water content 3asucrose alpha-glucosidase 3atrees 3aurease 3aChina 0aCoastal forest 0abamboo 0aenzymatic activities 0asoil microbial activity 0abiomass1 aChen, Lihua1 aYu, Xinxiao1 aZheng, Yushan0 tSoil science and plant nutrition.g2014 Mar. 4, v. 60, no. 2 p.134-144dTaylor & Francisx1747-07657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00380768.2014.8822193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02326naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100003100152245016500183300001600348500002000364520112600384592002801510650002101538650001401559650001501573650002301588650001601611650001901627650002101646650001801667700002201685700002601707700001801733773011501751852000901866856008901875655001201964IND4363833120221118085951.0210417e200408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436383312DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.2004.01119.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlbrechtová, Jolana T.

To correlate changes in morphogenesis to altered local forces, we followed the geometry of the apical meristem during photoperiodic flower induction in Chenopodium rubrum. • The shape of the apical meristem was determined using cryo‐scanning electron microscopy. Cell wall properties on the surface of the dome were visualized using uplight polarization microscopy. • A subtle depression at the summit of the apical dome, typical for the vegetative state, became rounded during the early phase of flower induction. The observed changes were quantified as an increase in the ratio of height to diameter of the dome. In parallel, the properties of cell walls on the surface of the dome changed. • The changes in geometry of the apical meristem were attributed to water movement in the meristem paralleled by a change in cell wall properties at the top of the dome. The results support the hypothesis that local changes in surface tension precede initiation of organ primordia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapical meristems 3aflowering 3acell walls 3aChenopodium rubrum 3aphotoperiod 3aultrastructure 3aplant morphology 3aorganogenesis1 aDueggelin, Marcel1 aDuerrenberger, Markus1 aWagner, Edgar0 tnew phytologist.g2004 Aug., v. 163, no. 2 p.263-269dBlackwell Science LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2004.01119.x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02197naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245010600170300001600276500001900292520058500311592002800896650001000924650002000934650001900954650001100973650001400984650001100998651001401009651001001023651001101033651001801044651000901062653001701071653002801088653001801116653001701134653001701151653002801168653001201196653001701208700002201225700002201247700002201269700002101291700002501312700002101337700002701358773017901385856008201564852000901646655001201655IND60697888320221119214856.0200626e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069788832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ram.2019.06.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMenghi, Claudia I.10aHuman infection with Pseudoterranova cattani by ingestion of “ceviche” in Buenos Aires, Argentina  ap. 118-120.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAnisakidosis is an infection caused by larval nematodes that belong to several genera within the family Anisakidae.

The nucleus migrates to the CCR before its entrance in the phragmosome. The latter consists of transvacuolar cytoplasmic strands connecting the perinuclear cytoplasm with the CCR. During preprophase, a preprophase MT band is organized in the CCR. AF disruption and myosin inhibition destroy the CCR and cytoplasmic strands, arrest migration of the nucleus and affect cell plate expansion. MT disorganization inhibits anchoring of the cytoplasmic strands into the division plane. • These observations support that CCR establishment, formation of transvacuolar cytoplasmic strands, migration of the nucleus and lateral cell plate expansion depend on actomyosin. The MTs guide and anchor the cytoplasmic strands of the phragmosome into the predetermined division plane.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplant anatomy 3ahistology 3acell division 3amicrotubules 3aPlectranthus barbatus 3aPlectranthus scutellarioides 3aplant proteins1 aApostolakos, Panagiotis1 aQuader, Hartmut1 aGalatis, Basil0 tnew phytologist.g2004 Aug., v. 163, no. 2 p.271-286dBlackwell Science LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2004.01125.x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02732naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002500144245008500169520166600254592002801920650002201948650002501970650001701995650001402012650001002026650001302036650001402049650001902063700002502082700001802107700002602125700001802151773012602169856007802295852000902373655001202382IND60729204520221118030338.0210228e20210216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072920452DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox100203032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDarkal, Abdul  Karim10aUnleashing the Biological Potential of Fomes fomentarius via Dry and Wet Milling  aFomes fomentarius, usually referred to as tinder conk, is a common wood-based fungus rich in many interesting phytochemicals and with an unique porous structure. Dry or wet ball milling of this sponge on a planetary mill results in small particles with sizes in the range of 10 µm or below. Suspended in water and without preservatives or other stabilizers, the resulting micro-suspensions are sterile for around six days, probably due to the increased temperatures of around 80 °C especially during the wet milling process. The suspensions also exhibit excellent antioxidant activities as determined in the DPPH, ferric reducing antioxidant potential (FRAP) and 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) assays. In the DPPH assay, IC₅₀ values of 0.02–0.04% w/v and 0.04% w/v were observed for dry and wet milled samples, respectively. In the FRAP assay, IC₅₀ values of <0.02% w/v and 0.04% w/v were observed for dry and wet milled samples, respectively. In contrast, the ABTS assay provided IC₅₀ values of 0.04% w/v and 0.005% w/v, respectively. Notably, this activity is mostly—albeit not exclusively—associated with the highly porous particles and their large surfaces, although some active ingredients also diffuse into the surrounding aqueous medium. Such suspensions of natural particles carrying otherwise insoluble antioxidants on their surfaces provide an interesting avenue to unleash the antioxidant potential of materials such as sponges and barks. As dry milling also enables longer storage and transport, applications in the fields of medicine, nutrition, agriculture, materials and cosmetics are feasible.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFomes fomentarius 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acosmetics 3afungi 3amedicine 3anutrition 3aphytochemicals1 aZuraik, Mhd  Mouayad1 aNey, Yannick 1 aNasim, Muhmmad  Jawad1 aJacob, Claus 0 tAntioxidants.g2021 Feb. 16, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox100203033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02704naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245014900161300002000310520108000330592002801410650000801438650001401446650001101460650001401471650001301485650003001498650002101528650001301549650001601562650001301578650001501591650001901606650001401625653003001639653001601669653003101685653001901716653002001735700001701755700001801772700001801790700005401808700005501862700005301917773014101970856007802111852000902189655001202198IND60595244720221120073619.0180531e20171227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059524472DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b148152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zhongtao10aSynergistic Effects between Doped Nitrogen and Phosphorus in Metal-Free Cathode for Zinc-Air Battery from Covalent Organic Frameworks Coated CNT  ap. 44519-44528.  aA covalent organic framework that is composed of hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene and dicyanamide has been coated on CNT to prepare metal-free oxygen reduction reaction catalyst through thermal polymerization of the Zn-air battery cathode. The N,P-codoped nanohybrids have highly porous structure and active synergistic effect between graphitic-N and -P, which promoted the electrocatalytic performance. The electrocatalysts exhibits remarkable half-wave potential (−0.162 V), high current density (6.1 mA/cm–²), good stability (83%), and excellent methanol tolerance for ORR in alkaline solution. Furthermore, the N,P-codoped nanohybrids were used as an air electrode for fabrication of a high performance Zn-air battery. The battery achieves a high open-circuit potential (1.53 V) and peak power density (0.255 W cm–²). Moreover, the effect of N,P codoping on the conjugate carbon system and the synergistic effect between graphitic-N and P have been calculated through density functional theory calculations, which are essentially in agreement with experimental data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abatteries 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acathodes 3adensity functional theory 3aelectrochemistry 3amethanol 3ananohybrids 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3apolymerization 3asynergism 0aoxygen reduction reaction 0aN,P-codoped 0acovalent organic framework 0aZn-air battery 0aDFT calculation1 aZhao, Weinan1 aYin, Changzhi1 aWei, Liangqin1 aWu, Wenting1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8380-79041 aHu, Zhenpeng1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8469-16831 aWu, Mingbo1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0048-778X0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2017 Dec. 27, v. 9, no. 51 p.44519-44528dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b148153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01914naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003200150245012600182300001600308520064400324592002800968650001300996650001401009650001201023650001901035650002401054650002101078650001601099653001401115653003201129653002801161653002301189653003201212653003101244700002801275700001701303773010301320856008401423852000901507655001201516IND60435889720221122232458.0151020e20151102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043588972DNAL7 a10.1080/15440478.2014.9673702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStoffberg, Marguerite Ester14aThe Effect of Fabric Structural Parameters and Fiber Type on the Comfort-Related Properties of Commercial Apparel Fabrics  ap. 505-517.  aThe effect of fabric structural parameters and fiber type on the comfort-related properties, namely water vapor resistance and thermal resistance, of commercial apparel (suiting) fabrics, containing both natural and man-made fibers have been studied using a Permetest.

Resveratrol has antioxidant and antitumor effects and promotes longevity. It is used in medicine, health care products, cosmetics, and other industries. Therefore, a sustainable source for resveratrol production is required.

Ischemia and reperfusion induce neuronal damage by mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative injury, ER stress, neuronal excitotoxicity, and a neuroinflammatory response, which may lead to activation of apoptosis pathways.The aim of the current review is to discuss TTM targets that convey neuroprotection and to identify potential novel pharmacological intervention strategies for the prevention of cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury.TTM precludes I/R injury by reducing glutamate release and oxidative stress and inhibiting release of pro-inflammatory factors and thereby counteracts mitochondrial induced apoptosis, neuronal excitotoxicity, and neuroinflammation. Moreover, TTM promotes regulation of the unfolded protein response and induces SUMOylation and the production of cold shock proteins. These advantageous effects of TTM seem to depend on the clinical setting, as well as type and extent of the injury. Therefore, future aims should be to refine hypothermia management in order to optimize TTM utilization and to search for pharmacological agents mimicking the cellular effects of TTM.Bundling knowledge about TTM in the experimental, translational and clinical setting may result in better approaches for diminishing I/R damage. While application of TTM in the clinical setting has some disadvantages, targeting its putative protective pathways may be useful to prevent I/R injury and reduce neurological complications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3abrain 3acold shock proteins 3acooling 3aglutamic acid 3ahead 3ahypothermia 3aischemia 3amitochondria 3aneurons 3aneuroprotective effect 3aoxidative stress 3astroke 3asurgery 3atranslation (genetics) 3aunfolded protein response 0aTherapeutic hypothermia 0aNeuroprotection 0aIschemia and reperfusion injury 0aSumoylation 0aUnfolded protein response 0aCold shock proteins1 aKok, W.F.1 ade Veij Mestdagh, C.F.1 aShanbhag, N.C.1 aBouma, H.R.1 aHenning, R.H.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2016 Nov., v. 1860, no. 11 p.2521-2528dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11872x0304-41657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2016.07.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02355naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003500147245012200182300002000304520108500324592002801409650002301437650002401460650001201484650001501496650001701511650001701528650001301545650001401558650001601572650001401588650001701602650001301619650001501632651001301647700001901660700002701679773014901706856008101855852000901936655001201945IND60583103020221120083245.0171008e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058310302DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-016-8195-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMana, Suzanne Christine Aboudi14aThe fate and transport of arsenic species in the aquatic ecosystem: a case study on Bestari Jaya, Peninsular Malaysia  ap. 22799-22807.  aThe field of arsenic pollution research has grown rapidly in recent years. Arsenic constitutes a broad range of elements from the Earth’s crust and is released into the environment from both anthropogenic and natural sources due to its relative mobility under different redox conditions. The toxicity of arsenic is described in its inorganic form, as inorganic arsenic compounds can leach into different environments. Sampling was carried out in the Bestari Jaya catchment while using a land use map to locate the site, and experiments were conducted via sequential extraction and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy to quantify proportions of arsenic in the sediment samples. The results show that metals in sediments of nonresidual fractions, which are more likely to be likely released into aquatic environments, are more plentiful than the residual sediment fractions. These findings support the mobility of heavy metals and especially arsenic through sediment layers, which can facilitate remediation in environments heavily polluted with heavy metals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic ecosystems 3aaquatic environment 3aarsenic 3aarsenicals 3acase studies 3aheavy metals 3aland use 3apollution 3aremediation 3asediments 3aspectroscopy 3atoxicity 3awatersheds 3aMalaysia1 aNg, Tham Fatt,1 aAshraf, Muhammad Aqeel0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2017 Oct., v. 24, no. 29 p.22799-22807dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-8195-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01257naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001700138245003400155300001800189520032300207592002800530650002700558650002300585650002300608650001000631650001900641650001200660700001800672700001100690700001400701773013400715856007300849852000900922655001200931IND60658619020221119125051.0190826e20100622xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065861902DNAL7 a10.1039/c001317j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Junfei10aLiquid marble for gas sensing  ap. 4734-4736.  aThe porous and superhydrophobic shell of a liquid marble prevents contact of its liquid core with outside surfaces, but allows gas transport.

In this study, the mitigating potential of lycopene was investigated against UV-C-mediated toxicity in Allium cepa L. roots. Allium bulbs were separated into six groups which treated with tap water, 215 mg/L lycopene, 430 mg/L lycopene, 254-nm UV radiation, 215 mg/L lycopene + 254-nm UV radiation, and 430 mg/L lycopene + 254-nm UV radiation. Germination percentage, root length, weight gain, mitotic index, micronucleus frequency, and other chromosomal aberrations as well as meristematic cell damages were investigated in all groups. Malondialdehyde level and the activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase enzymes were also analyzed to understand the severity of oxidative stress. UV-C radiation was revealed to negatively affect all parameters investigated, while the mitigating activities of lycopene against UV-C-mediated toxicity were dose-dependent. Therefore, the study evidently demonstrated the promising potential of lycopene in the protection against the detrimental effects of UV-C exposure in A. cepa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllium cepa 3acatalase 3adose response 3agermination 3alycopene 3amalondialdehyde 3ameristems 3amitosis 3aoxidative stress 3apollution 3aresearch 3arisk 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atap water 3atoxicity 3aultraviolet radiation 3aweight gain1 aKalefetoğlu Macar, Tuğçe1 aMacar, Oksal1 aYalçın, Emine1 aÇavuşoğlu, Kültiğin0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 Sept., v. 28, no. 34 p.47429-47438dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-14047-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03049naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245011300174520181800287592002802105650001902133650002202152650002202174650002002196650002602216650002702242650003502269650001102304650001902315650001202334653001402346653001602360653003202376700002502408700002202433773011202455856008702567852000902654655001202663IND60654390120221118053302.0190801e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065439012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jviromet.2019.1137022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aServat, Alexandre13aAn inter-laboratory comparison to evaluate the technical performance of rabies diagnosis lateral flow assays  aAs in previous years, the European Union Reference Laboratory (EURL) for rabies organised in 2018 an Inter-laboratory trial (ILT) on rabies diagnosis. Contrarily to past years, the 2018 ILT did not aim to evaluate the performance of participating laboratories, but the technical performance of new rapid tests. Two lateral Flow Assays (LFA), namely the Anigen® and the CDIA™ Rabies Virus Antigen Rapid Test” (commercialized by Bionote and Creative Diagnostics Cie respectively), were evaluated together with the Fluorescent Antibody Test (FAT). One panel of virus samples (including RABV as well as EBLV1a, EBLV-1b, and EBLV2 strains) was sent to participating laboratories to compare results obtained with these different techniques.The study revealed that the FAT provided a good agreement toward expected results for both negative/positive samples (99.1%). The Anigen® test produced similar results to the FAT, with only one false negative result (0.5%) reported by all participants and a concordance of 100% for all but one sample demonstrating a good inter-laboratory reproducibility of the Anigen® batch. The CDIA™ test produced reproducible results for Rabies Virus (RABV) samples only. However, it hardly detected the Bokeloh Bat Lyssavirus (BBLV) and the European Bat Lyssaviruses types 1b and 2 (EBLV-1b and EBLV-2) in most laboratories resulting in a moderate inter-laboratory concordance (58.4%–82.7%) for these lyssaviruses.The two LFAs provided reliable and reproducible results on all RABV samples (100%) but lead to heterogeneous performances with other lyssaviruses leading to different levels of diagnostic/analytical sensitivity, specificity. The study confirmed that LFAs should be used with caution and that their validation are of upmost importance before any use in laboratories.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aRabies lyssavirus 3acommercialization 3adetection limit 3adiagnostic techniques 3afalse negative results 3afluorescent antibody technique 3arabies 3aviral antigens 3aviruses 0aDiagnosis 0aRapid tests 0aInter-laboratory comparison1 aRobardet, Emmanuelle1 aCliquet, Florence0 tJournal of virological methods.g2019 Oct., v. 272 p.113702-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12356x0166-09347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2019.1137023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03205naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100003000138245009900168300001800267500002000285520159500305592002801900650002301928650001701951650000901968650001001977650001601987650001002003650002002013650001202033650001402045650002002059650001802079650001402097650000902111650001902120650000902139650002302148650001302171650001002184650001402194650002102208650001702229650002202246650001402268651001002282700002302292700003602315700003102351700002402382700001802406773012202424856007202546852000902618655001202627IND60520777620221118054301.0160524e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052077762DNAL7 a10.1002/etc.33012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVallverdú‐Coll, Núria10aLead exposure reduces carotenoid‐based coloration and constitutive immunity in wild mallards  ap. 1516-1525.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe ingestion of spent lead (Pb) from ammunition is a known cause of mortality in waterfowl, but little is known about sublethal effects produced by Pb poisoning on birds, especially in wild populations. The authors studied potential sublethal effects associated with Pb exposure in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) from the Ebro delta (northeastern Spain) after a ban on Pb ammunition. They analyzed the relationships between blood Pb levels and oxidative stress, immune response, and carotenoid‐based coloration, which are known to be influenced by oxidative stress. Levels of Pb were reduced by half from 6 yr to 9 yr after the ban. Lipid peroxidation was positively related to Pb levels in females. The δ‐aminolevulinic acid dehydratase activity was suppressed by Pb exposure and negatively associated with the activity of antioxidant enzymes. Carotenoid levels were positively associated with blood Pb concentration in both sexes, and males with higher Pb levels presented a less intense coloration in legs and beak. Levels of Pb were positively related to hemolytic activity of circulating immune system components and negatively related to lysozyme levels. In summary, Pb exposure was associated in a gender‐specific way with increased oxidative stress, consequences on color expression, and impaired constitutive immunity. In females, antioxidants seemed to be allocated mostly in reproduction rather than in self‐maintenance, whereas males seemed to better maintain oxidative balance to the detriment of coloration.

Based on panel data of 280 cities in China from 2003 to 2016, this paper analyzes the dual effects of environmental regulation on PM₂.₅ pollution, namely, the direct effect and the indirect effect by three transmission channels of the technological innovation, industrial structure, and foreign direct investment (FDI). The impact of urban heterogeneity on the effects of environmental regulation is then examined. The study found that environmental regulation has a significant negative impact on PM₂.₅ pollution. In addition, environmental regulation can indirectly reduce PM₂.₅ pollution through technological innovation and industrial structure adjustment. However, it also restrains the environmental spillover effect of FDI, in this way exacerbating PM₂.₅ pollution. Urban heterogeneity factors such as geographical location, city size, and resource endowment have an impact on pollution control and the haze reduction effect of environmental regulation. Finally, based on the research conclusion, some suggestions are proposed for strengthening environmental regulation and reducing PM₂.₅ pollution.  aPublisher supplied data  a71603202cNational Natural Science Foundation of China for Young Scholars  a2019KRM129cShaanxi Soft Science Foundation  a19JZ048cShaanxi Province Education Department Philosophy and Social Science Key Institute Base Project  aShaanjiao [2019] No.90cShaanxi University Youth Innovation Team Project  a2019YA08cScientific Research Project of China (Xi’an) Institute for Silk Road Research  a105-256081503cStart up Funds for Doctoral Research in Xi'an University of Technology 3aenvironmental law 3aforeign direct investment 3apollution 3apollution control 3aresearch 3atechnology 3aChina1 aLi, Jiaxin0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 Sept., v. 28, no. 34 p.47213-47226dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-14011-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03513naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245012600166300001800292520165800310592002801968650001601996650001102012650000902023650001002032650002002042650003102062650001002093650003402103650001302137650001402150650002702164650001402191650002302205650002202228650001202250650001702262653001002279653002102289653002402310653003402334653004002368700001602408700001902424700001602443700001802459700001802477700001802495700001702513700001602530700001902546700001202565700001602577700001502593700002002608700002002628773016602648856005202814852000902866655001202875IND60773285020221120041742.0220412e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077328502DNAL7 a10.1016/S2095-3119(21)63649-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Yue,10aDissecting the genetic basis of maize deep-sowing tolerance by combining association mapping and gene expression analysis  ap. 1266-1277.  aDeep-sowing is an important method for avoiding drought stress in crop species, including maize. Identifying candidate genes is the groundwork for investigating the molecular mechanism underlying maize deep-sowing tolerance. This study evaluated four traits (mesocotyl length at 10 and 20 cm planting depths and seedling emergence rate on days 6 and 12) related to deep-sowing tolerance using a large maize population containing 386 inbred lines genotyped with 0.5 million high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The genome-wide association study detected that 273 SNPs were in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the genetic basis of maize deep-sowing tolerance. The RNA-sequencing analysis identified 1 944 and 2 098 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in two comparisons, which shared 281 DEGs. By comparing the genomic locations of the 273 SNPs with those of the 281 DEGs, we identified seven candidate genes, of which GRMZM2G119769 encoded a sucrose non-fermenting 1 kinase interactor-like protein. GRMZM2G119769 was selected as the candidate gene because its homologs in other plants were related to organ length, auxin, or light response. Candidate gene association mapping revealed that natural variations in GRMZM2G119769 were related to phenotypic variations in maize mesocotyl length. Gene expression of GRMZM2G119769 was higher in deep-sowing tolerant inbred lines. These results suggest that GRMZM2G119769 is the most likely candidate gene. This study provides information on the deep-sowing tolerance of maize germplasms and identifies candidate genes, which would be useful for further research on maize deep-sowing tolerance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3aauxins 3acorn 3acrops 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agenome-wide association study 3agenomics 3agermplasm 3alinkage disequilibrium 3aphenotype 3aseedling emergence 3asequence analysis 3asucrose 3awater stress 0amaize 0amesocotyl length 0aassociation mapping 0adifferentially expressed gene 0aSNF1 kinase interactor-like protein1 aMA, Yu-ting1 aLiu, Yangyang,1 aLYLE, Demar1 aLI, Dong-dong1 aWANG, Ping-xi1 aXU, Jia-liang1 aZHEN, Si-han1 aLU, Jia-wen1 aPENG, Yun-ling1 aCUI, Yu1 aFU, Jun-jie1 aDU, Wan-li1 aZHANG, Hong-wei1 aWang, Jian-hua,0 tJournal of integrative agriculture.g2022 May, v. 21, no. 5 p.1266-1277dElsevier B.V.aCAAS.

Due to bioaccumulation of heavy metals in the food chain, seafood may concentrate high levels of these contaminants since they are often at the top of aquatic food chain. In this study, 342 seafood samples, subdivided into four categories (bivalve molluscs, cephalopod molluscs, blue-fish and other sea fish), were analysed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, in order to assess the levels of lead, cadmium and mercury. Contamination levels higher than allowable limits were verified. In particular, two bivalve mollusc samples were non-compliant for lead and cadmium, four cephalopod mollusc samples non-compliant for cadmium and 14 samples (4 blue-fish and 10 other sea fish) non-compliant for mercury. This survey confirmed the necessity to perform routinely controls related to this type of food inspection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBivalvia 3aCephalopoda 3abioaccumulation 3acadmium 3afood chain 3afood inspection 3aheavy metals 3ahumans 3alead 3amarine fish 3amass spectrometry 3amercury 3amolluscs 3aseafoods 3asurveys 3atoxicity 3aItaly 0aheavy metals 0alead 0acadmium 0amercury 0arisk assessment 0aseafood 0abivalve molluscs 0acephalopods 0ablue-fish 0ainductively mass spectrometry 0avalidation 0amonitoring1 aIammarino, Marco1 aPompa, Ciro1 aTarallo, Marina1 aChiaravalle, Antonio Eugenio0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2015 Apr. 3, v. 8, no. 2 p.85-92dTaylor & Francisx1939-32297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19393210.2014.9892813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02504naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245008700165300002000252520139600272592002801668650001101696650001301707650001201720650003401732650002701766651001001793700001601803700001501819700001501834700001701849700001301866700001801879773015501897856008102052852000902133655001202142IND60583103520221120072904.0171008e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058310352DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-017-9922-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ruijia10aExposure of children aged 0–7 years to perfluorinated compounds in Foshan, China  ap. 23299-23308.  aTo evaluate the exposure of children to 14 perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) in a typical and representative industrial city, plasma samples from 476 children aged 0–7 years in Foshan, China, were analysed. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) were detected in 100% of the samples, accounting for 82.27 and 11.46% of the total PFC concentrations, respectively, while PFOS peaked at age 0–1 years, for which the mean and median concentrations were 113.71 and 83.65 ng/mL, respectively, while PFOA peaked at age 3–4 years, for which the mean and median concentrations were 10.68 and 6.58 ng/mL, respectively. The concentrations of PFOS, perfluorohexane sulfonate and perfluorohexanoic acid decreased with age among children aged 0–7 years, and no gender-related differences were found in the concentrations of PFCs. A high correlation was found among all PFCs, especially between PFCs of similar carbon chains (r = 0.161–0.695, p < 0.05). In addition, the concentrations of PFOS and PFOA in children’s plasma in Foshan were up to 40-fold higher than those reported in China and other countries. In conclusion, children in Foshan have extensive exposure to PFCs, especially in infancy. Further studies are needed to explore the impact of PFCs on children who live in a typical and representative industrial city in China.

The significant implications of soil loss necessitate the adoption of appropriate soil conservation practices and soil management solutions according to the regional climate. Investigation of the effects of soil cover on soil erosion process can provide the information necessary for the success of soil and water conservation practices. In this study, the effect of rock fragment and wheat straw covers on the hydraulic properties, runoff, and sediment yield were investigated in plot scale laboratory experiments using artificial rainfall. Experiments were carried out on the plots prepared based on two types of soil cover (rock fragment, wheat straw) and three coverage ratios (35%, 65%, and 90%) in addition to a control (bare soil) plot, each with three replications. In these experiments, 2 m long, 0.55 m wide, and 0.30 m deep plots with a 15% slope were subjected to artificial rainfall with a duration of 70 min and an intensity of 90 mm h⁻¹. The results showed a significant difference at the 5% level between the mean runoff rate of rock fragment cover (0.38 mm min⁻¹) and that of wheat straw cover (0.42 mm min⁻¹), but no such difference was found in terms of sediment production (Sig. = 0.73). The Wheat straw cover was more effective than rock fragment cover in increasing the Manning roughness (n) and Darcy-Weisbach friction (F) coefficients, and flow depth (h) and reducing the velocity (V), Reynolds (Re) and Froude (Fr) numbers. It was also found that, for both covers, increasing the coverage ratio increased the h, F, and n and decreased the runoff and sediment production, V, Re, and Fr. After investigating the relationship between hydraulic properties and sediment concentration in different plots, a direct linear regression relationship with a relatively high coefficient of determination (R² > 0.614) and a significant relationship at the 1% level (P < 0.01) were found between sediment concentration and discharge per unit width (q), V, h, and Re. In general, it can be concluded that rock fragment cover and wheat straw cover both have a satisfactory effect on the hydraulic properties and runoff and sediment production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aconservation practices 3afriction 3alaboratory experimentation 3arain 3aregression analysis 3aroughness 3arunoff 3asediment yield 3asediments 3asoil 3asoil conservation 3asoil erosion 3asoil management 3awater conservation 3awater resources 3awheat straw 0aWater erosion 0aOverland flow 0aPlant residue 0aCoverage 0aRainfall simulator1 aHajizadeh, Zeynab1 aGhasemieh, Hoda0 tSoil & tillage research.g2019 Nov., v. 194 p.104324-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl32961x0167-19877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2019.1043243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01495naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002000138245006000158300001800218520056000236592002800796650001400824650002300838650002700861650002300888650002300911700002500934700002000959773013300979856007201112852000901184655001201193IND60658619520221119130728.0190817e20100406xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065861952DNAL7 a10.1039/c001392g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaak, Robert M.10aCooperative multimetallic catalysis using metallosalens  ap. 2713-2723.  aMetallosalen complexes are able to catalyze several transformations via a bimetallic, cooperative pathway.

In a previous study, mutations were identified in the PRP6 ortholog in four suppressors of Fgprp4 that was deleted of the only kinase FgPrp4 among the spliceosome components in the plant pathogenic fungus Fusarium graminearum. In this study, we identified additional suppressor mutations in FgPrp6 and determined the suppressive effects of selected mutations. In total, 12 mutations of FgPRP6 were identified in 20 suppressors of Fgprp4 by sequencing analysis. Whereas three mutation sites are in the linker region of FgPrp6, seven are in the first two HAT repeats. RNA-seq analysis showed that suppressor mutations on different sites caused different splicing efficiency recovery. The suppressive effects of E308K and R230H were verified. Similar to human and fission yeast, the FgPrp6 was phosphorylated by the FgPrp4 kinase. Interestingly, the conserved Prp4-phosphorylation sites T261, T219&T221, and predicted phosphorylation sites T199&T200 on FgPrp6 were dispensable for the function of FgPrp6 in hyphal growth and sexual reproduction but important in plant infection.

The present study aimed to investigate the characteristics and dissemination of antimicrobial-resistant Salmonella within and between broiler farms that used enrofloxacin and those that did not. RESULTS: Cloacal and environmental (litter, feed, and water) samples from two selected flocks in each of 12 farms owned by the same company were collected three times over a 30-day period of two production cycles during 2015–2016. The rate of Salmonella isolation was 7.8% (123/1584). Nine Salmonella serotypes (116 isolates) and seven untypable isolates were identified, and Salmonella Montevideo was the most prevalent serotype. Azithromycin-resistant (17.9%) and colistin-resistant (3.3%) isolates were detected, and multidrug-resistant isolates (43.1%) were also observed. No isolate was resistant to enrofloxacin or ciprofloxacin; however, intermediate resistance to enrofloxacin was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in farms that used enrofloxacin than in those that did not. The rate of multi-drug resistance among litter isolates (25/44, 56.8%) was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that among cloacal swab (24/67, 35.8%) and feed (4/12, 33.3%) isolates. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis of strains of the same serotype was conducted to determine their epidemiological relationship. The PFGE types were classified into 31 groups with a 100% correlation cutoff in dendrograms for Salmonella Montevideo isolates, which showed 100% genomic identity based on age, sample type, flock, and production cycle within and between farms. CONCLUSION: The present study highlights the occurrence of horizontal transmission and cyclic contamination with antimicrobial-resistant Salmonella in broiler farms owned by the same company. Litter may be a good indicator of indoor environmental contamination with antimicrobial-resistant Salmonella on farms. Additionally, enrofloxacin use may be one of the factors promoting resistance towards it in Salmonella.  aPublisher supplied data  a716002-7, 315035-5cKorea Institute of Planning and Evaluation for Technology in Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries  aZ-1543073-2015-16-01cResearch of animal and plant Quarantine agency  a2017R1D1A1B03030883cNational Research Foundation of Korea0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSalmonella Montevideo 3aantibiotic resistance 3aciprofloxacin 3acloaca 3aenrofloxacin 3afarms 3aflocks 3afood pathogens 3agenomics 3amultiple drug resistance 3apollution 3apoultry 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3aserotypes 3aveterinary medicine1 aWei, Bai1 aKang, Min1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5650-11440 tBMC veterinary research.g2018 Dec., v. 14, no. 1 p.257-257dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4152735x1746-61487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-018-1590-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03958naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245012100168520201800289592002802307650001602335650001502351650001302366650001102379650002502390650000902415650001502424650001202439650001502451650001102466650001502477650000902492650000702501650001202508650002402520650001602544650002102560650002402581650003202605650001802637650001702655650002302672650001102695650001202706650001702718650001102735651001202746653000602758653000702764653000702771653000702778653000602785653000602791653000702797653000802804653000802812653000802820653000802828653001202836653001502848653002602863653003202889653001502921700001902936700002402955700002002979773010802999856008403107852000903191655001203200IND60654390820221118053341.0200320e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065439082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.still.2019.1043342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDekemati, Igor14aThe effects of various tillage treatments on soil physical properties, earthworm abundance and crop yield in Hungary  aHistorically, tillage has been essential for seedbed preparation and weed control, but it has also accelerated soil degradation through erosion and loss of soil organic matter (SOM). Our objective was to quantify the changes in soil physical properties and earthworm abundance under six tillage treatments on an Endocalcic Chernozem (Loamic) soil (2016 and 2017). The long-term tillage experiment was set up in 2002 with the following tillage treatments: disking 12 to 14 cm deep (D); shallow tine cultivation (18 to 20 cm) (SC); no-tillage (NT); deep tine cultivation (22 to 25 cm) (DC); loosening to a depth of 40 to 45 cm (L); moldboard ploughing to a depth of 28 to 30 cm, followed by leveling (P). Soil samples were collected in the autumn of 2015 from four depth increments (0–10, 10–20, 20–30, 30–40 cm). Soil moisture content (SMC), soil penetration resistance (SPR), soil texture, pH(H₂O), soil organic carbon (SOC), and earthworm abundance were measured. SMC and SPR were taken at 30-day intervals unless the weather prevented sampling. Earthworms were sampled in situ seven times per year by hand-sorting 25 × 25 x 30 cm soil blocks. No-tillage had a positive effect on crop yield and earthworm abundance. Compared to conventional tillage (P), SMC and SPR were improved by conservation tillage (DC, SC, D or NT). When measured during the summer months, SPR reached 6 MPa for all tillage treatments due to low SMC. Overall, NT had the highest earthworm abundance while conventional tillage (P) had the lowest. Maize (Zea mays L.) yield was highest with SC (9.32 Mg ha⁻¹), lowest with D (7.92 Mg ha⁻¹). For winter oat (Avena fatua L.), L resulted in the highest yield (5.87 Mg ha⁻¹) but required more time and energy. As weather patterns become more erratic, tillage has the potential to make crop production even riskier. Therefore, to improve both physical and biological soil properties, efforts should be made to decrease tillage intensity each year.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAvena fatua 3aChernozems 3aZea mays 3aautumn 3aconventional tillage 3acorn 3acrop yield 3adiscing 3aearthworms 3aenergy 3ano-tillage 3aoats 3apH 3aplowing 3aseedbed preparation 3asoil blocks 3asoil degradation 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil penetration resistance 3asoil sampling 3asoil texture 3asoil water content 3asummer 3aweather 3aweed control 3awinter 3aHungary 0aD 0aSC 0aNT 0aDC 0aL 0aP 0aCT 0aSMC 0aSPR 0aSOC 0aSOM 0aTillage 0aEarthworms 0aSoil moisture content 0aSoil penetration resistance 0aCrop yield1 aSimon, Barbara1 aVinogradov, Szergej1 aBirkás, Márta0 tSoil & tillage research.g2019 Nov., v. 194 p.104334-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl32961x0167-19877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2019.1043343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02171naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245013500168300001600303520119000319592002801509650002601537650001601563650001701579650001201596650001101608700001901619700001901638773011901657856008401776852000901860655001201869IND60090132420221121153256.0141102e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009013242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbapap.2012.01.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGudiño, E.D.12aA rational approach to the regioselective deacetylation of 2′,3′,5′-tri-O-acetyluridine by Novozym 435 catalysed alcoholysis  ap. 627-636.  aTo give a rational explanation for the behaviour of 2′,3′,5′-tri-O-acetyluridine (TAU) catalysed alcoholysis using Novozym 435, the commercial biocatalyst with immobilized Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB), a set of experiments analyzing the role of the alcohol/substrate (A/S) molar ratio, alcohol/biocatalyst (A/B) and substrate/biocatalyst (S/B) mass ratios were carried out. At a A/S=120 and a S/B=6.16, 2′,3′-di-O-acetyluridine (DAU) was obtained in 92% at 22h. The observed trend towards the exclusive formation of DAU at very high alcohol amounts can be explained on the basis of the change of substrate orientation from normal to inverse. The simple molecular modelling analysis supports that key O/H atoms from TAU and the resulting intermediates display the adequate distances to generate productive binding only when the inverse coordination of TAU is present through the 5′-moiety of TAU, at high ethanol concentrations. At these conditions a possible allosteric-like effect of ethanol, combined with water in an H-network in the catalytic triad and in its neighbourhood, could explain the high selectivity towards the production of DAU at selected conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudozyma antarctica 3aalcoholysis 3abiocatalysts 3aethanol 3amodels1 aIglesias, L.E.1 aFerreira, M.L.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2012 Apr., v. 1824, no. 4 p.627-636dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12097x1878-14547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbapap.2012.01.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03532naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001300188245009700201300001100298506007600309520168400385592002802069506003702097650001402134650001702148650002302165650001602188650002702204650003902231650001302270650001002283650001202293650001602305650001902321650001702340650001202357650002302369650002202392650002202414650002502436650001702461650001802478650000902496700001802505700001702523700001702540700001302557700001602570700001602586700001402602700001702616700001602633700001702649700001402666700001802680773009402698856008102792852000902873655001202882IND60548539620221207120745.0170724e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054853962DNAL7 a10.1186/s12986-016-0082-12doi7 aPMC47888652pmcid7 a269737022pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Wen14aThe effect of cholesteryl ester transfer protein on pancreatic beta cell dysfunction in mice  ap. 21.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Cholesterol accumulation causes pancreatic beta cell lipotoxicity and dysfunction. Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) plays an important role in blood lipid homeostasis. However, its role in tissue lipid metabolism remains unclear. We hypothesized that plasma CETP impact cholesterol homeostasis in the beta cells, thus damaging their functions. METHODS: The adipose tissue-specific CETP expression transgenic (aP2-CETPTg) mice, characterized by high CETP levels in the circulation, were used in this study. Pancreatic islet cholesterol and beta cell function were assessed in mice. We further measured mRNA levels of the genes involved in beta cell proliferation and differentiation, inflammation and cholesterol metabolism. TUNEL assay was applied to investigate beta cell apoptosis in islets. RESULTS: The aP2-CETPTg mice exhibited glucose intolerance, lower plasma insulin concentrations but increased insulin sensitivity compared with wild type mice. In addition, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from isolated pancreatic islets significantly decreased, and free cholesterol significantly increased. Moreover, the number and size of islets from aP2-CETPTg mice were significantly decreased. Genes involved in beta cell proliferation, such as Pdx1 and BETA2, were down-regulated; genes involved in inflammation and ER stress, such as IL-1β, CHOP, and Xbp1 were up-regulated, in line with an increase of beta cell apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma CETP causes free cholesterol accumulation in islets which could contribute to beta cell dysfunction. Thus, CETP inhibition could be a novel protective strategy for dyslipidemia related to diabetes and obese.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aapoptosis 3ablood lipids 3acell proliferation 3acholesterol 3acholesterol metabolism 3acholesteryl ester transfer protein 3adiabetes 3agenes 3aglucose 3ahomeostasis 3ahyperlipidemia 3ainflammation 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3ainsulin secretion 3ainterleukin-1beta 3aislets of Langerhans 3alipotoxicity 3amessenger RNA 3amice1 aGong, Yingyun1 aFu, Zhenzhen1 aFu, Jinxiang1 aSun, Yan1 aJu, Xianxia1 aChang, Yina1 aWang, Wen1 aZhu, Xiaohui1 aGao, Beibei1 aLiu, Xiaoyun1 aYang, Tao1 aZhou, Hongwen0 tNutrition & metabolism.g2016 Dec., v. 13, no. 1 p.21-21dBioMed Centralx1743-70757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12986-016-0082-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03494naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024003300132024001100165040001800176100002000194245009400214300001600308500000900324506017300333520160600506592002802112650001302140650000902153650002002162650002702182650001602209650002902225650001902254650002902273650001802302650002402320650000902344650002002353650000902373650001102382651001702393700001302410700001902423700002102442773013302463856011202596856008002708956015802788961000902946852000902955655001202964IND60006045320221214231432.0191122e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000604532DNAL7 a2920502aris7 a10113/604532hdl7 a10.2134/agronj2013.01082doi8 ans6694  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDell, Curtis J.10aNitrous Oxide Emissions with Enhanced Efficiency Nitrogen Fertilizers in a Rainfed System  ap. 723-731.  aepub  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aThe use of enhanced efficiency N fertilizers can increase crop N utilization and lead to lower emissions of the greenhouse gas N₂O. To determine the potential benefit of four enhanced efficiency fertilizers with rainfed corn (Zea mays L.) production in central Pennsylvania, N₂O emissions and grain yield were monitored during a 4-yr field study and compared with untreated urea prills and urea–NH₄NO₃ (UAN). The tested enhanced efficiency products were ESN (polymer-coated urea), SuperU (urease and nitrification inhibitor treated urea), UAN treated with AgrotainPlus (urease and nitrification inhibitors), and PiNT (cation-stabilized amine-N). Additionally, 28-d laboratory incubations were conducted to verify the potential differences in N cycling rates among N sources. The laboratory incubations indicated that ESN, SuperU, and treated UAN all had the potential to delay accumulation of NO₃ relative to untreated urea and UAN, but N cycling was similar with PiNT and the untreated fertilizers. Extended dry periods limited the denitrification potential and overall N₂O emissions in the field, but spikes of N₂O emission were seen within 1 mo after fertilizer application in each year. However, variation in emission rates was high within treatments, and no consistent differences among N sources were seen. Cumulative growing season N₂O emissions and grain yield were similar for all N sources in each year of the study. Enhanced efficiency fertilizers do not appear to be an effective means to reduce N₂O emission in a rainfed system, at least when rainfall is inconsistent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3acorn 3adenitrification 3afertilizer application 3agrain yield 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agrowing season 3anitrification inhibitors 3anitrous oxide 3apolymer-coated urea 3arain 3arainfed farming 3aurea 3aurease 3aPennsylvania1 aHan, Kun1 aBryant, Ray B.1 aSchmidt, John P.0 tAgronomy journal.g2014 Mar., v. 106, no. 2 p.723-731dThe American Society of Agronomy, Inc.wJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/604533Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2013.01083Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/292050%20Nitrous%20Oxide%20Emissions%20with%20Enhanced%20Efficiency%20Nitrogen.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03107naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002200166245006100188300001600249520137100265592002801636650001601664650004901680650002001729650001101749650001401760650000901774650003101783650005201814650001601866650001201882651001401894651001701908651001001925651001701935700002001952700002301972700002101995700002002016700001902036700002102055700001902076700001602095700001302111700002002124700002302144700002002167700002302187700002202210700002202232700001702254700001702271710002302288773009202311856008102403852000902484655001202493IND60119749220221120220911.0150318e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011974922DNAL7 a254138282pmid7 a10.1007/s12250-014-3507-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarasheed, Osamah10aViral respiratory infections among Hajj pilgrims in 2013  ap. 364-371.  aMiddle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has emerged in the Arabian Gulf region, with its epicentre in Saudi Arabia, the host of the ‘Hajj’ which is the world’s the largest mass gathering. Transmission of MERS-CoV at such an event could lead to its rapid worldwide dissemination. Therefore, we studied the frequency of viruses causing influenza-like illnesses (ILI) among participants in a randomised controlled trial at the Hajj 2013. We recruited 1038 pilgrims from Saudi Arabia, Australia and Qatar during the first day of Hajj and followed them closely for four days. A nasal swab was collected from each pilgrim who developed ILI. Respiratory viruses were detected using multiplex RT-PCR. ILI occurred in 112/1038 (11%) pilgrims. Their mean age was 35 years, 49 (44%) were male and 35 (31%) had received the influenza vaccine pre-Hajj. Forty two (38%) pilgrims had laboratory-confirmed viral infections; 28 (25%) rhinovirus, 5 (4%) influenza A, 2 (2%) adenovirus, 2 (2%) human coronavirus OC43/229E, 2 (2%) parainfluenza virus 3, 1 (1%) parainfluenza virus 1, and 2 (2%) dual infections. No MERS-CoV was detected in any sample. Rhinovirus was the commonest cause of ILI among Hajj pilgrims in 2013. Infection control and appropriate vaccination are necessary to prevent transmission of respiratory viruses at Hajj and other mass gatherings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterovirus 3aMiddle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus 3adisease control 3ahumans 3ainfluenza 3anose 3arandomized clinical trials 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3avaccination 3aviruses 3aAustralia 3aPersian Gulf 3aQatar 3aSaudi Arabia1 aRashid, Harunor1 aAlfelali, Mohammad1 aTashani, Mohamed1 aAzeem, Mohammad1 aBokhary, Hamid1 aKalantan, Nadeen1 aSamkari, Jamil1 aHeron, Leon1 aKok, Jen1 aTaylor, Janette1 aEl Bashir, Haitham1 aMemish, Ziad A.1 aHaworth, Elizabeth1 aHolmes, Edward C.1 aDwyer, Dominic E.1 aAsghar, Atif1 aBooy, Robert2 aHajj Research Team0 tVirologica Sinica.g2014 Dec., v. 29, no. 6 p.364-371dSpringer-Verlagx1674-07697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12250-014-3507-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02400naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245009200171300001600263520116100279592002801440650002801468650001801496650002801514650001601542650003101558650001201589650002701601650002201628653002801650653002301678653002401701653003501725653002001760700001401780700001501794773009801809856008601907852000901993655001202002IND60604491020221120150334.0180717e20151002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060449102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virusres.2015.07.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoffman, Brett10aK312 and E446 are involved in HCV RNA translation modulation by NS5A domains II and III  ap. 207-214.  aHCV NS5A plays a critical role in the HCV life cycle. We previously demonstrated that NS5A down-regulates viral translation through a mechanism requiring the polyU/UC region of the viral 3′UTR and that each of the three domains is capable of carrying out this function individually. In this study, we mapped the regions and amino acid residues within domains II and III involved in the modulation of viral translation. Using a series of deletion and amino acid substitution mutants, we found that K312 and E446 play important roles in the modulation of viral translation by NS5A domains II and III, respectively. In the context of full-length NS5A, mutations of K312 and E446 alone or in combination again abrogate translation down-regulation. In a transient replication assay using HCV subgenomic replicons, the K312A mutation alone does not affect HCV replication throughout a 96-h time course. While the E446A mutation can increase HCV replication at early time points (4–24h), the K312A and E446A double mutation can enhance viral replication at 24–96h, suggesting both residues are involved. Our results shed more light on the functions of NS5A.  aPublisher supplied data 3a3' untranslated regions 3aCoronaviridae 3aamino acid substitution 3aamino acids 3agene expression regulation 3amutants 3atranslation (genetics) 3avirus replication 0aHepatitis C virus (HCV) 0aHCV NS5A domain II 0aHCV NS5A domain III 0aHCV RNA translation modulation 0aHCV replication1 aShi, Qing1 aLiu, Qiang0 tVirus research.g2015 Oct. 02, v. 208 p.207-214dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6283x0168-17027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2015.07.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02690naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245014500170300001800315520161900333592002801952650002001980650000802000650001102008650001302019650001302032653001902045653002402064653003302088653002802121773012102149856008502270852000902355655001202364IND60549615020221120162325.0180829e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054961502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbagen.2016.08.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEckert, Juergen10aComputational study of inelastic neutron scattering vibrational spectra of water clusters and their relevance to hydration water in proteins  ap. 3564-3572.  aInelastic neutron scattering (INS) vibrational spectra for hydration water in proteins can be obtained from spectral differences, but their interpretation has mainly been limited to comparisons with various forms of ice at high hydration levels without making use of available structural information from neutron protein crystallography.The INS vibrational spectra of free and partially constrained water clusters (up to n=17) were calculated with DFT methods using published energy-minimized structures.Reference is made to neutron diffraction studies of hydrated proteins, which contain a wealth of structural information both on individual water molecules and small clusters in the inner “shell” in order to select representative clusters to serve as models for bound, rather than free clusters as they would occur in a protein.INS spectra of the water librational region calculated for a combination of model bound clusters provide a qualitative account of the essentially featureless experimental spectra on water in proteins at very low hydration levels, but do indicate that the well-known rise in intensity near 500cm⁻¹ is connected to increasing numbers of four-coordinate water molecules in larger clusters.The combination of structural information of hydration water from neutron protein crystallography with much more sophisticated computational methods than used herein should lead to a much more detailed picture of the hydration of proteins.

A previous study has identified circular RNA EDC3 (circEDC3) as a typical covalently closed circular RNA abundant in chicken skeletal muscle. This study found that circEDC3 is a conservative circular RNA and performed functional analysis to investigate the role of circEDC3 in chicken muscle growth. The results indicated that circEDC3 could inhibit (P<0.05) chicken skeletal muscle satellite cells (SMSCs) proliferation and differentiation but had no significant influence on SMSCs apoptosis. Additionally, bioinformatics analysis showed that circEDC3 had promising coding potential. The open reading frames (ORF) were found in circEDC3 in this study. Furthermore, this study predicted that circEDC3 had internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) and N⁶-methyladenosine (m⁶A) motifs in different species, implying that circEDC3 might be translatable. This study revealed that circEDC3 might be a negative regulator in chicken muscle development and suggested it has protein-coding potential in different species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3aapoptosis 3abioinformatics 3achemical bonding 3achickens 3acircular RNA 3amuscle development 3amuscles 3askeletal muscle 0acircEDC3 0achicken 0aSMSCs 0amyogenesis 0acoding potential1 aZHAO, Xi-yu1 aSHEN, Xiao-xu1 aYe, Lin,1 aZhang, Yao,1 aWang, Yan,1 aLI, Di-yan1 aZhu, Qing,1 aYIN, Hua-dong0 tJournal of integrative agriculture.g2022 May, v. 21, no. 5 p.1444-1456dElsevier B.V.aCAAS.

METHODS: Eligible adults (n = 2284) who participated in the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study were followed for a mean of 4.7 years. Dietary intake of L-arginine was assessed at baseline (2006–2008); biochemical variables were evaluated at baseline and the follow-up examination. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models adjusted for potential confounders were used to estimate the risk of CHD across tertiles of L-arginine intake. Linear regression models were also used to indicate the association of L-arginine intake with changes of serum lipids and blood pressure during the follow-up. RESULTS: Mean age of participants (42.8 % men) was 38.2 ± 13.4, at baseline. During a mean 4.7 ± 1.4 y of follow-up, 57 participants experienced CHD events. A significant negative association was observed between plant-derived L-arginine intake and changes of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, whereas animal-derived L-arginine intake was related to increased levels of diastolic blood pressure (P < 0.01). Participants in the 2ⁿᵈ tertile (1.45–1.78 g/d) had a significantly increased risk of CHD events compared to the participants in the 1ˢᵗ tertile (<1.45 g/d) (HR = 1.90, 95 % CI = 1.03–3.58). The risk of CHD had a decreasing trend across increasing plant-derived L-arginine intake (HR = 1.0, HR = 0.91, 95 % CI = 0.51–1.62, HR = 0.72, 95 % CI = 0.39–1.32, P for trend = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Higher intake of plant derived L-arginine may have a protective effect whereas animal-derived L-arginine may be a risk factor for development of hypertension and CHD events.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3aarginine 3ablood lipids 3acoronary disease 3adiastolic blood pressure 3afood intake 3aglucose 3ahypertension 3alipids 3amen 3aprotective effect 3aregression analysis 3arisk factors1 aMirmiran, Parvin1 aTahmasebinejad, Zhaleh1 aAzizi, Fereidoun0 tNutrition & metabolism.g2016 Dec., v. 13, no. 1 p.23-23dBioMed Centralx1743-70757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12986-016-0084-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01495naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245009600159300001800255520041200273592002800685650002700713650002300740650002300763650001300786650001500799650001800814650003700832700002200869700002900891700002200920773013300942856007301075852000901148655001201157IND60658620220221119124953.0190826e20100602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065862022DNAL7 a10.1039/c001488e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStrom, T.

Of all biopsies, 219 (48.8%) revealed positive results in the rapid urease test. Using the aforementioned method, 158 (35.2%) culture positive biopsy specimens were obtained.The researchers attempted to use one biopsy specimen for both rapid urease and culture tests. This method causes fewer injuries of gastric tissue and allows antimicrobial susceptibility testing and characterization in detail of the isolated organism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelicobacter pylori 3aagar 3aantibiotic resistance 3abiopsy 3aculture media 3adigestive system diseases 3aglucose 3ahealth services 3amicrobiology 3apatients 3aurease 0aBiopsy specimens 0aRapid urease test 0aGastric disorders1 aMoaddab, Yaghuob1 aSharifi, Yaeghob0 tJournal of microbiological methods.g2019 Sept., v. 164 p.105674-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6372x0167-70127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mimet.2019.1056743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02479naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001500186245011500201300001800316520112600334592002801460653002201488653004101510653003601551653001801587653001701605700001701622700001201639700001801651700001901669700001901688700001701707700001801724700002101742700002701763773019101790856007901981852000902060655001202069IND60517901720221120042206.0160406e20150804xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051790172DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.15041641122doi7 aPMC45342122pmcid7 a261994132pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, B.

The measurement of a small Fermi surface by quantum oscillations on suppression of superconductivity by high applied magnetic fields, together with complementary spectroscopic measurements in the hole underdoped copper oxide superconductors, point to a nodal electron pocket from charge order in YBa ₂Cu ₃[Formula]. Here, we report quantum oscillation measurements in the closely related stoichiometric material YBa ₂Cu ₄O ₈, which reveals similar Fermi surface properties to YBa ₂Cu ₃[Formula], despite the nonobservation of charge order signatures in the same spectroscopic techniques, such as X-ray diffraction, that revealed signatures of charge order in YBa ₂Cu ₃[Formula]. Fermi surface reconstruction in YBa ₂Cu ₄O ₈ is suggested to occur from magnetic field enhancement of charge order that is rendered fragile in zero magnetic fields because of its potential unconventional nature and/or its occurrence as a subsidiary to more robust underlying electronic correlations.  aPublisher supplied data 0asuperconductivity 0astrongly correlated electron systems 0ahigh-Tc cuprate superconductors 0aFermi surface 0acharge order1 aHarrison, N.1 aZhu, Z.1 aBalakirev, F.1 aRamshaw, B.

Despite the availability of PEDV vaccines in the domestic market, the disease continues to plague the Korean pork industry, raising issues regarding their protective efficacy and new vaccine development. Therefore, PEDV isolation in cell culture is urgently needed to develop efficacious vaccines and diagnostic assays and to conduct further studies on the virus biology. In the present study, one Korean PEDV strain, KOR/KNU-141112/2014, was successfully isolated and serially propagated in Vero cells for over 30 passages. The in vitro and in vivo characteristics of the Korean PEDV isolate were investigated. Virus production in cell culture was confirmed by cytopathology, immunofluorescence, and real-time RT-PCR. The infectious virus titers of the viruses during the first 30 passages ranged from 10⁵.¹ to 10⁸.² TCID50 per ml. The inactivated KNU-141112 virus was found to mediate potent neutralizing antibody responses in immunized guinea pigs. Animal studies showed that KNU-141112 virus causes severe diarrhea and vomiting, fecal shedding, and acute atrophic enteritis, indicating that strain KNU-141112 is highly enteropathogenic in the natural host. In addition, the entire genomes or complete S genes of KNU-141112 viruses at selected cell culture passages were sequenced to assess the genetic stability and relatedness. Our genomic analyses indicated that the Korean isolate KNU-141112 is genetically stable during the first 30 passages in cell culture and is grouped within subgroup G2b together with the recent re-emergent Korean strains.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPorcine epidemic diarrhea virus 3acell culture 3adiarrhea 3aenteritis 3afluorescent antibody technique 3agenes 3agenetic stability 3aguinea pigs 3aneutralizing antibodies 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3avaccines 3aviral load 3avomiting 3aSouth Korea 0aPorcine epidemic diarrhea virus 0aCell culture isolation 0aPathogenicity 0aGenome analysis1 aKim, Youngnam1 aLee, Changhee0 tVirus research.g2015 Oct. 02, v. 208 p.215-224dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6283x0168-17027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2015.07.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02381naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245008500187300001600272520109700288592002801385650002301413650005001436650001801486650001301504650001301517650002101530650002201551650000901573650001401582650003201596651001601628700001201644700001501656700001401671700001901685700001501704700001901719700001501738773009201753856008101845852000901926655001201935IND60119749620221120221015.0150318e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011974962DNAL7 a255476832pmid7 a10.1007/s12250-014-3530-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Zhangsheng10aCoronavirus MHV-A59 infects the lung and causes severe pneumonia in C57BL/6 mice  ap. 393-402.  aIt remains challenging to develop animal models of lung infection and severe pneumonia by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome cornavirus (MERS-CoV) without high level of containment. This inevitably hinders understanding of virushost interaction and development of appropriate countermeasures. Here we report that intranasal inoculation of sublethal doses of murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus A-59 (MHV-A59), a hepatic and neuronal tropic coronavirus, can induce acute pneumonia and severe lung injuries in C57BL/6 mice. Inflammatory leukocyte infiltrations, hemorrhages and fibrosis of alveolar walls can be observed 2–11 days after MHV-A59 infection. This pathological manifestation is associated with dramatical elevation of tissue IP-10 and IFN-γ and moderate increase of TNF-α and IL-1β, but inability of anti-viral type I interferon response. These results suggest that intranasal infection of MHV-A59 would serve as a surrogate mouse model of acute respiratory distress syndrome by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMurine coronavirus 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 3aanimal models 3adistress 3afibrosis 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-1beta 3amice 3apneumonia 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3aMiddle East1 aDu, Jun1 aChen, Gang1 aZhao, Jie1 aYang, Xuanming1 aSu, Lishan1 aCheng, Genhong1 aTang, Hong0 tVirologica Sinica.g2014 Dec., v. 29, no. 6 p.393-402dSpringer-Verlagx1674-07697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12250-014-3530-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03020naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001100152245010200163300001400265520181700279592002802096650002202124650001602146650003102162650001602193650001202209650001702221650002902238650002602267650002202293653002002315653002102335653001802356653002202374653002002396700001502416773009602431856008602527852000902613655001202622IND60604491420221120125417.0180717e20151202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060449142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virusres.2015.07.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Qi10aHBx truncation mutants differentially modulate SREBP-1a and -1c transcription and HBV replication  ap. 46-53.  aAs master transcription factors for lipogenesis, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) has two isoforms, SREBP-1a and SREBP-1c. Hepatitis B virus X (HBx) can up-regulate the transcription of both SREBP-1a and SREBP-1c. HBx is a small protein consisting of 154 amino acids. Truncated forms of HBx, often found in the tissues after HBV infection, may have a role in the pathogenesis associated with HBV infection. In this study, we examined the effects of two HBx truncation mutants, HBx aa. 1-127 and HBx aa. 43-154, on the transcription of SREBP-1a and SREBP-1c. HBx 1-127 can up-regulate SREBP-1c, but not SREBP-1a transcription, whereas HBx 43-154 can activate SREBP-1a, but not SREBP-1c transcription. We further determined the activities of two HBV enhancers after the expression of the truncated HBx proteins. HBx 1-127 and HBx 43-154 can only up-regulate HBV enhancer I or HBV enhancer II, respectively. Knocking down SREBP-1 abrogates enhancer activation by HBx proteins, suggesting a role of SREBP-1. In addition, using HBV enhancer mutants, we found that the binding sequence for AP-1 on enhancer I is essential for its activation by HBx 1-127, whereas C/EBP and Sp1 sites are required for enhancer II activation by HBx 43-154. Finally, we showed that both HBx 1-127 and HBx 43-154 can increase HBV transcription and HBV replication dependent upon SREBP-1 because knocking down SREBP-1 abrogates the up-regulation. Furthermore, upon ectopic expression of either SREBP-1a or SREBP-1c, we showed that SREBP-1a is involved in HBV transcription and replication up-regulation by HBx 43-154, whereas SREBP-1c is involved in HBV transcription and replication up-regulation by HBx 1-127. Our results should help understand the interactions between HBV and the SREBP-1-mediated lipogenic pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHepatitis B virus 3aamino acids 3agene expression regulation 3alipogenesis 3amutants 3apathogenesis 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3avirus replication 0aHBx truncations 0aSREBP-1a and -1c 0aHBV enhancers 0aHBV transcription 0aHBV replication1 aLiu, Qiang0 tVirus research.g2015 Dec. 02, v. 210 p.46-53dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6283x0168-17027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2015.07.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02635naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245012200177300001600299520135700315592002801672650000801700650002401708650001201732650002701744650002201771650002001793650001201813650001601825650001301841650001101854650001801865650001401883700001801897700001501915700002101930700001601951700001901967700001801986773010402004856008402108852000902192655001202201IND60090132920221121063556.0141102e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009013292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbapap.2012.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKushwaha, Gajraj Singh10aCrystal structures of a type-1 ribosome inactivating protein from Momordica balsamina in the bound and unbound states  ap. 679-691.  aThe ribosome inactivating proteins (RIPs) of type 1 are plant toxins that eliminate adenine base selectively from the single stranded loop of rRNA. We report six crystal structures, type 1 RIP from Momordica balsamina (A), three in complexed states with ribose (B), guanine (C) and adenine (D) and two structures of MbRIP-1 when crystallized with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (E) and 2′-deoxyadenosine triphosphate (2′-dATP) (F). These were determined at 1.67Å, 1.60Å, 2.20Å, 1.70Å, 2.07Å and 1.90Å resolutions respectively. The structures contained, (A) unbound protein molecule, (B) one protein molecule and one ribose sugar, (C) one protein molecule and one guanine base, (D) one protein molecule and one adenine base, (E) one protein molecule and one ATP-product adenine molecule and (F) one protein molecule and one 2′-dATP-product adenine molecule. Three distinct conformations of the side chain of Tyr70 were observed with (i) χ¹=−66°and χ²=165° in structures (A) and (B); (ii) χ¹=−95° and χ²=70° in structures (C), (D) and (E); and (iii) χ¹=−163° and χ²=87° in structure (F). The conformation of Tyr70 in (F) corresponds to the structure of a conformational intermediate. This is the first structure which demonstrates that the slow conversion of DNA substrates by RIPs can be trapped during crystallization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aMomordica balsamina 3aadenine 3aadenosine triphosphate 3acrystal structure 3acrystallization 3aguanine 3aphytotoxins 3aproteins 3aribose 3aribosomal RNA 3aribosomes1 aPandey, Nisha1 aSinha, Mau1 aSingh, S.

Many applications are sensitive to the radiocarbon ( ¹⁴C) content of atmospheric CO ₂, which has varied since 1890 as a result of nuclear weapons testing, fossil fuel emissions, and CO ₂ cycling between atmospheric, oceanic, and terrestrial carbon reservoirs. Over this century, the ratio ¹⁴C/C in atmospheric CO ₂ (Δ ¹⁴CO ₂) will be determined by the amount of fossil fuel combustion, which decreases Δ ¹⁴CO ₂ because fossil fuels have lost all ¹⁴C from radioactive decay. Simulations of Δ ¹⁴CO ₂ using the emission scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report, the Representative Concentration Pathways, indicate that ambitious emission reductions could sustain Δ ¹⁴CO ₂ near the preindustrial level of 0‰ through 2100, whereas “business-as-usual” emissions will reduce Δ ¹⁴CO ₂ to −250‰, equivalent to the depletion expected from over 2,000 y of radioactive decay. Given current emissions trends, fossil fuel emission-driven artificial “aging” of the atmosphere is likely to occur much faster and with a larger magnitude than previously expected. This finding has strong and as yet unrecognized implications for many applications of radiocarbon in various fields, and it implies that radiocarbon dating may no longer provide definitive ages for samples up to 2,000 y old.  aPublisher supplied data 0afossil fuel emissions 0aradiocarbon 0aatmospheric CO2 0a14C dating 0aisotope forensics0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2015 Aug. 4, v. 112, no. 31 p.9542-9545dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.15044671123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04672naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002900188245016700217300001200384506007600396520237800472592002802850596007602878596008802954596004303042596008103085596008303166596005103249506003703300650001903337650002303356650002203379650000903401650001303410650002803423650001703451650000903468650001103477650001003488650002103498650001903519650001103538650001703549650001503566650001203581650001103593650001603604650001903620650001303639650001203652651001403664700002503678700002203703700003003725700002103755700003003776773011303806856008203919852000904001655001204010IND60611337620221207133452.0191016e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061133762DNAL7 a10.1186/s13071-018-3069-02doi7 aPMC61180062pmcid7 a301658922pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCardinal, Marta Victoria10aHigh levels of human infection with Trypanosoma cruzi associated with the domestic density of infected vectors and hosts in a rural area of northeastern Argentina  ap. 492.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Insecticide spraying campaigns designed to suppress the principal vectors of the Chagas disease usually lack an active surveillance system that copes with house reinvasion. Following an insecticide campaign with no subsequent surveillance over a 12-year period, we implemented a longitudinal intervention programme including periodic surveys for Triatoma infestans, full-coverage house spraying with insecticides, and selective control in a well-defined rural area of the Argentinean Chaco inhabited by Creoles and one indigenous group (Qom). Here, we conducted a cross-sectional study and report the age-specific seroprevalence of human T. cruzi infection by group, and examine the association between human infection, the onset of the intervention, the relative density of infected domestic bugs, and the household number of infected people, dogs, or cats. RESULTS: The seroprevalence of infection among 691 residents examined was 39.8% and increased steadily with age, reaching 53–70% in those older than 20 years. The mean annual force of infection was 2.5 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 1.8–3.3%). Infection in children younger than 16 years born before the intervention programme was two to four times higher in houses with infected T. infestans than in houses without them and was six times higher when there were both infected dogs or cats and bugs than when they were absent. The model-averaged estimate of the intervention effect suggests that the odds of seropositivity were about nine times smaller for those born after the onset of the intervention than for those born before it, regardless of ethnic background, age, gender, household wealth, and cohabitation with T. cruzi-infected vectors or human hosts. Human infection was also closely associated with the baseline abundance of infected domestic triatomines and the number of infected cohabitants. Two of 43 children born after interventions were T. cruzi-seropositive; since their mothers were seropositive and both resided in apparently uninfested houses they were attributed to vertical transmission. Alternatively, these cases could be due to non-local vector-borne transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals high levels of human infection with T. cruzi in the Argentinean Chaco, and the immediate impact of sustained vector surveillance and selective control actions on transmission.  aPublisher supplied data  aPICT 2014-2661cFondo para la Investigación Científica y Tecnológica  aPIP No 11220110101146cConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas  aA70596cWorld Health Organization (CH)  a20020100100944cSecretaria de Ciencia y Tecnica, Universidad de Buenos Aires  a20020130100843BAcSecretaria de Ciencia y Tecnica, Universidad de Buenos Aires  aAvia Terai sin ChagascFundación Bunge y Born0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aChagas disease 3aTriatoma infestans 3aTrypanosoma cruzi 3acats 3achildren 3across-sectional studies 3adog diseases 3adogs 3agender 3ahosts 3ahousehold income 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3ainsecticides 3amonitoring 3amothers 3apeople 3arural areas 3aseroprevalence 3aspraying 3asurveys 3aArgentina1 aSartor, Paula Andrea1 aGaspe, María Sol1 aEnriquez, Gustavo Fabián1 aColaianni, Ivana1 aGürtler, Ricardo Esteban0 tParasites & vectors.g2018 Dec., v. 11, no. 1 p.492-492dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-018-3069-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02069naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245011700172300001600289520094700305592002801252650002601280650001701306650002501323650001401348650001601362650001101378650002101389650001101410650001701421650002201438700002201460773014101482856008701623852000901710655001201719IND60595238820221117232645.0200511e20070101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059523882DNAL7 a10.1080/14620316.2007.115122072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFoley, Shawn L.10aInfluence of in vitro and ex vitro propagation on anthocyanin content and anti-oxidant activity of lingonberries  ap. 114-118.  aThe fruit yields, anthocyanin contents and anti-oxidant activities of lingonberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea L.) cultivars ‘Splendor’ and ‘Erntedank’ were studied after being propagated either by conventional softwood cuttings (SC) or by in vitro adventitious shoot regeneration from excised leaves of micropropagated shoots (TC). A significant interaction between propagation method and cultivar was observed for berry anti-oxidant activity. After 4 years of growth, the TC plants produced berries with more anti-oxidant activity, although berry diameter, number and yield per plant were higher in SC plants. The three dominant lingonberry anthocyanins (cyanidin-3-galactoside, cyanidin-3-glucoside and cyanidin-3-arabinoside) were not affected by propagation method. ‘Erntedank’ out-yielded ‘Splendor’ for berry production, and produced more, but smaller berries with a higher anti-oxidant activity than those of ‘Splendor’.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVaccinium vitis-idaea 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3acultivars 3afruit yield 3aleaves 3amicropropagation 3ashoots 3asmall fruits 3asoftwood cuttings1 aDebnath, Samir C.0 tJournal of horticultural science & biotechnology.g2007 Jan. 1, v. 82, no. 1 p.114-118dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12181x2380-40847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14620316.2007.115122073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02742naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245013800165300001600303520099100319592002801310650001301338650001001351650001201361650002801373650001801401650001701419650002301436650001801459650002101477650002101498650000901519650002201528653001101550653001001561653002401571653001701595653001201612653002501624653002601649653002501675653001101700653000701711653000801718653000801726700002201734700002001756700001901776700002201795700002101817700002201838700002201860700001901882773014701901856008302048852000902131655001202140IND60531574320221118180548.0181120e20160909xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053157432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.07.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKunath, Anne10aRepin1 deficiency improves insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism in db/db mice by reducing adipose tissue mass and inflammation  ap. 398-402.  aReplication initiator 1 (Repin1) is a zinc finger protein playing a role in insulin sensitivity, body fat mass and lipid metabolism by regulating the expression key genes of glucose and lipid metabolism. Here, we tested the hypothesis that introgression of a Repin1 deletion into db/db mice improves glucose metabolism in vivo. We generated a whole body Repin1 deficient db/db double knockout mouse (Rep1⁻/⁻x db/db) and systematically characterized the consequences of Repin1 deficiency on insulin sensitivity, glucose and lipid metabolism parameters and fat mass. Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies revealed significantly improved insulin sensitivity in Rep1⁻/⁻x db/db mice, which are also characterized by lower HbA1c, lower body fat mass and reduced adipose tissue (AT) inflammation area. Our study provides evidence that loss of Repin1 in db/db mice improves insulin sensitivity and reduces chronic hyperglycemia most likely by reducing fat mass and AT inflammation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody fat 3agenes 3aglucose 3aglucose clamp technique 3ahyperglycemia 3ainflammation 3ainsulin resistance 3aintrogression 3aknockout mutants 3alipid metabolism 3amice 3azinc finger motif 0aRepin1 0aRip60 0aInsulin sensitivity 0aDyslipidemia 0aObesity 0aHypertriglyceridemia 0aDb/db, adipose tissue 0aCrown like structure 0aRepin1 0aAT 0aGIR 0aCLS1 aHesselbarth, Nico1 aGericke, Martin1 aKern, Matthias1 aDommel, Sebastian1 aKovács, Péter,1 aStumvoll, Michael1 aBlüher, Matthias1 aKlöting, Nora0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2016 Sept. 09, v. 478, no. 1 p.398-402dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.07.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02540naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012500166300001600291520143200307592002801739650002001767650001701787650001201804650001901816650001401835650001201849650001301861650001101874650001601885650001901901700001701920700002001937700002701957773009201984856008102076852000902157655001202166IND60121009520221121033515.0150213e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012100952DNAL7 a10.1007/s10337-014-2655-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBacalum, Elena10aRetention Behavior of Some Compounds Containing Polar Functional Groups on Perfluorophenyl Silica-Based Stationary Phase  ap. 543-552.  aA retention study on perfluorophenyl silica-based stationary phase was undertaken for some organic compounds containing different polar functionalities. The dependence of the retention factor on the content of organic modifier (acetonitrile, or methanol) in mobile phase was fitted by polynomial equations. The only exception was observed for adenine, which showed a sigmoidal dependence for the retention factor versus organic modifier content. The extrapolated values of retention factor for water as mobile phase (log kw) from these dependences were well correlated with octanol–water partition constants (log Kₒw), excepting the values for hexachlorocyclohexane isomers and adenine. Temperature dependences of the retention factor obeyed the van’t Hoff equation with thermodynamic parameters similar to those obtained in reversed phase on C8 or C18 stationary phases, excepting two statines whose dependences of ln k on the reciprocal value of absolute column temperature were nonlinear. Again, adenine had an atypical behavior with decrease in the retention factor with the increase in column temperature, due to possible tautomeric equilibria of this compound in presence of water, in accordance with theoretical models reported by literature. Charge modeling with MarvinSketch package program revealed charged centers from analyte molecule that could interact differently with charge centers from stationary phase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHCH (pesticide) 3aacetonitrile 3aadenine 3achromatography 3aequations 3aisomers 3amethanol 3amodels 3atemperature 3athermodynamics1 aGalaon, Toma1 aDavid, Víctor,1 aAboul-Enein, Hassan Y.0 tChromatographia.g2014 Apr., v. 77, no. 7-8 p.543-552dSpringer-Verlagx0009-58937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10337-014-2655-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02743naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245010300163300001800266520175100284592002802035650001402063650001202077650002102089650001702110650001402127650003702141650001602178650001402194700002802208773009102236856008102327852000902408655001202417IND60516489320221116203234.0160604e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051648932DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-016-0862-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Dezhi10aMorphological changes of sterically stabilized nanocrystalline cellulose after periodate oxidation  ap. 1051-1059.  aPeriodate oxidation breaks the C2–C3 bond in the glucose repeat units of cellulose, forming two vicinal aldehyde groups. When the cellulose is partially oxidized, three products were generated after periodate oxidation: fibrous cellulose, sterically stabilized nanocrystalline cellulose (SNCC) and dialdehyde modified cellulose. Thus, by periodate oxidation alone, we can produce nanocellulose. SNCCs were produced after 26, 42 and 84 h periodate oxidation. Their morphologies were examined by transmission electron microscopy, which show that the three SNCCs have similar diameters (5–10 nm). In contrast, the average length of SNCC decreases with aldehyde content: from approximately 590 nm after 26 h of oxidation to 100 nm for an oxidation period of 84 h. It indicates that the morphology of SNCC can be well controlled by the degree of periodate oxidation, which depends on the amount of periodate and the reaction time. Equivalent spherical diameters of SNCCs were also examined by dynamic light scattering, and the results correspond closely to the ones observed by TEM. The viscosities of SNCCs were measured by an Ubbelohde viscometer and compared with theory. Because the length of SNCC particles gradually reduces while their diameters remain almost the same, we propose that periodate reacts preferentially with the amorphous region of cellulose. After most of the amorphous regions have reacted, the reaction proceeds at the boundary of amorphous and crystalline regions, creating a reaction front that advances towards the crystalline regions, thus continually shortening them. Dynamic light scattering experiments on SNCC suspensions when adding cosolvents into them proved that SNCCs were sterically stabilized in water.  aPublisher supplied data 3acellulose 3aglucose 3alight scattering 3ananocrystals 3aoxidation 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aviscometers 3aviscosity1 aVan de Ven, Theo G.

As a case study, wood samples with a dimension of 2 mm × 2 mm × 20 mm were cut from a board of welded beech (Fagus sylvatica L.). The spatial resolution of the X-ray scan was 500 nm. Densitometry results showed that welding was accompanied by a considerable increase in the bulk density and a decrease in the cell-wall density at the weld-line. The cell-wall density in the weld-line was almost 33% less than that of the unaffected wood. As an additional application of nano computed tomography, the 3D imaging also revealed details of the internal structure of the welded sample. This study showed that nano-CT is a powerful tool for the descriptive and quantitative study of welded wood.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus sylvatica 3aX-radiation 3abulk density 3acase studies 3acomputed tomography 3adensitometry 3aengineering 3aimage analysis 3ajoints (wood) 3amaterials science 3awood 0aCell wall 0adensity 0aFagus sylvatica L 0afriction welding1 aPlessis, Anton Du1 aSandberg, Dick1 aBerg, Sven0 tWood material science and engineering.g2015 Oct. 2, v. 10, no. 4 p.368-372dTaylor & Francisx1748-02807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17480272.2015.10624183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02092naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147245005300178300001600231500001900247520082600266592002801092650001801120650001901138650002701157650001501184650001101199650001501210650001101225653001001236653000901246653001901255653001901274653001401293653000901307653001101316653001901327653001901346700002301365773018001388856008101568852000901649655001201658IND60697885220221119215259.0200607e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069788522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ram.2018.09.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaymond Eder, María Laura10aYeast diversity in Vitis non-vinifera ecosystems  ap. 278-283.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe surface of grapes lodges a complex community of yeast species responsible for spontaneous alcoholic fermentation. The study of indigenous Saccharomyces and “non-Saccharomyces” yeasts during grape must fermentation constitutes a major research area in microbial enology. Although there are detailed studies on the microbiota of Vitis vinifera L. grapes, little is known about the diversity of yeast communities present in non-vinifera Vitis ecosystems (i.e., grapes and spontaneously fermenting grape musts). Potentially scientific and/or enological valuable yeast strains from these non-vinifera Vitis ecosystems might never be isolated from V. vinifera L.

B. campestris ssp. chinensis) was analysed by cDNA-AFLP. Four cDNA fragments, including BcMF-A17T14, were obtained from flower buds of the fertile B line. In this paper, on the basis of BcMF-A17T14, a spliced full-length cDNA designated BcMF4 was generated by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) from flower buds of the fertile B line of Chinese cabbage-pak-choi. The complete nucleotide sequence of the cDNA of BcMF4 was then amplified only from flower buds of the fertile B line. BcMF4 was expressed specifically in tetrads and uni-nucleate pollen of the fertile B line. The 1,102 bp DNA sequence of BcMF4 contains a single 95 bp intron and two exons. Its largest open reading frame (999 nt) encodes a polypeptide of 332 amino acids. The putative BcMF4 protein contains a signal peptide and displays five possible N-glycosylation sites, which are typical structures found in polygalacturonase inhibiting proteins (PGIPs). It also has eight Leucine-Rich Repeat (LRR) regions, and has 69 – 90% identity to PGIPs from other plants. Functional interruption of its ortholog in Arabidopsis thaliana, using an RNAi vector, resulted in aborted pollen grains and decreased pollen germination, and the abnormal pollen phenotype was stably inherited. This study suggests that the product of BcMF4 plays an important role in the development of microspores or pollen.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aBrassica rapa subsp. chinensis 3aRNA interference 3abuds 3acomplementary DNA 3adevelopmental stages 3aexons 3agene expression 3aglycosylation 3aintrons 3amale sterility 3amicrospores 3aopen reading frames 3aphenotype 3apollen 3apollen germination 3apolygalacturonase 3apolypeptides 3aproteins 3arapid amplification of cDNA ends 3asignal peptide1 aWang, Yongqin1 aZhang, Tao1 aHuang, Li,1 aXiang, Xun1 aCao, Jiashu0 tJournal of horticultural science & biotechnology.g2007 Jan. 1, v. 82, no. 1 p.133-139dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12181x2380-40847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14620316.2007.115122103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01963naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245007100171300001600242500001900258520066700277592002800944650001700972650002300989650001101012650001701023650002001040653002201060653002301082653002601105653002301131700002001154700002201174700002201196700001901218700002501237700002201262773017901284856008101463852000901544655001201553IND60697885420221119215504.0200607e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069788542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ram.2018.09.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarrera, Viviana A.10aCarbon-substrate utilization profiles by Cladorrhinum (Ascomycota)  ap. 302-306.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFungi from the genus Cladorrhinum (Ascomycota) are promising agents in the biocontrol of phytopathogens, in the promotion of plant growth, and in the production of enzymes with technological application.

It is mainly grown on the marginal areas where, terminal drought stress is one of the serious threats to its productivity. For defining the appropriate selection criteria for screening drought tolerant chickpea genotypes, present study was conducted. Distinct chickpea germplasm was collected from different pulses breeding institutes of Pakistan and evaluated for drought tolerance at germination and early seedling stages, furthermore, at late vegetative growth stages physiochemical traits and multi-environment yield performance were also tested. RESULTS: Chickpea genotypes under different environments, were significantly varied for different seedling traits, physio-chemical attributes and seed yield. Genotypes showing drought tolerance by performing better at an early seedling stages were not correspondingly high yielding. Screening for drought tolerance on seed yield basis is the most appropriate trait to develop the drought tolerant as well as high yielding chickpea genotypes. Results confirmed that traits of early growth stages were not reflecting the drought tolerance at terminal growth stages and also did not confer high yielding. NIAB-rain fed environment proved ideal in nature to screen the chickpea genotypes whereas, NIAB-lysimeter and Kalur Kot was least effective for selecting genotypes with high seed yield. Genotypes D0091–10, K010–10, D0085–10, K005–10, D0078–10, 08AG016, 08AG004, D0080–10, 09AG002, K002–10 and D0099–10 were high yielding and drought tolerant based on their performance across multiple hotspot environments. CONCLUSIONS: The selected genotypes are intended for further evaluation for varietal approval to recommend for general cultivation on farmer fields in drought hit areas of Pakistan. Among physio-biochemical traits, higher proline, glycine betain, RWC and CMS were reflecting the higher capability to tolerate the drought stress in chickpea. Drought sensitive genotypes (K0037–10, 2204, K0052–10, 09AG015, K0042–10, CM709/06, K0068–10, K004–10, K0026–10 and K0063–10) were also identified in present study which were resourceful asset for using as contrasting parents in hybridization programs. To our knowledge, this is first report using an integrated approach involving, physio-biochemical indices, and multi-environmental yield trials, for comparison, screening and selection of chickpea genotypes for drought tolerance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aassets 3achickpeas 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3afarmers 3agermination 3agermplasm 3ahybridization 3aproline 3aseed yield 3aseedlings 3avegetative growth 3awater stress 3aPakistan1 aImran, Muhammad1 aAtta, Babar Manzoor1 aAshraf, M.

(huckleberry) is widespread in West, East and Central Africa, where it constitutes one of the most important leafy vegetables. However, the salinity tolerance of this crop has not yet been assessed. The objective of this study was to assess the response of huckleberry to salinity stress in comparison with eggplant (S. melongena L.). Four-week-old seedlings of both species were subjected to two levels of salinity stress, 50 mM and 150 mM sodium chloride (NaCl), for 14 d. Leaf water potential of both species decreased with increasing salinity stress. This decrease was lower in huckleberry than in eggplant. Total dry weight and total leaf area were also decreased by salinity, and the reductions of total dry weight and total leaf area under the 50 mM treatment compared with the control were 25 and 18% in huckleberry, while they were 47 and 55% in eggplant, respectively. The increases in leaf sodium (Na) accumulation in the 50 and 150 mM treatments compared with the control were 65 and 66% for eggplant and 18 and 36% for huckleberry, respectively. Na accumulation in stem and root in huckleberry was higher than that of leaf, whereas it was the reverse in eggplant under both salinity treatments. Huckleberry accumulated less Na in the leaves than eggplant, suggesting that huckleberry might reduce the transport of Na to its leaves more effectively than eggplant. The decrease of potassium (K) accumulation and the increase of Na in leaves by salinity resulted in a higher Na/K ratio in leaves, but this trend was greater in eggplant than in huckleberry. The calcium (Ca) concentration in leaves of huckleberry was also increased by salinity, whereas that of eggplant was decreased. These results indicate that huckleberry is more tolerant to salinity than eggplant, and less decrease in leaf area associated with lower leaf Na and increased Ca concentrations may be important in enhancing quality and sustaining productivity of the crop under this stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum scabrum 3acalcium 3aeggplants 3agreen leafy vegetables 3aleaf area 3aleaf water potential 3aleaves 3apotassium 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3aseedlings 3asodium 3asodium chloride 3aCentral Africa 0aeggplant 0ahuckleberry 0aNa accumulation 0asalinity1 aUeda, Akihiro1 aSaneoka, Hirofumi0 tSoil science and plant nutrition.g2013 Dec. 1, v. 59, no. 6 p.912-920dTaylor & Francisx1747-07657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00380768.2013.8583003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03671naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245016400169500002200333500002200355520229000377592002802667650003502695650002202730650001102752650001502763650001902778650000902797650000902806650001702815650001302832650001502845651001002860700001602870700002502886700001802911700002302929773021602952856008403168852000903252655001203261IND60557708520221121124639.0181029s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055770852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.iswcr.2016.09.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSar, Nityananda10aRETRACTION: Coupling of analytical hierarchy process and frequency ratio based spatial prediction of soil erosion susceptibility in Keleghai river basin, India  aPre-press version  aPre-press version  aSoil erosion susceptibility maps can be an essential tool for erosion prone areas as they explain and display the distribution of risk and areas likely to be affected to different magnitudes. Therefore, it is very useful to planners and policy makers initiating remedial measures and for prioritizing areas. In this study, thematic data layers of sixteen soil erosion conditioning factors were integrated to prepare a soil erosion susceptibility map using analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and a frequency ratio (FR) model incorporating remote sensing (RS) and geographical information system (GIS) techniques. The analytical hierarchy process (AHP) was used to derive the preference scale factor rating values (Ri) and prioritized vector weights (Wi) for all the soil erosion conditioning factors considered in the study. Using the frequency ratio (FR) model, the spatial associations between soil erosion location and each of the factors contributing to soil erosion occurrence were derived and FR values (0–0.99) for each layer are normalized. The integration between (Ri) and (Wi) and normalized FR values (0–0.99) were made in weighted linear combination model (WLSM) and linear sum model (LSM) on a GIS platform to estimate the soil erosion susceptibility value (SESV) for each pixel and a suitable classification technique was incorporated to prepare the soil erosion susceptibility map (SESM) of the Keleghai river basin. In this study, multicolinearities among the sixteen conditioning factors were identified using the variance inflation factors (VIF) and tolerances. The result shows that there is no colinearity among the sixteen conditioning factors in this study. For verification and accuracy purposes, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve, area under the curve and kappa index of agreement was used. The results depicted that in general, a high to severe susceptibility condition of soil erosion was found in the study area and the proposed approach was also able to identify the areas under high and severe susceptibility that require urgent intervention on a priority basis. Based on this study, comprehensive erosion susceptibility management strategies were anticipated for the efficient management of present and future erosion disaster in the area.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageographic information systems 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3aprediction 3aremote sensing 3arisk 3asoil 3asoil erosion 3avariance 3awatersheds 3aIndia1 aKhan, Ansar1 aChatterjee, Soumendu1 aDas, Arosikha1 aMipun, Bijay Singh0 tInternational soil and water conservation research.g2016, dElsevier B.V.aInternational Research and Training Center on Erosion and Sedimentation and China Water and Power PresswJournal:23246x2095-63397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.iswcr.2016.09.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03172naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245016700169300001600336500001900352520158400371592002801955650001301983650001001996650002802006650002002034650002602054650002402080650001302104650001402117650001802131650001902149650001202168651001402180653001902194653001302213653002302226653001502249653001702264653001302281653001702294653001502311700002402326700002302350700002402373773017902397856008102576852000902657655001202666IND60697885520221119215330.0200607e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069788552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ram.2018.10.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorda, Marcelo A.10aHallazgo del virus linfotrópico T humano 1 (HTLV-1) subtipo Cosmopolita subgrupo Transcontinental (Aa) y del HTLV-2 subtipo b en donantes de sangre de Corrientes  ap. 307-315.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA molecular epidemiological study was conducted in a population of 9422 blood donors in the province of Corrientes, Northeastern Argentina, to determine the prevalence of Human T-cell lymphotropic virus types 1 and 2 (HTLV-1/2), the phylogenetic identification of HTLV-1 and 2 subtypes/subgroups and perform a mutation analysis. Based on the results obtained, it was shown that both HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 are circulating in a low-risk population of Corrientes, although with a similar prevalence to that of non-endemic areas. Phylogenetic studies identified the HTLV-1 Cosmopolitan subtype Transcontinental subgroup (Aa), and the HTLV-2 subtype b. Infected donors reported neither a history of risk factors such as transfusions, intravenous drug use, nor risky or HTLV-1/2 seropositive sexual partners. These results suggest that these viruses were transmitted from mother to child, possibly from generation to generation, and that these strains were introduced into the Caucasian population of this region from ancestors originating from endemic areas of the country either from or through contact with individuals from other countries years ago. Our results demonstrate for the first time the presence of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 in the province of Corrientes. Moreover, although the province can be considered a non-endemic area, the need to include these retroviruses in a national Public Health program is highlighted, in order to have qualified professionals duly trained to make their diagnosis and provide the necessary information in relation to primary care and patient follow-up.  aPublisher supplied data 3achildren 3adrugs 3aepidemiological studies 3ahealth programs 3aintravenous injection 3amutational analysis 3apatients 3aphylogeny 3apublic health 3aseroprevalence 3aviruses 3aArgentina 0aEpidemiología 0aHTLV-1/2 0aDonantes de sangre 0aCorrientes 0aEpidemiology 0aHTLV-1/2 0aBlood donors 0aCorrientes1 aSvibel, Graciela R.1 aBiglione, Mirna M.1 aBerini, Carolina A.0 tRevista argentina microbiología.g2019 Oct.,  Dec., v. 51, no. 4 p.307-315dElsevier España, S.L.U.aAsociación Argentina de MicrobiologíawJournal:23426x0325-75417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ram.2018.10.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02513naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245007700168300001600245500002000261520136700281592002801648650002201676650001401698650001301712650001701725650001401742650001701756650002301773650001201796650001601808650001101824650001501835700002101850700001501871700001601886773011501902852000902017856008902026655001202115IND2330533220221118090221.0210417e200212  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233053322DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1469-8137.2002.00534.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNilsson, M.10aColonization of roots of rice (Oryza sativa) by symbiotic Nostoc strains  ap. 517-525.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a• The lack of nitrogen in agriculture, and negative environmental effects of fertilizers, have stimulated interest in creating artificial associations between N₂‐fixing cyanobacteria and rice (Oryza sativa). • For the first time, numerous (57) Nostoc isolates from natural symbioses were screened for their ability to associate with rice. Successful colonizers were tested for N₂‐fixation by acetylene reduction, and for their ability to adsorb to roots by chlorophyll a measurements. Paranodules were induced by 2,4‐dichlorophenoxyacetic acid. And genetic fingerprints of the cyanobacteria were obtained for identification. Ultrastructural investigations were made by light and scanning electron microscopy. • Twenty‐one symbiotic Nostoc isolates associated with rice roots, colonizing surfaces and intercellular spaces. Adsorption was high and appeared biphasic. The rates of N₂ fixation by associated cyanobacteria were higher compared with those in free‐living cyanobacteria. Paranodules were formed and colonized, but root growth was adversely affected. • Under laboratory conditions, artificial associations were created between one‐third of the screened symbiotic cyanobacteria and rice. The agricultural potential for the association appears high since the cyanobacteria adsorb tightly and fix more N₂ than when free‐living.  aPublisher supplied data 3anitrogen fixation 3asymbiosis 3anitrogen 3aOryza sativa 3asymbionts 3aroot nodules 3aDNA fingerprinting 3astrains 3achlorophyll 3aNostoc 3aadsorption1 aBhattacharya, J.1 aRai, A.

In the present study, we examine in detail the landscape of tRFs in bovine milk exosomes to provide a molecular basis for understanding these functional components of bovine milk. Total RNA was isolated from exosomes in bovine colostrum and mature milk. High-throughput RNA sequencing was used to characterize the profiles of the tRFs. A total of 602 distinct tRFs were identified from milk exosomes, most of which were expressed either specifically in colostrum or in mature milk exosomes. The tRF profiles of colostrum and mature milk exosomes differed significantly. The target genes of the differentially expressed tRFs were predicted and analyzed. The target mRNAs of the downregulated tRFs were enriched in the cAMP signaling pathway, whereas those of the upregulated tRFs were enriched in the insulin and FoxO signaling pathways. Preliminary research shows that tRF-Gly-CCC-026 inhibits the translation of IL7R by directly targeting its 3′-UTR. As RNAs in milk exosomes can be absorbed and function in recipient cells, these RNAs might act as novel regulatory nutrients for infant and adult consumers, which is a possibility that needs further study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3acow colostrum 3adigestive tract 3aexosomes 3afood composition 3ainsulin 3alandscapes 3amammals 3amilk 0atRFs 0aMilk exosome 0aIL7R1 aZhang, Yanhua,1 aKong, LingHao1 aSong, ChengChuang1 aChen, Xi1 aFang, XingTang1 aZhang, Chunlei,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1545-32350 tJournal of food composition and analysis.g2021 Sept., v. 102 p.103948-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl42192x0889-15757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfca.2021.1039483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02330naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245019000171300001600361520110200377592002801479650000801507650001101515650001901526650001501545651001101560653000901571653002901580653001201609653001201621653000901633700001801642700002201660700001601682700001601698700002001714773010401734856008501838852000901923655001201932IND60113371320221119235226.0160903e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011337132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvrad.2013.06.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConnan, Olivier10aComparison of RIMPUFF, HYSPLIT, ADMS atmospheric dispersion model outputs, using emergency response procedures, with 85Kr measurements made in the vicinity of nuclear reprocessing plant  ap. 266-277.  aThe Institut de Radioprotection et de Sureté Nucléaire (IRSN) performed a series of 85Kr air sampling campaigns at mesoscale distances (18–50 km) from the AREVA NC La Hague nuclear reprocessing plant (North West France) between 2007 and 2009. The samples were collected in order to test and optimise a technique to measure low krypton-85 (85Kr) air concentrations and to investigate the performance of three atmospheric dispersion models (RIMPUFF, HYSPLIT, and ADMS),This paper presents the 85Kr air concentrations measured at three sampling locations which varied from 2 to 8000 Bq m−3, along with the 85Kr air concentrations output by the dispersion models. The dispersion models made reasonable estimates of the mean concentrations of 85Kr field measurements during steady wind conditions. In contrast, the models failed to accurately predict peaks in 85Kr air concentration during periods of rapid and large changes in wind speed and/or wind direction. At distances where we made the comparisons (18–50 km), in all cases, the models underestimated the air concentration activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3amodels 3awind direction 3awind speed 3aFrance 0a85Kr 0aExperimental measurement 0aRIMPUFF 0aHYSPLIT 0aADMS1 aSmith, Kilian1 aOrgano, Catherine1 aSolier, Luc1 aMaro, Denis1 aHebert, Didier,0 tJournal of environmental radioactivity.g2013 Oct., v. 124 p.266-277dElsevier Ltdx0265-931X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvrad.2013.06.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02795naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003900113040001800152100002000170245010500190300001600295520092400311592002801235650002301263650001401286650002401300650001101324650001901335650000701354650002201361650001801383650002001401650001301421650001801434650001301452650001501465650001601480650003401496650002201530650003101552650001701583650002401600650002601624650002201650650004001672650003101712650003101743650002001774650005501794653001801849653001201867653002301879653001801902653001401920653001401934700002301948773010401971856008502075852000902160655001202169IND60113371420221119235303.0160903e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011337142DNAL7 a238719682pmid7 a10.1016/j.jenvrad.2013.06.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHormann, Volker10aEstimating the distribution of radionuclides in agricultural soils – Dependence on soil parameters  ap. 278-286.  aIn this study it is shown how radionuclide distributions in agricultural soils and their dependence on soil parameters can be quantitatively estimated. The most important sorption and speciation processes have been implemented into a numerical model using the geochemical code PHREEQC that is able to include specific soil and soil solution compositions. Using this model, distribution coefficients (Kd values) for the elements Cs, Ni, U and Se have been calculated for two different soil types. Furthermore, the dependencies of these Kd values on various soil parameters (e.g. pH value or organic matter content) have been evaluated. It is shown that for each element, an individual set of soil parameters is relevant for its solid–liquid distribution. The model may be used for the calculation of input parameters used by reference biosphere models (e.g. used for the risk assessment of nuclear waste repositories).  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural soils 3abiosphere 3amathematical models 3anickel 3aorganic matter 3apH 3aradioactive waste 3aradionuclides 3arisk assessment 3aselenium 3asoil solution 3asorption 2aAdsorption 2aAgriculture 2aAluminum Silicatesxchemistry 2aCarbonxchemistry 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aIon Exchange 2aModels, Theoretical 2aOsmolar Concentration 2aOxidesxchemistry 2aRadioisotopesxanalysisxchemistry. 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSilicon Dioxidexchemistry 2aSoilxchemistry 2aSoil Pollutants, Radioactivexanalysisxchemistry. 0aRadionuclides 0aPHREEQC 0aAgricultural soils 0aNuclear waste 0aKd values 0aModelling1 aFischer, Helmut W.0 tJournal of environmental radioactivity.g2013 Oct., v. 124 p.278-286dElsevier Ltdx0265-931X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvrad.2013.06.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03604naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245011600168300001200284520224200296592002802538650002802566650001802594650001202612650001502624650003102639650001002670650002002680650003402700650001702734650002302751650001602774650001902790650002202809650002102831650002602852650002002878700002502898700002502923773010502948856008303053961001303136852000903149655001203158IND60712510320221117155752.0210921e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071251032DNAL7 a10.1186/s12870-020-02341-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartin, Ruth C.10aTranscriptome analysis of responses in Brachypodium distachyon overexpressing the BdbZIP26 transcription factor  ap. 174.  aBACKGROUND: Biotic and abiotic stresses are the major cause of reduced growth, persistence, and yield in agriculture. Over the past decade, RNA-Sequencing and the use of transgenics with altered expression of stress related genes have been utilized to gain a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms leading to salt tolerance in a variety of species. Identification of transcription factors that, when overexpressed in plants, improve multiple stress tolerance may be valuable for crop improvement, but sometimes overexpression leads to deleterious effects during normal plant growth. RESULTS: Brachypodium constitutively expressing the BdbZIP26:GFP gene showed reduced stature compared to wild type plants (WT). RNA-Seq analysis comparing WT and bZIP26 transgenic plants revealed 7772 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Of these DEGs, 987 of the DEGs were differentially expressed in all three transgenic lines. Many of these DEGs are similar to those often observed in response to abiotic and biotic stress, including signaling proteins such as kinases/phosphatases, calcium/calmodulin related proteins, oxidases/reductases, hormone production and signaling, transcription factors, as well as disease responsive proteins. Interestingly, there were many DEGs associated with protein turnover including ubiquitin-related proteins, F-Box and U-box related proteins, membrane proteins, and ribosomal synthesis proteins. Transgenic and control plants were exposed to salinity stress. Many of the DEGs between the WT and transgenic lines under control conditions were also found to be differentially expressed in WT in response to salinity stress. This suggests that the over-expression of the transcription factor is placing the plant in a state of stress, which may contribute to the plants diminished stature. CONCLUSION: The constitutive expression of BdbZIP26:GFP had an overall negative effect on plant growth and resulted in stunted plants compared to WT plants under control conditions, and a similar response to WT plants under salt stress conditions. The results of gene expression analysis suggest that the transgenic plants are in a constant state of stress, and that they are trying to allocate resources to survive.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrachypodium distachyon 3abiotic stress 3acalcium 3acalmodulin 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aoxidoreductases 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3aplant growth 3aprotein metabolism 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3asequence analysis 3astress tolerance 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptomics1 aKronmiller, Brent A.1 aDombrowski, James E.0 tBMC plant biology.g2020 Dec., v. 20, no. 1 p.174-174dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-020-02341-33Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02520naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245019300165300001600358520110300374592002801477650001601505650001501521650001501536650001201551650002101563650001901584650001801603650002401621650001801645653001801663653001501681653003901696653002201735653001901757700001501776700001501791700001501806700001701821700001701838700001601855773009701871856008501968852000902053655001202062IND60597892720221120190747.0190628e20181001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059789272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2018.06.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Quxiu10aInvestigation on extracellular polymeric substances, sludge flocs morphology, bound water release and dewatering performance of sewage sludge under pretreatment with modified phosphogypsum  ap. 337-346.  aModified phosphogypsum (MPG) was developed to improve dewaterability of sewage sludge, and dewatering performance, properties of treated sludge, composition and morphology distribution of EPS, dynamic analysis and multiple regression model on bound water release were investigated. The results showed that addition of MPG caused extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) disintegration through charge neutralization. Destruction of EPS promoted the formation of larger sludge flocs and the release of bound water into supernatant. Simultaneously, content of organics with molecular weight between 1000 and 7000 Da in soluble EPS (SB-EPS) increased with increasing of EPS dissolved into the liquid phase. Besides, about 8.8 kg•kg−1DS of bound water was released after pretreatment with 40%DS MPG dosage. Additionally, a multiple linear regression model for bound water release was established, showing that lower loosely bond EPS (LB-EPS) content and specific resistance of filtration (SRF) may improve dehydration performance, and larger sludge flocs may be beneficial for sludge dewatering.  aPublisher supplied data 3abound water 3adewatering 3afiltration 3aliquids 3amolecular weight 3aneutralization 3aphosphogypsum 3aregression analysis 3asewage sludge 0aSewage sludge 0aDewatering 0aExtracellular polymeric substances 0aFractal dimension 0aBinding energy1 aMa, Liping1 aRen, Nanqi1 aNing, Ping1 aGuo, Zhiying1 aXie, Longgui1 aGao, Haijun0 tWater research.g2018 Oct. 01, v. 142 p.337-346dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2018.06.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03654naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002600144245012500170520216000295592002802455650001702483650002802500650001402528650001402542650001702556650001602573650001502589650002002604650001802624650001602642650001302658650001502671650001102686650001602697650001302713650001902726650002802745700002302773700002702796700002802823700002602851700002102877700001902898700003002917773012602947856007803073852000903151655001203160IND60729202420221118024926.0210228e20210213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072920242DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox100202842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMitsiogianni, Melina 13aAn Evaluation of the Anti-Carcinogenic Response of Major Isothiocyanates in Non-Metastatic and Metastatic Melanoma Cells  aMalignant melanoma is one of the most deadly types of solid cancers, a property mainly attributed to its highly aggressive metastatic form. On the other hand, different classes of isothiocyanates, a class of phytochemicals, present in cruciferous vegetables have been characterized by considerable anti-cancer activity in both in vitro and in vivo experimental models. In the current study, we investigated the anti-cancer response of five isothiocyanates in an in vitro model of melanoma consisting of non-metastatic (A375, B16F-10) and metastatic (VMM1, Hs294T) malignant melanoma as well as non-melanoma epidermoid carcinoma (A431) and non-tumorigenic melanocyte-neighboring keratinocyte (HaCaT) cells. Our aim was to compare different endpoints of cytotoxicity (e.g., reactive oxygen species, intracellular glutathione content, cell cycle growth arrest, apoptosis and necrosis) descriptive of an anti-cancer response between non-metastatic and metastatic melanoma as well as non-melanoma epidermoid carcinoma and non-tumorigenic cells. Our results showed that exposure to isothiocyanates induced an increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species and glutathione contents between non-metastatic and metastatic melanoma cells. The distribution of cell cycle phases followed a similar pattern in a manner where non-metastatic and metastatic melanoma cells appeared to be growth arrested at the G2/M phase while elevated levels of metastatic melanoma cells were shown to be at sub G1 phase, an indicator of necrotic cell death. Finally, metastatic melanoma cells were more sensitive apoptosis and/or necrosis as higher levels were observed compared to non-melanoma epidermoid carcinoma and non-tumorigenic cells. In general, non-melanoma epidermoid carcinoma and non-tumorigenic cells were more resistant under any experimental exposure condition. Overall, our study provides further evidence for the potential development of isothiocyanates as promising anti-cancer agents against non-metastatic and metastatic melanoma cells, a property specific for these cells and not shared by non-melanoma epidermoid carcinoma or non-tumorigenic melanocyte cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassicaceae 3aantineoplastic activity 3aapoptosis 3acarcinoma 3acytotoxicity 3aglutathione 3ainterphase 3aisothiocyanates 3akeratinocytes 3amelanocytes 3amelanoma 3ametastasis 3amodels 3anecroptosis 3anecrosis 3aphytochemicals 3areactive oxygen species1 aKyriakou, Sotiris 1 aAnestopoulos, Ioannis 1 aTrafalis, Dimitrios  T.1 aDeligiorgi, Maria  V.1 aFranco, Rodrigo 1 aPappa, Aglaia 1 aPanayiotidis, Mihalis  I.0 tAntioxidants.g2021 Feb. 13, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox100202843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02164naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003300151245017100184300001600355520088500371592002801256650001201284650000901296650001301305650001001318651002101328653002301349653003101372653000801403653002001411653002801431700002301459700002601482700003101508700003001539773011501569856008501684852000901769655001201778IND60435887620221121230538.0151027e20160102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043588762DNAL7 a10.1080/10106049.2015.10415652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKozhikkodan Veettil, Bijeesh10aRecent variations of supraglacial lakes on the Baltoro Glacier in the central Karakoram Himalaya and its possible teleconnections with the pacific decadal oscillation  ap. 109-119.  aThis study discusses the formation and variations of supraglacial lakes on the Baltoro glacier system in the central Karakoram Himalaya during the last four decades. We mapped supraglacial lakes on the Baltoro Glacier from 1978 to 2014 using Landsat MSS, TM, ETM + and LCDM images. Most of the glacial lakes were formed or expanded during the late 1970s–2008. After 2008, the total number and the area of glacial lakes were found to be lesser compared to previous years. We tried to find any teleconnections exists between the glacial lake changes in this region and the pacific decadal oscillation (PDO), which entered its prolonged warm regime in the late 1970s and again to its cold regime in 2008, based on observational investigation. The decrease in the number and area of the supraglacial lakes after 2008 is hypothesised to be linked with the recent cold phase of PDO.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3acold 3aglaciers 3alakes 3aHimalayan region 0aSupraglacial lakes 0aCentral Karakoram Himalaya 0aPDO 0aBaltoro Glacier 0aDebris-covered glaciers1 aBianchini, Nilceia1 aBremer, Ulisses Franz1 aMaier, Éder Leandro Bayer1 aSimões, Jefferson Cardia0 tGeocarto international.g2016 Jan. 2, v. 31, no. 1 p.109-119dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12366x1752-07627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2015.10415653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03141naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245012600163300001600289520158300305592002801888650002601916650002201942650002101964650001901985650001902004650001302023650001802036650003102054650001002085650002202095650002202117650002302139650001402162650001502176650001702191650002102208653002602229653001702255653002102272653002802293653002202321700001502343700001702358700001402375700001302389700001802402773009702420856008502517852000902602655001202611IND60597892920221120190749.0190628e20181001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059789292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2018.06.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGu, Chen10aExtracellular degradation of tetrabromobisphenol A via biogenic reactive oxygen species by a marine Pseudoalteromonas sp.  ap. 354-362.  aTetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) has attracted considerable attention due to its ubiquitous presence in different environmental compartments worldwide. However, information on its aerobic biodegradability in coastal environments remains unknown. Here, the aerobic biodegradation of TBBPA using a Pseudoalteromonas species commonly found in the marine environment was investigated. We found that extracellular biogenic siderophore, superoxide anion radical (O2•−), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and hydroxyl radical (•OH) were involved in TBBPA degradation. Upregulation of genes (nqrA and lodA) encoding Na+-translocating NADH-quinone oxidoreductase and l-lysine-ε-oxidase supported the extracellular O2•− and H2O2 production. The underlying mechanism of TBBPA biodegradation presumably involves both O2•− reduction and •OH-based advanced oxidation process (AOP). Furthermore, TBBPA intermediates of tribromobisphenol A, 4-isopropylene-2,6-dibromophenol, 4-(2-hydroxyisopropyl)-2,6-dibromophenol, 2,4,6-tribromophenol (TBP), 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, and 2-bromobenzoic acid were detected in the culture medium. Debromination and β-scission pathways of TBBPA biodegradation were proposed. Additionally, membrane integrity assays revealed that the increase of intracellular catalase (CAT) activity and the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) might account for the alleviation of oxidative damage. These findings could deepen understanding of the biodegradation mechanism of TBBPA and other related organic pollutants in coastal and artificial bioremediation systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3a4-hydroxybenzoic acid 3aPseudoalteromonas 3abiodegradability 3abiodegradation 3abioremediation 3acatalase 3aculture media 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydroxyl radicals 3amarine environment 3aoxidation 3apollutants 3asiderophores 3asuperoxide anion 0aTetrabromobisphenol A 0aCometabolism 0aMarine bacterium 0aReactive oxygen species 0aCoastal pollution1 aWang, Jing1 aGuo, Mengfan1 aSui, Meng1 aLu, Hong1 aLiu, Guangfei0 tWater research.g2018 Oct. 01, v. 142 p.354-362dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2018.06.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02210naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245010000165520105900265592002801324650001501352650002601367650001701393650001601410650001001426650001701436650002201453650001401475650001301489650001601502650001001518700002001528700002101548700002301569700001901592773012601611856007801737852000901815655001201824IND60729202620221118024939.0210228e20210213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072920262DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox100202862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Wei-Tang 10aRutin and Gallic Acid Regulates Mitochondrial Functions via the SIRT1 Pathway in C2C12 Myotubes  aMitochondria are highly dynamic organelles, balancing synthesis and degradation in response to increases in mitochondrial turnover (i.e., biogenesis, fusion, fission, and mitophagy) and function. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of polyphenols in the regulation of mitochondrial functions and dynamics in C2C12 myotubes and their molecular mechanisms. Our results indicate that gallic acid and rutin are the most potential polyphenol compounds in response to 15 phenolic acids and 5 flavonoids. Gallic acid and rutin were associated with a significantly greater mitochondrial DNA (cytochrome b and COX-II), mitochondrial enzymatic activities (including citrate synthase and cytochrome c oxidase), and intracellular ATP levels in C2C12 myotubes. Moreover, gallic acid and rutin significantly increased the gene expressions of mitochondrial turnover in C2C12 myotubes.

The impact of spray-drying conditions on the particle size of whey microparticles was studied. Solutions of 10% (w/w) whey proteins in native mixed form (ratio of α-La/β-Lg, 20:70) and isolated form were microparticulated in a scraped surface heat exchanger with a denaturation degree of 90% or higher and were dried using a lab-scale spray dryer. The effect of drying temperatures on the particle size was evaluated for the powder form as well as after reconstitution in distilled water to the original solids content, following a multilevel factorial design with variation of the inlet (180-210 °C) and outlet (75-105 °C) temperatures in the dryer. A slight increase in particle size was observed in the powders independent of the inlet and outlet drying temperatures, which was reversible after dissolution in water. Residual water content of the powder was reduced, independent of the protein composition, as the outlet temperature during drying was increased. Scanning electron microscope micrographs of the obtained powders showed spherical particles with morphological differences depending on the protein composition of the solutions. The results were validated at pilot scale using a spray dryer with centrifugal disc atomisation. ©INRA and Springer-Verlag France 2013.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomization 3adenaturation 3adrying temperature 3afoods 3aheat 3aparticle size 3apowders 3aprotein composition 3ascanning electron microscopes 3asensory properties 3aspray drying 3awater content 3awhey 3awhey protein1 aSchumann, Jens1 aKulozik, Ulrich0 tDairy science & technology.g2013 July, v. 93, no. 4-5 p.487-503dSpringer-Verlagx1958-55867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13594-013-0124-7  aDNAL 7aarticle03406naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010900165300001600274500001900290520165600309592002801965650001501993650002302008650000902031650001402040650001202054650001202066650002402078650003502102650001102137650001902148650001102167650001002178650001802188650002602206650000902232650001902241650002202260651001202282653002402294653001702318653002502335653002302360653002002383700002102403700002202424700001902446700001902465700002102484700002202505700002002527773017902547856008102726852000902807655001202816IND60697886320221119221251.0200607e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069788632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ram.2019.01.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeny, Paulina10aSeroprevalence of leptospirosis in human groups at risk due to environmental, labor or social conditions  ap. 324-333.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLeptospirosis is important in Uruguay due to the economic loss caused by the diseases of production animals, mainly bovines, and also due to frequent human infection. We decided to study anti-Leptospira antibodies in the sera of dairy workers, rice laborers, veterinarians, suburban slum dwellers and garbage recyclers. Our aims were to estimate the seroprevalence of infection by Leptospira spp. in these people at risk, the relative importance of the known risk factors associated with infection, and the impact of human infections in each setting. Groups at risk were identified and 35 visits to their locations were made, conducting field surveys and exchange talks for information and education. Simple epidemiological questionnaires were administered and sera samples were taken from 308 persons. The microagglutination Technique (MAT) and the IgM Indirect Immunofluorescence (IIF) assay were employed to detect antibodies. Environmental water samples, canine and equine sera were also examined. More than 45% of human sera were reactive and the studied groups were confirmed to be widely exposed to infection. Female sera were frequently reactive, though most illnesses occur in men, and the most severe cases in elderly males; the emergence and evolution of the disease may strongly depend on the host condition and functions. Animal contact and unsafe water usage were the main identified risk factors to be considered in prevention. Fifty per cent of the studied horses showed a positive MAT reaction. The underdiagnosis of the illness and its long-term symptoms require further study, as well as greater health and social attention efforts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeptospira 3aat-risk population 3adogs 3aeducation 3aelderly 3afemales 3afinancial economics 3afluorescent antibody technique 3ahorses 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3alabor 3aleptospirosis 3amunicipal solid waste 3arice 3aseroprevalence 3awater utilization 3aUruguay 0aHuman leptospirosis 0aRisk factors 0aLeptospirosis humana 0aFactores de riesgo 0aSeroprevalencia1 aMenéndez, Clara1 aAshfield, Natalia1 aQuintero, Jair1 aRios, Cristina1 aIglesias, Tamara1 aSchelotto, Felipe1 aVarela, Gustavo0 tRevista argentina microbiología.g2019 Oct.,  Dec., v. 51, no. 4 p.324-333dElsevier España, S.L.U.aAsociación Argentina de MicrobiologíawJournal:23426x0325-75417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ram.2019.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02109naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003400152245010800186500001900294520094000313592002801253650001101281650002001292650001801312650002501330650001701355650002201372650001201394651001301406653002901419653001301448653001101461653000801472653000801480653000801488700001701496773010201513856008701615852000901702655001201711IND60736099320221121170940.0210603e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073609932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2021.1070712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlbuquerque Sant'Anna, André10aEnvironmental regulation and bail outs under weak state capacity: Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis paper assesses the effects of a bail out on deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon following a revision in the Forest Code. By providing a bail out to landowners with illegal deforestation, the New Forest Code has created incentives for law-abiding landowners to engage in deforestation activities as well, in the expectation of receiving future amnesties. To identify causal effects, we explore a rich dataset at the property level and use a difference-in-differences strategy, where former law-abiders are our treatment group. In our preferred econometric specification, the private rural properties in the treated group are associated with a rate of forest loss 0.457 p.p. higher than would prevail in the absence of the law revision. This amounts to an accumulated loss of nearly 1 million hectares of forest between 2012 and 2017. This is equivalent to a US$ 2.4 billion loss when no more than carbon emissions are considered.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3adata collection 3adeforestation 3aecological economics 3aeconometrics 3aenvironmental law 3aforests 3aAmazonia 0aEnvironmental regulation 0aBail out 0aAmazon 0aO13 0aQ23 0aR521 aCosta, Lucas0 tEcological economics.g2021 Aug., v. 186 p.107071-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11629x0921-80097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2021.1070713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02948naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245009800163300001200261520138800273592002801661596007701689596008401766596007001850650001601920650002401936650001701960650001701977650001001994650001002004650001502014650001402029650001702043650001202060650002602072650002002098700001602118700001802134700001702152700001902169700001902188700001802207700001602225700001602241773010502257856008302362852000902445655001202454IND60712511320221123002749.0210921e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071251132DNAL7 a10.1186/s12870-020-02391-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQi, Yuting10aIdentification of the Eutrema salsugineum EsMYB90 gene important for anthocyanin biosynthesis  ap. 186.  aBACKGROUND: Anthocyanins contribute to coloration and antioxidation effects in different plant tissues. MYB transcription factors have been demonstrated to be a key regulator for anthocyanin synthesis in many plants. However, little information was available about the MYB genes in the halophyte species Eutrema salsugineum. RESULT: Here we report the identification of an important anthocyanin biosynthesis regulator EsMYB90 from Eutrema salsugineum, which is a halophyte tolerant to multiple abiotic stresses. Our phylogenetic and localization analyses supported that EsMYB90 is an R2R3 type of MYB transcription factor. Ectopic expression of EsMYB90 in tobacco and Arabidopsis enhanced pigmentation and anthocyanin accumulation in various organs. The transcriptome analysis revealed that 42 genes upregulated by EsMYB90 in 35S:EsMYB90 tobacco transgenic plants are required for anthocyanin biosynthesis. Moreover, our qRT-PCR results showed that EsMYB90 promoted expression of early (PAL, CHS, and CHI) and late (DFR, ANS, and UFGT) anthocyanin biosynthesis genes in stems, leaves, and flowers of 35S:EsMYB90 tobacco transgenic plants. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that EsMYB90 is a MYB transcription factor, which regulates anthocyanin biosynthesis genes to control anthocyanin biosynthesis. Our work provides a new tool to enhance anthocyanin production in various plants.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018ZX08009-10BcNational Major Science and Technology Projects of China  a2019GSF107089cKey Technology Research and Development Program of Shandong (CN)  aZR2014CM041cNatural Science Foundation of Shandong Province (CN) 3aArabidopsis 3aEutrema salsugineum 3aanthocyanins 3abiosynthesis 3acolor 3agenes 3ahalophytes 3aphylogeny 3apigmentation 3atobacco 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptomics1 aGu, Caihong1 aWang, Xingjun1 aGao, Shiqing1 aLi, Changsheng1 aZhao, Chuanzhi1 aLi, Chuanshun1 aMa, Changle1 aZhang, Quan0 tBMC plant biology.g2020 Dec., v. 20, no. 1 p.186-186dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-020-02391-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03176naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011100168300001400279500001900293520160700312592002801919650002801947650000801975650001901983650001902002650001102021650002702032650002502059651001402084653002702098653000902125653001502134653001602149653002302165653002202188653000902210653001502219653002002234700002002254700001802274700001902292700001802311700002002329700002002349700002202369773017702391856008102568852000902649655001202658IND60697886620221119221211.0200607e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069788662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ram.2019.02.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConiglio, Anahí10aDesarrollo de marcadores moleculares del tipo SCAR para la identificación de Azospirillum brasilense Az39  ap. 50-60.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAzospirillum brasilense Az39 has been used since more than 30 years by several companies in South America for biofertilizers production. This strain may promote plants growth and development, as well as the ability of inoculated plants to tolerate environmental stresses, which determines an increase in the productivity under field conditions. At present, there are no protocols in Argentina to confirm the identity of Az39 in commercial products; however, such biofertilizers are formulated almost exclusively with this strain. Therefore, the objective of this paper was to develop a molecular methodology that allows the accurate identification of A. brasilense Az39. Using the complete genome sequence and several bioinformatics tools, fragments of DNA present only in the Az39 genome were recognized. A set of PCR primers to amplify these sequences were designed, and the specific products were observed only in the strain of our interest. The sensitivity of the methodology was evaluated, where the strain could be detected up to a titer of 10⁵ CFU/ml (4.5 ng/μl ADN) or 10² CFU/ml (0.88 ng/μl DNA) or in a minimal concentration of 0.098 ng/μl DNA, depending on the DNA extraction methodology used. Primers were tested against direct samples of commercial inoculants and cultures, in both cases there were specifics products, both in direct samples and in confirmatory tests from isolated colonies from those products. The procedure presented in this paper allows the accurate identification of A. brasilense Az39 in pure cultures, mixtures of microorganisms, and commercial biofertilizers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAzospirillum brasilense 3aDNA 3abiofertilizers 3abioinformatics 3agenome 3agrowth and development 3anucleotide sequences 3aArgentina 0aMarcadores moleculares 0aSCAR 0aBioinsumos 0aInoculantes 0aControl de calidad 0aMolecular markers 0aSCAR 0aInoculants 0aQuality control1 aLópez, Gastón1 aGualpa, José1 aMolina, Romina1 aRosas, Susana1 aPuente, Mariana1 aMora, Verónica1 aCassán, Fabricio0 tRevista argentina microbiología.g2020 Jan.,  Mar., v. 52, no. 1 p.50-60dElsevier España, S.L.U.aAsociación Argentina de MicrobiologíawJournal:23426x0325-75417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ram.2019.02.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02714naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245017600170300001600346520118700362592002801549650002401577650002901601650001701630650001401647650002401661650001101685650003501696650002601731650001701757650002001774653002601794653003501820653003001855653007401885653005101959700001902010700002602029700001702055773011302072856008602185852000902271655001202280IND60585484320221117105932.0201216e20180120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058548432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.10.1842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zhenfeng10aWaste-to-energy, municipal solid waste treatment, and best available technology: Comprehensive evaluation by an interval-valued fuzzy multi-criteria decision making method  ap. 887-899.  aThe treatment of municipal solid waste (MSW) has become an urgently important task of many countries. This objective of this study is to present a novel group multi-attribute decision analysis method for prioritizing the MSW treatment alternatives based on the interval-valued fuzzy set theory. This study allows multiple stakeholders to participate in the process of decision-making and they are also allowed to use linguistic variables to rate the alternatives and determine the weights of the evaluation criteria. The interval-valued fuzzy group decision making trail and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method was developed to determine the weights of the evaluation criteria by considering the independent relationships among these criteria. The multi-actor interval-valued fuzzy grey relational analysis was developed to rank the waste-to-energy scenarios. Four alternative processes for MSW treatment including landfill, anaerobic digestion, incineration, and gasification were studied by the developed model, and the results reveal that the developed model can successfully help the stakeholders to determine the priority sequence of the alternative MSW treatment scenarios.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digestion 3adecision support systems 3agasification 3alandfills 3amathematical theory 3amodels 3amulti-criteria decision making 3amunicipal solid waste 3astakeholders 3awaste treatment 0aMunicipal solid waste 0aMulti-criteria decision making 0aInterval-valued fuzzy set 0aInterval-valued fuzzy decision making trail and evaluation laboratory 0aInterval-valued fuzzy grey relational analysis1 aRen, Jingzheng1 aGoodsite, Michael E.,1 aXu, Guangyin0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 Jan. 20, v. 172 p.887-899dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.10.1843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03108naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245014700171300001500318500002000333520122400353592002801577650002301605650001101628650002201639650002701661650001701688650001901705650001701724650002101741650003001762650002301792650002201815650003101837650001101868650001401879650002201893650001801915650002501933650002201958650002601980650002202006650005202028650001202080650002502092650001602117650002202133700002002155700002402175700002002199700002602219700002202245700002702267773011402294852000902408856008902417655001202506IND4363325220221118090259.0210417e200407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436332522DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.2004.01088.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMehli, Lisbeth12aA gene encoding a polygalacturonase‐inhibiting protein (PGIP) shows developmental regulation and pathogen‐induced expression in strawberry  ap. 99-110.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a• Polygalacturonase‐inhibiting proteins (PGIPs) have been demonstrated to play a role in host defence in several plants. • The PGIP now cloned from strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa) showed a high degree of homology to other fruit PGIPs. The gene expression of strawberry PGIP was monitored in healthy leaves, flowers and fruit at different maturity stages. PGIP transcript levels were also analysed following fruit inoculation with the fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea in strawberry cultivars displaying variation in susceptibility. • Healthy mature berries showed the highest constitutive PGIP gene expression levels compared with leaves, flowers and immature fruit, indicating that the gene is developmentally regulated. Among the cultivars studied (‘Elsanta’, ‘Korona’, ‘Polka’, ‘Senga sengana’, ‘Tenira’), ‘Polka’ had the highest constitutive expression level of PGIP. After inoculation with B. cinerea, all five cultivars displayed a significant induction of PGIP gene expression, but the differences between them were not statistically significant. • The high induction of the PGIP gene after inoculation with B. cinerea indicates that PGIP has a role in defence of strawberry.  aPublisher supplied data 3asequence alignment 3agenome 3apolygalacturonase 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aplant damage 3aplant proteins 3astrawberries 3aBotrytis cinerea 3afungal diseases of plants 3adisease resistance 3aenzyme inhibition 3agene expression regulation 3aleaves 3acultivars 3aplant development 3amessenger RNA 3aamino acid sequences 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aresistance mechanisms 3aFragaria ananassa 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aflowers 3anucleotide sequences 3afruit crops 3agenetic variation1 aSchaart, Jan G.1 aKjellsen, Trygve D.1 aTran, Diem Hong1 aSalentijn, Elma M.

Biosorption is a potential environmental biotechnology approach for biotreatment of aquatic sites polluted with heavy metal ions. Seaweeds have received great attention for their high bioremediation potential in recent years. However, the co-application of marine macroalgae for removal of heavy metals from wastewater is very limited. Thus, for the first time in literature, a coastal seaweed community composed of Chaetomorpha sp., Polysiphonia sp., Ulva sp. and Cystoseira sp. species was applied to remove copper ions from synthetic aqueous medium in this study. The biosorption experiments in batch mode were conducted to examine the effects of operating variables including pH, biosorbent amount, metal ion concentration and contact time on the biosorption process. The biosorption behavior of biosorbent was described by various equilibrium, kinetic and thermodynamic models. The biosorption of copper ions was strongly influenced by the operating parameters. The results indicated that the equilibrium data of biosorption were best modeled by Sips isotherm model. The values of mean free energy of biosorption computed from Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherm model and the standard Gibbs free energy change indicated a feasible, spontaneous and physical biotreatment system. The pseudo-second-order rate equation successfully defined the kinetic behavior of copper biosorption. The pore diffusion also played role in the control of biosorption process. The maximum copper uptake capacity of biosorbent was found to be greater than those of many other biosorbents. The obtained results revealed that this novel biosorbent could be a promising material for copper ion bioremediation implementations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChaetomorpha 3aCystoseira 3aGibbs free energy 3aPolysiphonia 3aUlva 3abiosorbents 3abiosorption 3abiotechnology 3acopper 3acopper metabolism 3aeffluents 3aequations 3aheavy metals 3amacroalgae 3ametal ions 3apH 3aphytoremediation 3athermodynamic models 3awastewater 3awater pollution 0aSeaweed community 0awater environment 0aheavy metals 0abioremediation1 aErsanli, Elif Tezel0 tInternational journal of phytoremediation.g2018 Feb. 23, v. 20, no. 3 p.256-263dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl62892x1549-78797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15226514.2017.13743353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02014naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245007300164300001600237520101700253592002801270650001501298650001401313650002501327650001201352650001401364651001001378700001801388700001801406700002201424700001801446700001601464773009401480856008101574852000901655655001201664IND60520776020221118054235.0160524e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052077602DNAL7 a10.1007/s40003-016-0203-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTawar, P.

CoC 671 with high cane and sugar yield, high sucrose content and moderately resistant to smut, grassy shoot and red rot diseases. VSI 434 recorded 14.5 to 30.7 % higher cane yield and 22.9 to 30.1% higher commercial cane sugar over the donor and standard CoC 671 in different station and multilocation trials. This is the second sugarcane cultivar released in India through the use of somaclonal variation after var. Co 94012. A morphological variation was observed in number of traits for VSI 434 through somaclonal variation along with improvement in sucrose percent and moderately red rot resistant as compared to parent var. CoC 671. This variation was possibly due to complex genetic nature and existence of chromosomal mosaicism. Morphologically, these two varieties are distinct and also differentiated by using different molecular marker techniques. The study demonstrates that somaclonal variation can be utilized for improvement of sugarcane varieties.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrop yield 3acultivars 3asomaclonal variation 3asucrose 3asugarcane 3aIndia1 aSawant, R.

In developing countries, treatment of rural domestic waste (RDW) is distinguished from urban waste. Quantitative assessment of greenhouse gas emissions from RDW disposal treatment is needed to achieve carbon neutrality. Reliable global warming potential (GWP) assessments of RDW are not differentiated in the widely accepted “urban–rural integration” centralized disposal model. We considered five different scenarios for RDW management. Scenario 1 (S1), unsanitary landfill (open-air dump); scenario 2 (S2), sanitary landfill; scenario 3 (S3), incineration; scenario 4 (S4), biological + incineration; and scenario 5 (S5), classification + composting + sanitary landfill + recycling. Life cycle assessment was used for GWP, and sensitivity analysis was calculated to point out the sensitive parameter. We found that the mean GWP ranged from 5.14 × 10⁴ to 2.31 × 10⁵ kg CO₂-equivalents. Pollution from untreated RDW with landfill gas emissions led to large contributions under all scenarios. The collection and transportation ratio was sensitive to all scenarios, and we found that, if the recyclable materials separated at source were not used efficiently, the impact on GWP would be greater than under the unclassified waste scenarios. A “new urban–rural integration” mode (S5) that included household classification, village collection, town transfer, and county and urban disposal was introduced for RDW management. These quantitative results have a great potential for promoting effective RDW management in China and other developing countries.  aPublisher supplied data  a2019YFC1906000cKey Technologies Research and Development Program 3acarbon 3acase studies 3agreenhouse gases 3alandfills 3alife cycle assessment 3amodels 3apollution 3apopulation growth 3aresearch 3atransportation 3aurban development 3avillages 3awaste treatment 3awastes 3aChina1 aNie, Xiaoqin1 aShu, Tianchu1 aLi, Xu1 aBai, Binjie0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 Sept., v. 28, no. 34 p.47149-47161dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-13983-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02959naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245014100164300002000305520147900325592002801804650002401832650002801856650001101884650001201895650002501907650001201932650001301944650001101957650001101968650002101979650003102000650001702031650001702048650001102065650000902076650000902085650001402094650001202108650001402120650001102134650000902145650000902154651002102163700003002184773014902214856008102363852000902444655001202453IND60583101520221121121203.0171008e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058310152DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-017-9958-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVarol, Memet10aComparison of heavy metal levels of farmed and escaped farmed rainbow trout and health risk assessment associated with their consumption  ap. 23114-23124.  aIn this study, levels of ten metals (arsenic, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, iron, manganese, nickel, lead, and zinc) in muscles of farmed and escaped farmed rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in the Keban Dam Reservoir (Turkey) were determined. Also, human health risks associated with their consumption were assessed. Of ten metals, only Co and Fe levels in escaped rainbow trout were significantly higher than those in farmed rainbow trout. The metal levels in farmed and escaped rainbow trout were below the maximum permissible limits. The estimated daily intake (EDI) of each metal in both farmed and escaped farmed rainbow trout was much lower than the respective tolerable daily intake (TDI). The target hazard quotient (THQ) values for individual metal and the total THQ values for combined metals were lower than 1 in both farmed and escaped rainbow trout, indicating no health risk for humans. The cancer risk (CR) values estimated for inorganic As in both farmed and escaped rainbow trout indicated low carcinogenic risk to the consumers. According to the maximum allowable monthly consumption limits (CRₘₘ₎, adults may safely consume 24 meals of farmed rainbow trout per month or 39 meals of escaped rainbow trout per month, with minimal adverse carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic health effects. This study revealed that the risk from consuming farmed and escaped farmed rainbow trout in the Keban Dam Reservoir due to these trace elements is minimal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aacceptable daily intake 3aadults 3aarsenic 3aaverage daily intake 3acadmium 3achromium 3acobalt 3acopper 3afish consumption 3ahealth effects assessments 3aheavy metals 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3airon 3alead 3amanganese 3amuscles 3aneoplasms 3anickel 3arisk 3azinc 3aTurkey (country)1 aSünbül, Muhammet Raşit0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2017 Oct., v. 24, no. 29 p.23114-23124dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-9958-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03024naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003300151245011000184520166500294592002801959650002901987650002402016650002902040650001202069650001102081650001102092650001202103651001902115651001302134653001902147653002302166653002102189653002102210653001702231700001902248700006002267700002102327700005602348773010302404856008602507852000902593655001202602IND60654388520221118053302.0190807e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065438852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fishres.2019.1053292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMillar, R. B.q(Russell B.),10aFurther improvements in sorting grids for the crustacean trawl fishery off the Southern coast of Portugal  aBottom-trawl fishing for crustaceans off the Portuguese south and southwest coasts is a very important segment of the Portuguese fishing fleet, where annual rates of discarding have ranged from approximately 38% to as much as 70% of the total catch. Past experiments to address this problem encompassed the testing of different codend mesh sizes and configurations, square mesh windows and rigid grids to enhance species and size-selectivity. While the use of a Nordmøre grid has proved quite efficient in separating out blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou), it also led to some losses of the two main crustacean target species, Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus) and rose shrimp (Parapenaeus longirostris). The present study addresses that limitation by using a modified grid with 20 mm bar spacing and two open sections, designed with the purpose of separating fish and crustacean species into upper and lower codends. Good separation was achieved, with about 80% of the blue whiting (in number) directed towards the upper trawl section and caught in the upper codend, while a similar percentage of Norway lobster was caught in the lower codend. The grid bars had 50% retention for Norway lobster at 34.1 mm carapace length. The results herein will enable this gear configuration to be fine-tuned with regard to codend mesh sizes and bar spacing, so as to optimize both retention of Norway lobster and exclusion of blue whiting. For example, compared to using the minimum 70 mm diamond mesh size, using an 80 mm diamond mesh upper codend would reduce Norway lobster catch weight by just 1.6% but reduce the number of blue whiting caught by 42%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMicromesistius poutassou 3aNephrops norvegicus 3aParapenaeus longirostris 3abycatch 3acoasts 3ashrimp 3awhiting 3aAtlantic Ocean 3aPortugal 0aNordmøre grid 0aSpecies separation 0aSize-selectivity 0aPortuguese coast 0aNEA Atlantic1 aBarros, Luísa1 aFonsêca, Paulo,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4177-81961 aSantos, Paulo T.1 aCampos, Aida1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5972-62660 tFisheries research.g2019 Nov., v. 219 p.105329-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33528x0165-78367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2019.1053293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02169naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245009000176300001600266520097200282592002801254650003701282650002001319650001301339650001701352650001501369650001501384650002201399653001601421653000801437653002101445653000801466653000901474653002501483700001701508700002001525700002101545773009801566856008601664852000901750655001201759IND60604489020221122235222.0180717e20151002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060448902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virusres.2015.06.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNagamine, Toshihiro10aDissection of two modes of IE1 sub-nuclear localization in baculovirus-infected cells  ap. 120-128.  aPrior to viral DNA replication, baculovirus IE1 exhibits a focal distribution within the cell nucleus. During DNA replication, the IE1 foci apparently expand and develop into a virus replication center called the virogenic stroma (VS). In our search for chemical compounds capable of modulating Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV: a prototype of baculovirus) replication, we found an inhibitor (dBIQdO) of IE1 focus formation. VS formation, however, was not affected, suggesting that IE1 foci are not essential for VS formation and that IE1 possesses two independent mechanisms for sub-nuclear localization. In addition to inhibition of IE1 focus formation, dBIQdO also reduced viral titers following infection at a low MOI. Comparison of the effects of three chemicals, dBIQdO, aphidicolin and caffeine, on IE1 localization allowed us to detect a shift from focal distribution to VS localization, suggesting that IE1 foci are disassembled prior to VS formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus 3aDNA replication 3acaffeine 3acell nucleus 3aprototypes 3aviral load 3avirus replication 0aBaculovirus 0aNPV 0aVirogenic stroma 0aIE1 0aP143 0aSubnuclear structure1 aSaito, Tamio1 aOsada, Hiroyuki1 aMatsumoto, Shogo0 tVirus research.g2015 Oct. 02, v. 208 p.120-128dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6283x0168-17027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2015.06.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03344naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245012100174300001600295520152600311592002801837650002701865650002301892650002501915650001201940650001301952650001601965650001001981650001001991650002002001650001702021650002602038650001702064650002202081650002002103650001402123650001502137650001202152650002102164650001702185650001402202650001202216650002102228650002502249653002402274653002502298653001402323653001402337653001102351700002702362700002302389700002402412700001702436700001502453700001802468773013802486856008502624852000902709655001202718IND60595408920221123040608.0180602e20180223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059540892DNAL7 a10.1080/15226514.2017.13743372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYasin, Nasim Ahmad14aThe beneficial role of potassium in Cd-induced stress alleviation and growth improvement in Gladiolus grandiflora L.  ap. 274-283.  aHeavy metal contaminated agricultural soils are one of the most important constraints for successful cultivation of crops. The current research was conducted to evaluate the role of potassium (K) on plant growth and amelioration of cadmium (Cd) stress in Gladiolus grandiflora under greenhouse conditions. G. grandiflora corms were sown in media contaminated with 0 (C), 50 (Cd50) and 100 (Cd100) mg Cd kg⁻¹ soil. The plants growing in Cd-contaminated media exhibited reduced gas exchange attributes, chlorophyll (Chl) contents, vegetative and reproductive growth as compared to control. The plants raised in Cd contaminated media showed reduced nutrition yet higher Cd contents. However, supplementation of 60 mg Kg⁻¹ K in treated plants (C+K, Cd50+K and Cd100+K) improved quantity of total soluble protein and proline (Pro) along with activity of antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) under Cd stress. Similarly, K supplementation reduced the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) in treated plants. Potassium supplemented plants exhibited better vegetative and reproductive growth. The improved stress tolerance in K supplemented plants was attributed to the reduced quantity of MDA and H₂O₂, enhanced synthesis of protein, proline, phenols, flavonides and improved activity of antioxidant enzymes. The present research supports the application of K for alleviation of Cd stress in G. grandiflora.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGladiolus grandiflorus 3aagricultural soils 3aascorbate peroxidase 3acadmium 3acatalase 3achlorophyll 3acorms 3acrops 3aenzyme activity 3agas exchange 3agreenhouse production 3aheavy metals 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amalondialdehyde 3anutrition 3aperoxidase 3aphenols 3aphytoremediation 3aplant growth 3apotassium 3aproline 3astress tolerance 3asuperoxide dismutase 0aAntioxidant enzymes 0acadmium accumulation 0agladiolus 0apotassium 0astress1 aZaheer, Malik Muhammad1 aKhan, Waheed Ullah1 aAhmad, Sajid Rashid1 aAhmad, Aqeel1 aAli, Aamir1 aAkram, Waheed0 tInternational journal of phytoremediation.g2018 Feb. 23, v. 20, no. 3 p.274-283dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl62892x1549-78797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15226514.2017.13743373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03576naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002000188245015100208300001100359506007600370520195700446592002802403506003702431650001902468650001602487650002002503650001302523650001502536650000902551650002402560650002602584650001302610650003102623650002402654650001602678650001902694650001102713651001602724651001102740651001502751700001902766700002102785700001802806700001902824700002402843773008902867856008102956852000903037655001203046IND60548537520221207115925.0171010e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054853752DNAL7 a10.1186/s12937-016-0192-72doi7 aPMC49776722pmcid7 a275066672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMadar, Ahmed A.10aEffect of vitamin D3 supplementation on iron status: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial among ethnic minorities living in Norway  ap. 74.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Both vitamin D and iron deficiencies are widespread globally, and a relationship between these deficiencies has been suggested. However, there is a paucity of randomised controlled trials assessing the effect of vitamin D supplementation on iron status. PURPOSE: We aimed to investigate whether 16 weeks of daily vitamin D₃ supplementation had an effect on serum ferritin, haemoglobin, serum iron and transferrin saturation. METHODS: Overall, 251 participants from South Asia, Middle East and Africa aged 18–50 years who were living in Norway were randomised to receive daily oral supplementation of 10 μg vitamin D₃, 25 μg vitamin D₃, or placebo for 16 weeks during the late winter. Blood samples from baseline and after 16 weeks were analysed for serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (s-25(OH) D), serum ferritin, haemoglobin and serum iron. In total, 214 eligible participants completed the intervention (86 % of those randomised). Linear regression analysis were used to test the effect of vitamin D3 supplementation combined (10 or 25 μg) and separate doses 10 or 25 μg compared to placebo on change (T2-T1) in each outcome variable adjusted for baseline s-25(OH)D values. RESULTS: There was no difference in change in the levels of s-ferritin (1.9 μg/L, 95 % CI: -3.2, 7.0), haemoglobin (-0.02 g/dL, 95 % CI: -0.12, 0.09), s-iron (0.4 μg/L, 95 % CI: -0.5, 1.3) or transferrin saturation (0.7 %, 95 % CI: -0.6.1, 2.0) between those receiving vitamin D₃ or those receiving placebo. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D increased from 29 nmol/L at baseline to 49 nmol/L after the intervention, with little change in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: In this population of healthy ethnic minorities from South Asia, the Middle East and Africa who had low vitamin D status, 16 weeks of daily supplementation with 10 or 25 μg of vitamin D₃ did not significantly affect the haemoglobin levels or other markers of iron status.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ablood sampling 3ablood serum 3acholecalciferol 3aferritin 3ahemoglobin 3airon 3aminorities (people) 3anutrient deficiencies 3aplacebos 3arandomized clinical trials 3aregression analysis 3atransferrin 3avitamin status 3awinter 3aMiddle East 3aNorway 3aSouth Asia1 aStene, Lars C.1 aMeyer, Haakon E.1 aBrekke, Mette1 aLagerløv, Per1 aKnutsen, Kirsten V.0 tNutrition journal.g2015 Dec., v. 15, no. 1 p.74-74dBioMed Centralx1475-28917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12937-016-0192-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02561naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245008400164300001600248520149900264592002801763650002201791650001301813650001101826650001301837650002501850650001701875650001201892650001401904650000901918700002201927700001901949700001901968773011901987856008402106852000902190655001202199IND60090130320221121063241.0141102e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009013032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbapap.2011.10.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLai, Mark10aCopper binding traps the folded state of the SCO protein from Bacillus subtilis  ap. 292-302.  aThe SCO protein from the aerobic bacterium Bacillus subtilis (BsSCO) is involved in the assembly of the cytochrome c oxidase complex, and specifically with the CuA center. BsSCO has been proposed to play various roles in CuA assembly including, the direct delivery of copper ions to the CuA site, and/or maintaining the appropriate redox state of the cysteine ligands during formation of CuA. BsSCO binds copper in both Cu(II) and Cu(I) redox states, but has a million-fold higher affinity for Cu(II). As a prerequisite to kinetic studies, we measured equilibrium stability of oxidized, reduced and Cu(II)-bound BsSCO by chemical and thermal induced denaturation. Oxidized and reduced apo-BsSCO exhibit two-state behavior in both chemical- and thermal-induced unfolding. However, the Cu(II) complex of BsSCO is stable in up to nine molar urea. Thermal or guanidinium-induced unfolding of BsSCO-Cu(II) ensues only as the Cu(II) species is lost. The effect of copper (II) on the folding of BsSCO is complicated by a rapid redox reaction between copper and reduced, denatured BsSCO. When denatured apo-BsSCO is refolded in the presence of copper (II) some of the population is recovered as the BsSCO-Cu(II) complex and some is oxidized indicating that refolding and oxidation are competing processes. The proposed functional roles for BsSCO in vivo require that its cysteine residues are reduced and the presence of copper during folding may be detrimental to BsSCO attaining its functional state.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3abacteria 3acopper 3acysteine 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3adenaturation 3aligands 3aoxidation 3aurea1 aYam, Katherine C.1 aAndrews, Diann1 aHill, Bruce C.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2012 Feb., v. 1824, no. 2 p.292-302dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12097x1878-14547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbapap.2011.10.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02634naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012900164300001600293520133200309592002801641650002101669650001701690650001501707650001301722650001601735650001401751650001001765650001801775650001201793650001501805650002501820650001401845650000901859650001401868650001301882650001301895700001801908700001701926700001901943700001601962773010801978856008102086852000902167655001202176IND60520776320221118054218.0160524e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052077632DNAL7 a10.1007/s40502-016-0217-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMunde, N.

Phenotypic as well as allelic variations in nucleotide sequence within STAR2 gene in different rice cultivars was investigated. On the basis of morphological screening, six rice cultivars, viz., ‘Subhadra’, ‘Sankar’, ‘Rudra’, ‘Udaygiri’, ‘Lalitagiri’ and ‘Ghanteshwari’ showed tolerance to aluminum and other four cultivars were susceptible to Al. Both STAR1 (for sensitive to Al rhizotoxicity1) and STAR2 genes were identified in Indica rice demonstrating the Al toxicity/tolerance. The present study indicate that STAR2 encodes a transmembrane domain of a bacterial-type ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter methyltransferaseI (metI) like protein, sulfate/molybdate abc transporter/permease (transport protein), maltose transport system permease protein malf (hydrolase/transport protein) present in 13-α-helices and 14-coils, which signifies the role in Al tolerance. Based on phenotypic and genotypic observations, the cultivars like ‘Lalat’ and ‘Jyotirmayee’ were found susceptible to aluminum. In summary, both Oryza sativa, indica group and Oryza sativa, japonica group were genotypically similar and coevolved to confer the tolerance against aluminum stress, which helps in crop improvement programme.  aPublisher supplied data 3aABC transporters 3aOryza sativa 3aacid soils 3aaluminum 3acoevolution 3acultivars 3agenes 3agenome mining 3amaltose 3amolybdates 3anucleotide sequences 3aphenotype 3arice 3ascreening 3asulfates 3atoxicity1 aJadhao, K.

Yet, the role of chromatin interactions and its regulation of gene expression in EGFR-amplified glioblastoma remains unclear. In this study, we explored alterations in 3D chromatin organization of EGFR-amplified glioblastoma and its subsequent impact by performing a comparative analysis of Hi-C, RNA-seq, and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) on EGFR-amplified glioblastoma-derived A172 and normal astrocytes (HA1800 cell line). A172 cells showed an elevated chromatin relaxation, and unexpected entanglement of chromosome regions. A genome-wide landscape of switched compartments and differentially expressed genes between HA1800 and A172 cell lines demonstrated that compartment activation reshaped chromatin accessibility and activated tumorigenesis-related genes. Topological associating domain (TAD) analysis revealed that altered TAD domains in A172 also contribute to oncogene activation and tumor repressor deactivation. Interestingly, glioblastoma-derived A172 cells showed a different chromatin loop contact propensity. Genes in tumorigenesis-associated signaling pathways were significantly enriched at the anchor loci of altered chromatin loops. Oncogene activation and tumor repressor deactivation were associated with chromatin loop alteration. Structure variations (SVs) had a dramatic impact on the chromatin conformation of EGFR-amplified glioblastoma-derived tumor cells. Moreover, our results revealed that 7p11.2 duplication activated EGFR expression in EGFR-amplified glioblastoma via neo-TAD formation and novel enhancer-promoter interaction emergence between LINC01446 and EGFR. The disordered 3D genomic map and multi-omics data of EGFR-amplified glioblastoma provide a resource for future interrogation of the relationship between chromatin interactions and transcriptome in tumorigenesis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aastrocytes 3abiotechnology 3acarcinogenesis 3acell lines 3achromatin 3agene expression regulation 3agenomics 3aglioblastoma 3alandscapes 3amultiomics 3amutation 3aoncogenes 3asequence analysis 3atopology 3atranscriptome 0aHi-C 0aGlioblastoma 0aAstrocytes 0aStructure Variation 0aTumorigenesis 0a3D genomic 0aWGS 0aTAD 0aSV 0aGBM 0aPCC 0aICE 0aIDE 0aDE 0aFDR1 aJiang, Nian1 aZou, Han1 aFan, Xuning1 aLiu, Tao1 aHuang, Xi1 aWanggou, Siyi1 aLi, Xuejun0 tComputational and Structural Biotechnology Journal.g2022, v. 20 p.1967-1978dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23199x2001-03707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2022.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01844naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002300143245008300166300001800249520069000267650000900957650001500966650002000981650001401001650002601015650001601041650001301057650001201070700002301082700002001105700002601125773012601151852000901277856008301286856005501369930003301424946001301457655001201470IND4388844320221122162230.0070311e20070309xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438884432DNAL7 a10.1126/science.11383532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIjspeert, Auke Jan10aFrom Swimming to Walking with a Salamander Robot Driven by a Spinal Cord Model  ap. 1416-1420.  aThe transition from aquatic to terrestrial locomotion was a key development in vertebrate evolution. We present a spinal cord model and its implementation in an amphibious salamander robot that demonstrates how a primitive neural circuit for swimming can be extended by phylogenetically more recent limb oscillatory centers to explain the ability of salamanders to switch between swimming and walking. The model suggests neural mechanisms for modulation of velocity, direction, and type of gait that are relevant for all tetrapods. It predicts that limb oscillatory centers have lower intrinsic frequencies than body oscillatory centers, and we present biological data supporting this. 3agait 3alocomotion 3aneural networks 3aphylogeny 3asalamanders and newts 3aspinal cord 3aswimming 3awalking1 aCrespi, Alessandro1 aRyczko, Dimitri1 aCabelguen, Jean-Marie0 tScience.g2007 Mar. 9, v. 315, no. 5817 p.1416-1420dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11383533Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.scienceonline.org/3electronic resource  a20070311b20070402c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03543naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003100133040001800164100002000182245009900202300001800301500002400319506007600343520156500419506003701984650002202021650002202043650001202065650002102077650001602098650002102114650001702135650001402152650002502166650001202191650002202203650001702225650003102242650002502273650004602298650002702344650003502371650004602406650002302452650004502475650003102520650005802551650002602609650004702635650002202682700002202704700002202726773011502748852000902863856008102872655001202953IND4422741920221207093035.0090703e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442274192DNAL7 a194113712pmid7 aPMC27050232pmcid7 a10.1104/pp.109.1393782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRivero, Rosa M.10aCytokinin-Dependent Photorespiration and the Protection of Photosynthesis during Water Deficit  ap. 1530-1540.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe investigated the effects of PSARK::IPT (for Senescence-Associated Receptor Kinase::Isopentenyltransferase) expression and cytokinin production on several aspects of photosynthesis in transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv SR1) plants grown under optimal or restricted (30% of optimal) watering regimes. There were no significant differences in stomatal conductance between leaves from wild-type and transgenic PSARK-IPT plants grown under optimal or restricted watering. On the other hand, there was a significant reduction in the maximum rate of electron transport as well as the use of triose-phosphates only in wild-type plants during growth under restricted watering, indicating a biochemical control of photosynthesis during growth under water deficit. During water deficit conditions, the transgenic plants displayed an increase in catalase inside peroxisomes, maintained a physical association among chloroplasts, peroxisomes, and mitochondria, and increased the CO₂ compensation point, indicating the cytokinin-mediated occurrence of photorespiration in the transgenic plants. The contribution of photorespiration to the tolerance of transgenic plants to water deficit was also supported by the increase in transcripts coding for enzymes involved in the conversion of glycolate to ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate. Moreover, the increase in transcripts indicated a cytokinin-induced elevation in photorespiration, suggesting the contribution of photorespiration in the protection of photosynthetic processes and its beneficial role during water stress.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aelectron transfer 3aenzymes 3aleaf conductance 3aperoxisomes 3aphotorespiration 3aplant growth 3areceptors 3astomatal conductance 3atobacco 3atransgenic plants 3awater stress 2aCarbon Dioxidexmetabolism 2aCatalasexmetabolism 2aChloroplastsxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aCytokininsxphysiology 2aElectron Transportxphysiology 2aMitochondriaxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aModels, Biological 2aPeroxisomesxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aPhotosynthesisxphysiology 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aStress, Physiological 2aTobaccoxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aWaterxmetabolism1 aShulaev, Vladimir1 aBlumwald, Eduardo0 tPlant physiology.g2009 July, v. 150, no. 3 p.1530-1540dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.109.1393783Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02281naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002100143245007700164300001800241520111600259650001901375650001301394650000801407650001201415650001501427650001401442650000901456650001201465650001601477651002101493651001501514651001401529700002001543773012701563852000901690856008301699856005501782930003301837946001301870655001201883IND4389129920221122130118.0070318e20070316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438912992DNAL7 a10.1126/science.11367762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShepherd, Andrew10aRecent Sea-Level Contributions of the Antarctic and Greenland Ice Sheets  ap. 1529-1532.  aAfter a century of polar exploration, the past decade of satellite measurements has painted an altogether new picture of how Earth's ice sheets are changing. As global temperatures have risen, so have rates of snowfall, ice melting, and glacier flow. Although the balance between these opposing processes has varied considerably on a regional scale, data show that Antarctica and Greenland are each losing mass overall. Our best estimate of their combined imbalance is about 125 gigatons per year of ice, enough to raise sea level by 0.35 millimeters per year. This is only a modest contribution to the present rate of sea-level rise of 3.0 millimeters per year. However, much of the loss from Antarctica and Greenland is the result of the flow of ice to the ocean from ice streams and glaciers, which has accelerated over the past decade. In both continents, there are suspected triggers for the accelerated ice discharge--surface and ocean warming, respectively--and, over the course of the 21st century, these processes could rapidly counteract the snowfall gains predicted by present coupled climate models. 3aclimate models 3aglaciers 3aice 3amelting 3asatellites 3asea level 3asnow 3astreams 3atemperature 3aAntarctic region 3aAntarctica 3aGreenland1 aWingham, Duncan0 tScience.g2007 Mar. 16, v. 315, no. 5818 p.1529-1532dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11367763Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.scienceonline.org/3electronic resource  a20070318b20070402c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02101naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002400143245009200167300001800259520079600277650002601073650001301099650001701112650001701129650001001146650002201156650002501178650001601203650004801219650001901267650001901286700002301305700001601328700002801344773012601372852000901498856008301507856005501590930003301645946001301678655001201691IND4388843920221122130114.0070311e20070309xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438884392DNAL7 a10.1126/science.11366112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLovering, Andrew L.10aStructural Insight into the Transglycosylation Step of Bacterial Cell-Wall Biosynthesis  ap. 1402-1405.  aPeptidoglycan glycosyltransferases (GTs) catalyze the polymerization step of cell-wall biosynthesis, are membrane-bound, and are highly conserved across all bacteria. Long considered the "holy grail" of antibiotic research, they represent an essential and easily accessible drug target for antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. We have determined the 2.8 angstrom structure of a bifunctional cell-wall cross-linking enzyme, including its transpeptidase and GT domains, both unliganded and complexed with the substrate analog moenomycin. The peptidoglycan GTs adopt a fold distinct from those of other GT classes. The structures give insight into critical features of the catalytic mechanism and key interactions required for enzyme inhibition. 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteria 3abiosynthesis 3acrosslinking 3adrugs 3aenzyme inhibition 3aglycosyltransferases 3amethicillin 3amethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 3apeptidoglycans 3apolymerization1 ade Castro, Liza H.1 aLim, Daniel1 aStrynadka, Natalie C.J.0 tScience.g2007 Mar. 9, v. 315, no. 5817 p.1402-1405dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11366113Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.scienceonline.org/3electronic resource  a20070311b20070402c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01875naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100001800143245007100161300001800232520074900250650001500999650001801014650001301032650001901045650002401064650002101088650001601109650002501125700002301150700002101173773012601194852000901320856008301329856005501412930003301467946001301500655001201513IND4388844120221122130120.0070311e20070309xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438884412DNAL7 a10.1126/science.11340042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMito, Yoshiko10aHistone Replacement Marks the Boundaries of cis-Regulatory Domains  ap. 1408-1411.  aCellular memory is maintained at homeotic genes by cis-regulatory elements whose mechanism of action is unknown. We have examined chromatin at Drosophila homeotic gene clusters by measuring, at high resolution, levels of histone replacement and nucleosome occupancy. Homeotic gene clusters display conspicuous peaks of histone replacement at boundaries of cis-regulatory domains superimposed over broad regions of low replacement. Peaks of histone replacement closely correspond to nuclease-hypersensitive sites, binding sites for Polycomb and trithorax group proteins, and sites of nucleosome depletion. Our results suggest the existence of a continuous process that disrupts nucleosomes and maintains accessibility of cis-regulatory elements. 3aDrosophila 3abinding sites 3ahistones 3ahomeotic genes 3amechanism of action 3amultigene family 3anucleosomes 3aregulatory sequences1 aHenikoff, Jorja G.1 aHenikoff, Steve.0 tScience.g2007 Mar. 9, v. 315, no. 5817 p.1408-1411dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11340043Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.scienceonline.org/3electronic resource  a20070311b20070402c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03104naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003400110040001800144100001300162245008700175300002000262500001500282520123700297650001101534650002101545650002501566650002201591650002701613650001201640650001501652650003001667650002001697650001301717650001701730650003901747650002901786650002701815650002401842650003001866650002201896650002501918650005701943650002502000650003602025650003502061653003302096653002302129653001602152700001502168700001402183700002002197773009802217852000902315856008402324930003302408945001302441946001302454990002302467655001202490IND2060281920221122070659.0971027e19961220mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206028192DNAL7 a89551072pmid7 a10.1074/jbc.271.51.327372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLill, H.10aCross-linking of engineered subunit delta to (alpha beta)3 in chloroplast F-ATPase  ap. 32737-32742.  a2019-12-04  aSer replaced by Cys mutations were introduced into subunit delta of spinach chloroplast F0F1-ATPase (CF0CF1) by site-directed mutagenesis. The engineered delta subunits were overexpressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and reassembled with spinach chloroplast F1-ATPase (CF1) lacking the delta subunit (CF1(-delta)). By modification with eosin-5-maleimide, it was shown that residues 10, 57, 82, 160, and 166 were solvent-accessible in isolated CF1 and all but residue 166 also in membrane-bound CF0CF1. Modification of the engineered delta subunit with photolabile cross-linkers, binding of delta to CF1(-delta), and photolysis yielded the same SDS gel pattern of cross-link products in the presence or absence of ADP, phosphate, and ATP and both in soluble CP1 and in CF0CF1. By chemical hydrolysis of cross-linked CF1, it was shown that deltaS10C was cross-linked within the N-terminal 62 residues of subunit beta. deltaS57C, deltaS82C, and delta S166C were cross-linked within the N-terminal 192 residues of subunit alpha. Crosslinking affected neither ATP hydrolysis by soluble CF1 nor its ability to reassemble with CF0 and to structurally reconstitute ATP synthesis. Functional reconstitution, however, seemed to be impaired. 3aserine 3apyrophosphatases 3arecombinant proteins 3aSpinacia oleracea 3aadenosine triphosphate 3amutants 3ahydrolysis 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3aenzyme activity 3acysteine 3achloroplasts 2aAdenosine Triphosphatexmetabolism 2aChloroplastsxenzymology 2aCross-Linking Reagents 2aCysteinexchemistry 2aMacromolecular Substances 2aModels, Molecular 2aProtein Conformation 2aProton-Translocating ATPasesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aRecombinant Proteins 2aStructure-Activity Relationship 2aSulfhydryl Reagentsxchemistry 0ah+-transporting atp synthase 0achemical reactions 0amutagenesis1 aHensel, F.1 aJunge, W.1 aEngelbrecht, S.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1996 Dec. 20, v. 271, no. 51 p.32737-32742x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1074/jbc.271.51.327373Available from publisher's Web site  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle01614naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002000143245006400163300001600227520064600243650001000889650002000899650001200919650001900931650001000950700002200960773012500982852000901107856008301116856005501199930003301254946001301287655001201300IND4388023020221122042755.0070218e20070216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438802302DNAL7 a10.1126/science.11368552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkubo, Chris H.10aFracture-Controlled Paleo-Fluid Flow in Candor Chasma, Mars  ap. 983-985.  aColor observations from the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter reveal zones of localized fluid alteration (cementation and bleaching) along joints within layered deposits in western Candor Chasma, Mars.

These findings demonstrate that fluid flow along fractures was a mechanism by which subsurface fluids migrated through these layered deposits.

DESIGN Randomized blinded controlled trial. ANIMALS 214 calves (≥ 2 months of age) born in the spring of 2015 at an Iowa State University cow-calf research unit with no visible lesions or scars on either eye. PROCEDURES Calves were randomly allocated to receive SC administration of a single dose of a commercial vaccine against M bovis (112 enrolled and 110 analyzed) or saline (0.9% NaCl) solution (111 enrolled and 104 analyzed). Calves were monitored for signs of IBK from treatment to weaning, and body weight at weaning was recorded. People involved in calf enrollment and outcome assessment were blinded to treatment group assignment. Cumulative incidence of IBK and weaning weight were compared between vaccinated and unvaccinated calves; the effect measure was the risk ratio and mean difference, respectively. RESULTS IBK was detected in 65 (59.1%) vaccinated calves and 62 (59.6%) unvaccinated calves (unadjusted risk ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval, 0.79 to 1.24) during the study period. No significant difference in weaning weights was identified between vaccinated and unvaccinated calves (unadjusted effect size, 4.40 kg [9.68 lb]; 95% confidence interval, −3.46 to 12.25 kg [−7.61 to 26.95 lb]). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Results suggested that the commercially available M bovis vaccine was not effective in reducing the cumulative incidence of IBK or increasing weaning weight in beef calves. 3aMoraxella bovis 3abeef cattle 3acalves 3aconfidence interval 3acow-calf operations 3aeyes 3akeratoconjunctivitis 3arelative risk 3asodium chloride 3aspring 3avaccines 3aweaning 3aweaning weight 3aIowa1 aEngelken, Terry J.1 aCooper, Vickie1 aO'Connor, Annette M.0 tJournal of the American Veterinary Medical Association.g2017 Aug. 1, v. 251, no. 3 p.345-351dAmerican Veterinary Medical AssociationwJournal:1913x0003-14887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/javma.251.3.345  aDNAL 7aarticle03497naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003400110040001800144100001800162245012800180300002000308520113600328650001101464650002201475650001401497650001801511650002501529650002501554650002501579650002501604650001601629650000901645650003101654650001501685650001801700650001001718650002001728650003701748650002401785650001201809650001801821650002301839650003301862650004101895650003401936650001101970650004001981650002202021650002802043650002102071650002502092650005802117650003402175650001502209650002402224653002302248653003402271653002802305653001902333700002402352700001702376700001702393700002702410700001702437773009802454852000902552856008402561930003302645945001302678946001302691990002302704655001202727IND2060283920221122033226.0971027e19961220mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206028392DNAL7 a89551382pmid7 a10.1074/jbc.271.51.329512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrégoire, C.10acDNA cloning and sequencing reveal the major horse allergen Equ c1 to be a glycoprotein member of the lipocalin superfamily  ap. 32951-32959.  aThe gene encoding the major horse allergen, designated Equus caballus allergen 1 (Equ c1), was cloned from total cDNA of sublingual salivary glands by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using synthetic degenerate oligonucleotides deduced from N-terminal and internal peptide sequences of the glycosylated hair dandruff protein. A recombinant form of the protein, with a polyhistidine tail, was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography. The recombinant protein is able to induce a passive cutaneous anaphylaxis reaction in rat, and it behaves similarly to the native Equ c1 in several immunological tests with allergic patients' IgE antibodies, mouse monoclonal antibodies, or rabbit polyclonal IgG antibodies. Amino acid sequence identity of 49-51% with rodent urinary proteins from mice and rats suggests that Equ c1 is a new member of the lipocalin superfamily of hydrophobic ligand-binding proteins that includes several other major allergens. An RNA blot analysis demonstrates the expression of mRNA Equ c1 in liver and in sublingual and submaxillary salivary glands. 3ahorses 3acomplementary DNA 3aallergens 3aglycoproteins 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3arecombinant proteins 3achemical composition 3aanaphylaxis 3amice 3aantigen-antibody reactions 3amast cells 3amessenger RNA 3aliver 3asalivary glands 2aAllergensxgeneticsximmunology. 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aGlycoproteinsxgeneticsximmunology. 2aHorsesxgeneticsximmunology. 2aHumans 2aLipoproteinsxgeneticsximmunology. 2aModels, Molecular 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultigene Family 2aRecombinant Proteins 2aSalivary Proteins and Peptidesxgeneticsximmunology. 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSolubility 2aTissue Distribution 0aallergic reactions 0apassive cutaneous anaphylaxis 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/u708231 aRosinski-Chupin, I.1 aRabillon, J.1 aAlzari, P.M.1 aDavid, Bernard,cabbé1 aDandeu, J.P.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1996 Dec. 20, v. 271, no. 51 p.32951-32959x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1074/jbc.271.51.329513Available from publisher's Web site  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle04224naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003400110040001800144100002000162245014800182300002000330500001500350520188200365650003802247650002502285650002802310650002002338650001302358650002202371650001902393650002102412650001802433650001802451650001902469650001702488650002402505650002502529650003302554650002602587650004102613650002902654650001802683650002802701650004002729650001302769650003202782650002502814650002802839650000902867650003102876650003502907650004102942650006202983650003603045653001703081653001203098653003303110653002503143653001903168653001403187700001603201773009803217852000903315856008403324930003303408945001303441946001303454990002303467655001203490IND2060283620221122033234.0971027e19961220mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206028362DNAL7 a89551322pmid7 a10.1074/jbc.271.51.329072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPinnaduwage, P.10aIn vitro interaction between a chloroplast transit peptide and chloroplast outer envelope lipids is sequence-specific and lipid class-dependent  ap. 32907-32915.  a2019-12-04  aInteraction of artificial lipid bilayers (liposomes) with the purified transit peptide (SS-tp) of the precursor form of the small subunit for ribulose-2,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (prSSU) has been studied using a vesicle-disruption assay (calcein dye release) and electron microscopy. Employing purified forms of Escherichia coli-expressed prSSU, mature small subunit, glutathione S-transferase-transit peptide fusion protein, and SS-tp in dye release studies demonstrated that lipid interaction is mediated primarily through the transit peptide. Using chemically synthesized peptides (20-mers), the lipid-interacting domain of the transit peptide was partially mapped to the C-terminal 20 amino acids of the transit peptide. Peptides corresponding to other regions of the transit peptide and control peptides promoted significantly less calcein release. Interaction between the transit peptide and the bilayer was very rapid and could not be resolved by stopped-flow fluorometry with a mixing time of <50 ms. Interaction between the peptides and bilayer was also lipid class-dependent. Disruption occurred only when the bilayer contained the galactolipid monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG). The extent of bilayer disruption directly correlated with the relative concentration of MGDG in the liposome, with maximum calcein release occurring in 20 mol % MGDG liposomes. Lipid bilayers with greater than 20 mol % MGDG could not be achieved as determined by calcein entrapment. Electron microscopy of the liposomes before and after addition of the transit peptide suggested that the transit peptide induced a dramatic reorganization of lipids. These results are discussed in light of a possible mechanism for the early steps in protein transport that may involve polymorphic changes in the envelope membrane organization to include localized non-bilayer HII structures. 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3arecombinant proteins 3aglutathione transferase 3adiacylglycerols 3azymogens 3aprotein transport 3asignal peptide 3afluorescent dyes 3abinding sites 3aPisum sativum 3alipid bilayers 3achloroplasts 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBiological Transport 2aCarrier Proteinsxmetabolism 2aCell Compartmentation 2aChloroplastsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aDiglyceridesxmetabolism 2aGalactolipids 2aGlycolipidsxmetabolism 2aIntracellular Membranesxmetabolism 2aKinetics 2aMembrane Lipidsxmetabolism 2aMicroscopy, Electron 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPeas 2aPlant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aProtein Precursorsxmetabolism 2aProtein Sorting Signalsxmetabolism. 2aRibulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylasexchemistryxmetabolism. 2aStructure-Activity Relationship 0ainteractions 0acalcein 0amonogalactosyldiacylglycerol 0aamino acid sequences 0acell membranes 0aliposomes1 aBruce, B.D.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1996 Dec. 20, v. 271, no. 51 p.32907-32915x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1074/jbc.271.51.329073Available from publisher's Web site  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle04117naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003200110040001800142100001900160245015900179300001800338520265200356650002003008650002003028650001903048650001403067650002303081650003703104650002403141650003703165650001003202650003103212650001303243650002403256653001603280653002603296653002703322700001503349700001503364773009503379852000903474856008203483930003303565945001303598946001303611990002303624655001203647IND2060268920221122033354.0971027e19970221mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206026892DNAL7 a90305522pmid7 a10.1074/jbc.272.8.49242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPollegioni, L.10aOn the mechanism of D-amino acid oxidase: structure/linear free energy correlations and deuterium kinetic isotope effects using substituted phenylglycines  ap. 4924-4934.  aThe kinetic mechanism of the reaction of D-amino acid oxidase (EC 1.4.3.3) from Trigonopsis variabilis with [alpha-1H]- and [alpha-2H]phenylglycine has been determined. The pH dependence of Vmax is compatible with pKa values of approximately 8.1 and >9.5, the former of which is attributed to a base which should be deprotonated for efficient catalysis. The deuterium isotope effect on turnover is approximately 3.9 and the solvent isotope effect approximately 1.6. The reductive half-reaction is biphasic, the first, fast phase, k2, corresponding to substrate dehydrogenation/enzyme flavin reduction and the second to conversion/release of product. Enzyme flavin reduction consists in an approach to equilibrium involving a finite rate for k-2, the reverse of k2.k2 is 28.8 and 4.6 s-1 for [alpha-1H]- and [alpha-2H]phenylglycine, respectively, yielding a primary deuterium isotope effect approximately 6. The solvent deuterium isotope effect on the apparent rate of reduction for [alpha-1H]- and [alpha-2H]phenylglycine is approximately 2.8 and approximately 5. The rates for k-2 are 4.2 and 0.9 s-1 for [alpha-1H]- and [alpha-2H]phenylglycine, respectively and the corresponding isotope effect is approximately 4.7. The isotope effect on alpha-H and the solvent one thus behave multiplicatively consistent with a highly concerted process and a symmetric transition state. The k2 and k-2 values for phenylglycines carrying the para substituents F, Cl, Br, CH3, OH, NO2 and OCH3 have been determined. There is a linear correlation of k2 with the substituent volume VM and with sigma+; k-2 correlates best with sigma or sigma+ while steric parameters have little influence. This is consistent with the transition state being structurally similar to the product. The Bronsted plot of activation energy versus apparent free energy allows the estimation of the in trinsic apparent activation energy as approximately 58 kJ.M-1. From the linear free energy correlations, the relation of activation energy versus apparent free energy and according to the theory of Marcus it is concluded that there is little if any development of charge in the transition state. This, together with the recently solved three dimensional structure of D-amino acid oxidase from pig kidney (Mattevi, A., Vanoni, M.A., Todone, F., Rizzi M., Teplyakov, A., Coda, A., Bolognesi, M., and Curti, B. (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 93, 7496-7501) argues against a carbanion mechanism in its classical formulation. Our data are compatible with transfer of a hydride from the substrate alphaC-H to the oxidized flavin N(5) position, although, clearly, they cannot prove it. 3aDeuteromycotina 3aenzyme activity 3athermodynamics 3adeuterium 3aphenolic compounds 3astructure-activity relationships 3areaction mechanisms 2aD-Amino-Acid Oxidasexmetabolism 2aFungi 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aKinetics 2aOxidation-Reduction 0aderivatives 0aamine oxidoreductases 0atrigonopsis variabilis1 aBlodig, W.1 aGhisla, S.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1997 Feb. 21, v. 272, no. 8 p.4924-4934x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1074/jbc.272.8.49243Available from publisher's Web site  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02351naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100001900143245010700162300001800269520080700287650002201094650002001116650001101136650002301147650002001170650002601190650001201216650004301228650001401271650001901285650002901304650002601333700001801359700001801377700002201395700002101417700001701438700001701455700001801472700002201490700002501512773012701537852000901664856008301673856005501756930003301811946001301844655001201857IND4388277220221122013729.0070225e20070223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438827722DNAL7 a10.1126/science.11363722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Qian-Hua10aNuclear Activity of MLA Immune Receptors Links Isolate-Specific and Basal Disease-Resistance Responses  ap. 1098-1103.  aPlant immune responses are triggered by pattern recognition receptors that detect conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or by resistance (R) proteins recognizing isolate-specific pathogen effectors. We show that in barley, intracellular mildew A (MLA) R proteins function in the nucleus to confer resistance against the powdery mildew fungus. Recognition of the fungal avirulence A10 effector by MLA10 induces nuclear associations between receptor and WRKY transcription factors. The identified WRKY proteins act as repressors of PAMP-triggered basal defense. MLA appears to interfere with the WRKY repressor function, thereby de-repressing PAMP-triggered basal defense.

Here, we present three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of the mass ejection associated with such a merger and the subsequent evolution of the ejecta, and we show that this accurately reproduces the properties of the triple-ring nebula surrounding the supernova. 3amass 3aphysics1 aPodsiadlowski, Philipp0 tScience.g2007 Feb. 23, v. 315, no. 5815 p.1103-1106dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11363513Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.scienceonline.org/3electronic resource  a20070225b20070303c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02986naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002200181245011300203300001800316500002400334500001500358506007600373520141200449506003701861650001401898650001101912650001401923650002301937650002301960650002501983650001302008650002602021650002102047650001302068650001202081650001602093650001302109653001702122700002102139700002102160700002002181700002902201700002502230773013602255852000902391856008002400655001202480IND4439070820221207093119.0100625e20100701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443907082DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.02425-092doi7 aPMC28974632pmcid7 a204531412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnson, Ethan T.10aEnhancement of Survival and Electricity Production in an Engineered Bacterium by Light-Driven Proton Pumping  ap. 4123-4129.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMicroorganisms can use complex photosystems or light-dependent proton pumps to generate membrane potential and/or reduce electron carriers to support growth. The discovery that proteorhodopsin is a light-dependent proton pump that can be expressed readily in recombinant bacteria enables development of new strategies to probe microbial physiology and to engineer microbes with new light-driven properties. Here, we describe functional expression of proteorhodopsin and light-induced changes in membrane potential in the bacterium Shewanella oneidensis strain MR-1. We report that there were significant increases in electrical current generation during illumination of electrochemical chambers containing S. oneidensis expressing proteorhodopsin. We present evidence that an engineered strain is able to consume lactate at an increased rate when it is illuminated, which is consistent with the hypothesis that proteorhodopsin activity enhances lactate uptake by increasing the proton motive force. Our results demonstrate that there is coupling of a light-driven process to electricity generation in a nonphotosynthetic engineered bacterium. Expression of proteorhodopsin also preserved the viability of the bacterium under nutrient-limited conditions, providing evidence that fulfillment of basic energy needs of organisms may explain the widespread distribution of proteorhodopsin in marine environments.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aviability 3aenergy 3aelectrons 3amembrane potential 3amarine environment 3amicrobial physiology 3alighting 3aShewanella oneidensis 3aelectric current 3alactates 3aprotons 3aproton pump 3abacteria 0atransporters1 aBaron, Daniel B.1 aNaranjo, Belén.1 aBond, Daniel R.1 aSchmidt-Dannert, Claudia1 aGralnick, Jeffrey A.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2010 July 1, v. 76, no. 13 p.4123-4129dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.02425-093Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02131naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002300115245011700138300001800255300002600273520112000299650001401419650001401433650002001447650001601467650003601483650002801519653002501547700001701572700001701589700002101606773009101627852000901718930003301727945000801760946001301768655001201781991573370950742620221121214828.0820222e198112  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI820002702DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan Rensburg, S.J.10aVitamin A status and esopohageal cancer risk: Epidemiologic and experimental evidence for a positive association  ap. 1123-1131.  ap. 1123-1131. charts.  aExtract: Patterns of dietary intake and serum levels of vitamin A were assessed in 681 rural Transkeians who had moderately low or very high risk for esophageal cancer. Deficient intakes of vitamin A in 2-4 and 6-9 year old children and nursing mothers were generally 2 or 3 times more frequent for the low risk groups. Serum levels were lower in low risk than in high risk 2-4 year old children (28 vs 34 micrograms/100 ml), as well as in 6-9 year old children (29 and 39 micrograms/100 ml). All lactating mothers had adequate-to-high serum levels. Inbred male rats were maintained on a diet containing 0 mg (supplemented the last 70 days with 3 mg), 3 mg or 30 mg retinol acetate per kg, for 160 days. All rats received 6 injections of 2 mg/kg each of the esophageal carcinogen methylbenzylnitrosamine (MBN) between the 40th and 60th day. Vitamin A deficient rats failed to develop any tumors following MBN treatment; 40 and 80% of the rats in the 3 and 30 mg/kg groups developed esophageal papillomas, respectively. Vitamin A probably promotes carcinogenesis in epithelia which are normally squamous.

Homology with insect hemolymph proteins  ap. 17937-17943.  aA previous article described the isolation of overall lambda gt22A cDNA cloned expressing the American cockroach (Periplaneta americana) Cr-PI allergens recognized by both human atopic IgE antibodies and anti-Cr-PI monoclonal antibodies (Wu, C. H., Lee, M. F., and Liao, S. C. (1995) J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 98, 352-359. This article presents the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of two cDNA clones encoding major allergens of P. americana. Clones C12 and C20 encode proteins of 685 and 631 amino acids with two potential N-glycosylation sites each. The predicted molecular weights for C12 and C20 cloned proteins are 79,300 and 75,500 with isoelectric point values of 6.26 and 6.63, which are compatible with the determined sizes (Mr 78,000 and 72,000) and isoelectric point value (6.2) of the Cr-PI allergens of P. americana. A high degree of identity (69.1%), including several overlapped predicted central antigenic determinant residues, was found between two allergens. The anti-fusion protein antibody-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was able to detect crude American cockroach extract, Cr-PI, recombinant proteins, and commercial cockroach extracts, which provides further evidence that two allergens share common antigen determinants. Recombinant allergens of clones C12 and C20 both showed 47.4% skin reactivities on 19 cockroach-sensitive asthmatic patients. Unexpectedly, although no sequence similarity was found to other known allergens, two aromatic amino acid-rich allergens were found to have a striking sequence identity to insect storage proteins (20.1-33.9%), insect juvenile hormone-suppressible proteins (30.9-36.4%), and arthropod hemocyanins (29.7-34.6%). Results suggested that two prominent allergens of P. americana are ancestrally related to these insect hemolymph protein and represent a new group of proteins in the hemocyanin superfamily. These data will now facilitate epitope-mapping studies, and the recombinant allergens may be valuable for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. 3aPeriplaneta americana 3aallergens 3acomplementary DNA 3aclones 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3aepitopes 3asequence alignment 3asequence homology 3arecombinant antigens 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aAsthmaxcomplications 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aEpitopes 2aGlycoproteins 2aHumans 2aHypersensitivityxcomplicationsxdiagnosis. 2aInsect Hormonesxgenetics 2aInsect Proteins 2aMiddle Aged 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPeriplanetaxgeneticsximmunology. 2aProteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSkin Tests 0acomparisons 0agenbank/l40818 0agenbank/l40820 0amolecular sequence data1 aLee, M.F.1 aLiao, S.C.1 aLuo, S.F.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1996 July 26, v. 271, no. 30 p.17937-17943x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1074/jbc.271.30.179373Available from publisher's Web site  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03048naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245009000181300001600271500002400287520120600311650000801517650002501525650002201550650004301572650001101615650001401626650002901640650001101669650001201680650001801692650001101710650002101721650001201742650001401754650001201768650001601780650001001796650002601806650001001832650005201842650002401894650001301918650002401931650002701955650002601982650001502008650001602023650001202039650002102051650003302072650001702105650003402122700001602156700001802172700001302190700001402203700001802217773008202235852000902317856004802326655001202374IND4413747020221121182523.0081212e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441374702DNAL7 a189853812pmid7 a10.1007/s00425-008-0832-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCui, Haifeng10aIntrogression of bread wheat chromatin into tall wheatgrass via somatic hybridization  ap. 323-330.  aIncludes references  aRegenerates were obtained following somatic hybridization between tall wheatgrass (Agropyron elongatum) and bread wheat (Triticum aestivum cv.

All CU progeny were phenotypically similar to the tall wheatgrass parent, while XI progeny had thinner, smoother and softer leaves. Cytological analysis showed that more wheat chromatin was present in the hybrid callus than in the R₁ and R₂ plants, and that some intercalary translocations of wheat chromosome segments were retained in the R₂ generation. AFLP profiling confirmed the presence of wheat DNA in the introgression lines. Analysis of the high molecular weight glutenin subunit content of derived seed identified three novel subunits, not present in either the wheat or the tall wheatgrass parent. Microsatellite-based profiling of the chloroplast genome of the introgression lines suggested that only chloroplast sequences from the tall wheatgrass parent were present. The specifically inherited phenomena and possible application of these hybrids are discussed. 3aDNA 3aThinopyrum elongatum 3aTriticum aestivum 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3acallus 3achromatin 3achromosome translocation 3agenome 3ahybrids 3aintrogression 3aleaves 3amolecular weight 3aparents 3aphenotype 3aprogeny 3aprotoplasts 3aseeds 3asomatic hybridization 3awheat 2aAmplified Fragment Length Polymorphism Analysis 2aChromatinxgenetics 2aGenotype 2aGlutensxmetabolism 2aHybridization, Genetic 2aIn Situ Hybridization 2aInbreeding 2aKaryotyping 2aMeiosis 2aMolecular Weight 2aProtein Subunitsxmetabolism 2aRegeneration 2aTriticumxcytologyxgenetics.1 aYu, Zhiyong1 aDeng, Jingyao1 aGao, Xin1 aSun, Yang1 aXia, Guangmin0 tPlanta.g2009 Jan., v. 229, no. 2 p.323-330dSpringer-Verlagx0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-008-0832-z 7aarticle02504naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245013800163300001600301500002400317520153100341650001501872650001301887650001301900650001201913650001501925650001001940650001801950650001601968651001201984700001901996773009402015852000902109856004802118655001202166IND4400810820221121182605.0080203e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440081082DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-007-9186-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZingel, Priit12aA comparison of zooplankton densities and biomass in Lakes Peipsi and Võrtsjärv (Estonia): rotifers and crustaceans versus ciliates  ap. 153-159.  aIncludes references  aThe abundance and biomass of ciliates, rotifers, cladocerans and copepods were studied in Lake Peipsi and Lake Võrtsjärv, both of which are shallow, turbid and large. Our hypothesis was that in a large shallow eutrophic lake, the ciliates could be the most important zooplankton group. The mean metazooplankton biomass was higher in Peipsi than in Võrtsjärv (mean values and SD, 1.8 ± 0.7 and 1.3 ± 0.6 mg WM l-¹). In Peipsi, the metazooplankton biomass was dominated by filtrators that feed on large-sized phytoplankton and are characteristic of oligo-mesotrophic waters. In Võrtsjärv, the metazooplankton was dominated by species characteristic of eutrophic waters. The planktonic ciliates in both lakes were dominated by oligotrichs. The biomass of ciliates was much greater in Võrtsjärv (mean 2.3 ± 1.4 mg WM l-¹) than in Peipsi (0.1 ± 0.08 mg WM l-¹). Ciliates formed about 60% of the total zooplankton biomass in Võrtsjärv but only 6% in Peipsi. Thus, the food chains in the two lakes differ: a grazing food chain in Peipsi and a detrital food-chain in Võrtsjärv. Consequently, top-down control of phytoplankton can be assumed to be much more important in Peipsi than in Võrtsjärv. When the detrital food chain prevails, the planktonic ciliates become the most important zooplankton group in shallow, eutrophic and large lake. Neglecting protozooplankton can result in serious underestimates of total zooplankton biomass since two-thirds of the zooplankton biomass in Võrtsjärv comprises ciliates. 3aCiliophora 3aCopepoda 3aRotifera 3abiomass 3afood chain 3alakes 3aphytoplankton 3azooplankton 3aEstonia1 aHaberman, Juta0 tHydrobiologia.g2008 Mar., v. 599, no. 1 p.153-159dSpringer Netherlandsx0018-81587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-007-9186-y 7aarticle03555naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245006200171300001600233500002400249500001500273520205500288650002102343650001602364650001302380650000902393650001602402650001102418650002002429650001302449650003702462650001602499650001302515650001402528650002502542650001402567650001702581650001802598653001602616653001602632700002002648700002102668700001702689700003502706700002202741700003002763700002202793700002202815773011202837852000902949856005502958655001203013IND4426988120221121144714.0091011e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442698812DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4514.2009.00244.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPARK, YONG-SEO10aRadical scavenging capacity of ethylene-treated kiwifruit  ap. 674-692.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aThe aim of this investigation was to compare the content of the polyphenols and ascorbic acid and the radical scavenging capacity of ethylene-treated and nontreated kiwifruit. It was found that the contents of these bioactive compounds determined by UV spectroscopy and fluorometry were higher in ethylene-treated kiwifruit than in the nontreated ones. In order to support the obtained data, two different antioxidant assays were used. Antioxidant capacity in total polyphenol extracts of treated kiwifruit measured by ferric-reducing/antioxidant power (FRAP) and Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) assays were significantly higher than that of nontreated. Higher correlation coefficients were obtained with polyphenols and antioxidant activity than with ascorbic acid. FRAP produced the most consistent measurements for ethylene-treated kiwifruit. The investigated samples showed similar protein bands during the whole period of treatment. Main protein bands appeared in the range of 20-35 kDa. The radical scavenging capacity of the kiwifruit can be used for the determination of the ripening. It is an established fact that supplementation of diet with fruits prevents atherosclerosis and other diseases. A new method was developed and applied for estimation of the duration of kiwifruit ethylene treatment, which is based on the comparison of the radical scavenging capacity and polyphenols in treated and nontreated fruits. Radical scavenging capacity can be determined by different antioxidant tests, which makes such application easy to use practically. The results of this research showed that the bioactivity of kiwifruit increased during the ethylene treatment and its maximum was registered at the sixth day. This is the maximum of the treatment of the fruit, and the bioactive compounds achieved the peak amounts. The main bioactive compounds in kiwifruit with high antioxidant activity prevent the oxidation of low density cholesterol, and can be recommended as a supplementation to the diet and as a part in functional foods. 3afunctional foods 3afluorometry 3aethylene 3adiet 3apolyphenols 3afruits 3aatherosclerosis 3aproteins 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3acholesterol 3aripening 3aoxidation 3aantioxidant activity 3akiwifruit 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 0amethodology 0anew methods1 aJUNG, SOON-TECK1 aKANG, SEONG-GOOK1 aHŏ, Puk-ku.1 aLee, Paul S.q(Paul Sang Hyun)1 aToledo, Fernando.1 aARANCIBIA-AVILA, PATRICIA1 aDRZEWIECKI, JERZY1 aGORINSTEIN, SHELA0 tJournal of food biochemistry.g2009 Oct., v. 33, no. 5 p.674-692dBlackwell Publishing Incx0145-88847nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4514.2009.00244.x 7aarticle02376naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245011900174500001400293520102000307650001601327650001701343650001901360650002601379650002001405650001401425650002501439650000901464650001801473650001001491650001501501650002301516650003001539650001301569651001101582700002401593700001801617700002601635700002001661700002201681773014601703856005101849961000901900852000901909655001201918IND60673973720221121113402.0191022s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067397372DNAL7 a10.530 4/jafscd.2019.09B.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerringa, Krista M.12aA holistic definition of healthy traditional harvest practices for rural Indigenous communities in Interior Alaska  aNAL-light  aTraditional harvest practices of the harvesting and sharing of fish, wildlife, and other wild resources are an integral source of food security that support physical, mental, and spiritual wellness, education, socio-economic development, and cultural identity of Indigenous communities in Interior Alaska. Many significant changes, including climate change, are impacting this way of life and challenging secure access to foods vital for sustenance and cultural preservation. We use a case study approach to develop a holistic and place-based definition of traditional harvest practices of Indigenous communities in rural Interior Alaska that expands upon commonly accepted definitions of food security. This definition emphasizes the role of ecological health, culture, and decision-making power in strengthening food security and sovereignty. We also highlight how multi stake holer partnerships foster capacity building that can support communities in their efforts to advocate for food security and sovereignty. 3aagriculture 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3acommunity development 3adecision making 3aeducation 3aenvironmental health 3afish 3afood security 3afoods 3aharvesting 3aindigenous peoples 3asocioeconomic development 3awildlife 3aAlaska1 aHuntington, Orville1 aWoods, Brooke1 aChapin, F.

In this study, we study whether the leaf type is related to the growth environment and/or life form type, even in a tropical rain forest, where most trees have evergreen leaves that are generally homobaric. Accordingly, we investigated the distribution of leaf morphological differences across different life forms of 250 tree species in 45 families in a tropical rainforest. In total, 151 species (60%) in 36 families had homobaric leaves, and 99 species (40%) in 21 families had heterobaric leaves. We found that the proportion of heterobaric and homobaric leaf species differed clearly across taxonomic groups and life form types, which were divided into five life form types by their mature tree heights (understory, subcanopy, canopy, and emergent species) and as canopy gap species. Most understory (94%) and subcanopy (83%) species such as Annonaceae had homobaric leaves. In contrast, heterobaric leaf trees appeared more frequently in the canopy species (43%), the emergent species (96%) (such as Dipterocarpaceae), and the canopy gap species (62%). Our results suggest that tree species in the tropical rainforest adapt to spatial differences in the environmental conditions experienced at the mature height of each tree species, such as light intensity and vapor pressure difference, by having differing leaf types (heterobaric or homobaric) because these types potentially have different physiological and/or mechanical functions. 3aAnnonaceae 3aDipterocarpaceae 3acanopy gaps 3aenvironmental factors 3aleaves 3alight intensity 3alowlands 3atrees 3atropical rain forests 3aunderstory 3avapor pressure1 aIchie, Tomoaki1 aWatanabe, Yōko.1 aHiromi, Toru0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2007 May, v. 94, no. 5 p.764-775dBotanical Society of Americax0002-91227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.94.5.7643Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.amjbot.org/ 7aarticle02737naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003100145245015300176300001600329500002400345500001500369520145900384650001401843650001901857650001301876650000901889650001601898650001601914650001101930650002301941650002601964650001901990650001602009650002102025653001502046700002402061700001802085700003002103700001702133773009602150852000902246856004802255655001202303IND4434939320221121062642.0100402e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443493932DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-009-0205-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchulte auf'm Erley, Gunda10aPhotosynthesis and leaf-nitrogen dynamics during leaf senescence of tropical maize cultivars in hydroponics in relation to N efficiency in the field  ap. 313-328.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe selection process of nitrogen (N)-efficient cultivars during plant breeding could be simplified by a specification of secondary plant traits that are decisive for N efficiency. It was shown that leaf senescence under N deprivation of sixteen tropical maize cultivars in a short-term nutrient solution experiment was related to leaf senescence and grain yield under N deficiency (N efficiency) in field experiments. In this study we investigated if a quantification of leaf- and plant-N flows by ¹⁵N labelling can improve the evaluation of genotypic differences in leaf senescence in short-term experiments. Cultivars differed in leaf-N content prior to senescence; however, this appeared to have no significant impact on the development of leaf senescence. N import into senescing leaves was not related to total plant N uptake, but seems to have been regulated by leaf-inherent factors. Leaf N remaining in the leaf seems to have comprised inefficiently remobilized leaf N, at least during early senescence stages. Photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll contents at early senescence stages depended on additional factors to leaf-N content. Nevertheless, all parameters used to characterize leaf senescence were related to leaf senescence at anthesis in field experiments. However, only photosynthetic rate during late leaf senescence reflected cultivar differences in leaf senescence during reproductive growth and N efficiency in field experiments. 3acultivars 3aplant breeding 3anitrogen 3acorn 3ahydroponics 3agrain yield 3aleaves 3anutrient solutions 3afield experimentation 3aphotosynthesis 3achlorophyll 3aleaf development 0asenescence1 aAmbebe, Titus Fondo1 aWorku, Mosisa1 aBänziger, M.q(Marianne)1 aHorst, W.

A role for the variable domain in activation  ap. 19846-19851.  aIsoforms of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II from Drosophila (R1-R6 and R3A) showed differential activation by two series of mutant calmodulins, B1K-B4K and B1Q-B4Q. These mutant calmodulins were generated by changing a glutamic acid in each of the four calcium binding sites to either glutamine or lysine, altering their calcium binding properties. All mutations produced activation defects, with the binding site 4 and B1Q mutants the most severe. Activation differed substantially between isoforms. R4, R5, and R6 were the least sensitive to mutations in calmodulin, while R1, R3, and R3A were the most sensitive. Activation of R1 and R2 by B4K and activation of R3 and R3A by B2K and B2Q produced significant (6-fold and almost 3-fold, respectively) differences in K(act) between isoforms that differ structurally by a single amino acid. These differences could not be accounted for by differential binding, as all isoforms showed almost identical binding patterns with the mutants. High binding affinity did not always correlate with ability to increase enzyme activity, implying that activation occurs in at least two steps. The isoform-specific differences seen in this study reflect a role for the COOH-terminal variable region in activation of CaM kinase II. 3aDrosophila 3acalmodulin 3aisozymes 3aalternative splicing 3aenzyme activity 3amutants 3ainorganic ions 3acalcium 3aenzyme activation 3abinding sites 2aAlternative Splicing 2aAnimals 2aCalciumxmetabolism 2aCalcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 2 2aCalcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinasesxmetabolism 2aCalmodulinxmetabolism 2aDrosophila melanogasterxenzymology 2aEnzyme Activation 2aIsoenzymesxmetabolism 2aKinetics 2aStructure-Activity Relationship 0abinding1 aBeckingham, K.1 aGriffith, L.C.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1996 Aug. 16, v. 271, no. 33 p.19846-19851x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1074/jbc.271.33.198463Available from publisher's Web site  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle01367naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245017000169300001800339500002400357500001500381520038300396650002500779650001200804650001200816650001300828650001100841650001500852653002000867773010900887852000900996856004801005655001201053IND4447651520221121052100.0110121e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444765152DNAL7 a10.1134/S00138738100900222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOvchinnikova, O.

We tested the hypothesis that global warming is in motion in California and is causing accumulated winter chill to decrease across the fruit and nut growing regions of California. The detection of potential trends in accumulated winter chill (between 0 and 7.2°C) was determined using two complementary climate datasets. The California Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS) contains hourly climate data and is suitable for computing accumulated chill hours and chill degree-hours. But, its longest data records extend back only to the 1980s. The National Weather Service Coop climate record is longer, extending beyond the 1950s at many sites. But its datasets only contain information on daily maximum and minimum temperatures. To assess long term trends in winter chill accumulation, we developed an algorithm that converted information from daily maximum and minimum temperature into accumulated hours of winter chill and summations of chill-degree hours. These inferred calculations of chill hour accumulation were tested with and validated by direct measurements from hourly-based data from the CIMIS network. With the combined climate datasets, we found that the annual accumulation of winter chill hours and chill degree hours is diminishing across the fruit and nut growing regions of California. Observed trends in winter chill range between -50 and -260 chill hours per decade. We also applied our analytical algorithm to project changes in winter chill using regional climate projections of temperature for three regions in the Central Valley. Predicted rates of reduced winter chill, for the period between 1950 and 2100, are on the order of -40 h per decade. By the end of the 21st century, orchards in California are expected to experience less than 500 chill hours per winter. This chronic and steady reduction in winter chill is expected to have deleterious economic and culinary impact on fruit and nut production in California by the end of the 21st Century. 3aclimate 3acooling 3aeconomic impact 3afruit growing 3afruiting 3aglobal warming 3aheat sums 3airrigation management 3amanagement information systems 3aorchards 3awinter 3aCalifornia1 aWong, Simon0 tClimatic change.g2008 Mar., v. 87, no. 1 p.153-166dSpringer Netherlandsx0165-00097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-007-9367-8 7aarticle01800naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245014300168300001600311500002400327520084600351650002101197650001101218650001601229650002101245650002001266700002001286700002201306773011301328852000901441856004801450655001201498IND4438472320221121030221.0100611e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443847232DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-009-0242-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlsheyab, Mohammad10aEngineering Aspects of Electrochemical Generation of Ferrate: A Step Towards Its Full Scale Application for Water and Wastewater Treatment  ap. 203-210.  aIncludes references  aThe objective of this paper is to design a pilot plant electrochemical reactor and to prove the operational concept of the electrochemical production of ferrate in situ and its online application for sewage treatment.

J. Chang et B. F. Zheng, and four “interspecific hybridization” strains of these two species are investigated. The rbcL genes of 11 samples were amplified and sequenced, each of which were about 1,400 bp with a good specificity. The results of pair-wise distance matrix and multi-alignment showed that pair-wise distance were small while homologous index was large between strains Y-2066, Y-k2001, and Y-H001. These two indexes showed the same level as the above between strains H-2001, Y-hyC₁, and Y-hyC₂; however, the distances were larger between three former strains and three latter strains. Cluster trees showed the same trend. Fertile strains appeared after 2 years of culture of unfertile interspecific hybridization conchocelis and were separated from that based on different colors. Our finding that these fertile strains can bear offspring is important for understanding the interspecies hybridization of Porphyra. Molecular analysis of the fertile strains based on rbcL gene showed maternal inheritance. We inferred that somatic recombination was one of the reasons making interspecific hybridization strains fertile. 3aConchocelis 3aPorphyra 3agenes 3ainterspecific hybridization 3anucleotide sequences1 aYang, Lian.1 aZhu, Jianyi1 aXu, Hao1 aLu, Qinqin0 tJournal of applied phycology.g2011 Apr., v. 23, no. 2 p.235-241dSpringer Netherlandsx0921-89717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-010-9537-3 7aarticle02072naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126100002200144245010300166300001600269520104200285650002001327650002501347650001101372650001101383650001001394650001701404650001901421650001301440650001401453650001701467651000901484773007801493852000901571856008401580939003301664946001301697655001201710IND4444175920221120152306.0101025e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444417592DNAL7 a10.3098/ah.2010.84.4.4232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiamond, David H.10aOrigins of pioneer apple orchards in the American West: random seeding versus artisan horticulture  ap. 423-450.  aBefore the Revolution, colonial American consumers reconstituted the English apple orchard. Unremarkable random seedling apples and "high" flavored English cider fruits were devalued. Late colonial consumers selected a range of sweeter, more versatile apples for fresh use and culinary preparations, others for drying, and many "winter keepers" for long-term storage. These trees were supplied by distinctive, horticulturally trained farmers who produced grafted trees as part of their mixed crop output. Demand for this first catalog of American apple trees exploded in the Ohio Valley, where surging farm establishment fueled commercial agricultural enterprises. By 1800 pioneer artisan horticulturists were selling America's favorite cultivated apple tree varieties to frontier farmers while mythologized peddlers of unimproved, random seedlings contributed only marginally. By 1820 craft nurserymen marketed tens of thousands of grafted apple trees annually and were among the most commercially oriented farmers in the Old Northwest. 3aMalus domestica 3aagricultural history 3aapples 3aciders 3afarms 3ahorticulture 3amixed cropping 3aorchards 3aseedlings 3astorage time 3aOhio0 tAgricultural history.g2010 Fall, v. 84, no. 4 p.423-450x0002-14827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3098/ah.2010.84.4.4233Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20120125  aOther US 7aarticle02730naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245012500166300001600291500002400307520139300331650002801724650001301752650000901765650001101774650001601785650001201801650002501813650001201838650002301850650001601873650001801889650000701907650001601914650001601930650001701946700002801963700001801991700002002009700001902029700002102048700002302069773011102092852000902203856004802212655001202260IND4431481020100206011756.0100115e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443148102DNAL7 a10.1007/s00217-009-1206-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl-Ghaish, Shady10aCharacterization of a new isolate of Lactobacillus fermentum IFO 3956 from Egyptian Ras cheese with proteolytic activity  ap. 635-643.  aIncludes references  aMore than 200 isolates were obtained from 15 Egyptian traditional dairy products (Domiatti cheese, Ras cheese and Rayeb milk) collected from local markets of Alexandria, Tanta and Kafr El-Sheikh. Examination with optical microscope of these dairy samples allowed to classify 92 bacilli, 64 of which were identified as lactobacilli. The proteolytic activity of lactobacilli isolates was tested on skim milk agar. Eight isolates showing a high proteolytic activity were further tested on UHT skim milk. The strain showing the highest proteolytic activity was purified and identified as Lactobacillus fermentum IFO 3656. The specific proteolytic activity of this strain and the factors affecting it (pH, temperature and presence of inhibitors) were studied. The proteolysis targeted mainly caseins (73% of whole casein), especially β-casein (85%). Smaller portions of whey proteins were proteolyzed (20%) essentially β-lactoglobulin. The proteolysis process gave rise to medium-sized peptide populations. The optimum conditions for the proteolysis activity of the studied strains were pH 6.5 and 37 °C. Proteolytic activities were very slightly affected by the increase of the temperature to 42 °C or the pH to 8.2. The protease system of Lactobacillus fermentum IFO 3956 is most probably composed from a high amount of metalloproteases and small amount of cysteine and serine proteases. 3aLactobacillus fermentum 3aUHT milk 3aagar 3acasein 3acheese milk 3acheeses 3acysteine proteinases 3amarkets 3ametalloproteinases 3amicroscopes 3amilk analysis 3apH 3aproteolysis 3atemperature 3awhey protein1 aDalgalarrondo, Michèle1 aChoiset, Yvan1 aSitohy, Mahmoud1 aIvanova, Iskra1 aHaertlé, Thomas1 aChobert, Jean-Marc0 tEuropean food research & technology.g2010 Feb., v. 230, no. 4 p.635-643dSpringer-Verlagx1438-23777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00217-009-1206-x 7aarticle02040naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245006700129300001600196500001500212520111800227650001101345650002701356650002501383650001501408650001501423653002301438653001201461653001701473653001301490653001001503700002201513773010201535852000901637939003301646946001101679655001201690IND9305390820221120143319.0930917e199304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930539082DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRichards, P.J.10aPrediction of raingun application patterns in windy conditions  ap. 281-291.  a2019-12-04  aA semi-empirical model has been developed for predicting the distortion by wind of raingun application patterns. The model can be calibrated from three full-circle wetting pattern field tests and used to predict wetting patterns at any intermediate wind speed and for any sector angle, thus providing data for raingun evaluation. For large sprinklers and rainguns, the water jet induces flow of the surrounding air mass, reducing air resistance and enhancing throw. The model assumes that the distortion of the irrigation pattern by wind is due to the combination of wind drift and range shortening due to disruption of the induced air flow, and that the disruption of the air flow is proportional to the component of the wind velocity perpendicular to the jet near the nozzle. The model was tested against 18 other measured patterns and, except in one case, achieved a reasonable degree of fit with standard deviations of the errors between 1.4 and 3.4 mm/h compared to peak application rates between 23.8 and 30.6 mm/h and a typical standard deviation in the field measurements of 1.55 mm/h due to non-symmetry. 3amodels 3aapplication technology 3asprinkler irrigation 3awind speed 3aprediction 0airrigation systems 0awetting 0awind effects 0apatterns 0adrift1 aWeatherhead, E.K.0 tJournal of agricultural engineering research.g1993 Apr., v. 54, no. 4 p.281-291x0021-86347nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03934naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245010900168300001600277500002400293520260700317650003002924650001502954650001902969650001602988650001403004650002203018650001003040650002103050650002103071650002103092650001403113650002203127650001403149650001503163650002503178650001803203651001003221700002703231700002003258700001803278700001703296773009403313852000903407856004803416655001203464IND4415644920221120143135.0090130e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441564492DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-008-9683-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKock Rasmussen, E.10aHydrodynamic-ecological model analyses of the water quality of Lake Manzala (Nile Delta, Northern Egypt)  ap. 195-220.  aIncludes references  aLake Manzala remains the largest of the Nile Delta lakes and has undergone substantial recent changes particularly over the last 30 years due to regulation of freshwater inflows, land reclamation and increasing loads of BOD and nutrients. The latter are particularly associated with polluted drains flowing into the lake. An increasing fraction of the N load may also come from the expanding fish farming industry within and around the lake. Over the past 20-25 years, the N load from the drains has increased three times whilst the P load has remained approximately constant. This is despite a 40% reduction in freshwater inflows due to diversion of water towards the Sinai for land development. As a result of these changes, the concentration of total N in the drains has increased 4.5 times while the total P concentration has increased by 50% over the same period. Increases in nutrient concentrations can be attributed to increase in the use of fertilizer combined with an expanding population served by sewers, improved living standards and increased industrial production. Nutrient enrichment has resulted in declining water quality and eutrophication, especially in the southern parts of Lake Manzala. A combined hydrodynamic-ecological model has been set up for the lake and is used to analyse the development of water quality as a function of the load of organic material and nutrients. Model results show that 86% of the N load and 59% of the P load are retained within the lake. Despite the efficient treatment of wastewater by the lake ecosystem, approximately 6,000 tonnes of N and 1,300 tonnes of P are exported to the Mediterranean through the two main lake-sea connections. This nutrient export has important implications for coastal fisheries production. The present investigation suggests that the current anthropogenic nutrient load to the coastal zone exceeds that of pre-Aswan High Dam conditions despite large reductions in the annual pulse of water and nutrients brought about by the dam. A series of model simulations with reduced nutrient load are investigated in order to identify the conditions required to enable the propagation of vegetation throughout the lake. Submerged rooted vegetation is used as an indicator for water quality as it needs light for growth and in polluted, eutrophicated waters turbidity increases hampering vegetation growth. Simulation results indicate that the nutrient load has to be reduced to approximately 25% of the present loads if submerged rooted vegetation is to become re-established in the more polluted south eastern parts of the lake. 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3aecosystems 3aeutrophication 3afertilizers 3afisheries 3ahydrologic models 3alakes 3aland restoration 3anitrogen content 3anutrient content 3anutrients 3asimulation models 3aturbidity 3avegetation 3awastewater treatment 3awater quality 3aEgypt1 aSvenstrup Petersen, O.1 aThompson, J.

We used a null model to address this question by testing for non-random organization of forest species according to maximum height, a trait associated with competitive ability for light. Specifically, we compared the species present in 409 different temperate forest plots with the pool of potentially present species (n=639 species), spanning a 50 000 km² area of southern Ontario, Canada. In contrast to current theory, coexisting forest species were neither more similar (i.e. convergent), nor more different (i.e. limiting similarity) in maximum height than expected by chance. However, coexisting forest species had larger maximum heights on average, and their maximum heights were more symmetrically distributed than expected by chance, suggesting that competition has reduced the representation of smaller plant species within plots (i.e. higher turn-over of species with smaller maximum heights among forest plots). We explored the possibility that our findings resulted from smaller species having relatively narrower niches; however, a conclusive test of this explanation will require knowledge of fundamental, rather than realized niche breadth. We also tested the prediction that the influence of competition changes along gradients of productivity and disturbance by examining how the effect size of our null model tests changed along these gradients. We observed that species with smaller maximum heights were increasingly under-represented in more productive forest communities, suggesting an increased role for competition in determining species membership in more productive communities. In contrast to theory, however, the effect size of our tests did not significantly change along a gradient of forest disturbance. In summary, we found evidence that maximum species height plays a significant role in driving the non-random organization of plant species among hundreds of mature forest plots, and that this role is more pronounced in more productive forest plots. ¹ 3aforest communities 3amodels 3aniches 3aprediction 3atemperate forests 3aOntario1 aAarssen, Lonnie W.0 tOikos.g2009 Apr., v. 118, no. 4 p.564-572dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0030-12997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0706.2009.16589.x 7aarticle02838naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245007700128300001600205500001500221520172500236650001601961650001101977650001301988650001302001650001502014650000902029650002402038650001502062650001102077650002202088650002302110650001102133650001802144650001602162650001202178651001202190653002302202653001402225700001702239773008302256852000902339939003302348946001102381655001202392IND9305389820221120143254.0930917e19930601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930538982DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShanley, J.B.10aVariations in aqueous sulfate concentrations at Panola Mountain, Georgia  ap. 361-382.  a2019-12-04  aAqueous sulfate concentrations were measured in incident precipitation, canopy throughfall, stemflow, soil water, groundwater, and streamwater at three locations in a 41 ha forested watershed at Panola Mountain State Park in the Georgia Piedmont. To evaluate the variations in sulfate concentrations, sampling intensity was increased during storms by automated collection of surface water and by incremental subsampling of rainfall, throughfall, and soil solution. Canopy throughfall, stemflow, and runoff from a bedrock outcrop in the watershed headwaters were enriched in sulfate relative to incident precipitation due to washoff of dry deposition that accumulated between storms. Soil waters collected from zero-tension lysimeters at 15 cm and 50 cm below land surface also were enriched in sulfate relative to precipitation, groundwater and streamwater. Sulfate concentrations in groundwater and in streamwater at base flow varied in an annual sinusoidal pattern with winter maxima and summer minima. Stream discharge and groundwater levels varied in a similar annual pattern in phase with the sulfate concentrations. The temporal variability of sulfate concentrations at most groundwater sites was small relative to the spatial variability among groundwater sites. Streamwater sulfate concentrations during base flow were controlled by low-sulfate groundwater discharge. As flow increased, an increasing proportion of shallow, high-sulfate groundwater and soil water contributed to streamflow. The dominant control on stream sulfate concentration shifted from sulfate retention by adsorption in the mineral soil at base flow to mobilization of sulfate from the upper, organic-rich horizons of the soil at high flow. 3athroughfall 3awinter 3asulfates 3astemflow 3awatersheds 3arain 3awatershed hydrology 3asoil water 3asummer 3aspatial variation 3aseasonal variation 3astorms 3asurface water 3agroundwater 3aforests 3aGeorgia 0atemporal variation 0aretention1 aPeters, N.E.0 tJournal of hydrology.g1993 June 1, v. 146, no. 1/4 p.361-382x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03137naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245015600166300001600322500002400338520194600362650001502308650002302323650002102346650002502367650001202392650001102404650003202415653002302447653002402470653002902494653002702523653003302550653003102583773009202614852000902706856004802715655001202763IND4437084120221120143109.0100514e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443708412DNAL7 a10.1007/s11284-010-0690-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPodlaski, Rafał10aDiversity of patch structure in Central European forests: are tree diameter distributions in near-natural multilayered Abies-Fagus stands heterogeneous  ap. 599-608.  aIncludes references  aNear-natural multilayered Abies alba Mill.-Fagus sylvatica L. forests form structural mosaics and consist of patches in different developmental stages and phases. Knowledge of the diversity of patch structure and adequate methods to describe the diameter structure is essential for modeling forest dynamics. The hypotheses tested in the study are that near-natural multilayered stands are structurally heterogeneous (i.e., tree diameter (DBH) distributions of these stands are heterogeneous) and, that in these forests the finite-mixture models are suitable for modeling the empirical DBH distributions. Diversity of patch structure was studied based on data collected from 33 sample plots. In multilayered stands, four groups of empirical DBH distributions were distinguished using hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and correspondence analysis (CA). Stands investigated are structurally heterogeneous; 27% multilayered stands showed the slightly rotated sigmoid (SRS) type of empirical DBH distribution, 34% the distinctly rotated sigmoid (DRS) type, 18% the bimodal M-shaped (BMS) type, and 21% the unimodal highly skewed (UHS) type. The gamma distribution, the two-component mixture gamma model, and the two-component mixture Weibull model were more flexible for the SRS type of DBH distributions. The average p-values (Chi-square test) for these theoretical distributions were 0.4712, 0.4718, and 0.4660, respectively. The two-component mixture gamma model and the two-component mixture Weibull model were a good choice for modeling the DRS, BMS, and UHS types of DBH distributions. The average p-values (Chi-square test) for these models ranged from 0.2684 to 0.4854. In near-natural multilayered Abies-Fagus forest patches of different DBH distributions occur together. The empirical DBH distributions in these stands are characterized by irregular and complicated shapes and therefore are best approximated by finite-mixture models. 3aAbies alba 3aWeibull statistics 3acluster analysis 3adevelopmental stages 3aforests 3amodels 3atree and stand measurements 0aDiameter structure 0aMultilayered stands 0aStructural heterogeneity 0aEnvironmental modeling 0aTwo-component mixture models 0aAbies alba-Fagus sylvatica0 tEcological research.g2010 May, v. 25, no. 3 p.599-608dSpringer Japanx0912-38147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11284-010-0690-6 7aarticle02889naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245015900165300001600324500002400340520175700364650001502121650001302136650002302149650002602172650000902198650001402207650002202221650002102243651001602264700002702280700002002307700003202327773011102359852000902470856004802479655001202527IND4404950720221120091831.0080425e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440495072DNAL7 a10.1007/s11273-007-9068-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWatts, Corinne.12aA comparison of restoration techniques to accelerate recovery of litter decomposition and microbial activity in an experimental peat bog restoration trial  ap. 199-217.  aIncludes references  aRestoration of mined Restionaceae-dominated peat bogs in northern New Zealand is currently initiated by establishing native vegetation cover to minimise erosion of the remaining peat. The relative effects of various restoration techniques on litter decomposition and microbial activity within experimental litter bags were investigated in a restoration trial established on a mined peat surface. Decomposition and microbial activity of litter were compared between four different restoration treatments: direct transfer of intact habitat 'islands'; the addition of processed peat with seed; the addition of processed peat with no seed; and recently mined peat surface (a 'do nothing' restoration option), with the four treatments replicated at each of five distances from an undisturbed peat bog. Treatments were compared with an undisturbed peat bog (control). Litter decomposition and associated microbial respiration rates were significantly higher in the undisturbed peat bog sites than in any of the restoration treatments, but the technique used to restore mined peatlands did have a significant effect on these ecosystem process rates. Results suggest that ecosystem processes such as decomposition and microbial community activity recover faster with restoration techniques such as direct transfer of intact habitat islands, than with other techniques such as simple seed addition. However, even after 12 months, litter decomposition and microbial activity in restored habitats were still far from reaching the levels recorded in the undisturbed peat bog. In addition, there was a strong relationship between the effort (and cost) applied to plant community restoration treatments and the rate of decomposition and microbial community activity. 3aecosystems 3ahabitats 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobial communities 3apeat 3apeatlands 3aplant communities 3avegetation cover 3aNew Zealand1 aVojvodic-Vukovic, Maja1 aArnold, Greg C.1 aDidham, R.

Broad mite had not been previously reported on blackberry. The plots sampled in this study were part of a study comparing harvesting in the fall versus harvest in spring and fall, high tunnels versus ambient conditions, and three genotypes, all under organic production. Leaves were sampled, broad mites per leaf counted, and leaf area and trichome density measured. Results indicated that broad mite is capable of overwintering in a moderate temperate climate and that it reduces leaf area of primocane-fruiting blackberry. The fall-only harvest system had fewer broad mites than fall and spring harvest. There were a range of genotype effects on broad mite populations, including one genotype, ‘Prime-Jan’, on which broad mite populations remained low, and one genotype, APF-46, on which mite populations grew significantly. Observations indicate that the broad mite may be a pest of ‘Prime-Ark® 45’, another primocane-fruiting cultivar. 3aplant damage 3acultivars 3ainsect pests 3aRubus plicatus 3aplant pests 3acrop yield 3aPolyphagotarsonemus latus 3agenetic variation 3ablackberries 3aorganic production 3aprimocanes 3aArkansas 0acrop production1 aGarcia, M.

Although older adults tend to report a higher intake of fruit and vegetables than other age groups, over half of the U.S. older population does not meet the recommendation of five daily servings of fruit and vegetables. Research has shown that gardening is one way of improving fruit and vegetable intake. The primary focuses of this study were to examine and compare fruit and vegetable consumption of gardeners and nongardeners and to investigate any differences in fruit and vegetable consumption of long-term gardeners when compared with newer gardeners in adults older than age 50 years. An online survey was designed to be answered by older adults (50 years or older) and respondents self-selected themselves for inclusion in the study. A total of 261 questionnaires was completed. Data collected were analyzed using statistical procedures, including descriptive statistics, Pearson's product-moment correlations, and multivariate analysis of variance. The results of this research supports previous studies that indicated gardeners were more likely to consume vegetables when compared with nongardeners. However, these results were not found with regard to fruit consumption between gardeners and nongardeners. Additionally, the length of time an individual reported having participated in gardening activities seemed to have no relationship to the number of vegetables and fruit reported as consumed, which suggests gardening intervention programs late in life would be an effective method of boosting vegetable and fruit consumption in older adults. Gender was also evaluated with no statistically significant differences found for overall fruit and vegetable intake. 3avegetables 3aelderly 3aquestionnaires 3afood intake 3aphysical activity 3asurveys 3aquality of life 3avegetable growing 3afruit growing 3amental health 3afood consumption 3aTexas 0aUnited States 0afruits (food)1 aMcFarland, Amy L.1 aWaliczek, Tina M.1 aZajicek, Jayne M.0 tHortTechnology.g2010 Aug., v. 20, no. 4 p.711-717wJournal:2120x1063-01987nnas  aDNAL  a20101222b20110101c00000000  aINDd9CTe2010/11/20  aOther US 7aarticle03331naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002600111040001800137100002000155245016200175300001600337500002400353500001500377520149300392650002701885650001201912650002201924650001501946650001101961650002901972650002902001650001402030650003702044650001402081650003902095650001102134650002802145650006102173650002602234650003602260650002602296650009302322650006102415650001402476653002602490700003002516700001902546700001902565700003802584700001902622773008802641852000902729856003902738655001202777IND4441338420221122232529.0100813e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444133842DNAL7 a205861152pmid7 a10.1002/yea.17992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Llanos, Rosa10aDifferences in activation of MAP kinases and variability in the polyglutamine tract of Slt2 in clinical and non-clinical isolates of Saccharomyces cerevisiae  ap. 549-561.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aThe concept of Saccharomyces cerevisiae as an emerging opportunistic pathogen is relatively new and it is due to an increasing number of human infections during the past 20 years. There are still few studies addressing the mechanisms of infection of this yeast species. Moreover, little is known about how S. cerevisiae cells sense and respond to the harsh conditions imposed by the host, and whether this response is different between clinical isolates and non-pathogenic strains. In this regard, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways constitute one of the major mechanisms for controlling transcriptional responses and, in some cases, virulence in fungi. Here we show differences among clinical and non-clinical isolates of S. cerevisiae in the level of activation of the MAPKs Kss1, which controls pseudohyphal and invasive growth, and Slt2, which is required for maintaining the integrity of the cell wall under stress conditions and in the absence of stimulating conditions. Moreover, we report for the first time the existence of length variability in SLT2 alleles of strains with a clinical origin. This is due to the expansion in the number of glutamine-encoding triplets in the microsatellite region coding for the polyglutamine (poly-Q) tract of this gene, which range from 12 to more than 38 repetitions. We suggest that this variability may influence biological features of the Slt2 protein, allowing it to adapt swiftly in order to survive in unusual environments. 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aalleles 3aavirulent strains 3acell walls 3ayeasts 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3atranscription (genetics) 3avirulence 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3apathogens 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungal 2aHumans 2aIndustrial Microbiology 2aMitogen-Activated Protein Kinasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMycosesxmicrobiology 2aPeptidesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolismxpathogenicity. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aVirulence 0anonpathogenic strains1 aHernández-Haro, Carolina1 aBarrio, Eladio1 aQuerol, Amparo1 aFernández-Espinar, María Teresa1 aMolina, Maria.0 tYeast.g2010 Aug., v. 27, no. 8 p.549-561dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0749-503X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/yea.1799 7aarticle01838naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245003600172300001600208500002400224520089400248650001501142650001001157650002301167650001801190650001201208651002201220653002201242653002401264653001501288653001601303773011701319852000901436856005501445655001201500IND4428947120221122125142.0091120e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442894712DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1440-6055.2009.00715.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMajer, Jonathan10aSaga of the short-range endemic  ap. 265-268.  aIncludes references  aShort-range endemic invertebrates (SREs), by their very nature, can be threatened if an impending development overlaps their range. Since their extinction would be unacceptable under State and Federal legislation, surveys for their presence are often required before approval for a project can be granted. Annually, millions of dollars are being spent in Western Australia alone on surveys for SREs. In contrast, funds for research on non-SRE terrestrial invertebrates, which probably represent around 98% of animal species, are extremely sparse. This overview outlines the current attention that is being paid to SRE surveys, and contrasts it to the situation with the rest of the invertebrate fauna. The perils of not including terrestrial invertebrates in survey and research agendas are discussed, and more inclusive solutions which consider all terrestrial invertebrates are outlined. 3aextinction 3afauna 3aindigenous species 3ainvertebrates 3asurveys 3aWestern Australia 0abiological survey 0ashort-range endemic 0astygofauna 0atroglofauna0 tAustralian journal of entomology.g2009 Nov., v. 48, no. 4 p.265-268dBlackwell Publishing Asiax1326-67567nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1440-6055.2009.00715.x 7aarticle03132naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002700145245016800172300001600340500002400356520185100380650001802231650001202249650001302261650000902274650001302283650002602296650002402322650002702346650001902373650001602392650001402408650004702422650001202469650001102481650001402492700001902506700002502525773010302550852000902653856004802662655001202710IND4426193720221122130643.0090918e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442619372DNAL7 a10.1007/s11738-009-0311-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAgnihotri, Rajneesh K.10aImproved in vitro shoot multiplication and rooting of Dendrocalamus hamiltonii Nees et Arn.

Ex Munro has been demonstrated using single node cuttings taken from the lateral branches of a 20-year-old bush. Axillary buds on the nodal explant sprouted within 10 days of culture on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium without any plant growth substance. High-frequency proliferation was induced on the propagules (small clusters with 3-5 multiple shoots and rhizomatous portions). Subsequent removal of the shoots (about 1.5 cm) from the rhizomatous portion of propagules (shoot cut) influenced the plantlet formation capacity. A multiplication of about 20-folds was achieved on MS medium supplemented with 8 μM BAP and 1 μM NAA. Rooting efficiency was also markedly enhanced (>90%) when the propagules, following shoot cut, were placed on to MS medium supplemented with 100 μM IBA for 10 days and then transferred to IBA-free medium. This is the first report from this species where 20-fold increment in multiplication was observed at the end of second subculture followed by >90% rooting. The hardened plants, established in the field, exhibited normal growth; their physiological performance has been monitored at 6-month intervals. The rate of photosynthesis increased from 3.55 μmol CO₂ m⁻² s⁻¹ (hardened, ready for field transfer) to 5.44 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹ (6 months of field transfer); following a year of plantation net photosynthesis recorded was 14.0 μmol CO₂ m⁻² s⁻¹ while after 1.5 years it was 12.76 μmol CO₂ m⁻² s⁻¹. These values were compared with those observed for the mother bush. Genetic fidelity of these regenerants was established by RAPD analysis advocating clonal propagation of this species through nodal segment culture and its commercial cultivation. 3aDendrocalamus 3abamboos 3abranches 3abuds 3aexplants 3ain vitro regeneration 3aindole butyric acid 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3aphotosynthesis 3aplantations 3aplantlets 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3arooting 3ashoots 3asprouting1 aMishra, Janhvi1 aNandi, Shyamal Kumar0 tActa physiologiae plantarum.g2009 Sept., v. 31, no. 5 p.961-967dSpringer-Verlagx0137-58817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11738-009-0311-6 7aarticle03661naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003100133040001800164100002000182245009900202300001800301500002400319506007600343520170500419506003702124650002202161650001702183650001402200650001602214650001702230650001502247650001002262650002002272650001002292650001202302650001502314650001002329650001502339650001602354650001302370650001402383650002602397650002802423650001202451650001202463650002102475650003902496650002502535650002302560650002802583650004002611650004402651650002602695650002402721650001002745700002302755700002802778773011502806852000902921856008102930655001203011IND4421454220221207082237.0090605e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442145422DNAL7 a194037262pmid7 aPMC26899922pmcid7 a10.1104/pp.109.1382222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Dong-Xiu10aRegulation of a Chemical Defense against Herbivory Produced by Symbiotic Fungi in Grass Plants  ap. 1072-1082.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNeotyphodium uncinatum and Neotyphodium siegelii are fungal symbionts (endophytes) of meadow fescue (MF; Lolium pratense), which they protect from insects by producing loline alkaloids. High levels of lolines are produced following insect damage or mock herbivory (clipping). Although loline alkaloid levels were greatly elevated in regrowth after clipping, loline-alkaloid biosynthesis (LOL) gene expression in regrowth and basal tissues was similar to unclipped controls. The dramatic increase of lolines in regrowth reflected the much higher concentrations in young (center) versus older (outer) leaf blades, so LOL gene expression was compared in these tissues. In MF-N. siegelii, LOL gene expression was similar in younger and older leaf blades, whereas expression of N. uncinatum LOL genes and some associated biosynthesis genes was higher in younger than older leaf blades. Because lolines are derived from amino acids that are mobilized to new growth, we tested the amino acid levels in center and outer leaf blades. Younger leaf blades of aposymbiotic plants (no endophyte present) had significantly higher levels of asparagine and sometimes glutamine compared to older leaf blades. The amino acid levels were much lower in MF-N. siegelii and MF-N. uncinatum compared to aposymbiotic plants and MF with Epichloë festucae (a closely related symbiont), which lacked lolines. We conclude that loline alkaloid production in young tissue depleted these amino acid pools and was apparently regulated by availability of the amino acid substrates. As a result, lolines maximally protect young host tissues in a fashion similar to endogenous plant metabolites that conform to optimal defense theory.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFestuca pratensis 3aNeotyphodium 3aalkaloids 3aamino acids 3abiosynthesis 3aendophytes 3afungi 3agene expression 3agenes 3agrasses 3aherbivores 3ahosts 3aleaf blade 3ametabolites 3aregrowth 3asymbionts 2aAlkaloidsxmetabolism 2aAmino Acidsxmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aBiomass 2aFeeding Behavior 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungal 2aInsectaxphysiology. 2aModels, Biological 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNeotyphodiumxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aPlant Leavesxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aPoaceaexmicrobiology 2aSymbiosisxgenetics 2aWater1 aNagabhyru, Padmaja1 aSchardl, Christopher L.0 tPlant physiology.g2009 June, v. 150, no. 2 p.1072-1082dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.109.1382223Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02605naa a2200445 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097072001700115100002400132245003600156300001600192500001500208520139100223650001301614650002601627650002801653650002301681650001601704653002301720653001101743653003701754700001701791700002301808700002201831700002401853700001901877700002401896700002201920700001801942700001801960773009301978852001302071930003302084945000802117946001302125852000902138655001202147991573332590742620221122053653.0860401e19850711xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI860098052DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMacFarlane, Donald.10aDiet and coronary heart disease  ap. 118-120.  a2019-12-05  aSix letters to the editor discuss the results and implications of a reported Ireland-Boston Diet-Heart (IBDH) study in which daily consumption of various fats was expressed and analyzed in terms of the subject's caloric intake. The first letter concludes that the authors of the reported study used a contrived formula that is useless for epidemiological study and that they reanalyze their raw data without inappropriate "corrections" to see if the results are consistent with other diet-heart studies that found no relationship between dietary lipid (or cholesterol) consumption and subsequent coronary heart disease (CHD) incidence. The second letter suggests that a suspected difference in the level of exercise (rather than diet) between the experimental and control groups in the IBDH study may have contributed to the observed differences in CHD incidence. The third letter (by the author of the IBDH study report) discusses the commentaries of the first 2 letters. The fourth letter refutes the claim of the first letter that cholesterol is not a CHD risk factor with/without exercise. The fifth letter, referencing a related study, argues that lipid dietary factors are more important than exercise for CHD prevention. The final letter recommends that appropriate exercise be used to reduce CHD risk and that the influence of dietary lipids on CHD risk be studied further.

Therefore, rates design is frequently subject to normative criteria such as full cost recovery, efficiency, equity and simplicity. This paper, proposes a method of ensuring the operational effectiveness of the equity criterion. Specifically, the objective is to resolve the problem of equity caused by pricing systems involving stepwise increments in the cost of aggregate household consumption. The problem is that it is more costly to meet basic individual water needs, the larger the household concerned. This paper analyses the water rates applied in the city of Zaragoza (Spain) and proposes a new rates design based on the normative criteria referred to above, which is applicable to any city and, therefore, may be of general interest. 3acities 3ahousehold expenditure 3ahouseholds 3aprices 3aSpain 0aRates design 0aWater pricing 0aIncreasing block tariffs 0aDomestic water consumption 0aEquity 0aEfficiency1 aArbués, Fernando0 tWater resources management.g2009 Aug., v. 23, no. 10 p.2101-2118dSpringer Netherlandsx0920-47417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-008-9372-3 7aarticle03626naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001700171245016400188300001600352500002400368520186600392650001502258650002802273650001802301650001002319650001102329650001102340650001702351650002102368650001802389650000902407650001102416650002502427650001302452650001302465650001202478650004402490650002102534650002102555650001102576650002202587650000902609650002302618650004302641650004602684650002402730700001602754700001602770700001902786700001802805700001802823700002002841773009902861852000902960856005502969655001203024IND4460074220221122033122.0110715e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446007422DNAL7 a217494222pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2052.2010.02158.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBright, L.A.10aFunctional modelling of an equine bronchoalveolar lavage fluid proteome provides experimental confirmation and functional annotation of equine genome sequences  ap. 395-405.  aIncludes references  aThe equine genome sequence enables the use of high-throughput genomic technologies in equine research, but accurate identification of expressed gene products and interpreting their biological relevance require additional structural and functional genome annotation. Here, we employ the equine genome sequence to identify predicted and known proteins using proteomics and model these proteins into biological pathways, identifying 582 proteins in normal cell-free equine bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). We improved structural and functional annotation by directly confirming the in vivo expression of 558 (96%) proteins, which were computationally predicted previously, and adding Gene Ontology (GO) annotations for 174 proteins, 108 of which lacked functional annotation. Bronchoalveolar lavage is commonly used to investigate equine respiratory disease, leading us to model the associated proteome and its biological functions. Modelling of protein functions using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identified carbohydrate metabolism, cell-to-cell signalling, cellular function, inflammatory response, organ morphology, lipid metabolism and cellular movement as key biological processes in normal equine BALF. Comparative modelling of protein functions in normal cell-free bronchoalveolar lavage proteomes from horse, human, and mouse, performed by grouping GO terms sharing common ancestor terms, confirms conservation of functions across species. Ninety-one of 92 human GO categories and 105 of 109 mouse GO categories were conserved in the horse. Our approach confirms the utility of the equine genome sequence to characterize protein networks without antibodies or mRNA quantification, highlights the need for continued structural and functional annotation of the equine genome and provides a framework for equine researchers to aid in the annotation effort. 3aantibodies 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3acell movement 3agenes 3ahorses 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3alipid metabolism 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3amodels 3anucleotide sequences 3aproteins 3aproteome 2aAnimals 2aBronchoalveolar Lavage Fluidxchemistry 2aGenomexgenetics 2aHorsesxgenetics 2aHumans 2aMass Spectrometry 2aMice 2aModels, Biological 2aMolecular Sequence Annotationxmethods 2aProteinsxanalysisxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aProteomicsxmethods1 aMujahid, N.1 aNanduri, B.1 aMcCarthy, F.M.1 aCosta, L.R.R.1 aBurgess, S.C.1 aSwiderski, C.E.0 tAnimal genetics.g2011 Aug., v. 42, no. 4 p.395-405dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0268-91467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2052.2010.02158.x 7aarticle01574naa a2200325 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024003700097040001800134100002200152245005100174246006100225300001300286520054300299650002400842650001300866650002100879650002400900653002400924700002400948700001800972773009600990852000901086856008701095939003301182945000801215946001301223655001201236991573330530742620221122032946.0800527e19791227xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI800008092DNAL7 a10.1056/NEJM1979122730126152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaufman, Allen M.10aAlkalosis from chloride-deficient neo-mull-soy3 aAlkalosis from chloride-deficient neo-mull-soy.

In a study of rats, those maintained on a low-chloride, normal sodium, and moderately increased citrate diet grew normally. Those chloride-depleted, by the administration of furosemide, developed alkalosis. Therefore, it is suggested that chloride or volume depletion of both developed for another reason in the infants. The author makes further suggestions regarding the infants' nutrition. 3adeficiency diseases 3aminerals 3ainfant nutrition 3achemical substances 0aacid base disorders1 aMac-Moune, Fernand.1 aKahn, Thomas.0 tNew England journal of medicine.g1979 Dec. 27, v. 301, no. 26 p.1449-1449x0028-47937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJM1979122730126153Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19800527c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle03530naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245011800127300001500245300001600260500001500276520220000291650001202491650002302503650001702526650001802543650002302561650000902584650001902593650001602612650000802628650001002636650002302646650001302669650002202682650001702704650001902721653003202740653001402772653002102786653001302807700001702820700001902837700001702856773008502873852000902958930003302967945001303000946001103013655001203024IND2207770420221122015431.0001114e200002  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220777042DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaillaud, E.10aNutritional status and energy expenditure in elderly patients with recent hip fracture during a 2-month follow-up  ap. 97-103.  apg. 97-103.  a2019-12-05  aA 2-month follow-up of nutritional status was performed in forty elderly patients with recent hip fracture. Patients were nutritionally assessed on admission to our rehabilitation unit (day 0), then monthly (day 30, day 60) by measurement of resting energy expenditure (REE), anthropometric, impedance and biological variables. Patients were defined as undernourished (n 13) or normally nourished (n 27) on the basis of mid-arm circumference (MAC) and triceps skinfold thickness (TST) measurements. Seven patients recovered a walking autonomy and were discharged from the hospital before day 30 (group I) whereas thirteen patients were discharged after day 30 (group II); twenty patients remained in the study at day 60 (group III). MAC and TST decreased in normally nourished patients from group III throughout the study whereas they did not change in group II or in undernourished patients from group III. REE values in relation to fat-free mass were increased compared with normal values and were similar in the three groups on day 0; they did not change during the study. Daily energy intake in relation to body weight was higher in group I and increased in group II and in undernourished patients from group III throughout the study. In contrast, it was below the recommended value at day 0 and it did not significantly improve in normally nourished patients from group III. Serum albumin, transthyretin and transferrin levels on day 0 were below reference intervals in the three groups. Albumin levels increased in group III throughout the study. Inflammatory proteins decreased in groups II and III, with C-reactive protein levels returning to normal values in group II by day 30 and in group III at day 60, while orosomucoid levels did not become completely normal over this period. Our findings indicate no improvement in nutritional status in undernourished patients after surgery for recent hip fracture, despite an adequate energy intake. An insufficient spontaneous energy intake for normally nourished patients was associated with a delayed favourable outcome resulting in a prolonged duration of hospitalization. A hypermetabolic state persisted during the 3 months after surgery. 3aelderly 3askinfold thickness 3amalnutrition 3aenergy intake 3anutritional status 3ahips 3ablood proteins 3abody weight 3amen 3awomen 3aenergy expenditure 3apatients 3aarm circumference 3ablood plasma 3alean body mass 0aanthropometric measurements 0afollow up 0abody composition 0abody fat1 aBories, P.N.1 aLe Parco, J.C.1 aCampillo, B.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2000 Feb., v. 83, no. 2 p.97-103x0007-11457nnas  aDNAL  a20001231b20010109c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle01423naa a2200385 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245007500132300001600207500001500223520037600238650002900614650002700643650001200670650000800682650001600690650002800706650001700734650001700751650000900768650001500777650002100792653002700813653001500840773009400855852001300949939003300962945000800995946001301003852000901016655001201025991573329660742620221122015936.0910715e19910328xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI910021922DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKern, F.

The sediment yield of each tank was computed by multiplying the total sediment yield by the sediment yield coefficients; the yield was obtained by the product of the runoff of each tank and the sediment concentration in the tank. The sediment concentration of the first tank was computed from its storage and the sediment concentration distribution (SCD); the sediment concentration of the next lower tank was obtained by its storage and the sediment infiltration of the upper tank; and so on. The SCD, caused by the incremental source runoff (or the effective rainfall), was obtained by the theory of the instantaneous unit sediment graph (IUSG) and a sediment routing function. Using the SCD, the sediment yield was computed from the tank model as well as by the IUSG model. The sediment yield obtained from the tank model was then compared with that from the IUSG model. Finally, the tank model was verified on an upland watershed in northwestern Mississippi. 3ahighlands 3amodels 3aprediction 3arain 3arunoff 3asediment yield 3asediments 3atanks 3awatersheds 3aMississippi1 aSingh, V.P.0 tWater resources management.g2005 Aug., v. 19, no. 4 p.349-362dKluwer Academic Publishersx0920-47417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-005-7998-y 7aarticle03677naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245014900180300001800329500002400347500001500371520174100386650001302127650002102140650002502161650001502186650002002201650001002221650001302231650002102244650001102265650006502276650003802341650003102379650004802410650003502458650004402493650004202537650006602579650004202645650006402687650006602751650003802817653001102855700001802866700001802884700002202902700002302924700002302947773008402970852000903054856004803063655001203111IND4427796020221122015210.0091023e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442779602DNAL7 a196852462pmid7 a10.1007/s00425-009-0997-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarth, Sina10aKNOX overexpression in transgenic Kohleria (Gesneriaceae) prolongs the activity of proximal leaf blastozones and drastically alters segment fate  ap. 1081-1091.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aKNOX (knotted1-like homeobox) genes have a widely conserved role in the generation of dissected leaves. Ectopic KNOX activity in leaves in various angiosperm lineages causes leaf form changes that can elucidate how the configuration of leaf development evolved. We present an analysis of leaf morphology and morphogenesis in transgenic Kohleria lines overexpressing a heterologous KNOX gene. Kohleria, like many members of Gesneriaceae, has simple-serrated leaves with pinnate venation. KNOX overexpression causes prolonged segment proliferation in proximal, but not distal, parts of leaf blades. Elaborate dissected segments reiterate the zonation of the whole leaf, with organogenic activity persisting between a distal maturation zone and a proximal intercalary elongation zone. The architecture of vascular bundles is severely altered, with a reduced midvein and a more palmate venation. The initial establishment of organogenically competent primordial margins (marginal blastozones) and the onset of tissue differentiation in early stages of leaf development were similar in wild-type and KNOX overexpressing lines. However, leaves overexpressing KNOX often failed to fully mature, and persistent marginal blastozones were found at the base of blades in mature portions of the shoot. We conclude that KNOX-mediated perpetuation of marginal blastozones in Kohleria is sufficient to induce a set of processes that result in highly dissected leaflets, which are unusual in this plant family. Spatial confinement of blastozones between an early maturing tip and a late elongating petiole zone reflects the presence of distinct maturation processes that limit the ability of the leaf margins to respond to ectopic KNOX gene expression. 3aKohleria 3avascular bundles 3adevelopmental stages 3aleaf blade 3agene expression 3agenes 3apetioles 3aleaf development 3ashoots 2aMagnoliopsidaxdrug effectsxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGibberellinsxpharmacology 2aHomeodomain Proteinsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aNuclear Proteinsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxpharmacology 2aPlant Leavesxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxultrastructure. 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aPlant Shootsxdrug effectsxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aRNA, Plantxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aplants1 aGeier, Thomas1 aEimert, Klaus1 aWatillon, Bernard1 aSangwan, Rajbir S.1 aGleissberg, Stefan0 tPlanta.g2009 Nov., v. 230, no. 6 p.1081-1091dSpringer-Verlagx0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-009-0997-0 7aarticle02855naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245015400125300001600279300001700295520145000312650001401762650002501776650002701801650000901828650001401837650001901851650001001870650001101880650002201891650001501913650000701928650001501935650002701950650001601977650000901993650001802002650001502020650002502035700001402060700001702074700001402091700001702105700001702122700001702139700001702156773008602173852000902259930003302268945001302301946001102314655001202325IND2207772220221122001353.0001114e200002  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220777222DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManabe, N.10aEffects of the mycelial extract of cultured Cordyceps sinensis on in vivo hepatic energy metabolism and blood flow in dietary hypoferric anaemic mice  ap. 197-204.  apg. 197-204.  aThe beneficial effects of a traditional Chinese medicine, Cordyceps sinensis (Cs), on mice with hypoferric anaemia were evaluated by NMR spectroscopy. Experimental hypoferric anaemia was induced in mice by feeding with an Fe-free diet for 6 weeks. They were then given extract from cultured Cs (200 mg/kg body weight daily, orally) and were placed on an Fe-containing recovery diet (35 mg Fe/kg diet) for 4 weeks. In vivo (31)P and (2)H NMR spectra acquired noninvasively and quantitatively at weekly intervals were used to evaluate hepatic energy metabolism and blood flow in the mice. During the 4-week Cs-extract treatment, consistent increases were observed in liver beta-ATP: inorganic phosphate value by liver (31)P NMR spectroscopy, representing the high energy state, and in blood-flow rate as determined by (2)H NMR spectroscopy of deuterated water (D(2)O) uptake after intravenous injection of D(2)O. The haematological variables (the packed cell volume and the haemoglobin level) and the hepatic intracellular pH, which was determined from the NMR chemical shift difference between the inorganic phosphate peak and the alpha-phosphate peak of ATP, were not significantly different between Cs-extract-treated and control mice. As blood flow and energy metabolism are thought to be linked, the Cs-extract-increased hepatic energy metabolism in the dietary hypoferric anaemic mice was concluded to be due to increased hepatic blood flow. 3aCordyceps 3atraditional medicine 3airon deficiency anemia 3airon 3arepletion 3aplant extracts 3aliver 3aweight 3aenergy metabolism 3ablood flow 3apH 3ahemoglobin 3aadenosine triphosphate 3abody weight 3amice 3aanimal models 3ahematocrit 3ainorganic phosphorus1 aAzuma, Y.1 aSugimoto, M.1 aUchio, K.1 aMiyamoto, M.1 aTaketomo, N.1 aTsuchita, H.1 aMiyamoto, H.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2000 Feb., v. 83, no. 2 p.197-204x0007-11457nnas  aDNAL  a20001231b20010109c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle01591naa a2200421 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001700133245006400150300001300214300002100227520046900248650002700717650001400744650000900758650001600767650001400783650001200797650002100809650001100830650001100841650002000852650002700872650000900899650002600908650002400934653003500958700002000993773008301013852000901096939003301105945000801138946001101146655001201157991573328900742620221122001207.0810408e198007  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI810008102DNAL7 a74266052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeerbeck, E.14aThe total content of vitamin D in human milk and cow's milk  ap. 7-12.  ap. 7-12. charts.  aAnalyses of cows milk and human milk for vitamin D content have varied considerably; thus the biological activity of water-soluble vitamin D in the 2 types of milk were investigated by taking x-rays of the proximal ends of the tibia of 8-10 rats per treatment dose.

However, its antiatherogenic role remains controversial. Here we report atheroprotective effects of PPARδ activation in a model of angiotensin II (AngII)-accelerated atherosclerosis, characterized by increased vascular inflammation related to repression of an antiinflammatory corepressor, B cell lymphoma-6 (Bcl-6), and the regulators of G protein-coupled signaling (RGS) proteins RGS4 and RGS5. In this model, administration of the PPARδ agonist GW0742 (1 or 10 mg/kg) substantially attenuated AngII-accelerated atherosclerosis without altering blood pressure and increased vascular expression of Bcl-6, RGS4, and RGS5, which was associated with suppression of inflammatory and atherogenic gene expression in the artery. In vitro studies demonstrated similar changes in AngII-treated macrophages: PPARδ activation increased both total and free Bcl-6 levels and inhibited AngII activation of MAP kinases, p38, and ERK1/2. These studies uncover crucial proinflammatory mechanisms of AngII and highlight actions of PPARδ activation to inhibit AngII signaling, which is atheroprotective.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadiposity 3aagonists 3aangiotensin II 3aatherosclerosis 3ablood pressure 3agene expression 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3ahormone receptors 3ain vitro studies 3ainflammation 3ainsulin resistance 3amacrophages 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amodels1 aLiu, Joey1 aYin, Fen1 aCollins, Alan R.1 aLyon, Christopher J.1 aLee, Chih-Hao1 aAtkins, Annette R.1 aDownes, Michael1 aBarish, Grant D.1 aEvans, Ronald M.1 aHsueh, Willa A.1 aTangirala, Rajendra K.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Mar. 18, v. 105, no. 11 p.4277-4282dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07086471053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080321b20080404c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03058naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100002500144245013300169300001600302520193900318650001802257650002002275650002502295650001302320650001902333650001702352650001102369650001802380650002102398650001802419653002002437653001502457700002202472773008602494852000902580930003302589945002502622946001302647655001202660IND4444182520221121220343.0101026e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444418252DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSchnelle, Rebecca A.10aPaclobutrazol Concentration and Substrate Moisture Status Impact Efficacy of Liner Dips for Size Control of Three Bedding Plants  ap. 735-739.  aThe influence of several environmental and cultural factors on the efficacy of paclobutrazol liner dips were evaluated for three species of bedding plants: ‘Fancy’ scaevola (Scaevola aemula), ‘Suncatcher Plum’ petunia (Petunia xhybrida), and ‘Double Fiesta Rose’ impatiens (Impatiens walleriana). The impact of paclobutrazol concentration in the dip solution, location of treatment, root substrate moisture status, and time in the dip solution were investigated. Before the liner dip application, the rooting substrate was brought to a specific percentage of container water capacity (20%-100%). Liners were then dipped in a paclobutrazol solution of the prescribed concentration (1-16 mg·L-1) for a prescribed time interval (10–300 s) in a specific location (open-wall greenhouse, polyethylene-glazed greenhouse under 80% shade fabric, three-wall potting shed, or building interior). Plant size data were collected when the untreated control plants reached a marketable stage. Paclobutrazol concentration and root substrate moisture status had a significant effect on size control, but location and dip duration did not. Size suppression varied by species. Following a liner dip at 2 mg·L-1, scaevola, impatiens, and petunia plants were 44%, 26%, and 11% smaller than the untreated controls, respectively. Petunia plants dipped in a 8 mg·L–1 paclobutrazol solution with substrate moisture status of 100%, 90%, 80%, 70%, 50%, or 20% of container capacity were 11%, 8%, 25%, 30%, 41%, or 42% smaller than the untreated control, respectively (30 s dip duration, open-wall greenhouse). Petunia plants dipped in a solution of 8 mg·L-1 paclobutrazol for 10, 30, 120, or 300 s were all between 18% and 23% smaller than the control (50% of container capacity, open-wall greenhouse). Petunia plants dipped in an 8 mg·L-1 paclobutrazol solution in all four locations were all 20% to 21% smaller than the untreated control. 3awater content 3aPetunia hybrida 3aImpatiens walleriana 3aScaevola 3abedding plants 3aplant growth 3aheight 3apaclobutrazol 3aapplication rate 3agrowing media 0aScaevola aemula 0aplant size1 aBarrett, James E.0 tHortTechnology.g2010 Aug., v. 20, no. 4 p.735-739wJournal:2120x1063-01987nnas  aDNAL  a20101222b20110101c00000000  aINDd9CTe2010/11/20  aOther US 7aarticle02695naa a2200553 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002100133245014000154300001600294300002400310520105100334650002701385650001201412650001401424650002601438650000901464650002101473650001201494650002301506650002801529650001201557650002901569650002901598650003801627650002201665650003301687650002601720650002401746650003101770650002601801650002401827650001301851650000901864650003301873650003301906650000901939653001901948700001601967773008501983852000902068939003302077945000802110946001102118655001202129991573326970742620221121220327.0810617e198005  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI810012922DNAL7 a74173892pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSyme, Gabrielle.14aThe validity of assessing changes in intestinal absorption mechanisms for dietary sugars with non-metabolizable analogues (glucalogues)  ap. 435-443.  ap. 435-443. charts.  aHormonal and dietary conditions affecting the intestinal absorption and biological transport of glucose and galactose were compared with their effects on absorption and transfer of 3 non-metabolizable glucalogues of the 2 hexose sugars. The kinetics of transfer were analyzed using jejunal sacs obtained from fed or fasted euthyroid rats and fed or fasted hypothyroid rats. Serial concentrations of the hexoses or their glucalogues were added to the incubation fluids in which the sacs were maintained. Analysis of kinetic parameters indicated that transport mechanisms for sugar transfer across the intestine are heterogeneous, with as many as 4 or more possible carrier mechanisms suggested by the data. As none of the kinetic parameters for glucalogue transfer matched those for the dietary sugars, the use of glucalogues to assess changes in intestinal absorption of sugars may not be valid. Fasting decreased "apparent Km" of both sugars and glucalogues, and hypothyroidism had different effects on transport in the fed vs. fasted intestine. 3aanimal experimentation 3aglucose 3agalactose 3aintestinal absorption 3adiet 3athyroid hormones 3afasting 3aanalytical methods 3aphysiological transport 2aAnimals 2aDeoxy Sugarsxmetabolism 2aDeoxyglucosexmetabolism 2aDietary Carbohydratesxmetabolism 2aElectrophysiology 2aFood Deprivationxphysiology 2aGalactosexmetabolism 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aHypothyroidismxmetabolism 2aIntestinal Absorption 2aJejunumxphysiology 2aKinetics 2aMale 2aMethylglucosidesxmetabolism 2aMethylglycosidesxmetabolism 2aRats 0aFood analogues1 aLevin, R.J.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g1980 May, v. 43, no. 3 p.435-443x0007-11457nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19810617c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US 7aarticle02773naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001700161245007800178300001600256520155600272650001001828650002201838650002801860650001801888650002901906650002101935650002001956650001001976650001401986650001202000650002902012650002202041650001502063650001702078651001302095653001902108700002202127773008602149852000902235930003302244945002502277946001302302655001202315IND4444182620221121220253.0101026e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444418262DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aBeddes, Taun10aNodulation of Seaside Alder Topdressed with Controlled-release Fertilizer  ap. 740-745.  aSeaside alder (Alnus maritima) is a rare species adapted for ornamental use. It can be produced easily by commercial growers, and when soil-inoculated in nursery containers, will form root nodules containing nitrogen (N)-fixing bacteria in the genus Frankia. It has been demonstrated that nodulation within this species can be controlled by the amount of N plants receive from a liquid source; however, granular controlled-release fertilizers (CRF) also are commonly used by commercial growers, and information is not available on CRF effects on nodulation. We sought to determine the application rate of CRF that will maximize nodulation of seaside alder while sustaining acceptable plant health and growth. Inoculated containerized plants were topdressed with CRF at eight application rates from 0 to 32.0 g per container. A control group of uninoculated plants received the manufacturer's prescribed rate of 6.0 g per 6-inch-diameter standard round pot. Regression analysis revealed that treatment with 2.0 g of CRF maximized root nodule formation (a mean of 26 nodules), while nodulation was inhibited at CRF rates 4.0 g. Plant growth parameters and leaf N content of inoculated plants treated with 2.0 g of CRF were similar to those of uninoculated plants receiving the prescribed rate of CRF (P < 0.05); nitrate-nitrogen leaching from pots containing 2.0-g CRF-treated plants was minimal. We conclude that vigorous nodulated plants of seaside alder can be produced, with minimal nitrate leaching, by providing CRF at lower than prescribed rates. 3aAlnus 3aornamental plants 3aornamental horticulture 3anursery stock 3aslow-release fertilizers 3aapplication rate 3aplant nutrition 3aroots 3asymbiosis 3aFrankia 3anitrogen-fixing bacteria 3anitrogen fixation 3anodulation 3aplant growth 3aOklahoma 0aAlnus maritima1 aKratsch, Heidi A.0 tHortTechnology.g2010 Aug., v. 20, no. 4 p.740-745wJournal:2120x1063-01987nnas  aDNAL  a20101222b20110101c00000000  aINDd9CTe2010/11/20  aOther US 7aarticle03154naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002600111040001800137100001800155245009300173300001600266500002400282520130400306650001301610650002101623650001901644650002001663650001001683650001001693650001201703650000901715650003701724650001101761650001601772650001401788650002601802650001001828650004701838650001201885650003201897650001401929650005201943650003401995650005302029650005502082650000902137650005002146650003002196650003002226650003802256700002002294700001902314700001802333700001702351700002002368773010402388852000902492856003902501655001202540IND4415747020221121145545.0090130e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441574702DNAL7 a186906592pmid7 a10.1002/ptr.25812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Sun-nam.10aInhibitory effect of (-)-saucerneol on osteoclast differentiation and bone pit formation  ap. 185-191.  aIncludes references  aIn this study, the effect of (-)-saucerneol, one of the lignans isolated from Saururus chinensis, on osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption was evaluated in two in vitro models for osteoclast differentiation, the receptor activator of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) ligand (RANKL)-treated RAW264.7 cells and mouse BMMs treated with both RANKL and macrophage-colony stimulating factor. (-)-Saucerneol significantly inhibited the RANKL-induced activity of tartrate-resistance acid phosphatase (TRAP, an early marker of osteoclast formation) and formation of osteoclasts in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, (-)-saucerneol was shown to inhibit the RANKL-induced activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase in both in vitro models. In addition, (-)-saucerneol inhibited the bone resorptive activity and the expression of transcription factors and genes essential for osteoclast formation and bone resorption as well. In conclusion, (-)-saucerneol has a potential to inhibit the osteoclast differentiation via preventing the activation of ERK signaling pathway. In addition, its activity to inhibit the bone resorption activities of osteoclasts could result from its potential to inhibit RANKL-induced expression levels of transcription factors and genes essential for bone resorption. 3aSaururus 3aacid phosphatase 3abone formation 3abone resorption 3abones 3agenes 3alignans 3amice 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amodels 3aosteoclasts 3areceptors 3atranscription factors 3atraps 2aAcid Phosphatasexantagonists & inhibitors 2aAnimals 2aBone Resorptionxmetabolism 2aCell Line 2aFuransxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aGene Expressionxdrug effects 2aLignansxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aMacrophage Colony-Stimulating Factorxpharmacology 2aMice 2aMitogen-Activated Protein Kinasesxmetabolism 2aOsteoclastsxdrug effects 2aRANK Ligandxpharmacology 2aTranscription Factorsxmetabolism1 aKim, Myung-Hee.1 aKim, Young Sup1 aRyu, Shi Yong1 aMin, Yong Ki1 aKim, Seong Hwan0 tPhytotherapy research.g2009 Feb., v. 23, no. 2 p.185-191dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0951-418X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ptr.2581 7aarticle02275naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100002800144245011200172300001600284500014700300520107600447650001601523650002701539650001901566650001501585650002601600650002101626650002401647651000901671653003301680653002201713773008601735852000901821930003301830945002501863946001301888655001201901IND4444180920221121145628.0101026e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444418092DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

This requires higher-order thinking skills such as critical thinking, which can be practiced through various teaching and learning strategies in an undergraduate curriculum. The objective of this project was to develop a series of three reflective writing assignments in a landscape design course to help students improve their critical thinking skills of analysis and synthesis. Scores on an 18-point quiz question for 110 students enrolled in Beginning Garden Composition (HORT 380) from 2005 to 2009 were compared. The comparison was between 2 years when the reflective writing assignments were not part of the course and 3 years when the assignments were included in the course. Quiz scores increased significantly for the students who completed the reflective writing assignments (average of 16.2 out of 18) compared with students who did not complete the assignments as part of the course (average 10.2 out of 18). 3alandscaping 3aagricultural education 3awriting skills 3acurriculum 3aeducational materials 3acollege students 3auniversity programs 3aIowa 0aBeginning Garden Composition 0acritical thinking0 tHortTechnology.g2010 Aug., v. 20, no. 4 p.668-671wJournal:2120x1063-01987nnas  aDNAL  a20101222b20110101c00000000  aINDd9CTe2010/11/20  aOther US 7aarticle03060naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002300184245008300207300001800290506007600308520153700384506003701921650003501958650003201993650002602025650002002051650002002071650001002091650002402101650001302125650001602138650001702154650001202171650001202183700002102195700001402216700002302230700002502253773017402278852000902452856008302461930003302544946001302577655001202590IND4403673220221207081538.0080328e20080325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440367322DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07113721052doi7 aPMC22907472pmcid7 a183623422pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSedaghat, Ahmad R.10aDecay dynamics of HIV-1 depend on the inhibited stages of the viral life cycle  ap. 4832-4837.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe time to suppression of HIV-1 viremia to below the limit of detection of standard clinical assays is an important prognostic indicator for patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Recent clinical trials of the integrase inhibitor raltegravir have demonstrated more rapid viral decay than previously seen with reverse transcriptase (RT) or protease inhibitor-based regimens. Because of the therapeutic importance of drugs that target different steps in the virus life cycle, it is imperative to consider whether viral dynamics are affected by the stage of the viral life cycle at which an antiretroviral drug acts. We use a mathematical model to investigate the effects of various drug classes on the dynamics of HIV-1 decay and show that the stage at which a drug acts affects the dynamics of viral decay. We find that the drug class acting latest in the viral life cycle dictates the dynamics of HIV-1 decay. In general, we find that the later in the life cycle an inhibitor acts, the more rapid the decay in viremia, and we illustrate this by comparing the effect of RT and integrase inhibitors on viral dynamics. We conclude that the rapid decay observed in patients on integrase-inhibitor-containing regimens is not necessarily an indication of greater drug efficacy but rather an expected consequence of the fact that this drug acts later in the life cycle. We propose that clinically observed viral decay rates for HAART regimens should be evaluated in the context of the drug classes that are represented.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3aRNA-directed DNA polymerase 3aantiretroviral agents 3aclinical trials 3adetection limit 3adrugs 3amathematical models 3apatients 3aproteinases 3atherapeutics 3aviremia 3aviruses1 aDinoso, Jason B.1 aShen, Lin1 aWilke, C.q(Claus)1 aSiliciano, Robert F.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Mar. 25, v. 105, no. 12 p.4832-4837dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07113721053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080328b20080404c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03082naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245014000204300001800344506007600362520140800438506003701846650001601883650003101899650002501930650002301955650002901978650003102007650001002038650001902048650001802067650001202085650001302097650001502110650001402125650002302139700001502162700002402177700001902201700002202220700002202242773017402264852000902438856008302447930003302530946001302563655001202576IND4403672020221207081531.0080328e20080325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440367202DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07084511052doi7 aPMC22907512pmcid7 a183374972pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSultana, Naznin10aZebrafish early cardiac connexin, Cx36.7/Ecx, regulates myofibril orientation and heart morphogenesis by establishing Nkx2.5 expression  ap. 4763-4768.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHeart development is a precisely coordinated process of cellular proliferation, migration, differentiation, and integrated morphogenetic interactions, and therefore it is highly susceptible to developmental anomalies such as the congenital heart disease (CHD). One of the major causes of CHD has been shown to be the mutations in key cardiac transcription factors, including nkx2.5. Here, we report the analysis of zebrafish mutant ftk that showed a progressive heart malformation in the later stages of heart morphogenesis. Our analyses revealed that the cardiac muscle maturation and heart morphogenesis in ftk mutants were impaired because of the disorganization of myofibrils. Notably, we found that the expression of nkx2.5 was down-regulated in the ftk heart despite the normal expression of gata4 and tbx5, suggesting a common mechanism for the occurrence of ftk phenotype and CHD. We identified ftk to be a loss-of-function mutation in a connexin gene, cx36.7/early cardiac connexin (ecx), expressed during early heart development. We further showed by a rescue experiment that Nkx2.5 is the downstream mediator of Ecx-mediated signaling. From these results, we propose that the cardiac connexin Ecx and its downstream signaling are crucial for establishing nkx2.5 expression, which in turn promotes unidirectional, parallel alignment of myofibrils and the subsequent proper heart morphogenesis.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDanio rerio 3aGATA transcription factors 3aabnormal development 3acell proliferation 3acongenital abnormalities 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aheart diseases 3amorphogenesis 3amutants 3amutation 3amyofibrils 3aphenotype 3atransport proteins1 aNag, Kakon1 aHoshijima, Kazuyuki1 aLaird, Dale W.1 aKawakami, Atsushi1 aHirose, Shigehisa0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Mar. 25, v. 105, no. 12 p.4763-4768dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07084511053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080328b20080404c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02616naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002300184245009800207300001800305506007600323520124600399506003701645650001001682650003901692650002001731650001201751650002701763650001801790650001401808650001301822650001301835700002701848700001901875773017401894852000902068856008302077930003302160946001302193655001202206IND4403673720221207081544.0080328e20080325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440367372DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07091021052doi7 aPMC22907692pmcid7 a183473362pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeanneteau, Freddy10aActivation of Trk neurotrophin receptors by glucocorticoids provides a neuroprotective effect  ap. 4862-4867.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGlucocorticoids (GCs) display both protective and destructive effects in the nervous system. In excess, GCs produce neuronal damage after stress or brain injury; however, the neuroprotective effects of adrenal steroids also have been reported. The mechanisms that account for the positive actions are not well understood. Here we report that GCs can selectively activate Trk receptor tyrosine kinases after in vivo administration in the brain and in cultures of hippocampal and cortical neurons. Trk receptors are normally activated by neurotrophins, such as NGF and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, but the activation of Trk receptors by GCs does not depend on increased production of neurotrophins. Other tyrosine kinase receptors, such as EGF and FGF receptors, were not activated by GCs. The ability of GCs to increase Trk receptor activity resulted in the neuroprotection of neurons deprived of trophic support and could be modulated by steroid-converting enzymes. Pharmacological and shRNA experiments indicate that Trk receptor activation by GCs depends on a genomic action of the GC receptor. The ability of GCs to promote Trk receptor activity represents a molecular mechanism that integrates the actions of GCs and neurotrophins.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abrain 3afibroblast growth factor receptors 3aglucocorticoids 3aneurons 3aneuroprotective effect 3aneurotrophins 3areceptors 3asteroids 3atyrosine1 aGarabedian, Michael J.1 aChao, Moses V.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Mar. 25, v. 105, no. 12 p.4862-4867dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07091021053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080328b20080404c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02152naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002200184245012000206300001800326506007600344520092800420506003701348650001501385650001101400650001101411650001701422700002601439700002501465773017401490852000901664856008301673930003301756946001301789655001201802IND4403355120221207093416.0080321e20080318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440335512DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07095041052doi7 aPMC23937552pmcid7 a183346432pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRazak, Khaleel A.10aExperience is required for the maintenance and refinement of FM sweep selectivity in the developing auditory cortex  ap. 4465-4470.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFrequency modulated (FM) sweeps are common components of vocalizations, including human speech. How developmental experience shapes neuronal selectivity for these important signals is not well understood. Here, we show that altered developmental experience with FM sweeps used in echolocation by the pallid bat leads to either a loss of sideband inhibition or millisecond delays in the timing of inhibitory inputs, both of which lead to a reduction in rate and direction selectivity in auditory cortex. FM rate selectivity develops in an experience-independent manner, but requires experience for subsequent maintenance. Direction selectivity depends on experience for both development and maintenance. Rate and direction selectivity are affected by experience over different time periods during development. Altered inhibition may be a general mechanism of experience-dependent plasticity of selectivity for vocalizations.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aChiroptera 3acortex 3aspeech 3avocalization1 aRichardson, Marlin D.1 aFuzessery, Zoltan M.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Mar. 18, v. 105, no. 11 p.4465-4470dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07095041053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080321b20080404c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03308naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001900184245013500203300001800338506007600356520167800432506003702110650002302147650001502170650001502185650001802200650001202218650001402230650001402244650001202258650002002270650001702290650001902307650002202326650001602348650001402364650001402378650003702392650001802429700002202447700002102469773017402490852000902664856008302673930003302756946001302789655001202802IND4403352520221207090521.0080321e20080318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440335252DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07073701052doi7 aPMC23937602pmcid7 a183374992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFink, Susan L.10aAnthrax lethal toxin and Salmonella elicit the common cell death pathway of caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis via distinct mechanisms  ap. 4312-4317.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCaspase-1 cleaves the inactive IL-1β and IL-18 precursors into active inflammatory cytokines. In Salmonella-infected macrophages, caspase-1 also mediates a pathway of proinflammatory programmed cell death termed "pyroptosis." We demonstrate active caspase-1 diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm and localized in discrete foci within macrophages responding to either Salmonella infection or intoxication by Bacillus anthracis lethal toxin (LT). Both stimuli triggered caspase-1-dependent lysis in macrophages and dendritic cells. Activation of caspase-1 by LT required binding, uptake, and endosome acidification to mediate translocation of lethal factor (LF) into the host cell cytosol. Catalytically active LF cleaved cytosolic substrates and activated caspase-1 by a mechanism involving proteasome activity and potassium efflux. LT activation of caspase-1 is known to require the inflammasome adapter Nalp1. In contrast, Salmonella infection activated caspase-1 through an independent pathway requiring the inflammasome adapter Ipaf. These distinct mechanisms of caspase-1 activation converged on a common pathway of caspase-1-dependent cell death featuring DNA cleavage, cytokine activation, and, ultimately, cell lysis resulting from the formation of membrane pores between 1.1 and 2.4 nm in diameter and pathological ion fluxes that can be blocked by glycine. These findings demonstrate that distinct activation pathways elicit the conserved cell death effector mechanism of caspase-1-mediated pyroptosis and support the notion that this pathway of proinflammatory programmed cell death is broadly relevant to cell death and inflammation invoked by diverse stimuli.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacillus anthracis 3aDNA damage 3aSalmonella 3aacidification 3aanthrax 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-1 3acytosol 3adendritic cells 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-18 3ainterleukin-1beta 3amacrophages 3apoisoning 3apotassium 3aproteasome endopeptidase complex 3asalmonellosis1 aBergsbaken, Tessa1 aCookson, Brad T.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Mar. 18, v. 105, no. 11 p.4312-4317dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07073701053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080321b20080404c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03964naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002000171245007000191300001800261500002400279520202600303650001902329650002302348650002502371650001702396650001302413650001302426650001602439650001102455650002502466650002202491650001002513650002102523650001702544650002502561650001602586650001402602650001802616650001402634650005602648650005102704650002202755650003702777650001702814650002802831650001402859650003902873650003402912650003402946650002702980700001803007700002703025700001603052700002803068700002303096700002003119773011103139852000903250856005503259655001203314IND4435860820221120224916.0100423e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443586082DNAL7 a201585072pmid7 a10.1111/j.1462-2920.2010.02164.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGlöckner, Jana10aPhylogenetic diversity and metagenomics of candidate division OP3  ap. 1218-1229.  aIncludes references  aExcept for environmental 16S rRNA gene sequences, no information is available for members of the candidate division OP3. These bacteria appear to thrive in anoxic environments, such as marine sediments, hypersaline deep sea, freshwater lakes, aquifers, flooded paddy soils and methanogenic bioreactors. The 16S rRNA phylogeny suggests that OP3 belongs to the Planctomycetes/Verrucomicrobia/Chlamydiae (PVC) superphylum. Metagenomic fosmid libraries were constructed from flooded paddy soil and screened for 16S rRNA gene-containing fragments affiliated with the PVC superphylum. The screening of 63 000 clones resulted in 23 assay-positive fosmids, of which three clones were affiliated with OP3. The 16S rRNA gene sequence divergence between the fragments OP3/1, OP3/2 and OP3/3 ranges from 18% to 25%, indicating that they belong to different OP3 subdivisions. The 23S rRNA phylogeny confirmed the membership of OP3 in the PVC superphylum. Sequencing the OP3 fragments resulted in a total of 105 kb of genomic information and 90 ORFs, of which 47 could be assigned a putative function and 11 were conserved hypothetical. Using BLASTP searches, a high proportion of ORFs had best matches to homologues from Deltaproteobacteria, rather than to those of members of the PVC superphylum. On the fragment OP3/3, a cluster of nine ORFs was predicted to encode the bacterial NADH dehydrogenase I. Given the high proportion of homologues present in deltaproteobacteria and anoxic conditions in the natural environment of OP3 bacteria, the detection of NADH dehydrogenase I may suggest an anaerobic respiration mode. Oligonucleotide frequencies calculated for OP3/1, OP3/2 and OP/3 show high intraphylum correlations. This novel sequence information could therefore be used to identify OP3-related fragments in large metagenomic data sets using marker gene-independent procedures in the future. In addition to the OP3 fragments, a single metagenomic fragment affiliated with the candidate division BRC1 was obtained and analysed. 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aNADH dehydrogenase 3aanaerobic conditions 3aanaerobiosis 3aaquifers 3abacteria 3abioreactors 3aclones 3adelta-Proteobacteria 3agenomic libraries 3alakes 3amarine sediments 3ametagenomics 3anucleotide sequences 3apaddy soils 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3ascreening 2aDNA, Bacterialxanalysisxisolation & purification. 2aDeltaproteobacteriaxclassificationxgenetics. 2aGenetic Variation 2aGeologic Sedimentsxmicrobiology 2aMetagenomics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 23Sxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA1 aKube, Michael1 aShrestha, Pravin Malla1 aWeber, Marc1 aGlöckner, Frank Oliver1 aReinhardt, Richard1 aLiesack, Werner0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2010 May, v. 12, no. 5 p.1218-1229dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1462-29127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2010.02164.x 7aarticle02065naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097245006900115300001600184300002100200520129900221650001401520650001201534650001301546650001701559650001701576653002401593773009501617852000901712939003301721945000801754946001301762655001201775991573314660742620221120224858.0801002e19790920xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI800027412DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL10aCase records of the Massachusetts General Hospital.

The patient, with a history of drug abuse, had a striking change in mentation ranging from violence to coma with focal seizures and evidence of meningitis on cerebrospinal fluid analysis. The outstanding biochemical feature was severe, progressive metabolic acidosis resistant to the administration of large amounts of alkali. Profound lactic acidosis and acidosis caused by drugs or poisons have a common severity of the acidosis disproportionate to the amount of acid produced by metabolism of the toxin. The typical feature absent in this case is the presence of oxalate or hippurate crystals in the urine. Crystalluria is almost always reported in cases of ethylene glycol poisoning. However, acute renal failure in this case, is compatible with the absence of crystals. There is experimental and clinical evidence that toxicity can be slowed by the intravenous infusion of ethanol. This treatment of the poison inhibits metabolism of the ethylene glycol by competing for alcohol dehydrogenase. Prompt institution of hemodialysis removes the toxins and permits infusion of alkali without the danger of overloading circulation already compromised by the toxic effects of the ingested poisons. 3apoisoning 3aethanol 3amethanol 3ahemodialysis 3acase studies 0aacid base disorders0 tNew England journal of medicine.g1979 Sept. 20, v. 301, no. 12 p.650-657x0028-47937nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19801002c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle03795naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166072001700184100002200201245017500223300001800398500001500416506007600431520190100507506003702408650002002445650002502465650001702490650001402507650002102521650000802542650001502550650002002565650003002585653001302615653001502628653001502643653001502658653003402673700002102707700002302728700002802751700002202779700001602801700001902817700002202836700002302858773017302881852000903054856008303063930003303146945002503179946001303204655001203217IND4401900620221207090514.0080223e20080219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440190062DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07122211052doi7 aPMC22681682pmcid7 a182561832pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMatsumoto, Yasuko10aDistribution of cytotoxic and DNA ADP-ribosylating activity in crude extracts from butterflies among the family Pieridae [Erratum: 2008 Mar. 18, v. 105, no. 14, p. 5649.]  ap. 2516-2520.  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCabbage butterflies, Pieris rapae and Pieris brassicae, contain strong cytotoxic proteins, designated as pierisin-1 and -2, against cancer cell lines. These proteins exhibit DNA ADP-ribosylating activity. To determine the distribution of substances with cytotoxicity and DNA ADP-ribosylating activity among other species, crude extracts from 20 species of the family Pieridae were examined for cytotoxicity in HeLa cells and DNA ADP-ribosylating activity. Both activities were detected in extracts from 13 species: subtribes Pierina (Pieris rapae, Pieris canidia, Pieris napi, Pieris melete, Pieris brassicae, Pontia daplidice, and Talbotia naganum), Aporiina (Aporia gigantea, Aporia crataegi, Aporia hippia, and Delias pasithoe), and Appiadina (Appias nero and Appias paulina). All of these extracts contained substances recognized by anti-pierisin-1 antibodies, with a molecular mass of [almost equal to]100 kDa established earlier for pierisin-1. Moreover, sequences containing NAD-binding sites, conserved in ADP-ribosyltransferases, were amplified from genomic DNA from 13 species of butterflies with cytotoxicity and DNA ADP-ribosylating activity by PCR. Extracts from seven species, Appias lyncida, Leptosia nina, Anthocharis scolymus, Eurema hecabe, Catopsilia pomona, Catopsilia scylla, and Colias erate, showed neither cytotoxicity nor DNA ADP-ribosylating activity, and did not contain substances recognized by anti-pierisin-1 antibodies. Sequences containing NAD-binding sites were not amplified from genomic DNA from these seven species. Thus, pierisin-like proteins, showing cytotoxicity and DNA ADP-ribosylating activity, are suggested to be present in the extracts from butterflies not only among the subtribe Pierina, but also among the subtribes Aporiina and Appiadina. These findings offer insight to understanding the nature of DNA ADP-ribosylating activity in the butterfly.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ainsect proteins 3apentosyltransferases 3aPieris rapae 3aneoplasms 3aPieris brassicae 3aDNA 3acell lines 3aenzyme activity 3aanticarcinogenic activity 0aPieridae 0apierisin-1 0apierisin-2 0aHeLa cells 0aDNA ADP-ribosylating activity1 aNakano, Tsuyoshi1 aYamamoto, Masafumi1 aMatsushima-Hibiya, Yuko1 aOdagiri, Ken-Ichi1 aYata, Osamu1 aKoyama, Kotaro1 aSugimura, Takashi1 aWakabayashi, Keiji0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Feb. 19, v. 105, no. 7 p.2516-2520dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07122211053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080509b20080606c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/04/29  aOther US 7aarticle03460naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100003400184245013300218300001800351506007600369520177700445506003702222650001902259650001102278650001802289650001902307650002302326650002102349650001502370650001102385650001602396650001502412650000902427650001202436650001302448650002402461650001202485650002702497700002002524700001602544700001902560700002002579700002002599773017302619852000902792856008302801930003302884946001302917655001202930IND4401900720221207090511.0080223e20080219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440190072DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07120211052doi7 aPMC22681692pmcid7 a182683302pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRatnacaram, Chandrahas Koumar10aTemporally controlled ablation of PTEN in adult mouse prostate epithelium generates a model of invasive prostatic adenocarcinoma  ap. 2521-2526.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aStudies of prostate cancer pathogenesis and development of new therapies have been hampered by a lack of appropriate mouse models. We have generated PSA-Cre-ERT² mice that express the tamoxifen-dependent Cre-ERT² recombinase selectively in prostatic epithelium, thus allowing us to target floxed genes selectively in epithelial cells of fully differentiated prostate of adult mice and to modulate the number of genetically altered cells. Our present mouse model, in which prostate carcinogenesis is initiated through Cre-ERT²-mediated somatic biallelic ablation of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN after puberty, closely mimics the course of human cancer formation. Indeed, mutant mice developed prostate epithelium hyperplasia within 4 weeks after PTEN ablation and prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) in all lobes within 2-3 months, with the highest incidence in the dorsolateral lobe, which is considered to be the most similar to the peripheral zone of the human prostate, in which adenocarcinoma is preferentially localized. Eight to 10 months after PTEN ablation some PINs of the dorsolateral lobe had progressed to adenocarcinoma, but no distant metastases were found up to 20 months after PTEN ablation, indicating that progression to metastasis requires an additional mutation or mutations. Interestingly, monoallelic Cre-ERT²-mediated PTEN ablation in epithelial cells of adult prostate also generated focal hyperplasia and PINs, but exclusively in the dorsolateral lobe, and in much lower number and after a longer latency. However, no progression to adenocarcinoma was observed. Because PTEN expression was undetectable in epithelial cells from these PINs, loss of PTEN function appears to act as a permissive event for uncontrolled cell proliferation.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadenocarcinoma 3aadults 3aanimal models 3acarcinogenesis 3acell proliferation 3aepithelial cells 3aepithelium 3ahumans 3ahyperplasia 3ametastasis 3amice 3amutants 3amutation 3aprostatic neoplasms 3apuberty 3atumor suppressor genes1 aTeletin, Marius1 aJiang, Ming1 aMeng, Xiangjun1 aChambon, Pierre1 aMetzger, Daniel0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Feb. 19, v. 105, no. 7 p.2521-2526dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07120211053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080224b20080301c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02587naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002300184245013300207300001800340506007600358520110000434506003701534650003101571650002201602650002901624650002401653650001101677650002001688650003601708700002101744700002101765700002101786700002201807700002501829773017301854852000902027856008302036930003302119946001302152655001202165IND4401901220221207095116.0080223e20080219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440190122DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07083501052doi7 aPMC22681742pmcid7 a182683542pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEsquerré, Michael10aHuman regulatory T cells inhibit polarization of T helper cells toward antigen-presenting cells via a TGF-β-dependent mechanism  ap. 2550-2555.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe molecular mechanisms used by regulatory T cells (Treg) to inhibit the effector phase of adaptive immune responses are still elusive. In the present work, we investigated the possibility that Treg may interfere with a basic biological function of T helper cells (TH): polarization of secretory machinery for dedicated help delivery. To address this question, we visualized by confocal microscopy different parameters of activation in TH and Treg cells interacting simultaneously with individual antigen-presenting cells (APC). Our results show that, although productive TCR engagement in TH/APC conjugates was unaffected by the presence of adjacent Treg, the reorientation of TH secretory machinery toward APC was strongly inhibited. Blocking TGF-β completely reverted Treg induced inhibition of TH polarization. Our results identify a previously undescribed mechanism by which Treg inhibit effector T cells. TGF-β produced by adjacent Treg interferes with polarization of TH secretory machinery toward APC, thus affecting a crucial step of TH-mediated amplification of the immune response.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aadaptive immunity 3aantigen-presenting cells 3aconfocal microscopy 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3atransforming growth factor beta1 aTauzin, Baptiste1 aGuiraud, Martine1 aMüller, Sabina.1 aSaoudi, Abdelhadi1 aValitutti, Salvatore0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Feb. 19, v. 105, no. 7 p.2550-2555dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07083501053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080224b20080301c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01800naa a2200373 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001900115245005400134300001600188300002400204500001500228520078500243650001101028650001801039650002301057650002601080650002101106650001601127650002501143650001301168650002401181653001601205653002101221653002201242653001901264700001501283773007401298939003301372852000901405655001201414991573311540742620221120182655.0911125e199110  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI910035622DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchroder, B.G.10aConsumer evaluation of reduced-cholesterol butter  ap. 104-107.  ap. 104-107. charts.  a2019-12-05  aThis article describes a home-use market study undertaken to determine whether acceptable, reduced-cholesterol butter could be produced by replacing milk fat with RCMF.

Signoret (Heteroptera: Miridae) is a major insect pest in cashew production in India. Current control strategy consistently applies conventional pesticides especially insecticides of organophosphates, carbamates and synthetic pyrethroids. A three round calendar based spray schedule is the most popular measure being adopted across the country, providing desirable control of tea mosquito bug. However, the use of broad-spectrum insecticidal sprays, even occasionally, has profound influence on the pest and beneficial fauna of the cashew ecosystem, resulting in environmental and social problems. Organic cashew growers have no effective pest management options to limit TMB damage, because other soft chemicals are also ineffective. The tree inhabitating red weaver ants Oecophylla smaragdina (Fabricius) (Formicidae: Hymenoptera) are known to control over fifty species of insect pests on many tropical tree crops across the world. Not much research work has been carried out previously in respect of biocontrol potentials of weaver ants in India. Nowadays research interest is on the increase to recognize the weaver ants in a control programme of cashew pests. Prior studies have confirmed that the prevalence of weaver ant is correlated with reduction of Helopeltis populations in certain cashew plantings of Tamil Nadu and Kerala in South India. In the present paper, the existing pest management situation and the significance of ant husbandry practices for a future integrated control programme of tea mosquito bug are discussed. 3aHelopeltis antonii 3aHelopeltis theivora 3aOecophylla smaragdina 3abiological control 3acarbamates 3acrops 3aecosystems 3afauna 3agrowers 3ainsect pests 3ainsecticides 3aorganic production 3aorganophosphorus compounds 3aplantations 3apyrethrins 3asocial problems 3atrees 3aIndia0 tActa horticulturae.g2015 Mar. 26, , no. 1080 p.393-400dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1080.52  aDNAL 7aarticle02862naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166072001700184100001900201245006800220300001800288506007600306520135800382506003701740650002901777650001101806650002601817650002401843650001801867650002101885653003801906700002101944700001901965700002101984700001902005700002502024700001902049773017302068852000902241856008302250930003302333945002502366946001302391655001202404IND4401900820221207081548.0080223e20080219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440190082DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07121881052doi7 aPMC22681702pmcid7 a182724772pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aChen, Chien-Yu10aDiscovering gapped binding sites of yeast transcription factors  ap. 2527-2532.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA gapped transcription factor-binding site (TFBS) contains one or more highly degenerate positions. Discovering gapped motifs is difficult, because allowing highly degenerate positions in a motif greatly enlarges the search space and complicates the discovery process. Here, we propose a method for discovering TFBSs, especially gapped motifs. We use ChIP-chip data to judge the binding strength of a TF to a putative target promoter and use orthologous sequences from related species to judge the degree of evolutionary conservation of a predicted TFBS. Candidate motifs are constructed by growing compact motif blocks and by concatenating two candidate blocks, allowing 0-15 degenerate positions in between. The resultant patterns are statistically evaluated for their ability to distinguish between target and nontarget genes. Then, a position-based ranking procedure is proposed to enhance the signals of true motifs by collecting position concurrences. Empirical tests on 32 known yeast TFBSs show that the method is highly accurate in identifying gapped motifs, outperforming current methods, and it also works well on ungapped motifs. Predictions on additional 54 TFs successfully discover 11 gapped and 38 ungapped motifs supported by literature. Our method achieves high sensitivity and specificity for predicting experimentally verified TFBSs.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3ayeasts 3atranscription factors 3aDNA-binding domains 3abinding sites 3apromoter regions 0atranscription factor-binding site1 aTsai, Huai-Kuang1 aHsu, Chen-Ming1 aMay Chen, Mei-Ju1 aHung, Hao-Geng1 aHuang, Grace Tzu-Wei1 aLi, Wen-Hsiung0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Feb. 19, v. 105, no. 7 p.2527-2532dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07121881053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080429b20080502c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/04/29  aOther US 7aarticle01231naa a2200385 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115245002800131300001600159300002400175500001500199520024800214650001500462650001200477650001900489650002000508650001600528650002300544650001800567650002300585650002300608650001600631650001000647653002500657653001400682773007400696852000900770939003300779945000800812946001300820655001200833991573309890742620221120173422.0910604e199012  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI910015432DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNewsome, R.10aOrganically grown foods  ap. 123-130.  ap. 123-130. charts.  a2019-12-05  aThis Scientific Status Summary addresses the market for organically grown foods and summarizes the current scientific information available on the perceived attributes of organically grown foods compared to those of conventionally grown foods. 3amotivation 3afarmers 3ahealth beliefs 3anutritive value 3afood prices 3aconsumer attitudes 3aorganic foods 3aorganic production 3anutrition labeling 3afood safety 3ataste 0alaws and regulations 0amarketing0 tFood technology.g1990 Dec., v. 44, no. 12 p.123-130x0015-66397nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle01024naa a2200349 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115245002600131300001600157300002600173520012900199650001400328650001100342650001300353650001800366650002600384650002100410650002100431650002500452650001700477650001700494650001500511773007300526852000900599939003300608945000800641946001300649655001200662991573309700742620221120173445.0910520e199103  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI910013472DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColeman, E.10aSports drink research  ap. 104-106.  ap. 104-106, 108. ill.  aConsiderable research has been conducted to determine the benefits of consuming fluid replacement beverages during exercise. 3abeverages 3asports 3aexercise 3afluid therapy 3aintestinal absorption 3agastric emptying 3anutrient content 3adietary carbohydrate 3aelectrolytes 3apalatability 3aguidelines0 tFood technology.g1991 Mar., v. 45, no. 3 p.104-106x0015-66397nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02774naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001800184245012300202300001800325506007600343520108600419506003701505650001501542650001301557650001001570650001001580650002001590650001801610650001701628650002301645650001301668650003101681650003001712650003301742650001401775650002001789650002901809700002301838700001601861700002501877700001701902700002501919773017401944852000902118856008302127930003302210946001302243655001202256IND4403671320221207093411.0080328e20080325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440367132DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08009791052doi7 aPMC22907882pmcid7 a183473292pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArany, Zoltan10aGene expression-based screening identifies microtubule inhibitors as inducers of PGC-1α and oxidative phosphorylation  ap. 4721-4726.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α is a potent regulator of several metabolic pathways, including, in particular, the activation of oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial biogenesis. Recent evidence suggests that increasing PGC-1α activity may have beneficial effects in various conditions, including muscular dystrophy, diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases. We describe here a high-throughput screen to identify small molecules that induce PGC-1α expression in skeletal muscle cells. A number of drug classes are identified, including glucocorticoids, microtubule inhibitors, and protein synthesis inhibitors. These drugs induce PGC-1α mRNA, and the expression of a number of genes known to be regulated by PGC-1α. No induction of these target genes is seen in PGC-1α -/- cells, demonstrating that the drugs act through PGC-1α. These data demonstrate the feasibility of high-throughput screening for inducers of PGC-1α. Moreover, the data identify microtubule inhibitors and protein synthesis inhibitors as modulators of PGC-1α and oxidative phosphorylation.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiogenesis 3adiabetes 3adrugs 3agenes 3aglucocorticoids 3amessenger RNA 3amicrotubules 3amuscular dystrophy 3amyocytes 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aoxidative phosphorylation 3aprotein synthesis inhibitors 3ascreening 3askeletal muscle 3atranscription (genetics)1 aWagner, Bridget K.1 aMa, Yanhong1 aChinsomboon, Jessica1 aLaznik, Dina1 aSpiegelman, Bruce M.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Mar. 25, v. 105, no. 12 p.4721-4726dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08009791053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080328b20080404c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle00960naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115245006300131300001400194300004000208520015800248650001700406650002300423650002300446650001300469650002100482650002000503773007200523852000900595939003300604945000800637946001300645655001200658991573306890742620221120131714.0910306e199011  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI910005002DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKroll, B.J.10aEvaluating rating scales for sensory testing with children  ap. 78-80.  ap. 78-80, 82, 84, 86. ill., charts.  aSensory testing with children is becoming increasingly important to the food industry, but little research on appropriate methodology has been conducted. 3afood choices 3asensory evaluation 3aprogram evaluation 3achildren 3aprogram planning 3amarket analysis0 tFood technology.g1990 Nov., v. 44, no. 11 p.78-80x0015-66397nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle03810naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166072001700184072001700201072001700218100002100235245011100256300001800367500004600385500001500431506007600446520182500522506003702347650001302384650001802397650001702415650002502432650001402457650001802471650001802489650002702507650002002534650002202554650002602576650001802602650001002620650002502630650001102655650001902666650002002685653002402705653001402729653002802743653000802771700002002779700001602799700002002815773017402835852000903009856008303018930003303101945002503134946001303159655001203172IND4403668620221207091041.0080328e20080325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440366862DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07113631052doi7 aPMC22908122pmcid7 a183398062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Large-scale changes in a plant's transcriptome ensue, but how these changes are regulated remains unknown. Silencing of RNA-directed RNA polymerase 1 (RdR1) makes Nicotiana attenuata highly susceptible to insect herbivores, suggesting that defense elicitation is under the direct control of small-RNAs (smRNAs). Using 454-sequencing, we characterized N. attenuata's smRNA transcriptome before and after insect-specific elicitation in wild-type (WT) and RdR1-silenced (irRdR1) plants. We predicted the targets of N. attenuata smRNAs in the genes related to phytohormone signaling (jasmonic acid, JA-Ile, and ethylene) known to mediate resistance responses, and we measured the elicited dynamics of phytohormone biosynthetic transcripts and phytohormone levels in time-course experiments with field- and glasshouse-grown plants. RdR1 silencing severely altered the induced transcript accumulation of 8 of the 10 genes, reduced JA, and enhanced ethylene levels after elicitation. Adding JA completely restored the insect resistance of irRdR1 plants. irRdR1 plants had photosynthetic rates, growth, and reproductive output indistinguishable from that of WT plants, suggesting unaltered primary metabolism. We conclude that the susceptibility of irRdR1 plants to herbivores is due to altered phytohormone signaling and that smRNAs play a central role in coordinating the large-scale transcriptional changes that occur after herbivore attack. Given the diversity of smRNAs that are elicited after insect attack and the recent demonstration of the ability of ingested smRNAs to silence transcript accumulation in lepidopteran larvae midguts, the smRNA responses of plants may also function as direct defenses.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aethylene 3amessenger RNA 3aplant growth 3aphytophagous insects 3aNicotiana 3aManduca sexta 3ajasmonic acid 3aplant-insect relations 3agene expression 3aseed productivity 3aresistance mechanisms 3atranscriptome 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3alarvae 3aphotosynthesis 3apest resistance 0aNicotiana attenuata 0asmall RNA 0amolecular sequence data 0aRNA1 aShahi, Priyanka1 aGase, Klaus1 aBaldwin, Ian T.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Mar. 25, v. 105, no. 12 p.4559-4564dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07113631053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080506b20080606c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/05/05  aOther US 7aarticle02867naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002100184245007900205300001800284506007600302520124600378506003701624650001001661650002101671650001801692650002001710650003401730650001401764650002401778650002901802650003101831650002701862700002301889700002001912700001801932700002601950700002101976700001601997700002102013700002702034773017402061852000902235856008302244930003302327946001302360655001202373IND4403672820221207091036.0080328e20080325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440367282DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07109071052doi7 aPMC22907532pmcid7 a183398072pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSurindara Kaura.10aRole of the Akt pathway in mRNA translation of interferon-stimulated genes  ap. 4808-4813.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMultiple signaling pathways are engaged by the type I and II IFN receptors, but their specific roles and possible coordination in the generation of IFN-mediated biological responses remain unknown. We provide evidence that activation of Akt kinases is required for IFN-inducible engagement of the mTOR/p70 S6 kinase pathway. Our data establish that Akt activity is essential for up-regulation of key IFN-α- and IFN-γ-inducible proteins, which have important functional consequences in the induction of IFN responses. Such effects of the Akt pathway are unrelated to regulatory activities on IFN-dependent STAT phosphorylation/activation or transcriptional regulation. By contrast, they reflect regulatory activities on mRNA translation via direct control of the mTOR pathway. In studies using Akt1 and Akt2 double knockout cells, we found that the absence of Akt kinases results in dramatic reduction in IFN-induced antiviral responses, establishing a critical role of the Akt pathway in IFN signaling. Thus, activation of the Akt pathway by the IFN receptors complements the function of IFN-activated JAK-STAT pathways, by allowing mRNA translation of IFN-stimulated genes and, ultimately, the induction of the biological effects of IFNs.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3agenes 3ainterferon-alpha 3amessenger RNA 3aphosphorylation 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3areceptors 3asignal transduction 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptional activation 3atranslation (genetics)1 aSassano, Antonella1 aDolniak, Blazej1 aJoshi, Sonali1 aMajchrzak-Kita, Beata1 aBaker, Darren P.1 aHay, Nissim1 aFish, Eleanor N.1 aPlatanias, Leonidas C.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Mar. 25, v. 105, no. 12 p.4808-4813dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07109071053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080328b20080404c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01378naa a2200361 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245008800133300001400221300002200235500001500257520038400272650001200656650001600668650002000684650001900704650002100723650002100744650001600765650002300781650002300804653002500827700001800852773007100870852000900941939003300950945000800983946001300991655001201004991573305110742620221120122426.0920402e199201  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920009772DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThonney, P.F.10aGovernment regulation of food safety: interaction of scientific and societal forces  ap. 73-80.  ap. 73-80. charts.  a2019-12-05  aThis summary reviews the roles federal, state, and local governments in safeguarding consumers against hazards associated with the food supply.

We have recently found that enforced expression of Cdc6, the assembler of prereplicative complexes, markedly advances recovery from the prolonged S-phase arrest and reactivation of Cdk2 despite the presence of a high level of induced p21. Here, we report that Cdc6 protein can activate p21-associated Cdk2 in an ATP-dependent manner in vitro. Consistently, Cdc6 mutated for ATPase or a putative cyclin binding motif is no longer able to activate the Cdk2 in vitro or promote reinitiation of S-phase progression and reactivation of Cdk2 in vivo. These results reveal the never anticipated function of Cdc6 and redefine its role in the control of S-phase progression in mammalian cells.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3acyclin-dependent kinase 3acyclins 3ainterphase 3amammals1 aJinno, Shigeki1 aYamamoto, Hanako1 aKobayashi, Kohei1 aOkayama, Hiroto0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Mar. 25, v. 105, no. 12 p.4757-4762dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07063921053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080328b20080404c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03763naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166072001700184100002000201245007400221300001800295500001500313506007600328520166100404506003702065650000902102650002302111650001702134650001902151650001302170650002002183650002302203650002002226650001002246650002502256650001302281650002202294650002502316650002002341651001302361651001202374651001402386651001302400651000902413651002002422653002302442653001702465700002602482700002202508700001702530700001902547700002502566700002502591700002502616700001802641700001502659700002002674700002202694773017402716852000902890856008302899930003302982945002503015946001303040655001203053IND4403672120221207092029.0080328e20080325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440367212DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07105811052doi7 aPMC22907862pmcid7 a183623462pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In many countries where the virus was detected, the virus was successfully controlled, whereas other countries face periodic reoccurrence despite significant control efforts. A central question is to understand the factors favoring the continuing reoccurrence of the virus. The abundance of domestic ducks, in particular free-grazing ducks feeding in intensive rice cropping areas, has been identified as one such risk factor based on separate studies carried out in Thailand and Vietnam. In addition, recent extensive progress was made in the spatial prediction of rice cropping intensity obtained through satellite imagery processing. This article analyses the statistical association between the recorded HPAI H5N1 virus presence and a set of five key environmental variables comprising elevation, human population, chicken numbers, duck numbers, and rice cropping intensity for three synchronous epidemic waves in Thailand and Vietnam. A consistent pattern emerges suggesting risk to be associated with duck abundance, human population, and rice cropping intensity in contrast to a relatively low association with chicken numbers. A statistical risk model based on the second epidemic wave data in Thailand is found to maintain its predictive power when extrapolated to Vietnam, which supports its application to other countries with similar agro-ecological conditions such as Laos or Cambodia. The model's potential application to mapping HPAI H5N1 disease risk in Indonesia is discussed.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3arice 3apoultry production 3aOryza sativa 3aremote sensing 3aaltitude 3arisk assessment 3apopulation density 3acrop production 3aducks 3astatistical analysis 3achickens 3aInfluenza A virus 3adisease transmission 3aavian influenza 3aThailand 3aVietnam 3aIndonesia 3aCambodia 3aLaos 0aSoutheast Asia. 0acropping intensity 0aepidemiology1 aXiao, X.q(Xiangming)1 aPfeiffer, Dirk U.1 aEpprecht, M.1 aBoles, Stephen1 aCzarnecki, Christina1 aChaitaweesub, Prasit1 aKalpravidh, Wantanee1 aMinh, Phan Q.1 aOtte, M.J.1 aMartin, Vincent1 aSlingenbergh, Jan0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Mar. 25, v. 105, no. 12 p.4769-4774dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07105811053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080506b20080606c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/05/05  aOther US 7aarticle03114naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001700184245011500201300001800316500001500334506007600349520124400425506003701669650002601706650002101732650002001753650002201773650002401795650001801819650001101837650001101848650001701859650001801876650001001894650002001904650002201924650001901946650001701965650001401982653001301996700002102009700002102030700002202051700002502073700001902098700001702117700002302134700002202157700002102179773017402200852000902374856008302383930003302466946001302499655001202512IND4403671420221207092035.0080328e20080325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440367142DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07084551052doi7 aPMC22907482pmcid7 a183398112pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartin, Maud10aProtein phosphatase 2A controls the activity of histone deacetylase 7 during T cell apoptosis and angiogenesis  ap. 4727-4732.  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aClass IIa histone deacetylases (HDACs) act as key transcriptional regulators in several important developmental programs. Their activities are controlled via phosphorylation-dependent nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Phosphorylation of conserved serine residues triggers association with 14-3-3 proteins and cytoplasmic relocalization of class IIa HDACs, which leads to the derepression of their target genes. Although a lot of effort has been made toward the identification of the inactivating kinases that phosphorylate class IIa HDAC 14-3-3 motifs, the existence of an antagonistic protein phosphatase remains elusive. Here we identify PP2A as a phosphatase responsible for dephosphorylating the 14-3-3 binding sites in class IIa HDACs. Interestingly, dephosphorylation of class IIa HDACs by PP2A is prevented by competitive association of 14-3-3 proteins. Using both okadaic acid treatment and RNA interference, we demonstrate that PP2A constitutively dephosphorylates the class IIa member HDAC7 to control its biological functions as a regulator of T cell apoptosis and endothelial cell functions. This study unravels a dynamic interplay among 14-3-3s, protein kinases, and PP2A and provides a model for the regulation of class IIa HDACs.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3atranscription factors 3aRNA interference 3aprotein kinases 3aendothelial cells 3ahistone deacetylase 3aT-lymphocytes 3aserine 3amodels 3aokadaic acid 3abinding sites 3agenes 3aphosphorylation 3adephosphorylation 3aacid treatment 3aangiogenesis 3aapoptosis 0aproteins1 aPotente, Michael1 aJanssens, Veerle1 aVertommen, Didier1 aTwizere, Jean-Claude1 aRider, Mark H.1 aGoris, Jozef1 aDimmeler, Stefanie1 aKettmann, Richard1 aDequiedt, Franck0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Mar. 25, v. 105, no. 12 p.4727-4732dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07084551053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080328b20080404c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02321naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245008300127300001600210500001500226520124600241650001701487650001201504650002101516650001001537650001501547650002501562650001201587650002501599650002201624650001001646650002401656651001401680653001201694653001501706653002501721700001501746700001701761773006601778852000901844939003301853946001301886655001201899IND9207027420221120091109.0921117e199207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920702742DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYenish, J.P.10aEffects of tillage on vertical distribution and viability of weed seed in soil  ap. 429-433.  a2019-12-04  aThe effect of different levels of tillage and weed management on population, distribution, and germination of weed seed was evaluated in three tillage systems at Arlington and Hancock, WI, in 1989 and 1990. Over 60% of all weed seed in the top 19 cm of soil were found in the top 1 cm in no-tillage at both sites. As depth increased, concentration of weed seed declined logarithmically in no-tillage. In chisel plowing, over 30% of seed were in the top 1 cm and seed concentration decreased linearly with depth. Moldboard plowing had uniform distribution of weed seed in the top 19 cm of soil. Preemergence metolachlor plus atrazine decreased weed seed population by 50% compared with no treatment over all tillage systems. One year of the herbicide treatment plus handweeding to assure weed-free conditions did not reduce seed numbers in chisel plowing or moldboard plowing compared to herbicide alone. Seed numbers with no-tillage and weed-free conditions decreased by 40% relative to herbicide alone. Common lambsquarters germination was 40% greater in moldboard plowing and chisel plowing compared with no-tillage. Germination was highest in seed taken from 9 to 19 cm deep in moldboard plowing and from 0 to 9 cm deep in chisel plowing. 3aweed biology 3aannuals 3aseed germination 3aseeds 3ano-tillage 3aconventional tillage 3aplowing 3aspatial distribution 3aChenopodium album 3aweeds 3apopulation dynamics 3aWisconsin 0atillage 0aseed banks 0aconservation tillage1 aDoll, J.D.1 aBuhler, D.D.0 tWeed science.g1992 , v. 40, no. 3 p.429-433x0043-17457nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02764naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166072001700184100002100201245009100222300001800313500001500331506007600346520124500422506003701667650002201704650003001726650003001756650002101786653004701807653003001854700001601884700001901900700001801919700002101937700002401958773017301982852000902155856008302164930003302247945002502280946001302305655001202318IND4401904320221207090511.0080223e20080219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440190432DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07073741052doi7 aPMC22682052pmcid7 a182587472pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSugawara, Hajime10aStructural insight into the reaction mechanism and evolution of cytokinin biosynthesis  ap. 2734-2739.  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe phytohormone cytokinin regulates plant growth and development. This hormone is also synthesized by some phytopathogenic bacteria, such as Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and is as a key factor in the formation of plant tumors. The rate-limiting step of cytokinin biosynthesis is catalyzed by adenosine phosphate-isopentenyltransferase (IPT). Agrobacterium IPT has a unique substrate specificity that enables it to increase trans-zeatin production by recruiting a metabolic intermediate of the host plant's biosynthetic pathway. Here, we show the crystal structures of Tzs, an IPT from A. tumefaciens, complexed with AMP and a prenyl-donor analogue, dimethylallyl S-thiodiphosphate. The structures reveal that the carbon-nitrogen-based prenylation proceeds by the SN2-reaction mechanism. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to determine the amino acid residues, Asp-173 and His-214, which are responsible for differences in prenyl-donor substrate specificity between plant and bacterial IPTs. IPT and the p loop-containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolases likely evolved from a common ancestral protein. Despite structural similarities, IPT has evolved a distinct role in which the p loop transfers a prenyl moiety in cytokinin biosynthesis.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acrystal structure 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3aacyltransferases 0aadenosine phosphate-isopentenyltransferase 0aAgrobacterium tumefaciens1 aUeda, Nanae1 aKojima, Mikiko1 aMakita, Nobue1 aYamaya, Tomoyuki1 aSakakibara, Hitoshi0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Feb. 19, v. 105, no. 7 p.2734-2739dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07073741053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080430b20080502c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/04/30  aOther US 7aarticle03184naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001900184245007800203300001800281506007600299520135100375506003701726650001601763650001701779650002601796650001401822650001401836650002301850650001401873650001101887650002901898650001801927650002201945650001701967650002401984650001902008650001402027650001402041650002602055700001902081700002302100700002002123700002502143700002302168700002302191700002402214700002202238700002302260773017302283852000902456856008302465930003302548946001302581655001202594IND4401897120221207080604.0080223e20080219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440189712DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07121981052doi7 aPMC22681332pmcid7 a182683462pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWrasidlo, Wolf14aThe marine lipopeptide somocystinamide A triggers apoptosis via caspase 8  ap. 2313-2318.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aScreening for novel anticancer drugs in chemical libraries isolated from marine organisms, we identified the lipopeptide somocystinamide A (ScA) as a pluripotent inhibitor of angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation. The antiproliferative activity was largely attributable to induction of programmed cell death. Sensitivity to ScA was significantly increased among cells expressing caspase 8, whereas siRNA knockdown of caspase 8 increased survival after exposure to ScA. ScA rapidly and efficiently partitioned into liposomes while retaining full antiproliferative activity. Consistent with the induction of apoptosis via the lipid compartment, we noted accumulation and aggregation of ceramide in treated cells and subsequent colocalization with caspase 8. Angiogenic endothelial cells were extremely sensitive to ScA. Picomolar concentrations of ScA disrupted proliferation and endothelial tubule formation in vitro. Systemic treatment of zebrafish or local treatment of the chick chorioallantoic membrane with ScA resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of angiogenesis, whereas topical treatment blocked tumor growth among caspase-8-expressing tumors. Together, the results reveal an unexpected mechanism of action for this unique lipopeptide and suggest future development of this and similar agents as antiangiogenesis and anticancer drugs.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDanio rerio 3aangiogenesis 3aantineoplastic agents 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-8 3acell proliferation 3aceramides 3achicks 3achorioallantoic membrane 3adose response 3aendothelial cells 3alipopeptides 3amechanism of action 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3ascreening 3asmall interfering RNA1 aMielgo, Ainhoa1 aTorres, Vicente A.1 aBarbero, Simone1 aStoletov, Konstantin1 aSuyama, Takashi L.1 aKlemke, Richard L.1 aGerwick, William H.1 aCarson, Dennis A.1 aStupack, Dwayne G.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Feb. 19, v. 105, no. 7 p.2313-2318dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07121981053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080224b20080301c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle00872naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002100115245006000136300001400196300002200210520010500232650002300337650001800360650002500378650002400403653002100427773007100448852000900519939003300528945000800561946001300569655001200582991573300130742620221120070719.0900307e199001  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI900003202DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChambers, E.

Two pathways that are integral to setting the balance between cell survival and cell death are controlled by lipid-activated protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt and Ca²⁺. PKB elicits its effects through the phosphorylation and inactivation of proapoptotic factors. Ca²⁺ stimulates many prodeath pathways, among which is mitochondrial permeability transition. We identified Ca²⁺ release through inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP₃R) intracellular channels as a prosurvival target of PKB. We demonstrated that in response to survival signals, PKB interacts with and phosphorylates InsP₃Rs, significantly reducing their Ca²⁺ release activity. Moreover, phosphorylation of InsP₃Rs by PKB reduced cellular sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli through a mechanism that involved diminished Ca²⁺ flux from the endoplasmic reticulum to the mitochondria. In glioblastoma cells that exhibit hyperactive PKB, the same prosurvival effect of PKB on InsP₃R was found to be responsible for the insensitivity of these cells to apoptotic stimuli. We propose that PKB-mediated abolition of InsP₃-induced Ca²⁺ release may afford tumor cells a survival advantage.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aapoptosis 3acalcium 3acell viability 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3ainositols 3amitochondria 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3anon-specific serine/threonine protein kinase 3apermeability 3aphosphorylation 3areceptors1 aVanderheyden, Veerle1 aParys, Jan B.1 aDe Smedt, Humbert1 aRietdorf, Katja1 aKotelevets, Larissa1 aChastre, Eric1 aKhan, Farid1 aLandegren, Ulf1 aSöderberg, Ola1 aBootman, Martin D.1 aRoderick, H.

The approach centers on a "promoter-hijack" strategy in which the gene's promoter is replaced with a minimal promoter responsive to the tetracycline-repressible transactivator (tTA). Elsewhere in the genome, a cloned fragment of the gene's promoter is used to drive expression of a tTA. Thus, the gene is essentially regulated by its own promoter but through the intermediary tTA. Using this strategy, we generated a conditional knockout of chromokinesin KIF4A, an important mitotic effector protein whose mRNA is multiply spliced and whose cDNA is highly toxic when overexpressed in cells. We used chicken DT40 cells, but the same strategy should be applicable to ES cells and, eventually, to mice.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achickens 3amessenger RNA 3atetracycline 3agene overexpression 3acomplementary DNA 3amice 3aisolation techniques 3atransactivators 3astart codon 3atoxicity 3acell cycle 3aculture media 0agenes1 aOgawa, Hiromi1 aCooke, Carol A.1 aHudson, Damien1 aMacIsaac, Fiona1 aRibeiro, Susana A.1 aVagnarelli, Paola1 aCardinale, Stefano1 aKerr, Alastair1 aLai, Fan1 aRuchaud, Sandrine1 aYue, Zuojun1 aEarnshaw, William C.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Feb. 19, v. 105, no. 7 p.2457-2462dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07120831053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080224b20080301c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02321naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001800184245004800202300001800250506007600268520102700344506003701371650002501408650002601433650002601459650002301485700002401508700002301532700002601555700002101581700002201602773017301624852000901797856008301806930003301889946001301922655001201935IND4401896520221207094124.0080223e20080219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440189652DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07069941052doi7 aPMC22681272pmcid7 a182724992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWood, Kris C.10aElectroactive controlled release thin films  ap. 2280-2285.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe present the fabrication of nanoscale electroactive thin films that can be engineered to undergo remotely controlled dissolution in the presence of a small applied voltage (+1.25 V) to release precise quantities of chemical agents. These films, which are assembled by using a nontoxic, FDA-approved, electroactive material known as Prussian Blue, are stable enough to release a fraction of their contents after the application of a voltage and then to restabilize upon its removal. As a result, it is possible to externally trigger agent release, exert control over the relative quantity of agents released from a film, and release multiple doses from one or more films in a single solution. These electroactive systems may be rapidly and conformally coated onto a wide range of substrates without regard to size, shape, or chemical composition, and as such they may find use in a host of new applications in drug delivery as well as the related fields of tissue engineering, medical diagnostics, and chemical detection.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achemical composition 3adiagnostic techniques 3adrug delivery systems 3atissue engineering1 aZacharia, Nicole S.1 aSchmidt, Daniel J.1 aWrightman, Stefani N.1 aAndaya, Brian J.1 aHammond, Paula T.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Feb. 19, v. 105, no. 7 p.2280-2285dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07069941053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080224b20080301c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01013naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001500115245009600130300001600226300003500242520019600277650001600473650002100489650001600510650000900526653002200535700001700557773007400574852000900648939003300657945000800690946001300698655001200711991573296500742620221120043632.0891219e198909  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI890019712DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHall, R.L.10aFood toxicology and safety evaluation: changing perspectives and a challenge for the future  ap. 270-274.  ap. 270-274, 276, 278-279. ill.  aToxic substances occur in food naturally or as a result of chemicals added to food.

Recently, other methods have emerged, such as the use of artificial transcription factors and engineering of the native ones. As methods for generating genetic diversity continue to proliferate, the need for quantifying phenotypic diversity and, hence, assessing the potential of various genetic libraries for strain improvement becomes more pronounced. Here, we present a metric based on the quantification of phenotypic diversity, using Lactobacillus plantarum as a model organism. We found that phenotypic diversity can be introduced by mutagenesis of the principal σ factor, that this diversity can be modulated by tuning the sequence diversity, and that this method compares favorably with commonly used protocols for chemical mutagenesis. The results of the diversity metric here developed also correlated well with the probability of finding improved mutants in the different libraries, as determined by recursive screening under stress. In addition, we subjected our libraries to lactic and inorganic acids and found strains with improved growth in both conditions, with a concomitant increase in lactate productivity.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aengineering 3agenetic variation 3ainorganic acids 3amutagenesis 3amutants 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic variation 3aprobability 3ascreening 3atranscription factors1 aStephanopoulos, Gregory0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Feb. 19, v. 105, no. 7 p.2319-2324dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07121771053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080224b20080301c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03184naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166072001700184100002200201245008800223300001800311506007600329520105200405506003701457650002101494650002601515650003101541650002901572650001401601650002101615650001901636650002301655650002901678650001201707650002401719650000901743653002401752653002401776653003501800700002201835700002101857700001801878700001801896700002801914700002501942700002001967700001801987700002002005700002302025700002302048700002302071700001802094700002202112700001902134700002102153773017302174852000902347856008302356930003302439945002502472946001302497655001202510IND4401897320221207094127.0080223e20080219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440189732DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07121621052doi7 aPMC22681352pmcid7 a182870832pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aPearson, Kevin J.10aNrf2 mediates cancer protection but not prolongevity induced by caloric restriction  ap. 2325-2330.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCaloric restriction (CR) is the most potent intervention known to both protect against carcinogenesis and extend lifespan in laboratory animals. A variety of anticarcinogens and CR mimetics induce and activate the NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway. Nrf2, in turn, induces a number of antioxidative and carcinogen-detoxifying enzymes. Thus, Nrf2 offers a promising target for anticarcinogenesis and antiaging interventions. We used Nrf2-disrupted (KO) mice to examine its role on the biological effects of CR. Here, we show that Nrf2 is responsible for most of the anticarcinogenic effects of CR, but is dispensable for increased insulin sensitivity and lifespan extension. Nrf2-deficient mice developed tumors more readily in response to carcinogen exposure than did WT mice, and CR was ineffective in suppressing tumors in the KO mice. However, CR extended lifespan and increased insulin sensitivity similarly in KO and WT mice. These findings identify a molecular pathway that dissociates the prolongevity and anticarcinogenic effects of CR.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3alow calorie diet 3atranscription factors 3agene expression regulation 3atranscription (genetics) 3alongevity 3aoxidative stress 3acarcinogenesis 3adisease prevention 3ametabolic detoxification 3ainsulin 3ahormonal regulation 3amice 0acaloric restriction 0aantioxidant enzymes 0acarcinogen-detoxifying enzymes1 aLewis, Kaitlyn N.1 aPrice, Nathan L.1 aChang, Joy W.1 aPerez, Evelyn1 aCascajo, Maria Victoria1 aTamashiro, Kellie L.1 aPoosala, Suresh1 aCsiszar, Anna1 aUngvari, Zoltan1 aKensler, Thomas W.1 aYamamoto, Masayuki1 aEgan, Josephine M.1 aLongo, Dan L.1 aIngram, Donald K.1 aNavas, Placido1 aCabo, Rafael de.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Feb. 19, v. 105, no. 7 p.2325-2330dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07121621053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080429b20080502c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/04/29  aOther US 7aarticle02369naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245008200204300001800286506007600304520094400380506003701324650002001361650002301381650004401404650001201448650001901460650001101479700001801490700001501508700001301523700001501536700001701551700001901568700001101587700001401598773017301612852000901785856008301794930003301877946001301910655001201923IND4401896620221207094126.0080223e20080219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440189662DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07115051052doi7 aPMC22681282pmcid7 a182870802pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLedbetter, M.P.10aZero-field remote detection of NMR with a microfabricated atomic magnetometer  ap. 2286-2290.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe demonstrate remote detection of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) with a microchip sensor consisting of a microfluidic channel and a microfabricated vapor cell (the heart of an atomic magnetometer). Detection occurs at zero magnetic field, which allows operation of the magnetometer in the spin-exchange relaxation-free (SERF) regime and increases the proximity of sensor and sample by eliminating the need for a solenoid to create a leading field. We achieve pulsed NMR linewidths of 26 Hz, limited, we believe, by the residence time and flow dispersion in the encoding region. In a fully optimized system, we estimate that for 1 s of integration, 7 x 10¹³ protons in a volume of 1 mm³, prepolarized in a 10-kG field, can be detected with a signal-to-noise ratio of [almost equal to]3. This level of sensitivity is competitive with that demonstrated by microcoils in 100-kG magnetic fields, without requiring superconducting magnets.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amagnetic fields 3amagnetic materials 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aprotons 3aremote sensing 3avapors1 aSavukov, I.M.1 aBudker, D.1 aShah, V.1 aKnappe, S.1 aKitching, J.1 aMichalak, D.J.1 aXu, S.1 aPines, A.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Feb. 19, v. 105, no. 7 p.2286-2290dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07115051053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080224b20080301c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02589naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001500184245006300199300001800262506007600280520117100356506003701527650000801564650001801572650001401590650002301604650002001627650001101647650002201658700001301680700002901693700002001722700001801742700002001760700002601780700002601806773017301832852000902005856008302014930003302097946001302130655001202143IND4401902120221207094135.0080223e20080219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440190212DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07120851052doi7 aPMC22681832pmcid7 a182724782pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yawen14aThe genome landscape of ERα- and ERβ-binding DNA regions  ap. 2604-2609.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn this article, we have applied the ChIP-on-chip approach to pursue a large scale identification of ERα- and ERβ-binding DNA regions in intact chromatin. We show that there is a high degree of overlap between the regions identified as bound by ERα and ERβ, respectively, but there are also regions that are bound by ERα only in the presence of ERβ, as well as regions that are selectively bound by either receptor. Analysis of bound regions shows that regions bound by ERα have distinct properties in terms of genome landscape, sequence features, and conservation compared with regions that are bound by ERβ. ERβ-bound regions are, as a group, located more closely to transcription start sites. ERα- and ERβ-bound regions differ in sequence properties, with ERα-bound regions having an overrepresentation of TA-rich motifs including forkhead binding sites and ERβ-bound regions having a predominance of classical estrogen response elements (EREs) and GC-rich motifs. Differences in the properties of ER bound regions might explain some of the differences in gene expression programs and physiological effects shown by the respective estrogen receptors.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3abinding sites 3achromatin 3aestrogen receptors 3agene expression 3agenome 3aresponse elements1 aGao, Hui1 aMarstrand, Troels Torben1 aStröm, Anders.1 aValen, Eivind1 aSandelin, Albin1 aGustafsson, Jan-Åke.1 aDahlman-Wright, Karin0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Feb. 19, v. 105, no. 7 p.2604-2609dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07120851053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080224b20080301c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03197naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163100002700172245010500199300001800304500002400322520169100346650001902037650002102056650002402077650002302101650001202124650002302136650002502159650003002184650001302214650001202227650003502239650003102274651001802305651001102323651002702334653001702361700002602378700002202404773010202426852000902528856008502537930003302622945002502655946001102680655001202691IND4420952220221123004123.0090522e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442095222DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-008-9346-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF900 0aP010 0aF3001 aDillemuth, Forrest P. 10aPatch dynamics of a native grass in relation to the spread of invasive smooth brome (Bromus inermis)  ap. 1381-1391.  aIncludes references  aThe effects of invasive species on the patch dynamics (establishment, growth, and local extinction) of native species are not well studied, owing to the need for relatively fine-scale data on the distribution of species. Within the prairie pothole region of the United States and Canada, the grass, Bromus inermis (smooth brome) has become established by invading disturbed prairies, and through repeated introductions for soil retention and animal graze. In this study, the impact of smooth brome on the patch dynamics of a dominant native grass species, Spartina pectinata (prairie cordgrass), was assessed using fine-scale (sub-meter) mapping of the distribution of cordgrass and brome in three prairie fragments from 2000 to 2006. Using GIS spatial analyses, we determined that cordgrass patch growth was two times greater in areas not invaded by smooth brome versus areas that were heavily infested with smooth brome. Among sites and time periods, there was a consistent significant negative relationship between the amount of smooth brome surrounding a patch of cordgrass and the growth of that cordgrass patch. The probability of establishment of a new patch of cordgrass averaged 1.3 times higher in areas of low brome coverage (<25%) than areas of high brome coverage (>75%). Conversely, existing cordgrass patches were 7.8 times more likely to go extinct in areas of high than low brome coverage. This is one of only a few field studies to provide evidence of the negative impact of smooth brome on native flora and hopefully will serve as justification for the development of a formal management plan to limit the distribution of this species in tallgrass prairie ecosystems. 3aBromus inermis 3ainvasive species 3aecological invasion 3aindigenous species 3agrasses 3aSpartina pectinata 3aspatial distribution 3ageographical distribution 3aprairies 3asurveys 3ageographic information systems 3aglobal positioning systems 3aUnited States 3aCanada 3aPrairie Pothole region 0apatch growth1 aRietschier, Erick A. 1 aCronin, James T. 0 tBiological invasions.g2009 June, v. 11, no. 6 p.1381-1391dSpringer Netherlandsx1387-35477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-008-9346-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20090612b20090703c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/06/12  aNon-US 7aarticle02875naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100002100127245009300148300001400241500011200255500001500367520140000382650001601782650001801798650001901816650002301835650002301858650001301881650001601894650001701910650002601927650003801953650002001991650003402011650001602045650001702061651001302078653003202091700001602123700001402139700001602153700001602169700001502185773009102200852000902291930003302300945002502333946001102358655001202369IND4376898120221123004207.0051227e20051115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437689812DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Herds were visited to ascertain BVDV-vaccine use and to collect a bulk tank milk (BTM) sample and serum from 1268 cattle to analyse BVDV-antibodies using an NS2-3 ELISA. Fifty-three percent of farmers used inactivated BVDV-vaccines whilst the remaining farmers were not presently using BVDV-vaccines. BMT-antibody results included 35% positives, 25% negative and 39% inconclusive, and were similar in vaccinated and non-vaccinated herds (p > 0.05) and allowed estimating a 10% BVDV herd-prevalence from prior knowledge of the relationship between BMT-antibody results and probability of PI cattle in the herd. Overall individual seroprevalence was 27% and was 23% in non-vaccinated and 36% in vaccinated cattle (p < 0.05). Contact of the herd with BVDV was assessed according to seroprevalence in young and adult cattle in the herd and it was estimated that 35% of herds were infected or had recent contact with BVDV, 40% were not infected and did not have recent contact with BVDV and the BVDV-infection and - contact status of remaining herds was undetermined. The results from this study indicate BVDV is endemic and BVDV-vaccines are widespread in the dairy-cattle population in EDM region in Portugal. 3adairy herds 3amilk analysis 3aseroprevalence 3adisease prevalence 3aantibody detection 3avaccines 3aherd health 3adairy cattle 3abovine viral diarrhea 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3adisease control 3aBovine viral diarrhea virus 1 3avaccination 3acase studies 3aPortugal 0aBovine viral diarrhea virus1 aPereira, A.1 aSouza, J.1 aMadeira, H.1 aBarbosa, A.1 aAfonso, C.0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2005 Nov. 15, v. 72, no. 1-2 p.81-85x0167-58777nnas  aDNAL  a20061011b20061102c00000000  aINDd3CTe2006/07/18  aNon-US 7aarticle02255naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001800127245007000145300001400215500011200229500001500341520078600356650001401142650001001156650002301166650002601189650001301215650001901228650003701247650003401284650002201318650001601340651001601356653003201372653001401404700001401418700001601432700002101448700001801469700001701487700001701504700001401521700001501535700001801550773009101568852000901659930003301668945002501701946001101726655001201737IND4376897520221123004210.0051227e20051115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437689752DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

To date, representatives of subgenogroup k have been detected in Switzerland only. Despite serological evidence of Border disease in sheep, only few Border disease viruses have been isolated, all of which belong to the novel group 3. Serological evidence suggested that pestivirus infections may occur also in wild ruminants in Switzerland but no isolates are available for analysis. In addition, we describe two pestiviruses, one a cell culture contaminant and the other isolated from a buffalo, that cluster with a recently proposed novel pestivirus species. 3abuffaloes 3asheep 3astrain differences 3abovine viral diarrhea 3agenotype 3aborder disease 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3aBovine viral diarrhea virus 1 3agenetic variation 3anew species 3aSwitzerland 0aBovine viral diarrhea virus 0aruminants1 aMeier, P.1 aPfaffen, G.1 aWageck-Canal, C.1 aRufenacht, J.1 aSchaller, P.1 aBachofen, C.1 aMarti, S.1 aVogt, H.R.1 aPeterhans, E.0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2005 Nov. 15, v. 72, no. 1-2 p.37-41x0167-58777nnas  aDNAL  a20061011b20061102c00000000  aINDd3CTe2006/07/18  aNon-US 7aarticle01814naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245008500123300001400208520096300222650002201185650002301207650002201230650002701252650002001279650001401299650001301313700001601326773009201342852000901434930003301443945001301476946001101489655001201500IND2328981720221123004020.0020919e200202  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232898172DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLioi, L.10aOligonucleotide DNA fingerprinting revealing polymorphism in Phaseolus lunatus L  ap. 53-58.  aDigoxigenated synthetic oligonucleotides complementary to simple repetitive DNA sequences were used to detect polymorphisms in Phaseolus lunatus L.

It could be shown that five repetitive motifs, namely (AAT)5, (ATG)5, (GACA)4,(GATA)4, (GGAT)4, were able to give clear-cut bands when used as probes and to reveal high levels of variation. The highest resolving power was revealed by the (AAT)5 probe, which was able to detect even inter-individual polymorphisms. Therefore, oligonucleotide fingerprinting has proved to be a useful tool to analyse genetic diversity in Lima bean. Phylogenetic reconstruction based on JACCARD's similarity index confirmed the existence of two major gene pools and the presence of a minor group of genetically separated intermediate genotypes. 3aPhaseolus lunatus 3aDNA fingerprinting 3agenetic variation 3amicrosatellite repeats 3agenetic markers 3aphylogeny 3agenotype1 aGalasso, I.0 tGenetic resources and crop evolution.g2002 Feb., v. 49, no. 1 p.53-58x0925-98647nnas  aDNAL  a20030304b20030311c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02339naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001700127245005400144300001400198500011200212500001500324520094200339650001601281650002201297650002301319650002301342650001401365650001601379650001701395650002601412650002901438650003801467650003401505650002201539651001101561653003201572700001801604700001901622700001501641700001801656700001401674773009101688852000901779930003301788945002501821946001101846655001201857IND4376897920221122042726.0051227e20051115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437689792DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalences of BVD antigen-positive and PI animals, and investigate the significance of the associations between the prevalence estimates and herd size. Initially, all animals were bled and examined for BVDV, using an antigen ELISA. A second sample was collected from the positive animals, after a period of at least three weeks. Animals retested positive were classified as PI. Antigen positive and PI animals were detected in all herds. The respective mean prevalences, adjusted for the test's accuracy and the herd-clustering effect, were 14% (95%CI: 11-18%) and 1.3% (0.8-1.8%), respectively. Herd size was not associated with the prevalence of antigen-positive or PI animals. 3adairy herds 3aantigen detection 3avirus transmission 3adisease prevalence 3aherd size 3aherd health 3adairy cattle 3abovine viral diarrhea 3adisease control programs 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aBovine viral diarrhea virus 1 3aculling (animals) 3aGreece 0aBovine viral diarrhea virus1 aLeontides, L.1 aAmiridis, G.S.1 aSpyrou, V.1 aKostoulas, P.1 aSofia, M.0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2005 Nov. 15, v. 72, no. 1-2 p.75-79x0167-58777nnas  aDNAL  a20061011b20061102c00000000  aINDd3CTe2006/07/18  aNon-US 7aarticle02958naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245010800165300001800273520167000291592002801961650002101989650002002010650001302030650001902043650002202062650001502084650001002099650001102109650001902120650001102139650001502150650001402165650001902179650002602198650003002224650001002254700002602264700002002290700001802310773009102328856008402419852000902503655001202512IND60549509120221121234251.0160908e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054950912DNAL7 a10.1094/PHYTO-09-14-0260-R2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarba, Paola10aVitis rupestris B38 Confers Isolate-Specific Quantitative Resistance to Penetration by Erysiphe necator  ap. 1097-1103.  aVitis rupestris B38 is a North American grapevine resistant to the major pathogen of cultivated grapevines, Erysiphe necator. Sources of powdery mildew resistance, like V. rotundifolia, are widely used in grape breeding but are already threatened, even before commercialization, by isolates that can reproduce on Run1 and other rotundifolia-derived breeding lines. Thus, complementary sources of resistance are needed to improve resistance durability. The segregation of foliar powdery mildew severity in an F₁ family, derived from a cross of V. rupestris B38 × V. vinifera ‘Chardonnay’, was observed in the field over three growing seasons and in potted vines following single-isolate inoculation. A pattern of continuous variation was observed in every instance. Mechanisms of resistance were analyzed on the resistant and susceptible parent by using microscopy to quantify the ability of the pathogen to penetrate and to form a colony on detached leaves. While ‘Chardonnay’ was susceptible in all tested conditions, V. rupestris B38 resistance was characterized by a reduction in pathogen penetration, with an effect of leaf position and significant differences among powdery mildew isolates. Segregation of the ability of the pathogen to penetrate and form a colony in F₁ individuals showed a pattern of quantitative penetration resistance with no delay or restriction on colony formation once penetration has been achieved. Moreover, V. rupestris B38 showed an enhanced penetration resistance to a powdery mildew isolate with the ability to overcome the Run1 gene, making it an interesting resistance source to prolong the durability of this gene.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUncinula necator 3aVitis rupestris 3abreeding 3abreeding lines 3acommercialization 3adurability 3agenes 3agrapes 3agrowing season 3aleaves 3amicroscopy 3apathogens 3apowdery mildew 3aresistance mechanisms 3aresistance to penetration 3avines1 aCadle-Davidson, Lance1 aGalarneau, Erin1 aReisch, Bruce0 tPhytopathology.g2015 Aug., v. 105, no. 8 p.1097-1103dPhytopathologyx0031-949X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094%2FPHYTO-09-14-0260-R3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02621naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100001400171245007600185300001800261520095500279592002801234650002001262650001701282650000901299650002601308650002201334650002001356650001601376650004901392650001201441650003001453650003501483650001901518650001101537650003301548650003201581650003001613650002101643653000801664653001701672653001701689653003001706653002001736653002301756653001901779700001701798700002401815700002101839773011101860856008701971852000902058655001202067IND50060283520221120154113.0190402e20130201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006028352DNAL7 a231945612pmid7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.03.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRock, Luc10aIsotopic analysis of eggs: Evaluating sample collection and preparation  ap. 1551-1556.  aEgg traceability/authenticity is a worldwide concern. Stable isotope techniques have been suggested as a tool to address this issue. To further validate the use of these techniques, a research project was undertaken to evaluate what effect sample collection and preparation have on the measured isotopic composition of egg components. The timing of egg collection, the timing of egg preparation after collection, and the use of pasteurisation were investigated. The C, N, O, and S isotopic compositions of egg components from 7 different production systems were measured. Two sets of eggs were collected (4months apart). It was found that the ‘isotopic fingerprint’ of a particular production system was maintained over time, and that it may be possible to trace liquid egg products based on isotopic data from fresh eggs. The findings from this study support the integration of stable isotope techniques in egg traceability/authenticity systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aegg composition 3aegg products 3aeggs 3aproduction technology 3aresearch projects 3astable isotopes 2aAge Factors 2aAnalytic Sample Preparation Methodsxmethods 2aAnimals 2aCarbon Isotopesxanalysis 2aChickensxgrowth & development 2aEggsxanalysis 2aFemale 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aNitrogen Isotopesxanalysis 2aOxygen Isotopesxanalysis 2aSulfurxanalysis 0aEgg 0aTraceability 0aAuthenticity 0aStable isotope techniques 0aCollection time 0aSample preparation 0aPasteurisation1 aRowe, Sylwia1 aCzerwiec, Agnieszka1 aRichmond, Harold0 tFood chemistry.g2013 Feb. 01, v. 136, no. 3-4 p.1551-1556dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.03.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02479naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245010300156300002000259520134200279592002801621650001501649650003001664650001301694650002601707650001901733650002201752650002601774700002001800700002101820700002701841700002101868700002001889773012501909856007402034852000902108655001202117IND60750043920221120035159.0210910e20210823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075004392DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ra05424d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDo, Thi-Nga10aComputational insights into structural, electronic, and optical properties of Janus GeSO monolayer  ap. 28381-28387.  aAlthough O is an element of chalcogen group, the study of two-dimensional (2D) O-based Janus dichalcogenides/monochalcogenides, especially their 1T-phase, has not been given sufficient attention. In this work, we systematically investigate the structural, electronic, and optical properties of 1T Janus GeSO monolayer by using the density functional theory. Via the analysis of phonon spectrum and evaluation of elastic constants, the GeSO monolayer is confirmed to be dynamically and mechanically stable. Calculated results for the elastic constants demonstrate that the Janus GeSO monolayer is much mechanically flexible than other 2D materials due to its small Young's modulus. At the ground state, while both GeS₂ and GeO₂ monolayers are indirect semiconductors, the Janus GeSO monolayer is found to be a direct band gap semiconductor. Further, effective masses of both electrons and holes are predicted to be directionally isotropic. The Janus GeSO monolayer has a broad absorption spectrum, which is activated from the visible light region and its absorption intensity is very high in the near-ultraviolet region. The calculated results not only systematically provide the fundamental physical properties of GeSO monolayer, but also stimulate scientists to further studying its importance both theoretically and experimentally.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3adensity functional theory 3aisotropy 3amodulus of elasticity 3asemiconductors 3aspectral analysis 3aultraviolet radiation1 aHieu, Nguyen N.1 aPoklonski, N.

To date, the research was mainly focused on exploring the biological effects of these functional lipids. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no report on the hydration-mediated self assembly of these lipids that leads to the formation of nanostructures, which are attractive for use as vehicles for the delivery of drugs and functional foods. In the present study, we investigated the temperature-composition phase behaviour of eicosapentaenoic acid monoglyceride (MAG-EPA), which is one of the most investigated ω-3 PUFA monoglycerides, during a heating–cooling cycle in the temperature range of 5–60 °C. Experimental synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) evidence on the formation of a dominant inverse hexagonal (H₂) lyotropic liquid crystalline phase and its temperature-induced transition to an inverse micellar solution (L₂ phase) is presented for the fully hydrated bulk MAG-EPA system and its corresponding dispersion. We produced colloidal MAG-EPA hexosomes with an internal inverse hexagonal (H₂) lyotropic crystalline phase in the presence of F127, a well-known polymeric stabilizer, or citrem, which is a negatively charged food-grade emulsifier. In this work, we report also on the formation of MAG-EPA hexosomes by vortexing MAG-EPA in excess aqueous medium containing F127 at room temperature. This low-energy emulsification method is different than most reported studies in the literature that have demonstrated the need for using a high-energy input during the emulsification step or adding an organic solvent for the formation of such colloidal nonlamellar liquid crystalline dispersions. The designed nanoparticles hold promise for future drug and functional food delivery applications due to their unique structural properties and the potential health-promoting effects of MAG-EPA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aambient temperature 3abioactive properties 3adispersions 3adrugs 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3aemulsifiers 3aemulsifying 3afunctional foods 3ahealth promotion 3ainflammation 3aliquids 3amonoacylglycerols 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasms 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3asolvents 3astabilizers1 aAl-Hosayni, Sabah1 aAmenitsch, Heinz1 aSalentinig, Stefan0 tLangmuir.g2017 Dec. 12, v. 33, no. 49 p.14045-14057dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.7b030783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03668naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024003500132024004200167040001800209100001700227245010400244300001400348506002800362506003600390506007600426506003100502520126600533592002801799596005801827596004501885506003701930650001201967650001301979650001901992650002202011650002802033650001502061650003302076650001502109650001002124650002102134650002202155650001602177650001102193650001702204650001902221650002802240650002002268650002102288650001402309650001002323650001702333653001802350653001202368653003402380653001902414653002502433653001802458653003802476653002802514700001802542700002402560700002002584700001902604700002302623700001902646700002102665773009902686856008202785903002202867852000902889655001202898IND60581950520221207110308.0190417e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058195052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cpb.2016.08.0012chorus7 a10.1016/j.cpb.2016.08.0012doi7 a10.1016/j.cpb.2016.08.0012chorusOpen  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, Zareen10aGrowth enhancement and drought tolerance of hybrid poplar upon inoculation with endophyte consortia  ap. 38-47.  aResource is Open Access  aElsevier BV License Information  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aWith increasing effects of global climate change, there is a strong interest in developing biofuels from trees such as poplar (Populus sp.) that have high C sequestration rates and relatively low chemical inputs. Using plant-microbe symbiosis to maximize plant growth and increase host stress tolerance may play an important role in improving the economic viability and environmental sustainability of poplar as a feedstock. Based on our previous research, a total of ten endophyte strains were selected as a consortium to investigate the effects of inoculation on commercial hardwood cuttings of Populus deltoides×P. nigra clone OP-367. After one and a half months of growth under non-stress conditions followed by one month under water stress, there was substantial growth promotion with improved leaf physiology of poplar plants in response to the endophyte inoculation. Furthermore, inoculated plants demonstrated reduced damage by reactive oxygen species (ROS) indicating a possible mechanism for symbiosis-mediated drought tolerance. Production of important phytohormones by these endophytes and identification of microbial genes involved in conferring drought tolerance suggests their potential roles in the modulation of the plant host stress response.  aPublisher supplied data  cOffice of Sciencedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100006132  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPopulus 3abiofuels 3aclimate change 3adrought tolerance 3aeconomic sustainability 3aendophytes 3aenvironmental sustainability 3afeedstocks 3agenes 3agrowth promotion 3ahardwood cuttings 3ahost plants 3aleaves 3aplant growth 3aplant hormones 3areactive oxygen species 3astress response 3astress tolerance 3asymbiosis 3atrees 3awater stress 0aHybrid poplar 0aBiomass 0aReactive oxygen species (ROS) 0aPhotosynthesis 0aStomatal conductance 0aPhytohormones 0aVolatile organic compounds (VOCs) 0aDrought tolerance genes1 aRho, Hyungmin1 aFirrincieli, Andrea1 aHung, Shang Han1 aLuna, Virginia1 aMasciarelli, Oscar1 aKim, Soo-Hyung1 aDoty, Sharon L.,0 tCurrent plant biology.g2016 Oct., v. 6 p.38-47dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23302x2214-66287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cpb.2016.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aDNAL 7aarticle02516naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245011300172300001400285520094000299592002801239650001101267650001601278650001901294650002101313650000901334650001701343650002501360650000901385650001401394651001201408653003701420653001901457653003201476653001801508653002101526653002001547653001801567653002101585700001901606700002501625700001801650700002001668700002301688700001801711700005601729773012201785856008201907852000901989655001201998IND60616177920221121154119.0190405e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061617792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfca.2018.09.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBogdanović, Tanja,14aThe occurrence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in fish and meat products of Croatia and dietary exposure  ap. 49-60.  aFor the first time, the levels of benzo(a)anthracene (BaA), chrysene (CHR), benzo(b)fluoranthene (BbF) and benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) and their sum (PAH4) were investigated in a total of 180 samples of fish, shellfish and meat products produced in Croatia. In addition, dietary polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) intake of adult Croatian consumers was estimated for both acute and chronic ingestion circumstances. None of the food samples exceeded the currently legal PAHs levels according to the European legislation. The mean PAH4 level was 1.47 μg/kg for meat and 1.48 μg/kg for shellfish products. The acute daily ingestion of BaP and PAH4 through meat and shellfish products was 2‒ to 7‒ fold higher in comparison to chronic intake, with meat products being the major contributors.

GPS-enabled handheld devices with GIS software were preloaded with a basemap and shapefiles containing insect abundance and plant injury data entry lines. Pest monitoring data were entered and stored on the handheld device while conducting otherwise normal pest monitoring activities. The shapefiles were then transferred to a standard desktop computer, where pest monitoring maps were produced using GIS mapping software. Dots using a 5-color scheme were projected and mapped corresponding to the sampling sites. The color scheme represented five different insect density categories relative to the economic threshold of the insect being monitored: green shades were chosen for two categories below the economic threshold, yellow was chosen for a category that included the economic threshold, and orange and red were chosen for two categories exceeding the economic threshold. The insects monitored were cotton fleahopper, Pseudatomoscelis seriatus (Reuter), and verde plant bug, Creontiades signatus Distant, (Hemiptera: Miridae), on cotton, Gossypium hirsutum L., and sugarcane aphid, Melanaphis sacchari (Zehntner) (Hemiptera: Aphididae), on sorghum, Sorghum bicolor (L.). Pest monitoring maps were created and delivered to land managers within a half-day of data collection. The pest monitoring maps were used by cooperating land managers to better target and prioritize insecticide use to whole fields. Spatial variation in pest density along the field edges was observed. Considering future uses of the spatially variable data portrayed on the maps, a scenario of using insecticides in within-field precision zones matched to sampling sites resulted in a projected reduction of insecticide use (between 40 and 70% depending on the pest) compared with a scenario where insecticides were sprayed to whole fields based on field averages of pest density derived from the same data.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCreontiades 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aMelanaphis sacchari 3aPseudatomoscelis seriatus 3aSorghum bicolor 3acolor 3acomputer software 3acomputers 3acotton 3aeconomic threshold 3aedge effects 3ageographic information systems 3ainsect pests 3ainsecticides 3amanagers 3apest monitoring 3aplant damage 3aportable equipment 3aTexas 0aEconomic threshold 0aGIS 0aPrecision agriculture 0aGeospatial data 0aMiridae 0aAphididae1 aBrewer, Michael J.1 aEsquivel, Isaac L.1 aHalcomb, Jonda0 tCrop protection.g2017 Nov., v. 101 p.50-57dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2017.07.0163Available from publisher's site  aAccepted Manuscript  aDNAL 7aarticle02117naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245007200168300001800240520082500258592002801083650002101111650001101132650002401143650002801167650002201195650001501217650001901232650001501251650001401266650001701280650002301297651001001320653002701330653002401357653001901381700001901400700001201419700001301431700001601444773011601460856008601576852000901662655001201671IND60613559620221116150610.0200210e20180910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061355962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.07.0652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Weizeng10aEnvironmental ideology and household energy conservation in Beijing  ap. 1600-1608.  aDuring a period of extraordinary urban growth, China's per-capita carbon footprint could soar.

We study whether Chinese urbanites who label themselves as environmentalists consume fewer resources than the average urbanite. Based on a sample of Beijing's micro data drawn from the household survey on energy consumption in China, we document the association between a household's environmental ideology and its energy conservation behavior.

The activities of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferase as well as the concentrations of ascorbate (AsA), hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), superoxide (O₂•⁻), and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured in soybean plants from two cultivars differing in resistance to the pathogen. The number of lesions per square centimeter was significantly reduced by 14% in plants from cultivar Fundacep 59 compared with plants from cultivar TMG 132. The area under the disease progress curve was significantly lower, by 15%, in plants from Fundacep 59 than in plants from TMG 132. Generally, antioxidant enzyme activities and AsA concentration significantly increased in response to C. cassiicola infection in plants from both cultivars, however more prominent increases were recorded for plants from Fundacep 59. The concentrations of MDA, H₂O₂, and O₂•⁻ also increased, particularly for plants from TMG 132. The results from this study highlight the importance of a more efficient antioxidative system in the removal of reactive oxygen species generated in soybean plants during C. cassiicola infection, contributing to the resistance to target spot.  aPublisher supplied data 3acultivars 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3acatalase 3aascorbate peroxidase 3afungal diseases of plants 3aglutathione transferase 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amalondialdehyde 3asoybeans 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aCorynespora cassiicola 3acrop yield 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3asuperoxide anion 3aenzyme activity 3aperoxidase 3aleaves 3aBrazil 0aantioxidants1 aDebona, Daniel1 aBernardeli, Arthur Martins Almeida1 aRodrigues, Fabrício Ávila0 tPhytopathology.g2015 Aug., v. 105, no. 8 p.1050-1058dPhytopathologyx0031-949X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094%2FPHYTO-10-14-0283-R3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02554naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100005400189245007500243300001800318506007600336520102100412592002801433596005401461596006301515506003701578650001001615650001801625650001301643650001901656650000801675650001901683650001201702650003401714650001601748650001201764700002001776700001501796700001801811700001901829700001401848773013101862856008201993852000902075655001202084IND60689371420221207092722.0200421e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068937142DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-019-04228-02doi7 aPMC71710122pmcid7 a323278032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Zhili1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0506-592510aEffects of freezing treatments on the quality of frozen cooked noodles  ap. 1926-1935.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFreezing process is one of the key steps in making frozen cooked noodles. Ice crystal formed in freezing process affects the quality of frozen cooked noodles. In this paper, we studied the effect of freezing treatment on frozen cooked noodles. Frozen cooked noodles were evaluated for microstructure and texture properties explored with a scanning electron microscope and texture analyzer at − 20 °C, − 30 °C and − 40 °C respectively. The results indicated that the microstructure and texture properties of frozen cooked noodles were significantly (P < 0.05) improved by a lower freezing temperature than a higher temperature. This present study also showed that the freezing rate is not the only parameter responsible for microstructure and texture properties that occur during freezing; the difference of flours also can be a factor. These findings, if generally applicable to frozen cooked noodle products, could have important economic implications for the convenience of the food industry.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018YFD0400605cNational Key R&D Program of China  a18102110064cHenan Science and Technology Research Project0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aflour 3afood industry 3afreezing 3afreezing point 3aice 3amicrostructure 3anoodles 3ascanning electron microscopes 3atemperature 3atexture1 aHuang, Zhongmin1 aMa, Jingyi1 aLei, Mengmeng1 aTian, Pingping1 aAi, Zhilu0 tJournal of food science and technology.g2020 May, v. 57, no. 5 p.1926-1935dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl16929x0022-11557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-019-04228-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01554naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003000140245011600170300002000286520053300306592002800839650001400867650001500881650001600896650001400912700002300926700002500949700003000974700002801004773012501032856007401157852000901231655001201240IND60750044220221120035054.0210910e20210823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075004422DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ra05568b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVinogradova, Ekaterina E.10aDimroth-type N/S-interchange of N-aminothioglycolurils in the synthesis of 2-hydrazonoimidazo[4,5-d]thiazolones  ap. 28395-28400.  aAn original method for the synthesis of 2-hydrazonoimidazo[4,5-d]thiazolone derivatives has been developed based on a one-pot acid-induced sequence of hydrazone formation from 3-thioxoperhydroimidazo[4,5-e]-1,2,4-triazinones and aromatic aldehydes, triazine ring contraction to imidazolidine one, and Dimroth-type N/S-interchange of N-aminothioglycolurils formed in situ into 2-hydrazonoimidazo[4,5-d]thiazolones. 3-Phenylacroleine derivatives are also suitable substrates for the reaction with thioxoperhydroimidazotriazinones.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaldehydes 3ahydrazones 3amethodology 3atriazines1 aGazieva, Galina A.1 aIzmest'ev, Alexei N.1 aKarnoukhova, Valentina A.1 aKravchenko, Angelina N.0 tRSC advances.g2021 Aug. 23, v. 11, no. 45 p.28395-28400dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ra05568b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02674naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005400147245013600201300001200337520125900349592002801608650001301636650001301649650001401662650001501676650002101691650000901712650001401721650001101735650002101746650001901767650000901786650001101795650002001806650002301826650001801849650001001867651001001877700001701887700001501904700001601919700001501935700001701950773013401967856008202101852000902183655001202192IND60593256320221119110201.0180619e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059325632DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-018-7500-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaufler, S.1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1426-780110aRiverbank filtration in Cairo, Egypt: part II—detailed investigation of a new riverbank filtration site with a focus on manganese  ap. 318.  aA 5-day detailed field investigation at a new RBF test well gallery in Embaba, Cairo, was conducted to evaluate the hydraulic setting and the behavior of iron and manganese. The well gallery consists of six vertical wells placed along a straight line parallel to the Nile riverbank. A low anisotropy factor for the aquifer (kf,ₕ:kf,ᵥ) of 1.7 was determined by evaluation of a multi-step pumping test. Travel times between 11 days from the river toward the central wells and 22 days toward the outermost wells were estimated by groundwater flow modeling and particle tracking. The riverbed is rich in fine suspended sediments that have elevated iron and nitrogen concentrations. Depth-dependent water sampling during regular well operation indicates that the thick organic-, Fe- and Mn-rich riverbed is the primary source for ammonium, iron and manganese in the bank filtrate. Iron-rich groundwater flow from the opposite riverbank was identified as a secondary source of iron in the pumped water. The vertical position of the filter screen affects total travel times but would not reduce the portion of Mn-rich bank filtrate. The authors recommend continuous well operation for achieving stable water quality and lowering the risk of well clogging.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3aaquifers 3afiltrates 3afiltration 3agroundwater flow 3airon 3amanganese 3amodels 3anitrogen content 3ariparian areas 3arisk 3arivers 3astream channels 3asuspended sediment 3awater quality 3awells 3aEgypt1 aGrischek, T.1 aBartak, R.1 aGhodeif, K.1 aWahaab, R.1 aBoernick, H.0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2018 Apr., v. 77, no. 8 p.318-318dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001228x1866-62807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-018-7500-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03023naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001700189245010700206300001800313506007600331520140200407592002801809506003701837650003401874650002001908650001201928650002501940650001801965650001001983650001401993650001602007650001002023650002402033650001502057650001902072650002002091650001202111650000702123650001202130650002002142650002302162650002102185700006002206700001702266773013102283856008202414852000902496655001202505IND60689371520221207081824.0200421e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068937152DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-019-04229-z2doi7 aPMC71710062pmcid7 a323278042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, Alok10aFormulation, standardization and characterization of novel sattu beverage enriched with beetroot juice  ap. 1936-1943.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe existing market of beverages is in utmost need of non-conventional and cheaper option of a functional protein beverage. The primary goal of this research was to formulate a beverage using prepared from roasted Bengal gram (sattu) which can provide health benefits. Fortified sattu beverage was prepared by incorporating pectin, citric acid, ascorbic acid and sugar as additives with beetroot juice was added for the enrichment and coloration of beverage in four different proportions viz. 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% labelled as A, B, C and D. Beverage without enrichment was taken as blank sample. After formulation, physio-chemical parameters of beverage were measured which included pH, TSS, protein content, sedimentation index and color. For antioxidant potential, DPPH and ABTS methods were performed followed by measurement of TPC, TFC and Betalain content. Sensory analysis of beverage was also performed to determine the consumer acceptability. Sample containing 10% beetroot juice was observed to have the optimal formulation amongst all with regards to sedimentation index (24.86), protein content (28.10%), pH (3.83), TSS (7.43°Brix), acidity (0.522%), DPPH activity (83.22%), ABTS scavenging assay (70.38%), phenolic content (42.49 mg GAE/g), flavonoid content (50.51 mg RE/g).

Ribosomal 16S gene sequence analysis and PCR-RFLP showed a restricted microbiota mainly composed of Acetobacter pasteurianus, Acetobacter tropicalis and Acetobacter okinawensis sp., consistently found in all six regions studied. Meanwhile Acetobacter malorum, Acetobacter ghanensis and Gluconobacter oxydans were isolated as minor species in specific regions. The dominant species were mainly isolated in the first 72 h period of natural cocoa fermentation while the minor species were present toward the later stages. Acetobacter okinawensis, a newly isolated species, was able to yield an unusually high quantity, up to 62 g/L of acetic acid at 30 °C. However, a shift of temperature to 35 °C severely impaired acid production in most strains of this species. While acetic acid production increases for up to 6 days in Acetobacter okinawensis and Acetobacter pasteurianus, it decreases beyond 4 days in Acetobacter tropicalis strains. The production of acetic acid was strongly dependent on environmental conditions, with optimal production between pH 4 and 5, under ethanol concentration below 8% and temperatures above 35–40 °C, corresponding to conditions prevailing in the first half of fermentation process. Acetobacter tropicalis was more productive at higher ethanol concentration and Acetobacter okinawensis at low pH. Species diversity and different behavior of strains highlight the importance of valuable starter selection for well-controlled cocoa fermentation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAcetobacter pasteurianus 3aAcetobacter tropicalis 3aGluconobacter oxydans 3aacetic acid 3aacetic acid bacteria 3adominant species 3aenvironmental factors 3aethanol 3afermentation 3anucleotide sequences 3apH 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3asequence analysis 3aspecies diversity 3atemperature 3aCote d'Ivoire1 aOuattara, Honoré G.1 aDroux, Michel1 aNasser, William1 aNiamke, Sébastien L.1 aReverchon, Sylvie0 tJournal of food science and technology.g2020 May, v. 57, no. 5 p.1904-1916dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl16929x0022-11557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-019-04226-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03622naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245013200158500002000290520164000310592002801950596011701978596005402095596006702149596005902216650002202275650002302297650001802320650003102338650002402369650002002393650001202413650001002425650001202435650001702447650001802464650001602482650002102498650001102519650001602530650001302546650001402559650001002573650001902583650003202602650002502634650001602659650001402675700001502689700001502704700001602719700001802735700005702753773012702810856007402937852000903011655001203020IND60625643920221119195335.0181210e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062564392DNAL7 a10.1111/jfbc.126562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Danfei10aAttenuation of intestinal inflammation of polysaccharides from the seeds of Plantago asiatica L. as affected by ultrasonication  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aUltrasound treatment was applied to modify the physicochemical properties of polysaccharides from the seeds of Plantago asiatica L. The initial polysaccharides concentration of 10 mg/mL, ultrasonic power of 800 W, and different treatment time (15 s, 30 s, 1 min, 2 min) were used. After irradiation, the average molecular weight (Mw) and polydispersity index of relative molecular mass (PID) of polysaccharides decreased. The apparent viscosity of degraded polysaccharides dropped compared with native polysaccharides. By using dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) colitis mouse model, enhanced intestinal anti‐inflammatory activity of degraded polysaccharides was proved by a significant reduction in the degree of neutrophil infiltration, indicated by decreased macrophage inflammatory protein‐2 secretion, and levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF‐α and IL‐4) in inflamed colon. These results suggested that ultrasound treatment is a viable modification technology for high Mw polymer materials with high anti‐inflammatory activity. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic and nonspecific inflammatory disorder of the colonic mucosa, and assumed to be an autoimmune disease. PLCP was found to be one of the active ingredients responsible for many of the observed bioactivities including anti‐inflammation, anticomplement and facilitating defecation. However, it's extremely complex structure with high molecular weights and high viscosity hampered its applications. In this study, ultrasound irradiation was used to depolymerize PLCP, and its attenuation of intestinal inflammation was also studied.  aPublisher supplied data  aSKLF-QN-201508cYouth Research Fund of State Key Laboratory of Food Science of Technology of Nanchang University  a2017YFF0207800cNational Key R&D Program of China  a20161BAB204171cNatural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province  a31260364cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aPlantago asiatica 3aactive ingredients 3aanimal models 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aautoimmune diseases 3achemokine CXCL2 3acolitis 3acolon 3adextran 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-4 3airradiation 3amolecular weight 3amucosa 3aneutrophils 3apolymers 3asecretion 3aseeds 3asodium sulfate 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3aultrasonic treatment 3aultrasonics 3aviscosity1 aXia, Qiang1 aLi, Fenfen1 aYang, Weiyu1 aNie, Shaoping1 aXie, Mingyong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4454-30690 tJournal of food biochemistry.g2018 Dec., v. 42, no. 6 p.e12656-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl8484x0145-88847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfbc.126563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03143naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245012400169300001800293520180700311592002802118650003602146650001402182650002202196650001002218650002002228650002602248650001802274650003002292650001402322650001402336650001602350650001402366650001702380651002402397651003102421700001902452700001802471700002002489773010902509856008202618852000902700655001202709IND60549509720221121234119.0160908e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054950972DNAL7 a10.1094/PHYTO-11-14-0305-R2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMilus, Eugene A.10aRace-Specific Adult-Plant Resistance in Winter Wheat to Stripe Rust and Characterization of Pathogen Virulence Patterns  ap. 1114-1122.  aStripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, is an important disease of wheat in the Great Plains and southeastern United States. Growing resistant cultivars is the preferred means for managing stripe rust, but new virulence in the pathogen population overcomes some of the resistance. The objectives of this study were to characterize the stripe rust resistance in contemporary soft and hard red winter wheat cultivars, to characterize the virulence of P. striiformis f. sp. tritici isolates based on the resistances found in the cultivars, and to determine wheat breeders’ perceptions on the importance and methods for achieving stripe rust resistance. Seedlings of cultivars were susceptible to recent isolates, indicating they lacked effective all-stage resistance. However, adult-plants were resistant or susceptible depending on the isolate, indicating they had race-specific adult-plant resistance. Using isolates collected from 1990 to 2013, six major virulence patterns were identified on adult plants of twelve cultivars that were selected as adult-plant differentials. Race-specific adult-plant resistance appears to be the only effective type of resistance protecting wheat from stripe rust in eastern United States. Among wheat breeders, the importance of incorporating stripe rust resistance into cultivars ranged from high to low depending on the frequency of epidemics in their region, and most sources of stripe rust resistance were either unknown or already overcome by virulence in the pathogen population. Breeders with a high priority for stripe rust resistance made most of their selections based on adult-plant reactions in the field, whereas breeders with a low priority for resistance based selections on molecular markers for major all-stage resistance genes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPuccinia striiformis f. tritici 3acultivars 3adisease outbreaks 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3ahard red winter wheat 3amature plants 3apathogen characterization 3apathogens 3aseedlings 3astripe rust 3avirulence 3awinter wheat 3aGreat Plains region 3aSoutheastern United States1 aMoon, David E.1 aLee, Kevin D.1 aMason, R.

A large number of photocatalysts have been reported, but they still suffer from low activity that originates from fundamental efficiency bottlenecks: i.e., weak photon absorption and poor electron–hole pair separation when operating under irradiation, and poor electron storage capacity when operating in darkness. Herein, we report the first synthesis of hollow double-shell H:Pt–WO₃/TiO₂–Au nanospheres with high specific surface area, large TiO₂/WO₃ interfacial contact and strong visible light absorption. Because of these features, this type of nanocomposite shows high charge separation and electron storage capacity, and exhibits efficient degradation of organic pollutants both under visible light (λ ≥ 420 nm) and in darkness. In addition, CO₂ generation from formaldehyde gave a high quantum efficiency of 77.6%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3aformaldehyde 3airradiation 3alight 3ananocomposites 3ananospheres 3aphotocatalysts 3aphotons 3apollutants 3asurface area1 aVu, Nhu-Nang1 aDo, Trong-On0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2016 Mar. 15, v. 4, no. 12 p.4413-4419dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ta09016d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02412naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245012500172300001600297520099600313592002801309650001601337650001901353650002101372650001001393650001601403650000701419650003701426650002501463650001901488653001901507653002501526653002701551653002301578700001801601700001801619700001801637700001801655700002701673700005901700773011101759856008701870852000901957655001201966IND60576131420221117082025.0190318e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057613142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2017.07.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Hon Weng10aFormation and characterization of thiol-modified fibrillated whey protein isolate solution with enhanced functionalities  ap. 277-286.  aThe effect of thiolation using propanethiol on the functionalities of fibrillated whey protein isolate (WPI) solution at different pH values was studied. Fibrillated WPI solutions were thiolated at different molar ratios of propanethiol:carboxyl group (0.5:1, 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1) and the highest esterification extent ratio was obtained at 4:1 (pH 9). We also found that the thiolation process improved the foaming capacity and foam stability. TEM micrographs evidenced aggregation of thiol-modified fibrillated WPI. A network of shortened fibrils attached to each other was formed upon thiolation, suggesting good physical interaction. This was coherent with the increment of zeta potential values, indicating a greater repulsion force to retard fibrils aggregation. Thiolation enhanced emulsifying stability index of thiol-modified fibrillated WPI solution (pH 8) and diminished its susceptibility to pH changes. This has broadened the potential application of fibrils as food ingredients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aemulsifying 3aesterification 3afoaming capacity 3afoams 3aingredients 3apH 3atransmission electron microscopy 3awhey protein isolate 3azeta potential 0aEsterification 0aWhey protein isolate 0aEmulsifying properties 0aFoaming properties1 aTan, Tai Boon1 aTan, Phui Yee1 aAbas, Faridah1 aLai, Oi-Ming,1 aNehdi, Imededdine Arbi1 aTan, Chin-Ping,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4177-40720 tJournal of food engineering.g2017 Dec., v. 214 p.277-286dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2017.07.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02484naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005400139245009700193300001600290500002000306520146600326592002801792650001401820650001701834650001201851650001601863650001101879650001601890650001301906651002001919773013701939856007302076852000902149655001202158IND60676891520221117065642.0191122e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067689152DNAL7 a10.1111/avj.128822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnight, PK1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1076-537910aResults of racetrack examinations of Standardbred horses at race meetings in New South Wales  ap. 509-514.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis study analysed the race day veterinary reports from harness racing meetings controlled by the New South Wales Greyhound and Harness Racing Regulatory Authority between 1 September 2008 and 30 June 2009. The findings of all prerace and postrace examinations were analysed, and the frequency of observations was recorded. Chi‐square testing was used to determine whether the incidence of abnormalities differed between age groups and tracks. A total of 542 meetings were conducted during the period of the study, with veterinary examinations conducted at 395 of these meetings. A total of 520 veterinary examinations (60 prerace and 460 postrace) were conducted. During the period of the study, 3685 horses started 31,393 times. Injuries occurring during the warm‐up or start were the most common finding on prerace examination (11 reports) followed by lameness (6 reports). Lameness was the most common problem identified during postrace examinations, occurring at a rate of 2.10 cases per 1000 starts. Other problems identified at a rate of more than 1 per 1000 starts were poor postrace recovery/heat stress (2.04) and lacerations (1.75). Falls occurred at a rate of 1.72 cases per 1000 starts. Two‐year‐old horses were less likely to be lame than 3, 5 and 6‐year‐old horses. There was no difference in the rate of falls or lameness between tracks. This study provides a benchmark against which ongoing improvements in welfare can be assessed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGreyhound 3aStandardbred 3aharness 3aheat stress 3ahorses 3alacerations 3alameness 3aNew South Wales0 tAustralian veterinary journal.g2019 Dec., v. 97, no. 12 p.509-514dWiley Publishing Asia Pty LtdwJournal:jnl45498x0005-04237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/avj.128823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02248naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245009500156300002000251520122000271592002801491650002101519650000901540650001901549650001301568650001101581650001301592650002301605650001301628700001901641700003001660700002301690773010101713856007501814852000901889655001201898IND60576657820221120102801.0170806e20121009xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057665782DNAL7 a10.1021/la303292z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYigit, Cemil10aProtein Sorption to Charged Microgels: Characterizing Binding Isotherms and Driving Forces  ap. 14373-14385.  aWe present a set of Langmuir binding models in which electrostatic cooperativity effects to protein sorption is incorporated in the spirit of Guoy–Chapman–Stern models, where the global substrate (microgel) charge state is modified by bound reactants (charged proteins). Application of this approach to lysozyme sorption to oppositely charged core–shell microgels allows us to extract the intrinsic, binding affinity of the protein to the gel, which is salt concentration independent and mostly hydrophobic in nature. The total binding affinity is found to be mainly electrostatic in nature, changes many orders of magnitude during the sorption process, and is significantly influenced by osmotic deswelling effects. The intrinsic binding affinity is determined to be about 7 kBT for our system. We additionally show that Langmuir binding models and those based on excluded-volume interactions are formally equivalent for low to moderate protein packing, if the nature of the bound state is consistently defined. Having appreciated this, a more quantitative interpretation of binding isotherms in terms of separate physical interactions is possible in the future for a wide variety of experimental approaches.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding capacity 3agels 3ahydrophobicity 3alysozyme 3amodels 3aproteins 3asalt concentration 3asorption1 aWelsch, Nicole1 aBallauff, M.q(Matthias),1 aDzubiella, Joachim0 tLangmuir.g2012 Oct. 09, v. 28, no. 40 p.14373-14385dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla303292z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02239naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245012800154300002000282520106100302592002801363650001301391650002101404650001401425650002401439650001601463650001901479650001401498650001401512650001701526650002101543700001901564700001601583700001901599700001601618773013501634856007501769852000901844655001201853IND60538667420221119030000.0160815e20120926xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053866742DNAL7 a10.1021/ja307449z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Meidan10aHigh-Efficiency Photoelectrocatalytic Hydrogen Generation Enabled by Palladium Quantum Dots-Sensitized TiO2 Nanotube Arrays  ap. 15720-15723.  aTiO₂ nanotube arrays (TNTAs) sensitized by palladium quantum dots (Pd QDs) exhibit highly efficient photoelectrocatalytic hydrogen generation.

Subsequently, Pd QDs with uniform size and narrow size distribution were formed on TiO₂ nanotubes by a modified hydrothermal reaction (i.e., yielding nanocomposites of Pd QDs deposited on TNTAs, Pd@TNTAs). By exploiting Pd@TNTA nanocomposites as both photoanode and cathode, a substantially increased photon-to-current conversion efficiency of nearly 100% at λ = 330 nm and a greatly promoted photocatalytic hydrogen production rate of 592 μmol·h–¹·cm–² under 320 mW·cm–² irradiation were achieved. The synergy between nanotubular structures of TiO₂ and uniformly dispersed Pd QDs on TiO₂ facilitated the charge transfer of photoinduced electrons from TiO₂ nanotubes to Pd QDs and the high activity of Pd QDs catalytic center, thereby leading to high-efficiency photoelectrocatalytic hydrogen generation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acathodes 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrons 3ahydrogen production 3airradiation 3ananocomposites 3ananotubes 3apalladium 3aquantum dots 3atitanium dioxide1 aGong, Jiaojiao1 aLai, Yuekun1 aLin, Changjian1 aLin, Zhiqun0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2012 Sept. 26, v. 134, no. 38 p.15720-15723dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja307449z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02715naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006000145245009000205300001600295500001900311500002000330520149300350592002801843650002001871650001001891650001001901650001301911650001701924650001501941700002301956700002201979700002102001700002302022700001902045700001502064700002102079773012902100856007902229852000902308655001202317IND60724061820221120144413.0210120e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072406182DNAL7 a10.1111/1462-2920.153142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBahram, Mohammad1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9539-330710aMetagenomic assessment of the global diversity and distribution of bacteria and fungi  ap. 316-326.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBacteria and fungi are of uttermost importance in determining environmental and host functioning. Despite close interactions between animals, plants, their associated microbiomes, and the environment they inhabit, the distribution and role of bacteria and especially fungi across host and environments as well as the cross‐habitat determinants of their community compositions remain little investigated. Using a uniquely broad global dataset of 13 483 metagenomes, we analysed the microbiome structure and function of 25 host‐associated and environmental habitats, focusing on potential interactions between bacteria and fungi. We found that the metagenomic relative abundance ratio of bacteria‐to‐fungi is a distinctive microbial feature of habitats. Compared with fungi, the cross‐habitat distribution pattern of bacteria was more strongly driven by habitat type. Fungal diversity was depleted in host‐associated communities compared with those in the environment, particularly terrestrial habitats, whereas this diversity pattern was less pronounced for bacteria. The relative gene functional potential of bacteria or fungi reflected their diversity patterns and appeared to depend on a balance between substrate availability and biotic interactions. Alongside helping to identify hotspots and sources of microbial diversity, our study provides support for differences in assembly patterns and processes between bacterial and fungal communities across different habitats.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3afungi 3agenes 3ahabitats 3ametagenomics 3amicrobiome1 aNetherway, Tarquin1 aFrioux, Clémence1 aFerretti, Pamela1 aCoelho, Luis Pedro1 aGeisen, Stefan1 aBork, Peer1 aHildebrand, Falk0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2021 Jan., v. 23, no. 1 p.316-326dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl3867075x1462-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.153143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02911naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245009800171300001800269520159600287592002801883650002001911650001701931650002101948650000901969650001201978650001001990650003002000650001002030650002102040650003102061650001402092650001102106650001602117651001102133653001502144653001702159653002702176700002002203700002702223700001802250773009202268856008402360852000902444655001202453IND60549509920221121234226.0160908e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054950992DNAL7 a10.1094/PHYTO-01-15-0020-R2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRedondo, Miguel A.10aWinter Conditions Correlate with Phytophthora alni Subspecies Distribution in Southern Sweden  ap. 1191-1197.  aDuring the last century, the number of forest pathogen invasions has increased substantially. Environmental variables can play a crucial role in determining the establishment of invasive species. The objective of the present work was to determine the correlation between winter climatic conditions and distribution of two subspecies of the invasive forest pathogen Phytophthora alni: P. alni subspp. alni and uniformis killing black alder (Alnus glutinosa) in southern Sweden. It is known from laboratory experiments that P. alni subsp. alni is more pathogenic than P. alni subsp. uniformis, and that P. alni subsp. alni is sensitive to low temperatures and long frost periods. By studying the distribution of these two subspecies at the northern limit of the host species, we could investigate whether winter conditions can affect the geographical distribution of P. alni subsp. alni spreading northward. Sixteen major river systems of southern Sweden were systematically surveyed and isolations were performed from active cankers. The distribution of the two studied subspecies was highly correlated with winter temperature and duration of periods with heavy frost. While P. alni subsp. uniformis covered the whole range of temperatures of the host, P. alni subsp. alni was recovered in areas subjected to milder winter temperatures and shorter frost periods. Our observations suggest that winter conditions can play an important role in limiting P. alni subsp. alni establishment in cold locations, thus affecting the distribution of the different subspecies of P. alni in boreal regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlnus glutinosa 3aPhytophthora 3aclimatic factors 3acold 3aforests 3afrost 3ageographical distribution 3ahosts 3ainvasive species 3alaboratory experimentation 3apathogens 3arivers 3atemperature 3aSweden 0aAlnus spp. 0ainvasiveness 0aPhytophthora plurivora1 aBoberg, Johanna1 aOlsson, Christer H.

Nanofibers based on natural excipients, such as cyclodextrin (CD)-based nanofibers, can carry larger amounts of antibiotics while achieving better stability via inclusion complexation.Nanofibers were produced by electrospinning and analyzed by electron microscopy to investigate the morphology of fibers. The formation of inclusion-complexation was analyzed by ¹H NMR, FTIR, and XRD. Thermal analysis of the fibers was done using TGA. Ab initio modeling studies were done to calculate the complexation energies of antibiotics with CD. A disk-diffusion assay was used to test the antibacterial activity of the fibers.Bead-free antibacterial nanofibers with mean diameters between 340 and 550 nm were produced. The formation of inclusion complexes (IC) between the CD and the antibiotics was confirmed by FTIR and ¹H NMR, which was further verified by the disappearance of the crystalline peaks of antibiotics as determined by XRD analysis. Thermal analysis of the nanofibers revealed that the formulations showed good antibiotic encapsulation (45–90%). Ab initio simulations revealed that gentamicin had the highest complexation energy, followed by kanamycin, chloramphenicol, and ampicillin. The antibacterial nanofibers rapidly dissolved in water and artificial saliva, successfully releasing the CD antibiotic complexes. The nanofibers showed high antibacterial activity against Gram-negative Escherichia coli.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aampicillin 3aantibacterial properties 3achloramphenicol 3acyclodextrins 3aelectron microscopy 3aencapsulation 3aenergy 3agentamicin 3akanamycin 3ananofibers 3asaliva 3atoxicity 0aElectrospinning 0aCyclodextrin 0aInclusion complex (IC) 0aAntibacterial nanofibers 0aAntibiotics 0aOral drug delivery1 aKilic, Mehmet E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1814-51041 aDurgun, Engin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0639-58621 aSzékely, Gy.q(György),1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9658-24520 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2021 Mar., v. 585 p.184-194dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2020.11.0723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02872naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245007200167300001800239500001500257520143600272592002801708650002201736650001501758650001201773650001201785650001901797650001101816650001101827650001301838650001401851650001001865650001401875650001401889650002501903650001601928650000901944650000901953650000901962650001401971650001801985650001802003650002502021653001002046700001802056700001802074700002602092700002102118773010102139856008102240852000902321655001202330IND60120812420221121134049.0151229e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012081242DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-013-7864-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkram, Muhammad10aExtracting hydroxyapatite and its precursors from natural resources  ap. 1461-1475.  a2019-12-04  aHealing of segmental bone defects remain a difficult problem in orthopedic and trauma surgery. One reason for this difficulty is the limited availability of bone material to fill the defect and promote bone growth. Hydroxyapatite (HA) is a synthetic biomaterial, which is chemically similar to the mineral component of bones and hard tissues in mammals and, therefore, it can be used as a filler to replace damaged bone or as a coating on implants to promote bone in-growth into prosthetic implants when used in orthopedic, dental, and maxillofacial applications. HA is a stoichiometric material with a chemical composition of Ca₁₀(PO₄)₆(OH)₂, while a mineral component of bone is a non-stoichiometric HA with trace amounts of ions such as Na⁺, Zn²⁺, Mg²⁺, K⁺, Si²⁺, Ba²⁺, F⁻, CO₃ ²⁻, etc. This review looks at the progress being made to extract HA and its precursors containing trace amount of beneficial ions from biological resources like animal bones, eggshells, wood, algae, etc. Properties, such as particle size, morphology, stoichiometry, thermal stability, and the presence of trace ions are studied with respect to the starting material and recovery method used. This review also highlights the importance of extracting HA from natural resources and gives future directions to the researcher so that HA extracted from biological resources can be used clinically as a valuable biomaterial.  aPublisher supplied data 3athermal stability 3aprostheses 3asurgery 3amammals 3ahydroxyapatite 3asodium 3abarium 3acoatings 3afluorides 3abones 3apotassium 3aegg shell 3achemical composition 3aorthopedics 3aions 3azinc 3awood 3amagnesium 3aparticle size 3astoichiometry 3abiological resources 0aAlgae1 aAhmed, Rashid1 aShakir, Imran1 aIbrahim, Wan Aini Wan1 aHussain, Rafaqat0 tJournal of materials science.g2014 Feb., v. 49, no. 4 p.1461-1475dSpringer USx0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-013-7864-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02529naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001900189245010700208300001800315506007600333520099800409592002801407596002901435506003701464650001501501650001501516650001101531650001001542650002201552650001401574650001601588650002001604650001301624650002301637650001101660650001301671650001001684650001601694700003001710700002401740700006101764773013101825856008201956852000902038655001202047IND60689371920221207094210.0200421e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068937192DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-019-04231-52doi7 aPMC71710362pmcid7 a323278062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValerga, Lucia10aArtichoke, eggplant and tomato flours as nutritional ingredients for wheat dough: hydration properties  ap. 1954-1963.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aArtichoke (AF), eggplant (EF) and tomato (TF) flour were used as nutritional ingredients for wheat dough.

Methods: Until March 2007, free ranging eastern grey kangaroos and red kangaroos were herded into purpose‐built 15 m diameter capture yards (CYs) for darting with a projectile syringe. From March 2007 onwards, animals were free‐range darted in large areas without herding. Kangaroos were darted with 1.33–5.10 mg/kg tiletamine/zolazepam and 0.01–0.02 mg/kg medetomidine, ± 0.03 mg/kg acepromazine. Deaths were monitored. Population counts were performed annually. Results: There were 5825 capture events involving 3963 kangaroos. Over 85% of all captures occurred from 2005 to 2008. Of all reported deaths (n = 523), 135 were attributed to ill health. Musculoskeletal injuries incurred during capture were the main project‐related cause of death (n = 116). Post capture myopathy was uncommonly diagnosed following capture (n = 19). Conclusion: The herding and capture method enabled a large number of kangaroos to be mobilised and captured with low mortality rates, and the use of CYs resulted in fewer capture‐related injuries and deaths than free‐range capture. The drug doses and combinations used for darting were safe and effective, and the capture technique was successfully applied to a population management project.  aPublisher supplied data  cLendlease  cNSW National Parks and Wildlife Service  cEurofins 3aMacropus giganteus 3aacepromazine 3aanimals 3adeath 3aherding 3amedetomidine 3amortality 3amuscular diseases 3amusculoskeletal system 3asyringes 3atiletamine1 aPerkins, NR1 aGreen, LA0 tAustralian veterinary journal.g2019 Dec., v. 97, no. 12 p.515-523dWiley Publishing Asia Pty LtdwJournal:jnl45498x0005-04237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/avj.128863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03100naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245007600172300001800248520164500266592002801911650002701939650002501966650001101991650001702002650002202019650001402041650002202055650001802077650001102095650001302106650002402119650001902143650002602162651001102188653002702199653002302226653001502249653002202264653001902286653003002305653001502335700002402350700002102374773011602395856008602511852000902597655001202606IND60613560120221116150542.0200210e20180910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061356012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.12.2822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFemenías, Paula10aRethinking deep renovation: The perspective of rental housing in Sweden  ap. 1457-1467.  aThis study examines renovation strategies among owners of rental housing in Sweden in response to European energy policies that promote deep renovation as a means to reduce carbon emissions from residential buildings. Case studies of ten housing companies, seven public and three private, were designed with the aim to examine housing owners’ attitudes and renovation strategies, and how policies and objectives for energy efficiency become incorporated into these attitudes and strategies. Results are illustrated in typologies that distinguish between renovation strategies with either a more commercial or a more societal focus and spanning between deep and partial renovation. The typologies can be used to discuss how different aspects influence renovation, and illustrates how strategies change over time. The study identifies a trend in which housing owners are increasingly relying on partial or over-time renovation. Cost is one important driver, but social responsibility toward tenants and in some cases the protection of cultural heritage are also found to be important. A distrust of fixed models for renovation was observed. The paper questions the concept of deep renovation and suggests instead partial and over-time renovation as a way forward toward sustainable renovation. Partial renovation can bring together energy efficiency with environmental, financial, social, and cultural objectives of housing management. If managed properly, over-time renovation can reduce the risk of an investment, and has the advantage of allowing future technological advancements in energy efficiency to be included in current planning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3abusiness enterprises 3acarbon 3acase studies 3acultural heritage 3aemissions 3aenergy efficiency 3aenergy policy 3amodels 3aplanning 3aresidential housing 3arisk reduction 3asocial responsibility 3aSweden 0aSustainable renovation 0aRenovation process 0aStrategies 0aEnergy efficiency 0aHousing owners 0aMulti-residential housing 0aTypologies1 aMjörnell, Kristina1 aThuvander, Liane0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 Sept. 10, v. 195 p.1457-1467dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.12.2823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02741naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245010100169300001600270520153800286592002801824650001101852650001401863650002001877650001101897650001801908650002101926651001901947651001201966651001901978651002301997700001902020700002402039700001902063700002402082700002102106700002202127700001702149773009602166856004802262852000902310655001202319IND4458892820221122050747.0121003e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445889282DNAL7 a10.1007/s10592-010-0178-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorrison, Cheryl L.10aGenetic discontinuity among regional populations of Lophelia pertusa in the North Atlantic Ocean  ap. 713-729.  aKnowledge of the degree to which populations are connected through larval dispersal is imperative to effective management, yet little is known about larval dispersal ability or population connectivity in Lophelia pertusa, the dominant framework-forming coral on the continental slope in the North Atlantic Ocean. Using nine microsatellite DNA markers, we assessed the spatial scale and pattern of genetic connectivity across a large portion of the range of L. pertusa in the North Atlantic Ocean. A Bayesian modeling approach found four distinct genetic groupings corresponding to ocean regions: Gulf of Mexico, coastal southeastern U.S., New England Seamounts, and eastern North Atlantic Ocean. An isolation-by-distance pattern was supported across the study area. Estimates of pairwise population differentiation were greatest with the deepest populations, the New England Seamounts (average F ST = 0.156). Differentiation was intermediate with the eastern North Atlantic populations (F ST = 0.085), and smallest between southeastern U.S. and Gulf of Mexico populations (F ST = 0.019), with evidence of admixture off the southeastern Florida peninsula. Connectivity across larger geographic distances within regions suggests that some larvae are broadly dispersed. Heterozygote deficiencies were detected within the majority of localities suggesting deviation from random mating. Gene flow between ocean regions appears restricted, thus, the most effective management scheme for L. pertusa involves regional reserve networks.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorals 3agene flow 3agenetic markers 3alarvae 3arandom mating 3areserve networks 3aAtlantic Ocean 3aFlorida 3aGulf of Mexico 3aNew England region1 aRoss, Steve W.1 aNizinski, Martha S.1 aBrooke, Sandra1 aJärnegren, Johanna1 aWaller, Rhian G.1 aJohnson, Robin L.1 aKing, Tim L.0 tConservation genetics.g2011 June, v. 12, no. 3 p.713-729dSpringer-Verlagx1566-06217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10592-010-0178-5  aDNAL 7aarticle02237naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245013100163300001800294520092200312592002801234650004401262650002201306650001701328650001901345650002401364650001801388650001801406650002201424650001601446650003301462650000801495650003701503650001501540700002001555700001401575700001301589700002201602773010101624856008101725852000901806655001201815IND60120812520221121134005.0151229e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012081252DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-013-7865-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrakash, T.10aEffect of Sn doping on microstructural and optical properties of ZnO nanoparticles synthesized by microwave irradiation method  ap. 1776-1784.  aPure and Sn-doped ZnO nanostructures have been synthesized by the microwave irradiation method. The influence of Sn loading on the morphology and microstructure was evaluated by using field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive spectrum analysis techniques, X-ray diffraction, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. A change in the growth pattern, from needle-like particles for pure ZnO to agglomerated spherical crystallites for Sn-doped ZnO, has been observed. TEM observations indicated that the average particle size of the pure ZnO nano needles is in the range of 40–60 nm, whereas on addition of Sn spherical nanoassemblies size lies in the range of 10–21 nm. The pure ZnO and Sn-doped ZnO nanostructures were further characterized for their optical properties by UV–Vis reflectance spectra (DRS) and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3acrystallites 3amicrostructure 3amicrowave radiation 3ananoparticles 3aparticle size 3aphotoluminescence 3areflectance 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atin 3atransmission electron microscopy 3azinc oxide1 aJayaprakash, R.1 aEspro, C.1 aNeri, G.1 aRanjith Kumar, E.0 tJournal of materials science.g2014 Feb., v. 49, no. 4 p.1776-1784dSpringer USx0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-013-7865-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04276naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002500188245007000213300001100283506007600294520224500370592002802615596014702643596007602790596002502866506003702891650001202928650001302940650001902953650001302972650001502985650003003000650000903030650001803039650002203057650001303079650001503092650001503107650001703122650001403139650001403153650003503167650001203202700002403214700001703238700002103255700002103276700002503297700002103322700002103343700002003364700002703384700002703411773012203438856008103560852000903641655001203650IND60593256920221207105053.0191123e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059325692DNAL7 a296611302pmid7 aPMC59028312pmcid7 a10.1186/s12711-018-0390-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDerks, Martijn F. L.12aA survey of functional genomic variation in domesticated chickens  ap. 17.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Deleterious genetic variation can increase in frequency as a result of mutations, genetic drift, and genetic hitchhiking. Although individual effects are often small, the cumulative effect of deleterious genetic variation can impact population fitness substantially. In this study, we examined the genome of commercial purebred chicken lines for deleterious and functional variations, combining genotype and whole-genome sequence data. RESULTS: We analysed over 22,000 animals that were genotyped on a 60 K SNP chip from four purebred lines (two white egg and two brown egg layer lines) and two crossbred lines. We identified 79 haplotypes that showed a significant deficit in homozygous carriers. This deficit was assumed to stem from haplotypes that potentially harbour lethal recessive variations. To identify potentially deleterious mutations, a catalogue of over 10 million variants was derived from 250 whole-genome sequenced animals from three purebred white-egg layer lines. Out of 4219 putative deleterious variants, 152 mutations were identified that likely induce embryonic lethality in the homozygous state. Inferred deleterious variation showed evidence of purifying selection and deleterious alleles were generally overrepresented in regions of low recombination. Finally, we found evidence that mutations, which were inferred to be evolutionally intolerant, likely have positive effects in commercial chicken populations. CONCLUSIONS: We present a comprehensive genomic perspective on deleterious and functional genetic variation in egg layer breeding lines, which are under intensive selection and characterized by a small effective population size. We show that deleterious variation is subject to purifying selection and that there is a positive relationship between recombination rate and purging efficiency. In addition, multiple putative functional coding variants were discovered in selective sweep regions, which are likely under positive selection. Together, this study provides a unique molecular perspective on functional and deleterious variation in commercial egg-laying chickens, which can enhance current genomic breeding practices to lower the frequency of undesirable variants in the population.  aPublisher supplied data  a14283: From sequence to phenotype: detecting deleterious variation by prediction of functionality.cStichting voor de Technische Wetenschappen  aIMAGE (Innovative Management of Animal Genetic resources)cHorizon 2020  a677353cHorizon 20200 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalleles 3abreeding 3abreeding lines 3achickens 3acrossbreds 3aeffective population size 3aeggs 3agenetic drift 3agenetic variation 3agenomics 3agenotyping 3ahaplotypes 3ahomozygosity 3amortality 3apurebreds 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3asurveys1 aMegens, Hendrik-Jan1 aBosse, Mirte1 aVisscher, Jeroen1 aPeeters, Katrijn1 aBink, Marco C.

This is particularly true for nanostructures that are intended for biological applications because biomolecules are usually highly dynamic and responsive to external stimuli. In this Article, we investigated the structural and conformational dynamics of self-assembling bioactive β-sheet peptide nanostructures using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The model peptide nanostructures are characterized by the cross-β spine of β-ribbon fibers and multiple RNA-binding bioactive peptides that constitute the shell of the nanostructures. We found first, that bioactive peptides at the shell of β-ribbon nanostructure have a mobility similar to that of an isolated monomeric peptide. Second, the periphery of the cross-β spine is more immobile than the distal part of surface-displayed bioactive peptides. Third, the rotational dynamics of short and long fibrils are similar; that is, the mobility is largely independent of the extent of aggregation. Fourth, peptides that constitute the shell are affected first by the external environment at the initial stage. The cross-β spine resists its external environment to a certain extent and abruptly disintegrates when the perturbation reaches a certain degree. Our results provide an overall picture of β-sheet peptide nanostructure dynamics, which should be useful in the development of dynamic self-assembled peptide nanostructures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3amodels 3ananomaterials 3apeptides1 aKim, Donghun1 aHan, So-hee1 aKim, Nam Hee1 aKim, Sŏn-hŭi,1 aLim, Yong-beom0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2012 Sept. 26, v. 134, no. 38 p.16047-16053dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja307493t3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01851naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245012000153300001600273520082900289592002801118650001501146650002601161650001701187650001301204700001701217700001501234700002001249700001901269700001601288773013801304856007401442852000901516655001201525IND60641710720221119033958.0190506e20160105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064171072DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ta09029f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Libo10aExploiting the gate opening effect in a flexible MOF for selective adsorption of propyne from C1/C2/C3 hydrocarbons  ap. 751-755.  aThe separation of propyne from light hydrocarbon mixtures is of technological importance but poses considerable technical challenges. This article reports on the potential of a flexible metal–organic framework [Cu(dhbc)₂(4,4′-bipy)], with gate-opening characteristics, that exhibits adsorption selectivity in favor of propyne in a C1/C2/C3 mixture of hydrocarbons. The separation potential of the flexible MOF is established using a judicious combination of measurements of unary isotherms, IAST calculations of mixture adsorption equilibrium, transient breakthrough simulations, along with transient breakthrough experiments. Our multi-tier investigation strategy confirms that propyne can be selectively adsorbed from C1/C2/C3 hydrocarbons in fixed bed adsorbers that are commonly employed in the process industries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acoordination polymers 3ahydrocarbons 3aindustry1 aKrishna, R.,1 aWang, Yong1 aYang, Jiangfeng1 aWang, Xiaoqing1 aLi, Jinping0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2016 Jan. 5, v. 4, no. 3 p.751-755dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ta09029f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02786naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002400180245009900204300002000303506007600323520150400399592002801903506003701931650002101968650001101989650001202000650001202012650001102024650001602035650000902051650001802060650000802078700002602086700002302112700002202135773013502157856007502292852000902367655001202376IND60538667720221207064958.0160815e20120926xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053866772DNAL7 a10.1021/ja307501e2doi7 aPMC34621662pmcid7 a229673152pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNycholat, Corwin
M.10aIn Silico-Aided Design of a Glycan Ligand of Sialoadhesin for in Vivo Targeting of Macrophages  ap. 15696-15699.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCell-specific delivery of therapeutic agents using ligand targeting is gaining interest because of its potential for increased efficacy and reduced side effects. The challenge is to develop a suitable ligand for a cell-surface receptor that is selectively expressed on the desired cell. Sialoadhesin (Sn, Siglec-1, CD169), a sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin (Siglec) expressed on subsets of resident and inflammatory macrophages, is an attractive target for the development of a ligand-targeted delivery system. Here we report the development of a high-affinity and selective ligand for Sn that is an analogue of the natural ligand and is capable of targeting liposomal nanoparticles to Sn-expressing cells in vivo. An efficient in silico screen of a library of ∼8400 carboxylic acids was the key to identifying novel 9-N-acyl-substituted N-acetylneuramic acid (Neu5Ac) substituents as potential lead compounds. A small panel of targets were selected from the screen and synthesized to evaluate their affinities and selectivities. The most potent of these Sn ligands, 9-N-(4H-thieno[3,2-c]chromene-2-carbamoyl)-Neu5Acα2–3Galβ1–4GlcNAc (ᵀCCNeu5Ac), was conjugated to lipids for display on a liposomal nanoparticle for evaluation of targeted delivery to cells. The ᵀCCNeu5Ac liposomes were found to target liposomes selectively to cells expressing either murine or human Sn in vitro, and when administered to mice, they exhibited in vivo targeting to Sn-positive macrophages.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acarboxylic acids 3ahumans 3alectins 3aligands 3alipids 3amacrophages 3amice 3ananoparticles 3atin1 aRademacher, Christoph1 aKawasaki, Norihito1 aPaulson, James C.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2012 Sept. 26, v. 134, no. 38 p.15696-15699dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja307501e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02239naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245005100174300001400225520129100239592002801530650001501558650001401573650001001587650001401597650001601611650001401627650001401641650001201655700002001667700002801687773012201715856005501837852000901892655001201901IND4473250220221120215931.0120423e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447325022DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8339.2012.01232.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aERKENS, ROY H.

This can be carried out via online databases, printed publications or training in taxonomic practice. For Annonaceae, the online database AnnonBase includes all published names of Annonaceae at any rank worldwide. Recently, an updated index to genera, species and infraspecific taxa of Neotropical Annonaceae was published in hard copy. This manuscript contains a concise update to the Bibliography of Annonaceae published by the late E. A. Mennega in 1993. Since his publication, much work has been carried out on systematics and evolution of Annonaceae, with the advent of molecular phylogenetics providing an additional stimulus. Here, however, we concentrate only on taxonomic papers focusing specifically on the description and circumscription of taxa (e.g. revisions, monographs, floras, checklists, descriptions of new species or phylogenetic studies that show monophyly/polyphyly/paraphyly of genera). The index should provide an easy entrance into the most important taxonomic literature on Annonaceae from 1900 onwards for the trained and untrained taxonomist with an interest in Annonaceae. © 2012 The Linnean Society of London, Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society, 2012, 169, 41–73.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnnonaceae 3adatabases 3aflora 3amonophyly 3anew species 3aparaphyly 3apolyphyly 3atropics1 aMennega, E.

To modulate the compatibility between PET and PEO, maleic anhydride grafted POE (mPOE) was selected as compatibilizer. Three kinds of elastomeric additives, 100 % POE, mPOE/POE (15/85 w/w), and 100 % mPOE, were blended with PET, resulting in three compatibility situations, namely, poor, moderate, and strong interfacial adhesion, respectively. The impact toughness as a function of elastomer content was measured under different interfacial adhesions and test temperature, and microscopic morphology was revealed by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The results indicated that the interfacial adhesion determines the fashion of microvoiding and even the matrix shear yielding deformation, which will significantly affect the BDT behavior and its response to test temperature. Our study provides not only an effective route to prepare supertoughened PET blends (improved for 20 folds as comparing to the neat PET), but also a fresh insight into the importance of interfacial adhesion on the toughening of thermoplastic/elastomer system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3aadhesion 3adeformation 3amaleic anhydrides 3apolyethylene terephthalates 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3athermoplastics 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aLi, Yu-han1 aWang, Ke1 aFu, Qiang0 tJournal of materials science.g2014 Feb., v. 49, no. 4 p.1794-1804dSpringer USx0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-013-7867-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03212naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245016000165300001600325520162100341592002801962650001501990650002002005650001502025650001602040650001502056650002302071650001002094650001902104650001402123650002502137650001202162650001302174650003302187650002702220650001302247653003202260653003502292653003202327653001002359700001602369700001302385700001702398700001902415700001802434700001402452700002002466773010002486856008702586852000902673655001202682IND60542427620221119011204.0190402e20151115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054242762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.04.0692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Juan10aNovel restricted access materials combined to molecularly imprinted polymers for selective solid-phase extraction of organophosphorus pesticides from honey  ap. 331-337.  aA novel restricted access materials (RAM) combined to molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs), using malathion as template molecule and glycidilmethacrylate (GMA) as pro-hydrophilic co-monomer, were prepared for the first time. RAM-MIPs with hydrophilic external layer were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and recognition and selectivity properties were compared with the restricted access materials-non-molecularly imprinted polymers (RAM-NIPs) and unmodified MIPs. RAM-MIPs were used as the adsorbent enclosed in solid phase extraction column and several important extraction parameters were comprehensively optimized to evaluate the extraction performance. Under the optimum extraction conditions, RAM-MIPs exhibited comparable or even higher selectivity with greater extraction capacity toward six kinds of organophosphorus pesticides (including malathion, ethoprophos, phorate, terbufos, dimethoate, and fenamiphos) compared with the MIPs and commercial solid phase extraction columns. The RAM-MIPs solid phase extraction coupled with gas chromatography was successfully applied to simultaneously determine six kinds of organophosphorus pesticides from honey sample. The new established method showed good linearity in the range of 0.01–1.0μgmL−1, low limits of detection (0.0005–0.0019μgmL−1), acceptable reproducibility (RSD, 2.26–4.81%, n=6), and satisfactory relative recoveries (90.9–97.6%). It was demonstrated that RAM-MIPs solid phase extraction with excellent selectivity and restricted access function was a simple, rapid, selective, and effective sample pretreatment method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3adetection limit 3adimethoate 3aethoprophos 3afenamiphos 3agas chromatography 3ahoney 3ahydrophilicity 3amalathion 3amolecular imprinting 3aphorate 3apolymers 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolid phase extraction 3aterbufos 0aRestricted access materials 0aMolecularly imprinted polymers 0aOrganophosphorus pesticides 0aHoney1 aSong, Lixin1 aChen, Si1 aLi, Yuanyuan1 aWei, Hongliang1 aZhao, Dongxin1 aGu, Keren1 aZhang, Shusheng0 tFood chemistry.g2015 Nov. 15, v. 187 p.331-337dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.04.0693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03500naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245016100165300002000326520209500346592002802441596005902469596007602528650002202604650003502626650001602661650001602677650002702693650002402720650002102744650001702765650001402782650001602796700005502812773016902867856008103036852000903117655001203126IND60614219220221116151412.0181002e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061421922DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-018-2908-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Wenbing10aEffects of biological clogging on 1,1,1-TCA and its intermediates distribution and fate in heterogeneous saturated bio-augmented permeable reactive barriers  ap. 28628-28641.  aBiological clogging in porous media was an important concern in the design of bio-augmented permeable reactive barriers (Bio-PRBs) that were used to remediate groundwater with dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs). Here, we used laboratory sandbox experiments to develop and calibrate reactive transport models (C1 and C2) simulating 1,1,1-trichloroethane (1,1,1-TCA) change in heterogeneous saturated porous media. The routine (1,1,1-TCA chain kinetic reactions) and subroutine (the relationship between hydraulic conductivity (K) and time (t)) were included in the model computer code. The simulation results suggested that the model C1 had the applicability for simulating contaminant transport and fate in bio-augmented flow field. By using the model C1 which was suitable for constant K condition, the performance of different types of Bio-PRBs was evaluated, and the regularity of contaminants chain kinetic reactions in different heterogeneous saturated porous media was obtained. The results demonstrated that Bio-PRBs in immobilized microorganism (IM) protocol were more superior to Bio-PRBs in free microorganism (FM) protocol. In addition, by using the model C2 (updated model C1) which was suitable for decreasing K condition, the different and optimized regularity of contaminants transport and transformation was obtained. The results showed that microbial growth which further decreased K was beneficial to preventing the transport of contaminants and accelerating the transformation of contaminants. However, the negative effects of biological clogging on hydraulic conductivity and relative hydraulic conductivity ratio in FM Bio-PRBs were significantly stronger than that in IM Bio-PRBs. Deploying IM Bio-PRBs for groundwater remediation would be much more efficient and meet the design criteria. The research work had guiding significance to engineering and provided consultation for designing and optimizing Bio-PRBs system. To make the design and optimization of Bio-PRBs system convenient, it was very essential to choose the suitable mathematical model (C1 or C2).  aPublisher supplied data  a41272261cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a15DZ1205803cScience and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality 3acomputer software 3adense nonaqueous phase liquids 3aengineering 3agroundwater 3ahydraulic conductivity 3amathematical models 3amicrobial growth 3aporous media 3aprotocols 3aremediation1 aWu Yanqing,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6845-42580 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2018 Oct., v. 25, no. 28 p.28628-28641dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-2908-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03141naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002200189245009500211300001500306506007600321520172800397592002802125506003702153650001502190650002702205650001702232650001402249650002102263650001302284650001902297650001702316650001202333650001902345650001102364651001102375700002602386700002702412700002402439700001802463773011102481856008202592852000902674655001202683IND60648758320221207133613.0190701e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064875832DNAL7 a10.1007/s00267-019-01174-72doi7 aPMC65989462pmcid7 a310768282pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRogowska, Justyna10aPharmaceutical Household Waste Practices: Preliminary Findings from a Case Study in Poland  ap. 97-106.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPharmaceutical consumption continues to grow constantly. Unused/expired pharmaceuticals are disposed of to the municipal sewage system or waste disposal. Consequently, many countries have implemented a system of collecting pharmaceutical waste, with pharmacies playing an important role. It is important to educate consumers on rational consumption and the appropriate disposal of unused/expired pharmaceuticals and to identify the level of public awareness. Two studies were conducted in Poland to estimate the problem of collection and disposal of expired/unused pharmaceuticals. The purpose of the Survey I was to identify the scale of pharmaceutical consumption and the way pharmaceuticals are disposed of by various social groups. The Survey II was aimed to identify patients’ attitudes regarding expired/unused pharmaceuticals at home. Of the respondents who participated in in Survey I, almost 74% indicated that analgesics were among the over-the-counter drugs they purchased. Group of pharmaceuticals 65% of the respondents purchased were medicines for treating flu symptoms. Almost 68% of the respondents said they usually disposed of expired pharmaceuticals in their household waste or by flushing them down the toilet. In Survey II more than 35% reported that they disposed of pharmaceuticals in the same ways. Of all respondents, ~30% returned their expired pharmaceuticals to pharmacies. Most respondents (over 65%) who participated Survey I indicated that they were aware that pharmaceutical waste can be returned to pharmacies. It should be noted that local governments are currently not obliged by law to work with or compensate pharmacies in the collection and proper disposal of unused pharmaceuticals.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanalgesics 3aattitudes and opinions 3acase studies 3ainfluenza 3alocal government 3apatients 3asewage systems 3asocial class 3asurveys 3awaste disposal 3awastes 3aPoland1 aZimmermann, Agnieszka1 aMuszyńska, Agnieszka,1 aRatajczyk, Wojciech1 aWolska, Lidia0 tEnvironmental management.g2019 July, v. 64, no. 1 p.97-106dSpringer USwJournal:jnl8014x0364-152X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-019-01174-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03179naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245011200204300001800316520201900334592002802353650003102381650001202412650001902424650001102443650000902454650003002463650001602493700001302509700001402522700001102536700001502547700001302562700001302575773012602588856008202714852000902796655001202805IND60590071620221116181420.0180619e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059007162DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-017-3690-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Huqiang1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5669-155810aOn the influence of simulated SST warming on rainfall projections in the Indo-Pacific domain: an AGCM study  ap. 1373-1391.  aSignificant uncertainty exists in regional climate change projections, particularly for rainfall and other hydro-climate variables. In this study, we conduct a series of Atmospheric General Circulation Model (AGCM) experiments with different future sea surface temperature (SST) warming simulated by a range of coupled climate models. They allow us to assess the extent to which uncertainty from current coupled climate model rainfall projections can be attributed to their simulated SST warming. Nine CMIP5 model-simulated global SST warming anomalies have been super-imposed onto the current SSTs simulated by the Australian climate model ACCESS1.3. The ACCESS1.3 SST-forced experiments closely reproduce rainfall means and interannual variations as in its own fully coupled experiments. Although different global SST warming intensities explain well the inter-model difference in global mean precipitation changes, at regional scales the SST influence vary significantly. SST warming explains about 20–25% of the patterns of precipitation changes in each of the four/five models in its rainfall projections over the oceans in the Indo-Pacific domain, but there are also a couple of models in which different SST warming explains little of their precipitation pattern changes. The influence is weaker again for rainfall changes over land. Roughly similar levels of contribution can be attributed to different atmospheric responses to SST warming in these models. The weak SST influence in our study could be due to the experimental setup applied: superimposing different SST warming anomalies onto the same SSTs simulated for current climate by ACCESS1.3 rather than directly using model-simulated past and future SSTs. Similar modelling and analysis from other modelling groups with more carefully designed experiments are needed to tease out uncertainties caused by different SST warming patterns, different SST mean biases and different model physical/dynamical responses to the same underlying SST forcing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGeneral Circulation Models 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aoceans 3arain 3asurface water temperature 3auncertainty1 aZhao, Y.1 aMoise, A.1 aYe, H.1 aColman, R.1 aRoff, G.1 aZhao, M.0 tClimate dynamics.g2018 Feb., v. 50, no. 3-4 p.1373-1391dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3895934x0930-75757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-017-3690-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03132naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100006200189245009700251300001400348506007600362520178400438592002802222596005102250596003502301596004602336506003702382650002102419650001402440650001602454650001102470650002402481650002602505650001402531773011002545856008202655852000902737655001202746IND60648758420221207133611.0190701e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064875842DNAL7 a10.1007/s00267-019-01172-92doi7 aPMC65989412pmcid7 a310768292pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaylor, Dorceta E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2847-077910aCollege Students and Nature: Differing Thoughts of Fear, Danger, Disconnection, and Loathing  ap. 79-96.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDespite the existence of a robust body of research that investigates human–nature connections, few scholars have examined what people tend to ponder when they think of nature. The objective of the study is to find out how college and university students think about nature. The study also seeks to identify which factors are most significant in influencing students’ thoughts about nature. This paper analyzes racial, gender, class, and academic differences in the way college students think about nature. The study of 287 American students found that respondents thought about a wide range of concepts and ideas when they contemplate nature. This article focuses on the demographic differences in thoughts about fear, danger, and loathing. This set of ideas has been the subject of scholarly research, and the findings presented herein contribute to this body of scholarship. The paper discusses both descriptive and multivariate techniques that are used to explore the topic. The study found that white students are less likely than racial/ethnic minorities to think about disconnection, predators, getting lost, loathsome or hateful places, fear, and danger when they think of nature. However, the results also show that it would be inaccurate to describe racial/ethnic minorities as universally fearful of and disconnected from nature. Moreover, the paper demonstrates that race is not the only explanatory variable that has significant impacts in multivariate models—the student’s academic interest has significant impacts on thoughts about natural hazards, disconnection, predators, human-made hazards, and loathsome or hateful places. Gender, age, parental education, and first-generation college attendance also has significant impacts on the dependent variables.  aPublisher supplied data  aN025252cEnvironmental Grantmakers Association  aN023717cC.

It was established that carrying out of the reaction in the boiling toluene with 0.5 eq. of Lawesson’s reagent (LR) is most effective for synthesis of thio analogues of methyl-, allyl-, benzylcytisine and thermopsine. It was found, that formation of thioamides is preferable in the case with starting 3-carboxamides of (-)-cytisine or 2-oxo and 4-oxo derivatives of methylcytisine; and an excess of LR is needed for their exhaustive thionation. It was shown, that thionation of ‘cytisine substituted’ urea and thiourea, as well as Diels-Alder adducts of methylcitisine with phenylmaleimide on basis of this approach was not quite successful: only thionation of the 2-pyridone core has occurred. It should be noted that transformation of urea and thiourea is complicated by side reactions leading to low yields of thio products, and the result of LR interaction with mentioned above diastereomeric Diels-Alder adducts depends on their stereochemistry and thermodynamic stability under reaction conditions.  aThis study is supported by Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation, state assignments No AAAA-A17-117011910025-6 (IT, AK, DT), No AAAA-A17–117011910027–0 (AL) and RFBR No 18-53-52004 (PP).

This study constitutes the first work to investigate the response of digestive enzymes in relation to high environmental salinity and temperature in a non-symbiotic sea anemone. We determined the occurrence and biochemical characteristics of maltase activity and compared maltase and proteolytic activities in mesenterial filaments in Bunodosoma zamponii from the intertidal area of Punta Cantera, Mar del Plata, Argentina (38°05′S, 57°32′W) acclimated to 35 and 40 psu and after an acute enhancement (15 min) of temperature from 20° to 30°C. Maltase activity was higher in 40 psu and upon the increase in temperature (about 80 and 99%, respectively). Proteolytic activity was not affected in any case. The results suggest the occurrence of specific digestive adjustments in relation to high salinity and temperature. The fact that differential modulation of maltase activity could be associated with a higher digestive capacity for glycogenic substrates is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnthozoa 3aalpha-glucosidase 3adigestive enzymes 3aenvironmental factors 3alittoral zone 3aproteolysis 3asalinity 3asymbiosis 3atemperature 3aArgentina1 aAcuña, Fabián Horacio1 aLópez Mañanes, Alejandra Antonia0 tHydrobiologia.g2015 Oct., v. 759, no. 1 p.189-199dSpringer International Publishingx0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-015-2239-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02979naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002100186245010600207300002000313506007600333520148900409592002801898506003701926650003001963650001601993650001602009650001102025650001702036650002902053650001202082650000702094650001002101650001902111650001502130653002202145653002202167653001902189653003102208700001802239773017602257856007902433852000902512655001202521IND60173701420221207131038.0150603e20130611xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017370142DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12226061102doi7 aPMC36837552pmcid7 a237166952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTokutsu, Ryutaro10aEnergy-dissipative supercomplex of photosystem II associated with LHCSR3 in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii  ap. 10016-10021.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPlants and green algae have a low pH-inducible mechanism in photosystem II (PSII) that dissipates excess light energy, measured as the nonphotochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence (qE). Recently, nonphotochemical quenching 4 (npq4), a mutant strain of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii that is qE-deficient and lacks the light-harvesting complex stress-related protein 3 (LHCSR3), was reported [Peers G, et al. (2009) Nature 462(7272):518–521]. Here, applying a newly established procedure, we isolated the PSII supercomplex and its associated light-harvesting proteins from both WT C. reinhardtii and the npq4 mutant grown in either low light (LL) or high light (HL). LHCSR3 was present in the PSII supercomplex from the HL-grown WT, but not in the supercomplex from the LL-grown WT or mutant. The purified PSII supercomplex containing LHCSR3 exhibited a normal fluorescence lifetime at a neutral pH (7.5) by single-photon counting analysis, but a significantly shorter lifetime at pH 5.5, which mimics the acidified lumen of the thylakoid membranes in HL-exposed chloroplasts. The switch from light-harvesting mode to energy-dissipating mode observed in the LHCSR3-containing PSII supercomplex was sensitive to dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, a protein-modifying agent specific to protonatable amino acid residues. We conclude that the PSII-LHCII-LHCSR3 supercomplex formed in the HL-grown C. reinhardtii cells is capable of energy dissipation on protonation of LHCSR3.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3aamino acids 3achlorophyll 3aenergy 3afluorescence 3alight harvesting complex 3amutants 3apH 3apeers 3aphotosystem II 3athylakoids 0ahigh light stress 0alight acclimation 0aphotosynthesis 0atime-resolved fluorescence1 aMinagawa, Jun0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 June 11, v. 110, no. 24 p.10016-10021dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12226061103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02981naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005600151245010400207300001800311520110600329592002801435650001001463650000801473650001101481650001401492650002301506650001201529650001301541650001201554650001801566650001301584650001401597650002001611650001201631650001501643650001701658650001201675653001201687653001801699653002301717653001301740653002201753653003501775700002001810700001601830700001401846700002201860700001401882700006301896700005501959700001602014700005602030700005602086773014302142856008502285852000902370655001202379IND60642261520221118191336.0190506e20190321xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064226152DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b002922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Da-Ming1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4943-806810aMacroporous Niobium Phosphate-Supported Magnesia Catalysts for Isomerization of Glucose-to-Fructose  ap. 8512-8521.  aThe catalytic performance of hierarchically porous niobium phosphate (NbP) supported magnesia for the glucose isomerization to fructose, was investigated under atmospheric air atmosphere. Porous NbP showed improved support effects on MgO in comparison to other metal oxides tested for glucose isomerization. Also, the amount and distribution of basic sites were largely changed by supporting magnesia on NbP. Although the textural properties were reduced and solid acids formed on the MgO/NbP catalysts, glucose isomerization was promoted by increasing magnesium content. The maximum yield of fructose reached ∼24.6% over 40%MgO/NbP-500 with selectivity of 65.7% for 1.0 wt % glucose at 120 °C. The fructose productivity peaked as high as 13.6 g gcₐₜₐₗyₛₜ–¹ h–¹ over 40%MgO/NbP-700 catalyst. The leaching of cations and anions resulted in a homogeneous system for glucose isomerization. Regeneration almost fully reactivated the catalyst to its initial activity. The MgO/NbP showed high stability under air atmosphere for 15 days, and high potential use for glucose isomerization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacids 3aair 3aanions 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acations 3afructose 3aglucose 3aisomerization 3aleaching 3amagnesium 3amagnesium oxide 3aniobium 3aphosphates 3aporous media 3atexture 0aglucose 0aisomerization 0asupported magnesia 0afructose 0aniobium phosphate 0ahierarchically porous material1 aShen, Yong-Bing1 aZhao, Bohan1 aLiu, Qian1 aNakanishi, Kazuki1 aChen, Jie1 aKanamori, Kazuyoshi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5087-98081 aWu, Huaping1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4505-70621 aHe, Zhiyong1 aZeng, Maomao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9259-19921 aLiu, Haichao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9175-33710 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2019 Mar. 21, v. 7, no. 9 p.8512-8521dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b002923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03043naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245014000204300001400344520168000358592002802038596008202066650002802148650001102176650002002187650001502207650001402222650001502236650001102251650002102262650001302283650003002296650001702326650001202343650001402355651001702369700001802386700001602404773011002420856008202530852000902612655001202621IND60648758720221121234856.0190701e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064875872DNAL7 a10.1007/s00267-019-01173-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoble, B.

Integrated coastal management (ICM) is advocated as a best practice approach to achieving this, but comes with its own challenges. Given the diverse nature of the coastal environment and the goods and services it offers, its management is complex. In South Africa, this is exacerbated by the legislative framework which delegates numerous responsibilities to local government without providing financial or human capacity to meet these requirements. These challenges have resulted in the development of a number of guidelines in support of achieving ICM objectives. This paper focuses on one coastal region in South Africa, KwaZulu-Natal, which is grappling with coastal management issues, including the implementation thereof for a 580 km coast with 76 estuaries. It considers the progressive, iterative development of an innovative Decision Support info-portal to assist local coastal managers in the absence of human capacity support and tools. Stakeholders were asked to complete a survey to provide feedback on their impression of the tool, its functions and usability. This facilitated stakeholder input into the info-portal development, which was essential in ensuring that the end product is useable, relevant and supportive of coastal management and decision making.

In this study, a chromium (Cr)–resistant mineralization strain, Bacillus thuringiensis T124, was selected from the soil around an electroplating company, and the mechanism underlying the reduction–mineralization of Cr by this strain was studied. The reduction process mainly occurred on the cell wall membrane. The reducing enzymes were found in each component of the strain; however, a majority of them were internal. The strain could tolerate and reduce the toxicity of Cr toward itself. On fitting the data to enzyme kinetics, the Kₘ was found to be 2925.03 μmol·L⁻¹, Vₘ was 7.48 mg·(h·L)⁻¹, and urease activity was 66.4 U·mL⁻¹. The final mineralization of Cr(VI) by the strain yielded CaCO₃ and Ca₁₀Cr₆O₂₄(CO₃). The proposed mechanism is that Cr(VI) is reduced by biological reductase, which reduces the toxicity of Cr and indirectly increases urease activity of the strain. Urease can decompose the substrate to form a CaCO₃ precipitate with Ca(II). Cr replaces a part of the lattice of CaCO₃ to mineralize Cr, thereby forming a CaCr coprecipitate. These minerals occupy a part of the binding site of the strain. The reduction–mineralization synergistic mechanism thus plays an important role in the immobilization of Cr(VI) on the cell wall of the strain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3abioavailability 3acell walls 3achromium 3aenvironment 3aenzyme kinetics 3amineralization 3aoxidoreductases 3aremediation 3asoil 3asynergism 3atoxicity 3aurease 0aChromium 0aBioremediation 0aUrease 0aBioconversion 0aEnvironmental preservation1 aTang, Ding1 aJiang, Yi0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 July 10, v. 777 p.146190-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1461903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02297naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245008600163300002000249520104300269592002801312650002001340650001301360650002101373650001701394650001401411650001701425650001301442653001601455653001201471653002201483653000901505653002201514700001801536700002401554700001601578700001901594700001801613700001801631773012501649856008001774852000901854655001201863IND60528925420170710000000.0160717e20160518xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052892542DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b028712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLao, Yeh-Hsing10aSignal-on Protein Detection via Dye Translocation between Aptamer and Quantum Dot  ap. 12048-12055.  aA unique interaction between the cyanine dye and negatively charged quantum dot is used to construct a signal-on biaptameric quantum dot (QD) Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) beacon for protein detection and distinct aptamer characterization. The beacon comprises a pair of aptamers, one intercalated with the cyanine dye (YOYO-3) and the other conjugated to a negatively charged, carboxyl-QD. When the target protein is present, structural folding and sandwich association of the two aptamers take place. As a consequence, YOYO-3 is displaced from the folded aptamer and transferred to the unblocked QD surface to yield a target concentration-dependent FRET signal. As a proof-of-principle, we demonstrate the detection of thrombin ranging from nanomolar to submicromolar concentrations and confirm the dye translocation using cylindrical illumination confocal spectroscopy (CICS). The proposed beacon provides a simple, rapid, signal-on FRET detection for protein as well as a potential platform for distinct aptamer screening.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy transfer 3alighting 3aoligonucleotides 3aquantum dots 3ascreening 3aspectroscopy 3athrombin 0aquantum dot 0aaptamer 0aintercalating dye 0aFRET 0adye translocation1 aChi, Chun-Wei1 aFriedrich, Sarah M.1 aPeck, Konan1 aWang, Tza-Huei1 aLeong, Kam W.1 aChen, Lin-Chi0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2016 May 18, v. 8, no. 19 p.12048-12055dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b028713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03133naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002200138245012400160300001500284500002000299520148700319592002801806650002501834650002701859650001201886650001301898650001101911650001301922650001101935650003101946650001701977650000901994650001602003650001902019650001102038650002102049650001702070650001902087650001702106650001002123650001902133650002102152650000902173651001002182700001802192700002302210700002502233700001702258700002502275700002402300700002102324773012902345856007202474852000902546655001202555IND60588602620221123033459.0180124e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058860262DNAL7 a10.1002/ldr.28422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrunetti, Gennaro10aRemediation of a heavy metals contaminated soil using mycorrhized and non‐mycorrhized Helichrysum italicum (Roth) Don  ap. 91-104.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aFour hundred hectares of the inland and hilly part of Apulia Region (Southern Italy) were contaminated by using low‐quality composts for many years. That territory now belongs to a national park and needs a sustainable soil restoration. Therefore, a greenhouse experiment was carried out to test the phytoremediation potential of the frugal Helichrysum italicum (Roth) Don, alone and mycorrhized by Septoglomus viscosum. The aims of the research were (a) to test if the H. italicum can reduce the soil content of Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn; (b) to identify in which part of the plant those metals are mainly accumulated; (c) to check the role of S. viscosum in promoting the plant growth and the soil phytoremediation. The results showed better plant growth in contaminated soils in comparison to control soils, regardless of the presence of mycorrhiza, probably due to the better soil fertility parameters in contaminated soils. In addition, non‐mycorrhized plants from contaminated soil accumulated greater amounts of heavy metals, especially Cr, Cu, Pb, and Zn, in their root system. According to the translocation and bioconcentration factors, the mechanism by which H. italicum incorporated heavy metals was ascribable to a phytostabilization process. In contrast, the application of mycorrhiza in the contaminated soil reduced the uptake of heavy metals by the roots, possibly through an exclusion mechanism, reducing the phytoremediation potential of H. italicum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelichrysum italicum 3abioaccumulation factor 3acadmium 3achromium 3acobalt 3acomposts 3acopper 3agreenhouse experimentation 3aheavy metals 3alead 3amycorrhizae 3anational parks 3anickel 3aphytoremediation 3aplant growth 3apolluted soils 3aroot systems 3aroots 3asoil fertility 3asoil restoration 3azinc 3aItaly1 aRuta, Claudia1 aTraversa, Andreina1 aD'Ambruoso, Giuseppe1 aTarraf, Waed1 aDe Mastro, Francesco1 aDe Mastro, Giuseppe1 aCocozza, Claudio0 tLand degradation & development.g2018 Jan., v. 29, no. 1 p.91-104dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54628x1085-32787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.28423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02357naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003100151245007100182300001600253520092800269592002801197650002201225650001301247650000901260650001701269650001201286650001101298650001701309650001101326653002201337653001601359653001001375653001301385653001001398700002501408700002801433700002601461700003901487700002701526700003601553700003301589700003901622700002901661773009001690856008601780852000901866655001201875IND60790452820221122074201.0220906e20221015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079045282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxicon.2022.08.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliveira, Isadora Sousa de10aState-of-the-art review of snake venom phosphodiesterases (svPDEs)  ap. 121-130.  aPhosphodiesterases (PDEs) constitute an enzyme group able to hydrolyze nucleic acids as well as some second messengers. Due to this ability and their expression in several human tissues and organs, PDEs can control a gamut of physiological processes. They are also involved in some pathological conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease and erectile dysfunction. PDEs are also expressed in snake venom glands, being called snake venoms phosphodiesterases, or simply svPDEs. The occurrence of these enzymes has already been reported in crotalid, elapid and viperid venoms, such as Crotalus, Naja and Trimeresurus, respectively, but not all of them have been characterized concerning their structure, activity and function.

Significant enhancement in luminescence intensity by core@shell formation is observed due to the decrease of non-radiative rate arising from surface/defect of particles. Effect of 266 nm laser excitation (Mo–O charge transfer band) on the asymmetric ratio (A₂₁ = intensity ratio of electric to magnetic dipole transitions) has been studied and compared with a xenon lamp source. Luminescence intensity increases with the increase of power at 532 nm laser excitation. In order to explore materials, which can show dual functionalities such as luminescence as well as magnetic properties (magnetization of ∼14.2 emu g⁻¹), water dispersible Fe₃O₄–CaMoO₄:Eu hybrid magnetic nanoparticles (MN) have been prepared. This shows good heating ability up to ∼42 °C (hyperthermia) and luminescence in the red region (∼612 nm), which is in a biological window (optical imaging).

Results showed that the mycelial growth and spores’ germination of P. digitatum were inhibited by citronellal in a dose-dependent manner. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) were determined to be 1.60 µL/mL and 3.20 µL/mL, respectively. It was found that the plasma membrane of citronellal-treated P. digitatum spores was damaged, as confirmed by the propidium iodide stain results, as well as a higher extracellular conductivity and release of cell constituents in citronellal-treated samples than those of control samples. Moreover, in vivo test results demonstrated that wax + citronellal (WC; 10 × MFC) treatment effectively reduced the incidence of green mold after 5 days of storage at 25 ± 2 °C. These findings suggested that the plasma damage mechanism contributed to the antifungal activity of citronellal against P. digitatum. In addition, citronellal was suggested to be a potential alternative to fungicidal agents in controlling green mold of citrus fruit.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPenicillium digitatum 3aantifungal properties 3acitronellal 3acitrus fruits 3adose response 3aessential oils 3agermination 3ain vivo studies 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3amycelium 3aplasma membrane 3apropidium 3aspores 3astorage time1 aOuYang, Qiuli1 aTao, Nengguo0 tJournal of food science and technology.g2016 Oct., v. 53, no. 10 p.3853-3858dSpringer Indiax0022-11557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-016-2358-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03322naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002200186245008600208300001800294506007600312520169300388592002802081506003702109650002002146650001202166650001902178650001202197650001502209650002302224650002202247650001702269650001302286650000902299650002102308650001502329650001702344653002302361653001902384653001902403653002902422653001802451700002502469700002102494700002702515773017402542856007902716852000902795655001202804IND60173702020221207132458.0150603e20130611xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017370202DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.13009221102doi7 aPMC36837192pmcid7 a237166562pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeisner, Annelein10aSoil biotic legacy effects of extreme weather events influence plant invasiveness  ap. 9835-9838.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aClimate change is expected to increase future abiotic stresses on ecosystems through extreme weather events leading to more extreme drought and rainfall incidences [Jentsch A, et al. (2007) Front Ecol Environ 5(7):365–374]. These fluctuations in precipitation may affect soil biota, soil processes [Evans ST, Wallenstein MD (2012) Biogeochemistry 109:101–116], and the proportion of exotics in invaded plant communities [Jiménez MA, et al. (2011) Ecol Lett 14:1277–1235]. However, little is known about legacy effects in soil on the performance of exotics and natives in invaded plant communities. Here we report that drought and rainfall effects on soil processes and biota affect the performance of exotics and natives in plant communities. We performed two mesocosm experiments. In the first experiment, soil without plants was exposed to drought and/or rainfall, which affected soil N availability. Then the initial soil moisture conditions were restored, and a mixed community of co-occurring natives and exotics was planted and exposed to drought during growth. A single stress before or during growth decreased the biomass of natives, but did not affect exotics. A second drought stress during plant growth resetted the exotic advantage, whereas native biomass was not further reduced. In the second experiment, soil inoculation revealed that drought and/or rainfall influenced soil biotic legacies, which promoted exotics but suppressed natives. Our results demonstrate that extreme weather events can cause legacy effects in soil biota, promoting exotics and suppressing natives in invaded plant communities, depending on the type, frequency, and timing of extreme events.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiogeochemistry 3abiomass 3aclimate change 3adrought 3aecosystems 3aintroduced species 3aplant communities 3aplant growth 3aplanting 3arain 3asoil inoculation 3asoil water 3awater stress 0ainvaded ecosystems 0anitrogen cycle 0aplant invasion 0aplant–soil interaction 0asoil microbes1 aDe Deyn, Gerlinde B.1 aBoer, Wietse de,1 avan der Putten, Wim H.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 June 11, v. 110, no. 24 p.9835-9838dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.13009221103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03946naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245015400162300001800316520190400334592002802238596008902266650001602355650002802371650002102399650002002420650002902440650002502469650002202494650001902516650002602535650001802561650002102579650001502600650002102615650001202636650001302648650001002661650002002671650003002691650001202721650002202733650001802755650001102773650004302784650002502827650005202852650001902904650001202923650002902935650002202964650001202986700001202998700001303010700002003023700001303043700001603056700001103072773011103083856008103194852000903275655001203284IND60613916520221119221254.0180918e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061391652DNAL7 a10.1007/s00468-018-1702-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, D. Q.12aA hybrid proline-rich cell-wall protein gene JsPRP1 from Juglans sigillata Dode confers both biotic and abiotic stresses in transgenic tobacco plants  ap. 1199-1209.  aKEY MESSAGE: Walnut hybrid proline-rich protein gene JsPRP1 was induced by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and signaling molecules. JsPRP1 protein inhibited pathogenic fungi. JsPRP1 overexpression in tobacco conferred strong resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses. Walnut (Juglans sigillata Dode) is one of the important sources of nuts and timbers in the world. With the expansion of walnut cultivation area, its disease hazards have become a serious problem. In this study, a novel hybrid proline-rich cell-wall protein gene JsPRP1 was investigated and isolated from Juglans sigillata Dode induced by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. qRT-PCR (quantitative reverse transcription-PCR) analysis showed that JsPRP1 transcriptional level was up-regulated in J. sigillata Dode following jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, ethylene, and hydrogen peroxide treatments, and C. gloeosporioides inoculation. The JsPRP1 gene was further fused with green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene in a plant expression vector and transferred into onion (Allium cepa) epidermal cells. Laser scanning confocal microscope confirmed that JsPRP1 was expressed in the cell wall. Moreover, the JsPRP1 protein was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant protein purified by Ni–NTA column showed in vitro antifungal activity to C. gloeosporioides, Gibberella moniliformis, Botryosphaeria dothidea, and Fusarium solani. Furthermore, the plant overexpression vector of JsPRP1 was constructed and transferred into tobacco. The T₂ transgenic tobacco showed high tolerance to drought, CdCl₂, and C. gloeosporioides infection, meanwhile the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in transgenic tobacco was significantly lower than wild-type plant under stress. The above results indicate that JsPRP1 is an important defense gene in J. sigillata Dode against drought, CdCl₂ stress, and C. gloeosporioides infection.  aPublisher supplied data  a2011BAD46B00cMinistry of Science and Technology of the People’s Republic of China 3aAllium cepa 3aBotryosphaeria dothidea 3aEscherichia coli 3aFusarium solani 3aFusarium verticillioides 3aGlomerella cingulata 3aJuglans sigillata 3aabiotic stress 3aantifungal properties 3abiotic stress 3acadmium chloride 3acell walls 3acultivation area 3adrought 3aethylene 3agenes 3agenetic vectors 3agreen fluorescent protein 3ahybrids 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ajasmonic acid 3aonions 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arecombinant proteins 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asalicylic acid 3atobacco 3atranscription (genetics) 3atransgenic plants 3awalnuts1 aHan, Q.1 aShah, T.1 aChen, Zhengyou,1 aWang, Q.1 aTang, B.

There exists a synergetic effect between the chemotherapy and photothermal therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3acytotoxicity 3adrug therapy 3agraphene 3ahydrophobicity 3airradiation 3aporous media 3asilica 3asynergism 0agraphene 0aJanus 0ananocage 0adelivery 0aNIR1 aYang, Saina1 aLiang, Fuxin1 aWang, Qian1 aQu, Xiaozhong1 aYang, Zhenzhong0 tACS applied materials .g2016 May 18, v. 8, no. 19 p.12056-12062dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.6b032083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03422naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006500144245006600209300002000275500001900295520186900314592002802183650001402211650002102225650002102246650001002267650001802277650001202295650001302307650001702320650001402337650002002351650001802371650001902389650001902408650003102427650002102458650002602479650001402505653001502519653002702534653001602561653003002577700001702607700006202624773014302686856007802829852000902907655001202916IND60712107720221122091937.0201009e20200901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071210772DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c120862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFinny, Abraham Samuel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3435-094110a3D Printed Hydrogel-Based Sensors for Quantifying UV Exposure  ap. 43911-43920.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aExposure to excessive ultraviolet (UV) radiation can have detrimental effects on human health. Inexpensive easy-to-use sensors for monitoring UV radiation can allow broad-scale assessment of UV exposure, but their implementation requires technology that enables rapid and affordable manufacturing of these sensors on a large scale. Herein, we report a novel three-dimensional (3D) printing procedure and printable ink composition that produce robust, flexible, and wearable UV sensors. To fabricate the sensors, a color-changing hydrogel ink was first developed from which standalone constructs were 3D printed. The ink contains alginate, gelatin, photoactive titanium dioxide nanoparticles, and dyes (methyl orange, methylene blue, and malachite green) in which the nanoparticles are used to initiate photocatalytic degradation of dyes, leading to discoloration of the dye. The sensors resemble a color-changing tattoo that loses color upon exposure to UV. The viscosity and ink composition were optimized to achieve printability and tune the mechanical properties (e.g., modulus, hardness) of the sensors. The optimized procedure enabled the one-step fabrication of mechanically stable sensors that can effectively measure outdoor sun exposure by quantifying the decrease in color, visible to the naked eye. Apart from being used as wearable sensors, these sensors have the potential to be used along with UV-based workspace sterilizing devices to ensure that surfaces have been efficiently exposed to UV. The sensors are inexpensive, stable, extremely robust, biodegradable, and easy to use. The tunability, biocompatibility, and printability of the ink offer excellent potential for developing advanced 3D printing methods that, in addition to UV sensors, can be applied more broadly to fabricate other sensing technologies for a variety of other applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalginates 3abiocompatibility 3abiodegradability 3acolor 3adiscoloration 3agelatin 3ahardness 3ahuman health 3ahydrogels 3amalachite green 3amethyl orange 3amethylene blue 3aphotocatalysis 3athree-dimensional printing 3atitanium dioxide 3aultraviolet radiation 3aviscosity 0aUV sensors 0a3D printable hydrogels 0aUV exposure 0aPhotoactive nanoparticles1 aJiang, Cindy1 aAndreescu, Silvana1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3382-79390 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Sept. 01, v. 12, no. 39 p.43911-43920dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c120863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01782naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002300181245007500204300001600279506007600295520066500371592002801036506003701064650001901101650001601120650001501136650001101151650001501162700002401177700002201201773012601223856007401349852000901423655001201432IND60663092720221207051006.0190909e20140224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066309272DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ib40163d2doi7 aPMC40074912pmcid7 a244808522pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarulli, Alexis J.10aUnraveling intestinal stem cell behavior with models of crypt dynamics  ap. 243-257.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe definition, regulation and function of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) has been hotly debated.

Tree architecture is the three-dimensional arrangement of above ground parts of a tree. Ecologists hypothesize that the topology of tree branches represents optimized adaptations to tree’s environment. Thus, an accurate description of tree architecture leads to a better understanding of how form is driven by function. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) has demonstrated its potential to characterize woody tree structure. However, most current TLS methods do not describe tree architecture. Here, we examined nine trees from a Guyanese tropical rainforest to evaluate the utility of TLS for measuring tree architecture. First, we scanned the trees and extracted individual tree point clouds. TreeQSM was used to reconstruct woody structure through 3D quantitative structure models (QSMs). From these QSMs, we calculated: (1) length and diameter of branches > 10 cm diameter, (2) branching order and (3) tree volume. To validate our method, we destructively harvested the trees and manually measured all branches over 10 cm (279). TreeQSM found and reconstructed 95% of the branches thicker than 30 cm. Comparing field and QSM data, QSM overestimated branch lengths thicker than 50 cm by 1% and underestimated diameter of branches between 20 and 60 cm by 8%. TreeQSM assigned the correct branching order in 99% of all cases and reconstructed 87% of branch lengths and 97% of tree volume. Although these results are based on nine trees, they validate a method that is an important step forward towards using tree architectural traits based on TLS and open up new possibilities to use QSMs for tree architecture.  aPublisher supplied data  a14-IG-11132762-350cSilvaCarbon  a5160957540cERA-GAS NWO-3DforMod  a321131cGEM-TRAITS  a321131cGEM-TRAITS  a321131cGEM-TRAITS  aNE/P012337/1cNatural Environment Research Council 3aaerial parts 3abranches 3adata collection 3aecologists 3alidar 3amodels 3atopology 3atrees 3atropical plants 3atropical rain forests1 aBentley, Lisa Patrick1 aMartius, Christopher1 aShenkin, Alexander1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2358-93671 aBartholomeus, Harm1 aRaumonen, Pasi1 aMalhi, Y.q(Yadvinder),1 aJackson, Tobias1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8143-61611 aHerold, Martin0 tTrees.g2018 Oct., v. 32, no. 5 p.1219-1231dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl43090x0931-18907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00468-018-1704-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02323naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245010400165300001600269520143900285592002801724650001201752650001101764650001001775650002201785650000901807650003001816700002001846773010501866856004101971852000902012655001202021IND50071570920221119163442.0140206e199712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007157092DNAL7 a10.1007/BF029081952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Ruig, Joost H. M.10aDevelopments in Dutch coastline management: Conclusions from the second governmental coastal report  ap. 203-210.  aIn 1990 the Dutch government decided to stop any further long-term landward retreat of the coastline. This policy choice for a ‘dynamic preservation’ is primarily aimed at safety against flooding and at sustainable preservation of the values and interests concerning the dunes and beaches. Five years later, a first overview of the benefits and bottlenecks of the new coastal defence policy could be presented, which was published in the second governmental coastal report ‘Kustbalans 1995’ (coastal balance 1995). This consists of three elements: (1) evaluation of the implementation of ‘dynamic preservation’, (2) the consequences of several natural and anthropogenic developments in the coastal zone and (3) integrated coastal zone management. The present report describes experiences of Dutch coastline management and summarizes the main conclusions of the second governmental report.The overall conclusion of the evaluation study is that the 1990 choice for ‘dynamic preservation’ was right. Sand supply is an effective method of coastline maintenance, which also serves functional uses in the beach and dune area. However, nearly a doubling of the supply volume is necessary to compensate for sand losses in the coastal zone. A more integrated management of the coastal zone is necessary to find an equilibrium between the interests of socio-economic development and the maintenance of a natural, dynamic system.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeaches 3acoasts 3adunes 3aissues and policy 3asand 3asocioeconomic development1 aHillen, Roeland0 tJournal of coastal conservation.g1997 Dec., v. 3, no. 1 p.203-210dSpringer-Verlagx1400-03507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02908195  aDNAL 7aarticle01776naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245010700165300001600272520075900288592002801047650001801075650001701093650002501110650001901135650001201154650002701166700001401193700001801207700001801225700001301243773008801256856008501344852000901429655001201438IND60098294720221118014223.0141104e20110309xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009829472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.febslet.2011.02.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Jun10aCytotoxicity of red fluorescent protein DsRed is associated with the suppression of Bcl-xL translation  ap. 821-827.  aRed fluorescent protein (RFP) DsRed and its variants are widely applied in live-cell imaging experiments.

Here, we report that DsRed and its variant DsRed-Express2 inhibit the expression of B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xL) in HeLa cells by translational regulation. Over-expression of Bcl-xL can reduce the cytotoxicity of DsRed. Meanwhile, Turbo RFP, a mutant RFP from Entacmaea quadricolor, does not affect Bcl-xL expression, suggesting that cytotoxic mechanisms of RFP from different species may be varied. Our results reveal a possible mechanism for the cytotoxicity of DsRed, providing a potential strategy to improve the application of DsRed and its variants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-lymphocytes 3acytotoxicity 3afluorescent proteins 3aimage analysis 3amutants 3atranslation (genetics)1 aLin, Jian1 aZhou, Cuihong1 aDeng, Xiaoyan1 aXia, Bin0 tFEBS letters.g2011 Mar. 9, v. 585, no. 5 p.821-827dElsevier B.V.x0014-57937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2011.02.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02657naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245010300160300002000263520153100283592002801814650000801842650001001850650002001860650002401880650001901904650001101923653002101934653002201955653001801977653001901995653001702014700001902031700001902050773012502069856008002194852000902274655001202283IND60528926020221118160335.0160717e20160518xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052892602DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b032172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Gun Ho10aPolymeric Inverse Glasses for Development of Noniridescent Structural Colors in Full Visible Range  ap. 12473-12480.  aAmorphous colloidal array with short-range order displays noniridescent structural colors due to the isotropic nature of the colloidal arrangement. The low angle dependence renders the colloidal glasses, which is promising for various coloration applications. Nevertheless, the colloidal glasses are difficult to develop red structural color due to strong cavity-like resonance from individual particles in the blue region. To suppress the cavity mode and develop the colors in the full visible range, we prepare inverse glasses composed of amorphous array of air cavities with short-range order. To produce the structures in a simple and reproducible manner, monodisperse silica particles are dispersed in a photocurable resin of poly(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate (PEGDMA) at a volume fraction of 0.3. The particles spontaneously form the amorphous array with short-range order, which is rapidly captured in polymeric films by photopolymerization of the resin. Selective removal of silica particles from the polymerized resin leaves behind amorphous array of air cavities. The inverse glasses display structural colors with negligible backscattering in blue due to short optical path and low index in each cavity. Therefore, the colors can be tuned in full visible range by simply controlling the cavity size. The photocurable suspensions of silica particles can be patterned by photolithography, which enables the production of freestanding films containing patterned inverse glasses with noniridescent structural colors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acolor 3aethylene glycol 3apolyethylene glycol 3apolymerization 3asilica 0astructural color 0ashort-range order 0ainverse glass 0anoniridescence 0amicropattern1 aSim, Jae Young1 aKim, Shin-Hyun0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2016 May 18, v. 8, no. 19 p.12473-12480dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b032173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02576naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245008100172300001600253520139100269592002801660650001201688650001901700650001201719650001601731650000901747650001301756650002201769650003001791650001601821650001901837650001601856700002201872700002101894700002401915700002401939773012401963856008202087852000902169655001202178IND60590073120221116181506.0180619e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059007312DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-017-3650-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShonk, JonathanK. P.10aIdentifying causes of Western Pacific ITCZ drift in ECMWF System 4 hindcasts  ap. 939-954.  aThe development of systematic biases in climate models used in operational seasonal forecasting adversely affects the quality of forecasts they produce. In this study, we examine the initial evolution of systematic biases in the ECMWF System 4 forecast model, and isolate aspects of the model simulations that lead to the development of these biases. We focus on the tendency of the simulated intertropical convergence zone in the western equatorial Pacific to drift northwards by between 0.5° and 3° of latitude depending on season. Comparing observations with both fully coupled atmosphere–ocean hindcasts and atmosphere-only hindcasts (driven by observed sea-surface temperatures), we show that the northward drift is caused by a cooling of the sea-surface temperature on the Equator. The cooling is associated with anomalous easterly wind stress and excessive evaporation during the first twenty days of hindcast, both of which occur whether air-sea interactions are permitted or not. The easterly wind bias develops immediately after initialisation throughout the lower troposphere; a westerly bias develops in the upper troposphere after about 10 days of hindcast. At this point, the baroclinic structure of the wind bias suggests coupling with errors in convective heating, although the initial wind bias is barotropic in structure and appears to have an alternative origin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate models 3acooling 3aevaporation 3aheat 3alatitude 3asimulation models 3asurface water temperature 3atroposphere 3awind direction 3awind stress1 aGuilyardi, Éric,1 aToniazzo, Thomas1 aWoolnough, StevenJ.1 aStockdale, Francis,0 tClimate dynamics.g2018 Feb., v. 50, no. 3-4 p.939-954dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3895934x0930-75757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-017-3650-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02913naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005700139245011300196300001400309500001900323500002000342520141000362592002801772596004001800650001801840650001301858650001901871650003001890650001201920650002301932650001401955650001301969650001601982650001101998650002102009650001902030650001902049650001002068650001702078650001002095700006702105700005402172773013502226856007302361852000902434655001202443IND60724058720221118082801.0210120e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072405872DNAL7 a10.1111/jac.124422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShokat, Sajid1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2736-870810aImpact of elevated CO2 on two contrasting wheat genotypes exposed to intermediate drought stress at anthesis  ap. 20-33.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe objective of this experiment was to investigate the responses of contrasting wheat genotypes to drought stress under ambient and elevated CO₂ environments. At anthesis, the plants from each CO₂ levels were either exposed to progressive drought or well‐watered at 95% of pot holding capacity. The results showed that for both genotypes, CO₂ elevation sensitized the plants’ response to soil drying in terms of reduction of evapotranspiration. Drought significantly reduced trans‐zeatin (tZ) concentration in leaves, salicylic acid (SA) concentration in spikes, and physiological and yield‐related traits. However, the concentration of abscisic acid (ABA) and other phytohormones was increased under drought, which coincided with an increase in the kernel abortion. Elevated CO₂ significantly increased photosynthetic rate, but had no significant effect on yield‐related traits. Genotype L₃ possessed higher concentration of leaf tz, osmotic potential, and spike SA/ABA ratio under combined drought and elevated CO₂ as compared to genotype L₂. L₃ also had higher thousand kernel weight (TKW) and grain yield in comparison to L₂. The results indicate that elevated CO₂ is not necessarily increasing yield, and biophysiochemical traits in L₃ could be used as valuable selecting criteria to obtain higher TKW and grain yield in future drier and CO₂‐enriched environment.  aPublisher supplied data  a36/114153cIslamic Development Bank 3aabscisic acid 3aagronomy 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3adrought 3aevapotranspiration 3aflowering 3agenotype 3agrain yield 3aleaves 3aosmotic pressure 3aphotosynthesis 3asalicylic acid 3aseeds 3awater stress 3awheat1 aGroßkinsky, Dominik K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8976-10571 aLiu, Fulai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5006-89650 tJournal of agronomy and crop science.g2021 Feb., v. 207, no. 1 p.20-33dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57791x0931-22507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jac.124423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01953naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245013200159300001800291520082500309592002801134650001101162650001401173650001501187650001101202650002501213650001101238650001401249650003501263700001401298700001801312700002001330700001801350773014001368856007401508852000901582655001201591IND60641707420221119033941.0190506e20160105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064170742DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ta08806b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Gwang-Hee10aStable high-areal-capacity nanoarchitectured germanium anodes on three-dimensional current collectors for Li ion microbatteries  ap. 1060-1067.  aIt is of great significance to improve the areal capacity of Li ion microbatteries in pursuit of high-end medical and RFID products and technologies.

In addition, an excellent rate capability of 1.25 mA h cm⁻² (calculated gravimetric capacity of 685 mA h g⁻¹) at a current density of 5 mA cm⁻² could be achieved using these synergistically fabricated Ge-na/Cu NN electrodes, making them potential electrodes for Li ion microbatteries with large energy and power densities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3achemistry 3acollectors 3acopper 3acopper nanoparticles 3aenergy 3agermanium 3aradio frequency identification1 aLee, Seun1 aLee, Chan Woo1 aChoi, Changhoon1 aKim, Dong-Wan0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2016 Jan. 5, v. 4, no. 3 p.1060-1067dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ta08806b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03034naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011200163300001800275520207400293592002802367650001002395650001102405650001702416650001102433650002102444700001902465700002002484700002102504773010502525856008102630852000902711655001202720IND60120809020221120191113.0150211e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012080902DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-013-7828-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartin, A.,10aPolyethyleneimine-functionalized large pore ordered silica materials for poorly water-soluble drug delivery  ap. 1437-1447.  aFour ordered mesoporous silica supports with different pore structure characteristics were investigated for their drug loading and release abilities with regard to their structural variabilities as well as implications of surface modification. The (model) drug molecule in question was the poorly water-soluble glucocorticoid Prednisolone, composed of a steroid skeleton with functional groups in the form of carbonyls and hydroxyls. Under non-aqueous conditions, such as those applied for drug loading, these functional groups are expected to interact with the surface silanols of the silica supports, but this interaction could possibly also be enhanced by introducing amino groups to the silica surfaces. Thus, all four supports were further functionalized by surface hyperbranching of polyethyleneimine), PEI, which was successfully incorporated to all supports in high amounts (>30 wt%). However, the accessibility of the pore system after organic modification was dependent on the pore sizes and structures, highlighting the importance of using large-pore mesophases with adequate structures when aiming for applications involving (bulky) guest molecules. Additionally, after incorporation of large amounts of guest molecules (40 wt%), full water accessibility was retained in that the loaded cargo could be rapidly released from the carrier matrixes, which is a crucial requirement when formulating poorly soluble substances. Results displayed that the release of Prednisolone from the silica supports occurred faster than the dissolution of the pure drug. All silica materials released more than 85 % of the adsorbed drug in 5 h, independently of the support material. Thus, the confinement of Prednisolone inside the mesopores seems to be the main reason for the faster kinetic release rate. These constraints imply that Prednisolone becomes more mobile inside the pores, and therefore more soluble in release medium. These results confirm the potential of silica supports as drug delivery carriers for drugs with limited water solubility such as steroids.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrugs 3amodels 3aprednisolone 3asilica 3awater solubility1 aGarcía, R.

We have presented the synthesis and study of photophysical properties of type-II CdS/ZnSe core/crown NPLs, where electron-wave function is confined to CdS core, while hole wave function resides in ZnSe crown. The recombination of the photogenerated excitons in CdS and ZnSe occurs across the interface of both semiconductors and due to which the emission shows a red shift of ∼100 nm. The lifetime of CdS/ZnSe increases almost two orders of magnitude in comparison with the core CdS NPLs. The fast decaying excited states of the NPLs are distributed over the CdS/ZnSe interface and slow down; the larger lifetimes allow for their potential utilization in applications requiring charge separation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aemissions 3ananoparticles 3aphysical chemistry 3asemiconductors1 aAjīta Siṅgha,1 aSapra, Sameer0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2017 Dec. 07, v. 121, no. 48 p.27241-27246dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.7b103263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01807naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245006500157300002000222520073500242592002800977650001701005650001501022650001301037650001201050650001401062650001701076650001101093650002201104700001901126700001601145700001701161700001701178700001901195773013501214856007501349852000901424655001201433IND60538665120221119025453.0160815e20120926xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053866512DNAL7 a10.1021/ja30639252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Lin-Bing10aConfinement of Metal–Organic Polyhedra in Silica Nanopores  ap. 15923-15928.  aMetal–organic polyhedra (MOPs) have been incorporated into silica nanopores for the first time.

A typical mesoporous silica, SBA-15, with a two-dimensional hexagonal pore regularity was used as the host. In comparison with bulk MOPs, which prefer to aggregate, MOPs confined in silica nanopores can be well dispersed, making the active sites and pores in the MOPs accessible. These dispersed MOPs showed apparently superior H₂ adsorption capacity in comparison with aggregated bulk MOPs. Moreover, the thermal stability of the MOPs was enhanced upon their confinement in silica nanopores.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3aadsorption 3ahydrogen 3aligands 3ananopores 3aporous media 3asilica 3athermal stability1 aLi, Jian Rong,1 aLu, Weigang1 aGu, Zhi-Yuan1 aLuo, Zhiping1 aZhou, Hong-Cai0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2012 Sept. 26, v. 134, no. 38 p.15923-15928dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja30639253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03091naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245021600165520140000381592002801781650003401809650001101843650002501854650003701879650001801916650001701934650002101951650001101972650001501983650001101998650001402009650001602023650001702039650004702056650001802103650001102121650001102132650002002143650001302163650002302176650001602199650001302215650002502228650001002253650001202263651001702275700001902292700002302311773012402334856008202458852000902540655001202549IND60646844420221122050004.0190614e20170314xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064684442DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture70300242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHilou, Adama10aPhytochemistry and Agro-Industrial Potential of Native Oilseeds from West Africa: African Grape (<em>Lannea microcarpa</em>), Marula (<em>Sclerocarya birrea</em>), and Butter Tree (<em>Pentadesma butyracea</em>)  aEthnobotanical investigations on local oilseed species in Burkina Faso revealed that oils from tree oilseeds are frequently used for food, cosmetics and traditional medicine by local people. To test the bio-preservative capacity, the effect of the oilseed extracts on the stabilization of Shea butter was evaluated. Levels of bioactive phyto-components were evaluated through several methods. Some aspects of the quality of oilcakes were evaluated based on their inhibitory capacity on the endogenous digestive enzymes of cattle. For fat stabilizing quality, the extract from Lannea microcarpa Engl. &amp; K. Krause has showed the largest increase (91.47%) in the Rancimat induction time (TIR) of Shea butter. Using DPPH and FRAP methods for prevention or scavenging of free radicals, the results evidenced the highest activity with extracts of L. microcarpa. With respect to the feed quality of the oilcakes, the IC<inf>50</inf> obtained with α-amylase and trypsin have showed that the ethanolic extracts of Pentadesma butyracea Sabine (1824) is less toxic for cattle. These results suggest that phenolic compounds extracted from these native oilseeds, especially those of Lannea microcarpa, can be used as biological antioxidants for bio-preservation of edible fats. In addition, the by-products of the oil-extraction can be valorized as nontoxic and protein-rich oilcakes for livestock feed.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aLannea 3aPentadesma butyracea 3aSclerocarya birrea subsp. caffra 3aalpha-amylase 3aantioxidants 3abiopreservatives 3abutter 3abyproducts 3acattle 3acosmetics 3aethnobotany 3afeed quality 3afluorescence recovery after photobleaching 3afree radicals 3agrapes 3alipids 3alivestock feeds 3aoilseeds 3aplant biochemistry 3ashea butter 3atoxicity 3atraditional medicine 3atrees 3atrypsin 3aBurkina Faso1 aBougma, Adjima1 aDicko, Mamoudou H.0 tAgriculture.g2017 Mar. 14, v. 7, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture70300243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02596naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002200189245015100211300001800362506007600380520120800456592002801664506003701692650001601729650000901745650001101754650002301765650001801788650002001806650000701826650002001833650002401853650001201877650000901889700006601898773013101964856008202095852000902177655001202186IND60689369420221207101051.0200421e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068936942DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-019-04208-42doi7 aPMC71710212pmcid7 a323277862pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKononiuk, Anna D.10aComparison of the effect of freeze-dried acid whey on physicochemical properties of organic fermented sausages made from beef and fallow deer meat  ap. 1753-1762.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe objective of this study was to compare the effect of freeze-dried acid whey on physicochemical properties and microbial changes of organic fermented sausages made from beef and fallow deer meat.

At the end of processing fallow deer sausages were characterised by the lower pH (4.79 ± 0.01–4.90 ± 0.02 for fallow deer and 5.04 ± 0.00–5.25 ± 0.03 for beef sausages) and the content of 2-thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (1.54 ± 0.09–2.81 ± 0.23 and 1.64 ± 0.15–5.06 ± 0.25 respectively) than sausages made from beef meat. In conclusion, the addition of freeze-dried acid whey in varying amounts did not significantly affect the physicochemical characteristics of sausages from both fallow deer and beef. However, further research is needed to compare the effect of acid whey on the nutritional values of raw fermented sausages from fallow deer and beef.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCervus dama 3abeef 3afallow 3afermented sausages 3afreeze drying 3anutritive value 3apH 3aprocessing time 3athiobarbituric acid 3avenison 3awhey1 aKarwowska, Małgorzata1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7206-97150 tJournal of food science and technology.g2020 May, v. 57, no. 5 p.1753-1762dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl16929x0022-11557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-019-04208-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02476naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245009500170300001400265520097000279592002801249650002601277650001001303650002301313650001901336650001901355650001101374650002601385650002001411650001801431650002301449650001501472650001101487650002401498650001701522650001101539650001701550650001201567653001701579653001901596653004001615653004001655653002601695700002401721700002601745773010701771856008301878852000901961655001201970IND60581948820221119025126.0190417e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058194882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fpsl.2017.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEdelenbos, Merete10aSeasonal variation in color and texture of packaged wild rocket (Diplotaxis tenuifolia L.)  ap. 46-51.  aWild rocket (Diplotaxis tenuifolia L.) is sold year round and different raw material qualities are packaged. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of growing season on quality of packaged wild rocket stored for 3 week at 5°C or for 1 week at 20°C to mimic the supply chain for unwashed, packaged wild rocket. Quality was determined by multispectral imaging at 570nm (color) and 780nm (texture). Data from multispectral analysis showed that green color was better preserved in the spring than in the late summer and that texture i.e. dry leaves that sprinkled upon touch, was better preserved in the later summer than in the spring. Wild rocket stored at low temperature remained greener for longer than at high temperature, and short storage time preserved the texture better than long storage time. Multispectral imaging is a useful tool for quality control of wild rocket to better manage stocks and meet the priorities of potential customers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDiplotaxis tenuifolia 3acolor 3aconsumers (people) 3afood packaging 3agrowing season 3aleaves 3amultispectral imagery 3aquality control 3araw materials 3aseasonal variation 3ashelf life 3aspring 3astorage temperature 3astorage time 3asummer 3asupply chain 3atexture 0aLeafy greens 0aGrowing season 0aModified atmosphere packaging (MAP) 0aOxygen (O2) transmission rate (OTR) 0aMultispectral imaging1 aLøkke, Mette Marie1 aSeefeldt, Helene Fast0 tFood packaging and shelf life.g2017 Dec., v. 14 p.46-51dElsevier LtdwJournal:23300x2214-28947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fpsl.2017.08.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02751naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100007200189245012600261300001800387506007600405520102700481592002801508596009501536506003701631650002401668650002501692650003601717650002101753650001301774650001001787650001901797650001901816650001001835650001301845650001201858650002001870700002201890700002501912700002701937700002501964700002501989700002102014773013102035856008202166852000902248655001202257IND60689369520221207101106.0200421e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068936952DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-019-04206-62doi7 aPMC71710232pmcid7 a323277842pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuhammad, Dimas Rahadian Aji1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6551-581210aAntioxidant activity and quality attributes of white chocolate incorporated with Cinnamomum burmannii Blume essential oil  ap. 1731-1739.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWhite chocolate is often considered as an unhealthy product with low phenolic content and antioxidant activity since it does not contain cocoa liquor. In this study, investigation on the phytochemical composition of cinnamon essential oil as well as its potential use to improve the antioxidant activity of white chocolate were carried out. The effect of the essential oil incorporation on the quality attributes of white chocolate was also examined. The results show that cinnamon essential oil was rich in cinnamaldehyde and exhibited antioxidant activity. The incorporation of cinnamon essential oil at a level of 0.1% (w/w) increased the antioxidant activity of the white chocolate more than twofold without significant effect on its hardness, melting properties and colour. However, a slight alteration on the flow behaviour of the white chocolate was observed. This study clearly shows that natural cinnamon essential oil could be an alternative to synthetic additives in foods to improve their antioxidant activity.  aPublisher supplied data  a2019cto the Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education, Republic of Indonesia0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCinnamomum burmanni 3aantioxidant activity 3achemical constituents of plants 3achocolate liquor 3acinnamon 3acolor 3aessential oils 3afood additives 3afoods 3ahardness 3amelting 3awhite chocolate1 aLemarcq, Valérie1 aAlderweireldt, Elien1 aVanoverberghe, Pauline1 aPraseptiangga, Danar1 aJuvinal, Joel Garcia1 aDewettinck, Koen0 tJournal of food science and technology.g2020 May, v. 57, no. 5 p.1731-1739dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl16929x0022-11557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-019-04206-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02647naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003200113040001800145100001900163245014800182300001600330520122600346592002801572650001301600650001201613650001401625650001101639650002301650650002301673650001701696650001501713650001401728650001301742650002301755650002301778650002201801650002201823650002701845650004101872651001001913700002301923700002401946700002501970700001801995773009802013856004502111852000902156655001202165IND50074019220221118192533.0140315e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007401922DNAL7 a244209112pmid7 a10.1002/jssc.2013012782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManzano, Pilar10aComprehensive two‐dimensional gas chromatography coupled with static headspace sampling to analyze volatile compounds: Application to almonds  ap. 675-683.  aThe hyphenation of static headspace sampling with comprehensive 2D GC equipped with a modulator based on capillary flow technology and a flame ionization detector was used to separate and identify 43 representative target volatile compounds (light hydrocarbons, carbonyls, pyrazines, alcohols, furans, and benzenes) frequently detected in the roasting process of nuts. Five column combinations with differing degrees of orthogonality (one conventional and four inverted phase sets) were tested in order to obtain the best conditions for analyzing these volatile compounds. Optimization of the working conditions for each of the different column combinations was performed by means of a central composite design. The best results in terms of separation and differentiation among the different chemical groups were achieved with a combination of inverted phase columns (first dimension: highly polar, INNOWax; second dimension: mid‐polar, ZB‐35). Additionally, a reference template was developed to provide an effective and rapid analysis of the target compounds. Finally, the proposed method was successfully employed to identify volatile compounds in raw and roasted almond samples from the Spanish cultivar Largueta.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3aalmonds 3acultivars 3afurans 3agas chromatography 3aheadspace analysis 3ahydrocarbons 3aionization 3apyrazines 3aroasting 3avolatile compounds 3aworking conditions 2aMass Spectrometry 2aPrunusxchemistry 2aLythraceaexchemistry. 2aVolatile Organic Compoundsxanalysis 0aSpain1 aDiego, Juan Carlos1 aBernal, José Luis,1 aNozal, María Jesús1 aBernal, José0 tJournal of separation science.g2014 Mar., v. 37, no. 6 p.675-683dWiley-VCHx1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.201301278  aDNAL 7aarticle01660naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245009900158300002000257520059900277592002800876650002500904650001400929650001500943650001300958700001700971700001200988700002401000700002201024700001901046700001701065700002001082773012501102856007401227852000901301655001201310IND60750042120221120035027.0210910e20210818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075004212DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ra04733g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoinkis, Nina10aAssembly of iron oxide nanosheets at the air–water interface by leucine–histidine peptides  ap. 27965-27968.  aThe fabrication of inorganic nanomaterials is important for a wide range of disciplines.

Our dielectric relaxation, Raman scattering, and high-frequency EPR measurements on the M₃–ₓ(NH₄)ₓCr(O₂)₄ family clarify this mechanism. At 295 K, (NH₄)₃Cr(O₂)₄ is tetragonal (I4̅2m), with the NH₄⁺ ions occupying two distinctly different sites, N1 and N2. A ferroelectric transition at Tc₁ = 250 K is revealed by λ-type anomalies in Cₚ and dielectric constant, and lowering of symmetry to Cmc2(1). Below Tc₁, the N1 sites lose their tetrahedral symmetry and thus polarization develops. Raman detection of translational modes involving the NH₄⁺ ions around 193 cm–¹ supports this model. EPR around Tc₁ revealed that the [Cr(O₂)₄]³– ions reorient by about 10°. A minor peak at Tc₂ ≈ 207 K is attributed to a short-range ordering that culminates in a long-range, structural order at Tc₃ ≈ 137 K. At Tc₃, the symmetry is lowered to P1 with significant changes in the cell parameters. Rb⁺ and Cs⁺ substitutions that block the N1 and N2 sites selectively show that Tc₁ is related to the torsional motion of the N1 site, while Tc₂ and Tc₃ are governed by the motional slowing down of the N2 site. These data show that the multiferroic behavior of this family is governed by the rotational and translational dynamics of the NH₄⁺ ions and is tunable by their controlled substitutions. Relevance to other classes of possible multiferroics is pointed out.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aammonium compounds 3acesium 3achromium 3aferrimagnetic materials 3aions 3amodels 3aoxygen 3apotassium 3arubidium 3asuperoxide anion 3atranslation (genetics)1 aClark, Ronald

Using an information-theoretical approach, we sought to model yearly variation in the size of newly infested areas and dispersal distance. Maximum dispersal distances were best modeled by spring and winter precipitation 2 years before detection, and infestation size the year prior. Infestation size was best modeled by infestation size and spring precipitation the year prior. In our interpretation, there is a 2-year delay between the introduction of inoculum and onset of mortality for a majority of sites. The year-long gap in between allows ample time for the production of inoculum contributing to the spread of P. ramorum. This is supported by epidemic development following changes in eradication protocols precipitated by an outbreak in 2011, attributable to a 2009 treatment delay and an uncharacteristically wet spring in 2010. Posteradication, we have observed an increase in the total area of new outbreaks and increased frequency in dispersal distances greater than 4 km. Although the eradication program has not eliminated P. ramorum from Oregon forests, it has likely moderated this epidemic, emphasizing the need for prompt treatment of future invasive forest pathogens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhytophthora ramorum 3adeath 3aepidemiology 3aforests 3ainoculum 3amortality 3apathogens 3aspring 3aOregon1 aHansen, Everett M.1 aKanaskie, Alan0 tPhytopathology.g2015 July, v. 105, no. 7 p.937-946dPhytopathologywJournal:jnl44575x0031-949X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-12-14-0348-FI3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02871naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100006900189245008600258300001800344506007600362520128100438592002801719596007001747506003701817650002201854650002001876650001501896650002301911650001401934650001101948650002501959650001201984650001501996650002302011650002302034650001602057650001302073650002202086651001002108700002302118700002602141773013102167856008202298852000902380655001202389IND60689369720221207101109.0200421e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068936972DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-019-04203-92doi7 aPMC71710002pmcid7 a323277812pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWahengbam, Elizabeth Devi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8521-004410aDrying characteristics of ready-to-eat komal chawal rice: processing and modeling  ap. 1698-1709.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA traditional ready-to-eat rice from Assam, India, known as komal chawal is produced by steaming of steeped chokuwa paddy, which is a low-amylose variety, and by drying the steamed paddy under shade as a measure of controlling the drying rate for sustenance of a quick rehydration quality. As an improvement over this traditional method in terms of production time, komal chawal is produced by parboiling the chokuwa brown rice with model predicted soaking and steaming conditions. Thin-layer drying behavior of the steamed brown rice was studied at drying temperatures of 40−60 °C, at an air velocity of 1 m/s. Among different thin-layer drying models, Page equation fitted best to the drying data, with the coefficient of determination (R²) and root mean square error as the measures for selection of the best fitted model. While the moisture diffusivity values were in the range of 2.08 × 10⁻¹⁰–3.34 × 10⁻¹⁰ m²/s, the effects of drying air temperature on the drying rate was modeled with an activation energy of 20.44 kJ/mol for an the Arrhenius kind of temperature dependence of diffusivity. Based on the effects of drying temperature on rehydration, textural, and pasting properties of the product a lower drying temperature is recommended.  aPublisher supplied data  aF./2014-15/NFO-2014-15-OBC-MAN-2860cUniversity Grants Commission0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aactivation energy 3aair temperature 3abrown rice 3adrying temperature 3aequations 3amodels 3amoisture diffusivity 3apaddies 3aparboiling 3apasting properties 3aready-to-eat foods 3arehydration 3asteaming 3athin-layer drying 3aIndia1 aTongbram, Thoithoi1 aHazarika, Manuj Kumar0 tJournal of food science and technology.g2020 May, v. 57, no. 5 p.1698-1709dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl16929x0022-11557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-019-04203-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02988naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245015600168300001400324520150700338592002801845650002201873650000801895650001301903650001301916650001001929650001301939650001901952650001501971650001401986650001902000650001102019650002402030650001502054650001702069650001602086650001602102650001602118653002002134653004002154653002602194653000802220653001502228700002002243700002002263773010702283856008302390852000902473655001202482IND60581949020221120143042.0190417e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058194902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fpsl.2017.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGholami, Rashid10aShelf life extension of white mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus) by low temperatures conditioning, modified atmosphere, and nanocomposite packaging material  ap. 88-95.  aIn this work, we have explored a new integrated approach for the shelf life extension of button mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus). The effect of temperature (4°C and 25°C), packaging configuration (PET/coating/LLDPE oxygen barrier material over conventional PVC stretchable film), and modified atmosphere (15% O2/5% CO2/80% N2 over air) were monitored during 10days of storage. The influence of a chitosan coating deposited on the cap surface was also investigated. Temperature was the most important factor in preserving the quality attributes of mushrooms over time. The test material had a positive impact on weight loss, cap opening percentage, and firmness of mushrooms compared with the control film (∼1.0% versus ∼7.1%; ∼55% versus ∼65%; and ∼10.3N versus ∼7.6N, respectively), which was ascribed to the excellent and good oxygen and water vapor barrier properties of the new material, respectively. Mushrooms packaged under the modified atmosphere behaved decidedly better after a prolonged storage time of 22days at 4°C. Impressively, after this extended temporal window, the mushrooms looked freshly packed by fully recovering their original color. We explained this striking observation in consideration of the oxygen that permeated the package during these additional 12days of storage, which would have promoted a gradual resumption of respiratory activity in the overall metabolism of the mushrooms after the “freezing” effect of the rich-CO2 atmosphere inside the package.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgaricus bisporus 3aair 3achitosan 3acoatings 3acolor 3afirmness 3afood packaging 3ametabolism 3amushrooms 3ananocomposites 3aoxygen 3apackaging materials 3ashelf life 3astorage time 3atemperature 3awater vapor 3aweight loss 0aButton mushroom 0aModified atmosphere packaging (MAP) 0aNanocomposite coating 0aPVC 0aShelf life1 aAhmadi, Ebrahim1 aFarris, Stefano0 tFood packaging and shelf life.g2017 Dec., v. 14 p.88-95dElsevier LtdwJournal:23300x2214-28947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fpsl.2017.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03900naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245010500164300001800269500001500287520247200302592002802774650001402802650000902816650002502825650002102850650001502871650002002886650001102906650001802917650002102935650002502956650002402981650001803005650001203023650000903035650001903044650002603063650001803089650001203107650002503119653001503144700001403159700001403173700001603187700001503203773010703218856004803325852000903373655001203382IND4470881820221121223254.0120727e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447088182DNAL7 a10.1007/s11368-011-0429-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Chunsheng10aComparison of phosphorus fractions and alkaline phosphatase activity in sludge, soils, and sediments  ap. 1432-1439.  a2019-12-06  aPURPOSE: The land application or disposal of sewage sludge generally leads to phosphorus (P) loss in aquatic environments and often results in eutrophication. The nature of P fractions plays a key role in the transport of P within the environment, and alkaline phosphatase is important for the transformation of the P fractions. The objective of this study was to assess the P fractions and alkaline phosphatase activity in sewage sludge, soils, and sediments, in order to effectively evaluate their P bioavailability and mobility. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Standards, Measurements and Testing (SMT) harmonized procedure was adopted for the determination of the P fractions. The alkaline phosphatase activities were determined by analyzing the production of p-nitrophenol from p-nitrophenylphosphate catalyzed by phosphatase in the various samples. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The results demonstrated that sewage sludge possessed larger amounts of P than soils and sediments. Inorganic phosphorus (IP) was the main P fraction of all the samples investigated and it always constituted >70% of the total P (TP). However, the distribution of IP between non-apatite inorganic P (NAIP) and apatite P (AP) varied significantly according to the type of sample. NAIP accounted for >60% of IP in sediment and sewage sludge samples obtained from domestic wastewater treatment plants. However, AP was more abundant than NAIP in soil samples. For the P fractions obtained in a closed agriculture test field, NAIP content showed an obvious increase from soil to sediment samples. This suggests that NAIP is the most easily mobilizable form of P. The average alkaline phosphatase activity in sewage sludge samples is significantly higher than that in soil and sediment samples, and it may be closely attributed to the higher biomass content in sewage samples. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that the SMT protocol could be considered a useful tool for P monitoring of sewage sludge, soils, and sediments. The NAIP is the most easily mobilizable form of P and should receive further attention. The sewage sludge samples contain higher mobilizable forms of P and alkaline phosphatase activity than soil and sediment samples. The results are not only beneficial for analyzing P in sewage, soil, and sediment samples during their transfers to watercourses but are also beneficial for evaluating the risk of eutrophication and that associated with sewage sludge treatment and application.  aPublisher supplied data 3asediments 3arisk 3ainorganic phosphorus 3aland application 3amonitoring 3abioavailability 3asewage 3asewage sludge 3asewage treatment 3awastewater treatment 3aaquatic environment 3ap-nitrophenol 3aapatite 3asoil 3aeutrophication 3afield experimentation 3asoil sampling 3abiomass 3aalkaline phosphatase 0aphosphorus1 aTang, Jie1 aZhao, Jie1 aWu, Donglei1 aXu, Xinhua0 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2011 Dec., v. 11, no. 8 p.1432-1439dSpringer-Verlagx1439-01087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-011-0429-1  aDNAL 7aarticle02992naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245009600159300001600255520171200271592002801983650002002011650002302031650001202054650001702066650001002083650001302093650002402106650001302130650001302143650001102156650001802167650001602185650002102201650001402222650001902236650001102255700001802266700002102284700001902305773013902324856007402463852000902537655001202546IND60641708220221119033721.0190506e20151215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064170822DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ta08873a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRai, Prabhakar10aRole of Pd nanoparticles in gas sensing behaviour of Pd@In₂O₃ yolk–shell nanoreactors  ap. 264-269.  aPd@In₂O₃ yolk–shell nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized by a simple solution route using Pd@C core–shell NPs as template and applied for gas sensing. A glucose-assisted hydrothermal method was used for the synthesis of Pd@C core–shell NPs. Pd@In₂O₃ yolk–shell NPs were formed after calcination (450 °C for 3h) of Pd@C core–shell NPs containing indium precursor. In the Pd@In₂O₃ yolk–shell geometry, about 50–70 nm Pd NPs were present at the periphery of an In₂O₃ shell (10–20 nm thickness). The In₂O₃ shell was composed of ∼10 nm primary particles. The role of Pd NPs in gas sensing behavior of In₂O₃ has been investigated. The loading of In₂O₃ with Pd NPs improved the response for reducing gases, but reduced the response for oxidizing gases. The response of Pd@In₂O₃ yolk–shell NPs to ethanol was approximately 14 times higher than that of pure In₂O₃ hollow nanospheres at 350 °C. However, no response was recorded for NO₂ for Pd@In₂O₃ as compared to In₂O₃ (resistance ratio Rₛ = 2.50) at 350 °C. The maximum response of Pd@In₂O₃ yolk–shell NPs to 5 ppm ethanol was 159.02 at 350 °C, which was approximately 2.5 times higher than those for other interfering gases (NO₂, p-xylene, trimethylamine, HCHO, CO and H₂). The effect of humidity on the gas sensing characteristics of Pd@In₂O₃ yolk–shell NPs suggested that the present sensor can be used to detect ppm-level ethanol even in highly humid atmosphere (80% RH). The improved gas sensing performance of Pd@In₂O₃ yolk–shell NPs was attributed to catalytic activity of Pd NPs as well as hollow spaces that allowed the accessibility of Pd NPs to gas molecules.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon monoxide 3acatalytic activity 3aethanol 3aformaldehyde 3agases 3ageometry 3ahot water treatment 3ahumidity 3ahydrogen 3aindium 3ananoparticles 3ananospheres 3anitrogen dioxide 3apalladium 3atrimethylamine 3axylene1 aYoon, Ji-Wook1 aKwak, Chang-Hoon1 aLee, Jong-Heun0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2015 Dec. 15, v. 4, no. 1 p.264-269dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ta08873a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02376naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002500142245009300167300001600260520120900276592002801485650001501513650001401528650002001542650002101562650002301583650001001606650001601616650001501632650001201647650001801659650001001677650002201687650001801709651001201727700002101739773013301760856007601893852000901969655001201978IND60687017020221119091609.0200324e20200303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068701702DNAL7 a10.1656/045.027.01092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalanchuk, J.

Our study represents a previously under-explored opportunity to evaluate various breeding-season characteristics for ducks using both natural and artificial nest cavities in the same forested stand in the northeastern US. Overall use (72.5% vs. 14.5%) and nest-success rates (48.3% vs. 0.0%) were greater in artificial nest boxes but so was nest parasitism (62.1% vs. 0.0%). In addition, Aix sponsa (Wood Duck) were the only species using artificial nest boxes consistently even though this region represents a rare location in North America where they coexist with Lophodytes cucullatus (Hooded Merganser) and Bucephala clangula (Common Goldeneye), which are also cavity-nesting obligates. We found many (n = 35) unused available tree cavities over 2 years, and thus it is unlikely nest site availability is a limiting factor for population growth of cavity nesting ducks at Missisquoi NWR. Future research efforts should try to determine the factors affecting nest-cavity selection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAix sponsa 3aBucephala 3abreeding season 3abrood parasitism 3aconservation areas 3aducks 3afloodplains 3anest boxes 3anesting 3anesting sites 3anests 3apopulation growth 3atree cavities 3aVermont1 aStraub, Jacob N.0 tNortheastern naturalist.g2020 Mar. 3, v. 27, no. 1 p.115-124dHumboldt Field Research InstitutewJournal:19634x1092-61947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1656/045.027.01093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01843naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245008500161300002000246520099100266592002801257650003001285650001401315650001501329700002501344773012501369856007401494852000901568655001201577IND60750042520221120230802.0210910e20210817xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075004252DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ra04876g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMakkar, Priyanka12aA review on the use of DFT for the prediction of the properties of nanomaterials  ap. 27897-27924.  aNanostructured materials have gained immense attraction because of their extraordinary properties compared to the bulk materials to be used in a plethora of applications in myriad fields. In this review article, we have discussed how the Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculation can be used to explain some of the properties of nanomaterials. With some specific examples here, it has been shown that how closely the different properties of nanomaterials (such as optical, optoelectronics, catalytic and magnetic) predicted by DFT calculations match well with the experimentally determined values. Some examples were discussed in detail to inspire the experimental scientists to conduct DFT-based calculations along with the experiments to derive a better understanding of the experimentally obtained results as well as to predict the properties of the nanomaterial.

At the same time, it can be flexible and is modulated by multiple external and internal factors. This review focuses on how physiological state, behavioural context and social experience impact sexual circuits in the two sexes. We discuss how females tune receptivity and other behaviours depending on mating status and how males adjust courtship intensity based on sexual satiety, age and the conflicting drive for aggression. Neuronal mechanisms for behavioural modulation include changes in sensory and central processing. Activity of modulatory neurons can enhance, suppress or reverse the behavioural response to sensory cues. In summary, fly sexual behaviour is an excellent model to study mechanisms of neuromodulation of complex innate behaviour on the circuit level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aaggression 3acourtship 3afemales 3ainsects 3amales 3amodels 3aneurons 3aphysiological state 3asatiety1 avon Philipsborn, Anne C0 tCurrent opinion in insect science.g2017 Dec., v. 24 p.21-28dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23301x2214-57457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cois.2017.08.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02619naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003200135040001800167100001600185245010900201300001200310506007600322520134500398592002801743506003701771650001501808650001001823650002601833650001001859650003501869650001301904650001401917650002401931650002401955650001101979650001401990650002002004700002302024773009602047856004502143852000902188655001202197IND50061983920221207141900.0130324e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006198392DNAL7 a226245982pmid7 aPMC35338192pmcid7 a10.1186/1743-7075-9-462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLands, Bill10aUsing 3–6 differences in essential fatty acids rather than 3/6 ratios gives useful food balance scores  ap. 480.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The vitamin-like omega-3 and omega-6 essential fatty acids are converted in the body to a large family of hormones which act at selective receptors that occur on nearly every cell and tissue. A relative omega-3 deficit allows overabundant actions of omega-6 hormones to develop into health disorders. People need simple, explicit information on the balance of essential fatty acids in their foods to avoid accumulating unintended imbalances in their tissue omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. RESULTS: We developed an Omega 3–6 Balance Food Score that summarizes in a single value the balance among eleven omega-3 and omega-6 essential fatty acids in a food. The value allows a quantitative estimate of the impact of each food item on the proportions of omega-3 and omega-6 that will accumulate in the 20- and 22-carbon highly unsaturated fatty acids of blood, which is an important health risk assessment biomarker. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of an individual food item upon a useful health risk assessment biomarker is easily evident in a simple, explicit value for the balance among eleven essential fatty acids nutrients. Foods with more positive Omega 3–6 Balance Food Scores will increase the percent of omega-3 in the biomarker, whereas those with more negative Scores will increase the percent of omega-6 in the biomarker.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiomarkers 3ablood 3aessential fatty acids 3afoods 3ahighly unsaturated fatty acids 3ahormones 3anutrients 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aomega-6 fatty acids 3apeople 3areceptors 3arisk assessment1 aLamoreaux, Etienne0 tNutrition & metabolism.g2012 Dec., v. 9, no. 1 p.480-480dSpringer-Verlagx1743-70757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1743-7075-9-46  aDNAL 7aarticle02705naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245009500164300001800259520105300277592002801330650001601358650001601374650002301390650001701413650002001430650003101450650001001481650001301491650002101504650001901525650001301544650002901557650002601586650002001612650001101632653002601643653003101669653002701700653002801727653003701755700009001792700001201882700001201894700001701906700001701923700001601940700001501956773009901971856008402070852000902154655001202163IND60616176820221121124607.0191114e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061617682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ygeno.2018.09.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Hang10aTranscriptome analysis of soybean WRKY TFs in response to Peronospora manshurica infection  ap. 1412-1422.  aSoybean downy mildew (SDM) caused by Peronospora manshurica (Pm) is a common disease of soybean that occurs wherever soybean is grown. In order to provide new insights about the defense mechanism of soybean response to Pm infection, differential expression of WRKY transcription factors (TFs) in SDM-high resistant (HR) and SDM-high susceptible (HS) genotypes were analyzed in this study. Totally, 22 WRKY TFs were differentially expressed in HR and HS genotype, while 16 WRKY TFs were found to be specific in response to fungal inoculation. By yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) assay, the GmWRKY31 was characterized to be able to bind the cis-acting W-box element in the promoter region of the GmSAGT1 gene whose higher transcriptional expression was associated with enhanced SDM-resistance. This result of Y1H assay, together with the activation of GmSAGT1 both by SA (salicylic acid) induction and Pm infection in vivo, let us to speculate that the GmWRKY31 might regulate the GmSAGT1 gene expression and involve in SA-mediated immune responses in soybean.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3aPeronospora 3adisease resistance 3adowny mildew 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agenotype 3apromoter regions 3asalicylic acid 3asoybeans 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptomics 3ayeasts 0aSoybean (Glycine max) 0aSoybean downy mildew (SDM) 0aPeronospora manshurica 0aTranscriptomic analysis 0aWRKY transcription factors (TFs)1 aTan, Jie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0259-9331 https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0259-93311 aLi, Mei1 aYu, Yue1 aJia, Shirong1 aZhang, Chong1 aWu, Yuanhua1 aLiu, Yuhui0 tGenomics.g2019 Dec., v. 111, no. 6 p.1412-1422dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12348x0888-75437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygeno.2018.09.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03384naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245011000165300001600275520183000291592002802121650002702149650004102176650001302217650002602230650001702256650001502273650002502288650002002313650001202333650003202345650001702377650001102394650001402405650002602419650001302445650001102458650001902469650001002488650002302498651001302521651001002534651001302544651001502557651001102572651001002583651002302593700001602616700001502632773008902647856008502736852000902821655001202830IND60549508120221123001910.0160908e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054950812DNAL7 a10.1094/PHYTO-12-14-0365-FI2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRush, C. M.10aSignificance and Epidemiological Aspects of Late-Season Infections in the Management of Potato Zebra Chip  ap. 929-936.  aZebra chip (ZC) of potato is putatively caused by the fastidious, phloem-limited bacterium ‘Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum’ (Lso), which is transmitted by the potato psyllid (Bactericera cockerelli). The disease, which significantly impacts both crop yield and quality, was first identified in the United States from south Texas in 2000. It reached epidemic levels in north Texas and certain production areas in Colorado, Nebraska, and New Mexico from 2004 to 2007 and it caused severe losses in fields in Oregon, Washington, and Idaho in 2011. The potato plant is susceptible to infection at all developmental stages, but disease management programs have focused on vector control through early and repeated insecticide applications, in an effort to minimize early to midseason infections which are most damaging. Growers often terminate spray programs 2 to 3 weeks prior to crop harvest due to lack of visible treatment effects on crop yield or quality. However, recent studies on vector transmission and host−pathogen interactions have revealed that late-season infections pose a significant, previously unrecognized, threat to crop quality. The pathogen can move from an infected leaf to tubers within 2 days; however, tubers infected less than 1 week before harvest will remain asymptomatic and the pathogen will be undetectable. When these tubers are placed into storage they are assumed to be disease free. However, Lso can continue to multiply in respiring tubers during storage, resulting in reduced tuber quality. Likewise, if plants become infected a few days before vines are killed, ZC can continue to develop in infected tubers before they are harvested. Perspectives on the significance of late-season infections and some of the more important issues associated with those infections are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBactericera cockerelli 3aCandidatus Liberibacter solanacearum 3abacteria 3abiological resistance 3acrop quality 3acrop yield 3adevelopmental stages 3adisease control 3agrowers 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3ainsecticides 3aleaves 3apathogens 3apesticide application 3apotatoes 3atubers 3avector control 3avines 3azebra chip disease 3aColorado 3aIdaho 3aNebraska 3aNew Mexico 3aOregon 3aTexas 3aWashington (state)1 aWorkneh, F.1 aRashed, A.0 tPhytopathology.g2015 July, v. 105, no. 7 p.929-936dPhytopathologyx0031-949X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094%2FPHYTO-12-14-0365-FI3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03338naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001900181245007600200300001800276500002000294506007600314520181400390592002802204506003702232650001502269650001602284650001702300650000902317650001002326650001902336650002002355650003002375650002602405700002102431700001602452700001702468700001602485700001402501700001502515700001502530700001902545700005402564773014302618856007402761852000902835655001202844IND60616397220221207125158.0181016e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061639722DNAL7 a10.1111/jvim.152502doi7 aPMC61893832pmcid7 a300700042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOosthuyzen, W.10aSensitivity and specificity of microRNA‐122 for liver disease in dogs  ap. 1637-1644.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Current tests for diagnosing liver disease in dogs are sub‐optimal. MicroRNA‐122 (miR‐122) is a sensitive and specific biomarker of liver injury in humans and rodents. Circulating miR‐122 could have utility in identifying dogs with liver disease. OBJECTIVE: Establish the reference interval for miR‐122 in healthy dogs and determine performance in a range of dog breeds with liver disease and control animals with non‐liver disease. ANIMALS: Stored serum from 120 healthy dogs, 100 dogs with non‐liver diseases, and 30 dogs with histologically confirmed liver disease was analyzed. METHODS: Retrospective study. Medical records of dogs with liver disease, non‐liver disease and healthy dogs were reviewed. Serum miR‐122 concentrations were measured by PCR and compared with the characteristics of the dogs and their conventional clinical measurements. RESULTS: In healthy dogs the 2.5th, 50th, and 97.5th quartiles of miR‐122 were 110 (90% CI 80‐114), 594 (505‐682), and 3312 (2925‐5144) copies/μL, respectively. There was no difference between healthy dogs and dogs with non‐liver disease (median ± IQR: healthy dogs 609 [327‐1014] copies/μL; non‐liver disease 607 [300‐1351] copies/μL). miR‐122 was higher in dogs with liver disease (11 332 [4418‐20 520] copies/μL, P < .001 compared to healthy dogs). miR‐122 identified dogs with liver disease with high accuracy (receiver operating characteristic area under curve for comparison with healthy dogs: 0.93 [95% CI 0.86‐0.99]). The upper limit of normal for healthy dogs (3312 copies/μL) had a sensitivity of 77% and specificity of 97% for identifying liver disease. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Liver disease can be sensitively and specifically diagnosed in dogs by measurement of miR‐122.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3adog diseases 3adogs 3aliver 3aliver diseases 3amedical records 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aretrospective studies1 aTen Berg, P.W.L.1 aFrancis, B.1 aCampbell, S.1 aMacklin, V.1 aMilne, E.1 aGow, A.

We investigate the coupling of the microgel beads with the gel matrix and the formation of interpenetrating networks inside the microgels by confocal two-focus fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (2fFCS). This technique serves to study the effects of the heterogeneous structure of the composite hydrogels on the diffusive mobility of nanoscopic dextran tracers within the gels. Our investigations reveal that the formation of interpenetrating networks inside the embedded microgel beads depends on their cross-link density: whereas interpenetrating networks are formed inside weakly cross-linked beads, they are not formed inside strongly cross-linked beads. If the formation of interpenetrating networks occurs, the temperature-dependent swelling and deswelling of the beads is obstructed. In addition, the mobility of dextran tracers inside the embedded microgel beads is hindered compared to those in free beads and in the surrounding gel matrix. Surprisingly, the surrounding poly(acrylamide) hydrogel matrix swells inhomogeneously when the embedded poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) beads collapse upon heating. This indicates the formation of pores near the surface of the collapsed beads, offering promising means to tailor composite hydrogels for applications as membranes with tunable permeability. Our experiments also demonstrate the utility of 2fFCS to study spatially resolved diffusion in complex environments, which is of great interest in biomaterials research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylamides 3abiocompatible materials 3acrosslinking 3adextran 3afluorescence 3ahydrogels 3amodels 3apermeability 3aspectroscopy 3atracer techniques1 aSeiffert, Sebastian1 aRichtering, W.q(Walter),0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2012 Sept. 26, v. 134, no. 38 p.15963-15969dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja306808j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04332naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002200192245022400214300001800438506007600456520194900532592002802481506003702509650002702546650002702573650001302600650001502613650002302628650002502651650002002676650001302696650002002709650001902729650001802748650001802766650001902784650001402803650001602817651001802833653001402851653000802865653001402873653000902887653001202896653002702908700002302935700002102958700002002979700002002999700002103019700002503040700001803065700002503083700002203108700002103130700002103151700001803172700002003190700002403210700002403234700002303258700001803281700002203299710005903321773009903380856008603479852000903565655001203574IND60576130020221207085236.0190401e20170824xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057613002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.07.0242doi7 aPMC58007732pmcid7 a287508542pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMulligan, Mark J.10aTularemia vaccine: Safety, reactogenicity, “Take” skin reactions, and antibody responses following vaccination with a new lot of the Francisella tularensis live vaccine strain – A phase 2 randomized clinical Trial  ap. 4730-4737.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTularemia is caused by Francisella tularensis, a gram-negative bacterium that has been weaponized as an aerosol. For protection of personnel conducting biodefense research, the United States Army required clinical evaluation of a new lot of tularemia live vaccine strain manufactured in accordance with Current Good Manufacturing Practices.A phase 2 randomized clinical trial compared the new lot (DVC-LVS) to the existing vaccine that has been in use for decades (USAMRIID-LVS). The vaccines were delivered by scarification to 228 participants. Safety, reactogenicity, take and/or antibody levels were assessed on days 0, 1, 2, 8, 14, 28, 56, and 180.Both vaccines were safe and had acceptable reactogenicity profiles during six months of follow-up. There were no serious or grade 3 and 4 laboratory adverse events. Moderate systemic reactogenicity (mostly headache or feeling tired) was reported by ∼23% of participants receiving either vaccine. Injection site reactogenicity was mostly mild itchiness and pain. The frequencies of vaccine take skin reactions were 73% (95% CI, 64, 81) for DVC-LVS and 80% (95% CI, 71, 87) for USAMRIID-LVS. The 90% CI for the difference in proportions was −6.9% (−16.4, 2.6). The rates of seroconversion measured by microagglutination assay on days 28 or 56 were 94% (95% CI, 88, 98; n=98/104) for DVC-LVS and 94% (95% CI, 87, 97; n=103/110) for USAMRIID-LVS (p=1.00). Day 14 sera revealed more rapid seroconversion for DVC-LVS relative to USAMRIID-LVS: 82% (95% CI, 73, 89) versus 55% (95% CI, 45, 65), respectively (p<0.0001).The DVC-LVS vaccine had similar safety, reactogenicity, take and antibody responses compared to the older USAMRIID vaccine, and was superior for early (day 14) antibody production. Vaccination take was not a sensitive surrogate for seroconversion in a multi-center study where personnel at five research clinics performed assessments.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01150695  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFrancisella tularensis 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aaerosols 3aantibodies 3aantibody formation 3aclinical examination 3aclinical trials 3aheadache 3ahuman resources 3ainjection site 3alive vaccines 3amanufacturing 3aseroconversion 3atularemia 3avaccination 3aUnited States 0aTularemia 0aLVS 0aBacterial 0aTake 0aVaccine 0aFrancisella tularensis1 aStapleton, Jack T.1 aKeitel, Wendy A.1 aFrey, Sharon E.1 aChen, Wilbur H.1 aRouphael, Nadine1 aEdupuganti, Srilatha1 aBeck, Allison1 aWinokur, Patricia L.1 aEl Sahly, Hana M.1 aPatel, Shital M.1 aAtmar, Robert L.1 aGraham, Irene1 aAnderson, Edwin1 aEl-Kamary, Samer S.1 aPasetti, Marcela F.1 aSztein, Marcelo B.1 aHill, Heather1 aGoll, Johannes B.2 aThe DMID 08-0006 Tularemia Vaccine Study Groupeauthor0 tVaccine.g2017 Aug. 24, v. 35, no. 36 p.4730-4737dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.07.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02865naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006100139245008700200300001500287500001400302500002000316520160600336592002801942650003101970650000902001650001402010650001502024650001402039650001002053650001902063650002402082700002202106700002002128700005902148700006902207773012102276856007302397852000902470655001202479IND60724059920221118083134.0210120e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072405992DNAL7 a10.1111/vde.128852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlder, Caitlin E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7007-581510aCharacterization of staphylococcal communities on healthy and allergic feline skin  ap. 61-e10.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Various Staphylococcus species have been demonstrated to play important roles on the skin, including causing disease and protecting the host from pathogens. Although culture‐based studies have isolated various Staphylococcus spp. from feline skin, very little is known regarding the species‐level communities on the host. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To describe the species‐level staphylococcal communities inhabiting the skin of healthy cats and cats with allergic dermatitis. ANIMALS: Skin swabs from the ear canal and groin of 11 healthy and 10 allergic (nonlesional) cats were obtained. METHODS AND MATERIALS: DNA was extracted from the skin swabs and used for next‐generation sequencing targeting the V1–3 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Following a standard microbiota analysis of the sequencing data, species‐level assignment for the staphylococcal sequences were obtained using a staphylococci‐specific database. RESULTS: Staphylococcus spp. had similar relative abundance in healthy and allergic samples. The most abundant staphylococcal species were S. epidermidis in healthy samples, and S. felis and S. capitis in allergic samples. The composition of staphylococcal communities, as well as relative abundance of Staphylococcus spp., was variable between body sites and individual cats sampled. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: These results demonstrate that diverse staphylococcal communities inhabit the skin of healthy and allergic cats, and provide a starting point for further research into the importance of Staphylococcus spp. in feline allergic skin disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStaphylococcus epidermidis 3acats 3adatabases 3adermatitis 3aear canal 3agenes 3amicroorganisms 3aveterinary medicine1 aDiesel, Alison B.1 aStarks, Jill M.1 aLawhon, Sara D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9154-89091 aRodrigues Hoffmann, Aline1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6148-25310 tVeterinary dermatology.g2021 Feb., v. 32, no. 1 p.61-e10dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46684x0959-44937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vde.128853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01283naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245010800158300002000266520026200286592002800548650001100576650002300587650001300610650001300623650001400636700002300650700002100673700002100694700002300715773013500738856007500873852000900948655001200957IND60538666020221119025701.0160815e20120926xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053866602DNAL7 a10.1021/ja306992k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Qianyan10aPalladium-Catalyzed C–H Activation Taken to the Limit.

The Au@PtNPs exhibited remarkable stability (> 2 years) at room temperature. The synthesis, bimetallic nanostructures and catalytic properties were thoroughly characterized by ultraviolet-visible light spectrophotometry, transmission electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis and electrochemistry. The 8 ± 2 nm Au@PtNPs contained 24 ± 1 mol% Pt and 76 ± 1 mol% Au corresponding to an atomically thin Pt shell. Electrochemical data clearly show that the active surface is dominated by Pt with a specific surface area above 45 m² per gram of Pt. Interactions with the Au core increase the activity of the Pt shell by up to 55% and improve catalytic selectivity compared to pure Pt. The Au@Pt NPs show exciting catalytic activity in electrooxidation of sustainable fuels (i.e. formic acid, methanol and ethanol), and selective hydrogenation of benzene derivatives. Especially high activity was achieved for formic acid oxidation, 549 mA (mgPₜ)⁻¹ (at 0.6 V vs. SCE), which is 3.5 fold higher than a commercial < 5 nm PtNP catalyst. Excellent activity for the direct production of γ-valerolactone, an alternative biofuel/fuel additive, from levulinic acid and methyl levulinate was finally demonstrated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3abiofuels 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aelectrochemistry 3aethanol 3aformic acid 3agold 3ahydrogenation 3alevulinic acid 3amethanol 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3aoxidation 3aplatinum 3aspectroscopy 3asurface area 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aŠešelj, N.1 aPoreddy, R.1 aRiisager, A.1 aUlstrup, J.1 aZhang, J.0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2016 Feb. 23, v. 4, no. 9 p.3278-3286dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ta08922k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03006naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245010000168300001600268520141800284592002801702650002001730650002101750650002501771650002301796650001101819650001201830650001301842650003701855650001601892650001201908700001801920700003101938700001301969700001501982700001301997700001802010700001502028700001702043700002102060700001702081700001902098700001602117700001902133700001602152700002202168700001902190700006002209773010402269856008202373852000902455655001202464IND60593254920221119110200.0180619e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059325492DNAL7 a10.1007/s12355-017-0584-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnil Kumar, G.S.10aIdentification of Ideal Locations and Stable High Biomass Sorghum Genotypes in semiarid Tropics  ap. 323-335.  aThe dearth of proper delineation for energy sorghum cultivation has led to a prerequisite for evaluation and identification of test environments for the newly developed lines. This becomes of vital importance as the biomass yield is highly influenced by genotype and environmental (G × E) interactions. Several agronomic traits were considered to assess the biomass yield and the combined analysis of variance for G (genotype), L (location) and interaction effect of G × L. The variations in the yield caused by the interaction of G × L are very essential to acquire knowledge on the specific adaptation of a genotype. Thus, the multi-location trials conducted across locations and years have helped to identify the stable environments with specific adaptation for biomass sorghum. The presence of close association between the test locations suggested that the same information about the genotypes could be obtained from fewer test environments, and hence the potential to reduce evaluation costs. The two genotypes—IS 13762 and ICSV 25333—have shown stable performance for biomass traits across all the locations, in comparison with CSH 22SS (check). The top ten entries with stable and better performance for fresh biomass yield, dry biomass yield, grain yield and theoretical ethanol yield were ICSV 25333, IS 13762, CSH 22SS, IS 25302, IS 25301, IS 27246, IS 16529, DHBM2, ICSSH 28 and IS 17349.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSorghum bicolor 3aagronomic traits 3aanalysis of variance 3abiomass production 3aenergy 3aethanol 3agenotype 3agenotype-environment interaction 3agrain yield 3atropics1 aVinutha, K.S.1 aShrivastava, DevendraKumar1 aJain, S.1 aSyed, B.A.1 aGami, B.1 aMarimuthu, S.1 aYuvraj, A.1 aYadava, H.S.1 aSrivastava, S.C.1 aYadagiri, K.1 aAnsodariya, V.1 aPrasuna, P.1 aVishwanath, J.1 aAnand, S.R.1 aRathore, Abhishek1 aUmakanth, A.V.1 aSrinivasa Rao, P.1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7983-46620 tSugar tech.g2018 June, v. 20, no. 3 p.323-335dSpringer IndiawJournal:J000000155x0972-15257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12355-017-0584-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02581naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005500151245017400206300001400380520102900394592002801423650001101451650002301462650001701485650001701502650002101519650001701540650001201557650002101569650001901590650001901609650001901628650001801647650001801665650002201683650000901705650000901714650001701723650001401740650001601754700005701770700002601827700001701853700001401870773010801884856008601992852000902078655001202087IND60613558820221116150208.0190409e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061355882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.idairyj.2018.08.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPescuma, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2119-645510aHydrolysate of β-lactoglobulin by Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CRL 656 suppresses the immunoreactivity of β-lactoglobulin as revealed by in vivo assays  ap. 71-78.  aCows' milk allergy, common in young infants, is often solved by the age of five; however, it can persist in some adults. The in vivo immunomodulatory potential of β-lactoglobulin (BLG) hydrolysates obtained with Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CRL656 (H656) was studied. Sera from mice gavaged with H656 showed lower specific BLG-IgE values than those of allergic mice. Secretion of IL-10, INF-γ and IL-6 was increased and that of IL-4 decreased when allergic spleen cells were stimulated with H656. IL-4 secretion was significantly reduced and concentrations of IL-10, IL-17A and IL-6 were increased when H656 was orally administrated. Highest expression of IL-4 and IL-12 was observed for allergic mice and H656 gavaged mice, respectively. H656 immunisation had a positive effect on intestinal mucosa. Overall, H656 displayed an immunomodulating effect, balancing the allergic Th2 response by stimulating Th1 type cytokine secretion. The hydrolysate might promote oral tolerance towards BLG in infant foods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abeta-lactoglobulin 3ahydrolysates 3aimmunization 3aimmunomodulation 3ainfant foods 3ainfants 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-12 3ainterleukin-17 3ainterleukin-4 3ainterleukin-6 3aintestinal mucosa 3amice 3amilk 3amilk allergy 3asecretion 3asplenocytes1 aHébert, E.M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8288-97011 aFont de Affolter, G.,1 aSaavedra, L.1 aMozzi, F.0 tInternational dairy journal.g2019 Jan., v. 88 p.71-78dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48777x0958-69467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.idairyj.2018.08.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03009naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001700189245013000206300001800336506007600354520123000430592002801660596008401688506003701772650001501809650001501824650001201839650001701851650002501868650001701893650002501910650001501935650002101950650001901971650001901990650001202009650001802021650001402039650001102053650001802064650001402082650001502096650001802111650002202129650001302151651002102164700002002185700001602205773013102221856008202352852000902434655001202443IND60689370520221207082421.0200421e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068937052DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-019-04221-72doi7 aPMC71710272pmcid7 a323277972pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSezgin, Sema10aDetermination of antioxidant activities and chemical composition of sequential fractions of five edible mushrooms from Turkey  ap. 1866-1876.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTricholoma scalpturatum, Tricholoma populinum, Neolentinus cyathiformis, Chlorophyllum agaricoides, and Lycoperdon utriforme have been traditionally utilized as food in Turkey for a long time. The present study focused on determining antioxidant activities, total phenolic groups contents (flavonols, hydroxycinnamic acids, proanthocyanidins, and anthocyanins), phenolic compounds and fatty acids of sequential extracts (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, chloroform, acetone, ethanol, and pure water) obtained from five wild edible macrofungi species. Ethanol and acetone (or ethyl acetate) were found as the most efficient solvents in terms of antioxidant activities and extraction efficiency. Antioxidant studies showed that L. utriforme, C. agaricoides, and T. populinum exhibited the highest radical scavenging and reducing activities and contained the highest phenolic contents. Chromatographic studies revealed that phenolic acids (protocatechuic, gallic, and chlorogenic acids) and fatty acids (oleic, linoleic, and palmitic acids) were the major contributors of the antioxidant activities of the extracts. The results obtained suggest the utilization of these macrofungi species as significant sources of natural antioxidants.  aPublisher supplied data  a2015-SBE-YL268cVan Yuzuncu Yil University Scientific Research Projects Council0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLycoperdon 3aTricholoma 3aacetone 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3achemical composition 3achloroform 3achlorogenic acid 3achromatography 3acoumaric acids 3aethanol 3aethyl acetate 3aflavonols 3ahexane 3alinoleic acid 3amushrooms 3aoleic acid 3apalmitic acid 3aproanthocyanidins 3asolvents 3aTurkey (country)1 aDalar, Abdullah1 aUzun, Yusuf0 tJournal of food science and technology.g2020 May, v. 57, no. 5 p.1866-1876dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl16929x0022-11557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-019-04221-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02975naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245013900178300001600317520138300333536012901716592002801845650000801873650002101881650001801902650001401920650001301934650001301947650001401960650001701974650003001991650002002021653001202041653002802053653002802081653000902109653002202118700001702140700002202157700002202179700002002201700001602221700001902237773014202256856008602398852000902484655001202493IND60783181820221120044545.0220716e20220704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078318182DNAL7 a10.1080/14620316.2021.20149912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManikanda Boopathi, N.10aDevelopment of novel SSR markers derived from genomic and transcriptomic data of Moringa oleifera L. var. PKM1 and their applicability  ap. 487-495.  aLimited genomic resources, especially on breeder-friendly simple sequence repeats (SSR), are available in Moringa, a multi-purpose miracle tree. This study predicted a total of 29913 genomic-SSRs and 1364 genic-SSRs from the omics data obtained from a Moringa cultivar, PKM1. Among the genomic SSR motifs, 1, 414, 2183, 25600, 1106 and 609 SSRs were Mono, Di, Tri, Tetra, Penta, and Hexa repeats, respectively. Higher frequency for AGAG (24.01%) followed by GAGA (16.68) and AAAA (13.18%) was observed in genic-SSRs sequences. Primer pairs for 22,336 genomic- and genic-SSR markers were developed and 117 SSR primer pairs were randomly selected and assayed in four representative Moringa cultivars and ecotypes. Consequently, 94.44% of them have showed high level of DNA polymorphism by generating 1 to 4 alleles per SSR marker (with an average of 1.75) among the investigated Moringa accessions with a maximum polymorphic information content (PIC) of 0.95. Besides using as simple and affordable indicator to differentiate morphologically similar Moringa ecotypes, the SSRs reported in this study will also have several other potential applications such as seed purity analysis, intellectual property protection, identification of introgressions in interspecific crosses, evolutionary studies, germplasm management, gene and/or QTL identification and marker-assisted selection.  aThis research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aMoringa oleifera 3abiotechnology 3acultivars 3aecotypes 3agenomics 3agermplasm 3ahorticulture 3amarker-assisted selection 3atranscriptomics 0aMoringa 0asimple sequence repeats 0agenomic- and genic- SSR 0aPKM1 0aphylogenetic tree1 aWilliams, M.1 aVeera Ranjani, R.1 aPaul, Allen Eldho1 aJayakanthan, M.1 aSaranya, N.1 aRaveendran, M.0 tJournal of horticultural science & biotechnology.g2022 July 04, v. 97, no. 4 p.487-495dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12181x2380-40847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14620316.2021.20149913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02476naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245012200162300002000284520138200304592002801686596006701714650002101781650002901802650002201831650002501853650001301878650002401891773016901915856008102084852000902165655001202174IND60614217920221116151403.0181002e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061421792DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-018-2846-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMao, Yimin10aDecentralization, national context and environmental policy performance: a fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis  ap. 28471-28488.  aThis study examines the complex relationship between decentralization, national context and environment policy performance with the cross-sectional data from 118 countries. Decentralization is decomposed into three dimensions: political, fiscal and administrative. Both multiple regression analysis and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis are adopted. Results show that: (1) political, fiscal and administrative decentralization differ in their impacts on environmental policy performance. (2) There are multiple pathways, constituted by specific configurations of decentralization and context conditions, to high (or low) environmental policy performance. (3) High environmental policy performance occurs most often when a country is fiscally and administratively decentralized and its context is favorable, i.e. advanced economy, good governance and stringent environmental regulations. In this situation, political decentralization seems to be irrelevant to the outcome. (4) Low environmental policy performance occurs most often when a country, without the favorable context mentioned above, become fiscally centralized, regardless of whether political and administrative decentralization is present or not. This study suggests policy makers should keep in mind the contextual fit of decentralization and adopt a configurational thinking in environmental governance.  aPublisher supplied data  aNO. 18CZZ023cNational Social Science Foundation of China (CN) 3adecentralization 3aenvironmental governance 3aenvironmental law 3aenvironmental policy 3apolitics 3aregression analysis0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2018 Oct., v. 25, no. 28 p.28471-28488dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-2846-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02840naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245008200178300001600260520138100276592002801657650001801685650001001703650001401713650001301727650001801740650001401758650001001772650002001782650001701802650001401819650001701833650000901850650001301859650001101872650001601883650001801899650001701917650001601934650002201950650001701972653001001989653002101999653001602020653001302036653001402049653001002063773014202073856008602215852000902301655001202310IND60588600520221120215106.0200511e20170903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058860052DNAL7 a10.1080/14620316.2017.13141992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhokhar, Khalid Mahmud10aEnvironmental and genotypic effects on bulb development in onion – a review  ap. 448-454.  aEnvironmental and genetic factors influence growth and bulb development of onions by affecting their physiology. Photoperiod plays critical a role in bulb development and determines the suitability of a cultivar for a particular region. Long days and high temperatures promote onion bulbing. Bulbing is regulated more by temperature than photoperiod, as determined by growing degree days. Far-red light promotes bulbing most effectively. High-temperature storage of sets (above 20–25°C) results in increased total bulb yields, while very high temperature (25.5–31°C) or temperature below 0°C depresses yield. Plant density has an impact on bulb size: the higher the plant density the smaller the bulb size. Onion is more sensitive to water stress during bulb formation and enlargement than during the vegetative stage. Nitrogen improves bulb development, but too much nitrogen promotes excessive vegetative growth and delays maturity. Growth hormones (gibberellins and ethrel) promote the growth and development of bulbs. Flowering and bulb formation in onion is regulated by different (Flowering Locus T) FT genes. Two antagonistic FT-like genes regulate bulb formation. AcFT1 promotes bulb formation, while AcFT4 prevents AcFT1 up-regulation and inhibits bulbing. There is a need to link our research with the genetics and physiology of onions, to enhance bulb yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiotechnology 3abulbs 3acultivars 3aethephon 3afar-red light 3aflowering 3agenes 3agenetic factors 3agibberellins 3aheat sums 3ahorticulture 3aloci 3anitrogen 3aonions 3aphotoperiod 3aplant density 3asomatotropin 3atemperature 3avegetative growth 3awater stress 0aOnion 0abulb development 0aenvironment 0agenotype 0anutrition 0awater0 tJournal of horticultural science & biotechnology.g2017 Sept. 3, v. 92, no. 5 p.448-454dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12181x2380-40847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14620316.2017.13141993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02279naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245014900163520107500312592002801387650003401415650003001449650001201479650002801491650001901519650003901538650001101577653003101588653003201619653002501651653002701676700001401703700001801717773009401735856007901829852000901908655001201917IND60478528120221119031503.0160124e20141204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047852812DNAL7 a10.1556/AAlim.2014.00092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMihaylova, D.10aTotal phenolic content, antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of <i>Haberlea rhodopensis</i> extracts obtained by pressurized liquid extraction  aThe present study was designed to investigate the antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of pressurized liquid extracts from <i>Haberlea rhodopensis</i> Friv.

Therefore, polarized light compass orientation in the sandhopper Talitrus saltator seems to be a traditional attribute more than a solid demonstration. Our tests carried out under artificial and natural conditions of illumination using different polarizing and neutral density (grey) filters demonstrated that T. saltator perceives polarized light; however, it does not use the skylight polarized light as a cue for menotactic orientation. However, since the sky spectral and luminance gradients were not completely eliminated in our tests, a possible influence of these two celestial factors of orientation could still be present. Therefore, we conclude that this species, in this experimental paradigm at least, does not use a polarized light compass mechanism, despite a very good sun compass system of orientation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal behavior 3alighting 3apolarized light 0aorientation 0apolarized light 0asandhopper 0aTalitrus saltator1 aGalanti, Giuditta1 aMercatelli, Luca0 tAnimal behaviour.g2013 Aug., v. 86, no. 2 p.427-434dElsevier LtdaThe Association for the Study of Animal BehaviourwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.05.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03254naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006200151245009500213300001600308520183400324592002802158650002002186650001202206650001902218650002302237650002102260650001102281650000902292650001102301650002502312650001502337651001102352651002802363653002002391653002002411653002002431653001102451700002002462700005702482700002702539700003002566773010502596856008602701852000902787655001202796IND60539822220221122180257.0190219e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053982222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2015.10.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrulebois, Etienne1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4249-025810aHydrological response to an abrupt shift in surface air temperature over France in 1987/88  ap. 892-901.  aDuring the last few decades, Europe has seen a faster increase of observed temperature than that simulated by models. The air temperature over Western Europe showed an abrupt shift at the end of the 1980s, still insufficiently documented. The aim of this study is to assess the characteristics of this shift and its potential impacts on the hydrological cycle over France. Such an assessment is essential for a better understanding of past and future climatic changes and their impact on water resources.A subset of 119 temperature, 122 rainfall, and 30 hydrometric stations was studied, over the entire French metropolitan territory. Several change-point detection tests were applied to temperature, rainfall and runoff time series.A shift in annual mean air temperature was detected in 1987/88, for more than 75% of the stations, and for both minimum and maximum temperatures. An abrupt increase of about 1°C in minimum and maximum temperature provides evidence of this shift, which shows strong seasonality, with significant increases for DJF, MAM and JJA. Its detection is not affected by the length of the time series or any potential artefacts associated to the conditions of measurement.Cluster analysis of the rainfall stations was used to take account of regional variability in rainfall evolution. Two climate areas were obtained from this analysis: Mediterranean and temperate. No shift was detected in rainfall for either area. However, at annual and quarterly scales, several changes in runoff were observed between the periods 1969–87 and 1988–09. The significant changes occurred from January to July, in agreement with maximum increases in temperature. Evapotranspiration could well play a key role in these changes in the hydrological cycle, as a response to temperature increases in the watersheds studied.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aevapotranspiration 3ahydrologic cycle 3amodels 3arain 3arunoff 3atime series analysis 3awatersheds 3aFrance 3aWestern European region 0aShift detection 0aAir temperature 0aRunoff response 0aFrance1 aCastel, Thierry1 aRichard, Yves1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9203-09221 aChateau-Smith, Carmela1 aAmiotte Suchet, Philippe,0 tJournal of hydrology.g2015 Dec., v. 531 p.892-901dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2015.10.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02439naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245020500166300001800371520095100389592002801340650003101368650001101399650001301410650001201423650001101435650004301446650001201489653002801501653002001529653002001549653001701569653003501586653003301621700001901654700001701673700001701690700001901707700001901726700001501745700001601760773010901776856008701885852000901972655001201981IND50067972820221122233059.0190402e20131201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006797282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.05.0942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Lei10aDevelopment of sample preparation method for eleutheroside B and E analysis in Acanthopanax senticosus by ionic liquids-ultrasound based extraction and high-performance liquid chromatography detection  ap. 2426-2433.  aAn ionic liquids-based ultrasonic-assisted extraction (ILUAE) method was successfully developed for extracting eleutheroside B and E from Radix Acanthopanax senticosus. Thirteen 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium ionic liquids with different cations and anions were investigated and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide ([C4mim]Br) solution was selected as the solvent. The conditions for ILUAE, including the ionic liquid concentration, soaking time, ultrasonic power, ultrasonic time, solid–liquid ratio and number of extraction cycles, were optimized. With the proposed method, the energy consumption time was reduced to 30min, whereas conventional method requires about 4h. The proposed method had good recovery (97.96–103.39%) and reproducibility (RSD, n=5; 3.3% for eleutheroside B, 4.6% for eleutheroside E). ILUAE was an efficient, rapid and simple sample preparation technique that showed high reproducibility and was environmental friendly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEleutherococcus senticosus 3aanions 3abromides 3acations 3aenergy 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3asoaking 0aAcanthopanax senticosus 0aEleutheroside B 0aEleutheroside E 0aIonic liquid 0aUltrasonic-assisted extraction 0aResponse surface methodology1 aGe, Hongshuang1 aWang, Wenjie1 aZu, Yuangang1 aYang, Fengjian1 aZhao, Chunjian1 aZhang, Lin1 aZhang, Ying0 tFood chemistry.g2013 Dec. 01, v. 141, no. 3 p.2426-2433dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.05.0943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02337naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100001900186245009100205300001800296506007600314520114800390592002801538506003701566650001301603650001401616650001101630650001301641650002301654650001101677650001101688650001101699650001601710651001101726700002001737700002101757773009201778856004801870852000901918655001201927IND4467362320221207135401.0121003e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446736232DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-012-1953-22doi7 aPMC38730412pmcid7 a243912742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDypvik, Eivind10aSeasonal variations in vertical migration of glacier lanternfish, Benthosema glaciale   ap. 1673-1683.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe seasonal variations in glacier lanternfish (Benthosema glaciale) vertical distribution and diel vertical migration (DVM) were studied by use of a bottom-mounted upward-facing 38 kHz echo sounder deployed at 392 m depth and cabled to shore in Masfjorden (~60°52′N, ~5°24′E), Norway. Acoustic data from July 2007–October 2008 were analyzed, and scattering layers below ~220 m during daytime were attributed to glacier lanternfish based on net sampling in this, and previous studies, as well as from analysis of the acoustic data. At these depths, three different diel behavioral strategies were apparent: normal diel vertical migration (NDVM), inverse DVM (IDVM), and no DVM (NoDVM). NoDVM was present all year, while IDVM was present in autumn and winter, and NDVM was present during spring and summer. The seasonal differences in DVM behavior seem to correlate with previously established seasonal distribution of prey. We hypothesize that in regions with seasonally migrating zooplankton, such as where calanoid copepods overwinter at depth, similar plasticity in DVM behavior might occur in other populations of lanternfishes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCopepoda 3aacoustics 3aautumn 3aglaciers 3aseasonal variation 3aspring 3asummer 3awinter 3azooplankton 3aNorway1 aRøstad, Anders1 aKaartvedt, Stein0 tMarine biology.g2012 Aug., v. 159, no. 8 p.1673-1683dSpringer-Verlagx0025-31627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-012-1953-2  aDNAL 7aarticle03291naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003100151245011100182520161000293592002801903650001201931650002401943650001801967650002701985650002302012650001502035650002502050650002302075650001602098650001902114650001302133650002302146650003002169650001302199650001802212650001202230650002502242650001502267653002402282653002202306653002202328653001902350653002102369700003302390700003402423700003502457700005602492773011802548856008602666852000902752655001202761IND60684653720221119134609.0201104e20200401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068465372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.1100342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, Ana Flávia Rezende10aInfluence of COD/SO42− ratio on vinasse treatment performance by two-stage anaerobic membrane bioreactor  aVinasse is sulfate-rich wastewater due to sulfuric acid dosage in some ethanol production steps. The vinasse sulfate concentration is subject to seasonal variations. A two-stage anaerobic membrane bioreactor (2S-AnMBR) was operated to evaluate the influence of COD/SO₄²⁻ ratio on vinasse treatment performance by using a real vinasse sample under natural seasonal COD/SO₄²⁻ variation. This ratio directly affects the sulfidogenesis efficiency, which is responsible for different forms of inhibition in the anaerobic treatment of sulfate-rich wastewater. The bioreactor presented a stable performance at the highest COD/SO₄²⁻ ratios (50–94), with high removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) (97.5 ± 0.4%) and volatile fatty acids (VFA) (98.0 ± 0.6%), but low removal of sulfate (69.9 ± 9.5%), indicating lower sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) activity. In the lowest COD/SO₄²⁻ ratios (9–20), a deterioration in the removal of organic matter (87.0 ± 1.3%) and VFA (69.8 ± 15.5%) was observed, accompanied by sulfate removal increase (92.9 ± 2.6%). A significant correlation between COD fractions removed via methanogenesis and sulfidogenesis and the COD/SO₄²⁻ ratio was found, indicating that the increase of this ratio is beneficial to the methanogenic archaea activity. The occurrence of sulfidogenesis, favored by the lower COD/SO₄²⁻ ratios, induced the microbial soluble products (SMP) and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) release and protein/carbohydrate ratio increase in the mixed liquor, contributing to the filtration resistance increase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArchaea 3aanaerobic treatment 3acarbohydrates 3achemical oxygen demand 3aethanol production 3afiltration 3amembrane bioreactors 3amethane production 3amethanogens 3aorganic matter 3apolymers 3aseasonal variation 3asulfate-reducing bacteria 3asulfates 3asulfuric acid 3avinasse 3avolatile fatty acids 3awastewater 0aAnaerobic digestion 0aPollutant removal 0aSugarcane vinasse 0aSulfidogenesis 0aMembrane fouling1 aMagalhães, Natalie Cristine1 aCunha, Paulo Vitor Martinelli1 aAmaral, Miriam Cristina Santos1 aKoch, Konrad1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5425-01690 tJournal of environmental management.g2020 Apr. 01, v. 259 p.110034-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.1100343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02264naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005500146245006500201300001800266520103200284592002801316650001201344650001501356650001901371650003001390650001901420650001101439650003101450650001901481650001401500700005501514700001601569700002301585700002201608773017101630856008001801852000901881655001201890IND60600862020221122010352.0180704e20170405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060086202DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.6b044442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJia, Dening1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7515-540010aHeat Transfer in a Pulsed Fluidized Bed of Biomass Particles  ap. 3740-3756.  aBed-to-surface heat transfer coefficients of various biomass particles were measured in a pulsed fluidized bed. Effects of flow rate, pulsation frequency, particle size distribution, fines, and vibration on heat transfer were investigated. Higher gas flow rates generally yielded higher heat transfer coefficients. Natural frequency was found to be optimum as it offered ample bed movement and internal solid circulation without too much inactivity between pulsation cycles. Heat transfer was also heavily influenced by the interaction between gas convective and particle convective heat transfer, which was verified by the proposed heat transfer model. Two mechanisms, one of which treated the flow-on and flow-off period within a pulsation cycle individually, the other utilized the actual bubble rise velocity obtained via high-speed imaging were identified to account for the significantly different flow behavior below and above natural frequency. Good agreement was observed between experimental data and modeled results.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3aconvection 3afluidized beds 3aheat transfer coefficient 3aimage analysis 3amodels 3aparticle size distribution 3aprocess design 3avibration1 aBi, Xiaotao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9514-36851 aLim, C.

The structural characterization, physical property and antioxidant activity of PA grafted CS (PA-g-CS) was investigated. As results, three copolymers with different grafting ratios (61.64, 190.11 and 279.69mg PAE/g) were obtained by varying the molar ratios of reaction substrates. PA-g-CS showed the same UV absorption peaks as PA at 258 and 292nm. As compared to CS, PA-g-CS exhibited a decreased band at 1596cm−1 and a new band at 1716cm−1, suggesting the formation of amide and ester linkages between PA and CS. New proton signals at δ6.77–7⋅33ppm were observed on 1H NMR spectrum of PA-g-CS, assigning to the methine protons of PA. Signals at δ 150.8–116.6 ppm on 13C NMR spectrum of PA-g-CS was assigned to the aromatic ring carbon of PA moieties. All the structural information confirmed the successful grafting of PA onto CS. SEM observation showed CS had a smooth surface, while PA-g-CS had a rough surface. TGA revealed the thermal stability of PA-g-CS was lower than CS. Antioxidant activity assays further verified the reducing power and DDPH radical scavenging activity of PA-g-CS was much higher than CS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aantioxidant activity 3acarbon 3achitosan 3acomposite polymers 3acrosslinking 3afree radical scavengers 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aprotocatechuic acid 3aprotons 3ascanning electron microscopy 3athermal stability 0aCarbodiimide 0aCharacterization 0aChitosan 0aProtocatechuic acid1 aMeng, Chen-guang1 aYan, Ye-hua1 aShan, Ya-na1 aKan, Juan1 aJin, Chang-hai0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2016 Aug., v. 89 p.518-526dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2016.04.0893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03711naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245013100166300001600297520238500313592002802698650001202726650002502738650001102763650001902774650001902793650000902812650001902821650002302840650001602863650001602879650001702895651001002912653001502922653002102937653001902958653003002977653002103007653001703028700002003045773010503065856008603170852000903256655001203265IND60539822420221122155812.0190318e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053982242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2015.10.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAgilan, V.10aDetection and attribution of non-stationarity in intensity and frequency of daily and 4-h extreme rainfall of Hyderabad, India  ap. 677-697.  aThe high intensity rainfall has a significant contribution in urban area flooding and understanding this high intensity rainfall over urban areas may help us to reduce the damage caused by urban floods. In this study, the changes in Hyderabad city daily and sub-daily (4-h) extreme rainfall are analyzed using various climate change detection indices. Our analysis indicates that there is increasing trend in intensity and frequency of Hyderabad city daily extreme rainfall. In addition, increasing trend in intensity and frequency of monsoon months’ (June–August) 1a.m. to 4a.m., 5p.m. to 8p.m. and 9p.m. to 12a.m. and non-monsoon months’ 5p.m. to 8p.m. extreme rainfall is also observed. Based on recent theoretical development in the Extreme Value Theory (EVT), the changes in extreme rainfall of Hyderabad city are further attributed through modelling the non-stationarity (trend) present in the extreme rainfall intensity and frequency. The extreme rainfall intensity is modelled with peaks-over-threshold (POT) based Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) and frequency is modelled using inhomogeneous Poisson distribution. The trend is incorporated as covariate in the scale parameter (σ) of the GPD and the rate parameter (λ) of the Poisson distribution. In this study, four physical processes, i.e. Urbanization, El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle, local temperature changes, and global warming are used as covariates. Further, the combinations of these covariates are also considered for modelling the non-stationarity.Based on covariates and their combinations, fifteen non-stationary models and one stationary model are constructed and the best model is chosen based on the corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) value. The covariate(s) in the best chosen non-stationary statistical model is/are attributed as the most significant physical process/processes which causes non-stationarity in the series. The study results indicate that the non-stationarity in daily extreme rainfall of Hyderabad city is mostly associated with global processes, i.e. ENSO cycle and global warming and the non-stationarity in sub-daily (4-h) extreme rainfall is mostly associated with local processes, i.e. Urbanization and local temperature changes. It is also observed that, in most of the cases, the stationary model is not even considerable based on AICc value.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3aPoisson distribution 3afloods 3aglobal warming 3amonsoon season 3arain 3arain intensity 3astatistical models 3atemperature 3aurban areas 3aurbanization 3aIndia 0aENSO cycle 0aExtreme rainfall 0aGlobal warming 0aLocal temperature changes 0aNon-stationarity 0aUrbanization1 aUmamahesh, N.V.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2015 Nov., v. 530 p.677-697dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2015.10.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02055naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245013900162500001500301520078600316592002801102650003101130650002001161650001001181650001901191650002001210650001501230653001801245653001901263653002501282653002201307653002701329653001901356653001701375700002601392700002501418700002001443773009401463856007901557852000901636655001201645IND60478528420221119031656.0160124e20141204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047852842DNAL7 a10.1556/AAlim.2014.00122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChaikham, P.10aStorage stability of physical and biochemical parameters of pressurized and heat treated <i>Nam Prig Nhum</i> (Thai-green-chili paste)  a2019-12-06  aAlteration of physical and chemical qualities of pressurized and heat treated <i>Nam Prig Nhum</i> (Thai-green-chili paste) was thoroughly assessed upon storage for eight weeks.

However, higher amount of capsaicinoids were retained in pressurized than in heat treated products.  aPublisher supplied data 3alinoleate 13S-lipoxygenase 3astorage quality 3acolor 3aheat treatment 3aenzyme activity 3aperoxidase 0asterilization 0apressurization 0a<i>Nam Prig Nhum</i> 0astorage stability 0aThai-green-chili paste 0apasteurization 0alipoxygenase1 aApichartsrangkoon, A.1 aSrisajjalertwaja, S.1 aPhanchaisri, C.0 tActa alimentaria.g, v. 44, no. 3dAkadémiai KiadówJournal:J000000038x0139-30067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556/AAlim.2014.00123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03645naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006600151245008500217520214500302592002802447650001502475650001302490650002402503650001402527650001302541650001502554650001502569650001602584650002202600651001202622653003502634653002802669653001602697653001702713653002102730653003802751700001702789700002102806700002402827700005702851700001902908700002402927700002402951773012702975856005203102852000903154655001203163IND60793218820221120190145.0220914e20221110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079321882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1340342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSafhi, Amine El Mahdi,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7381-238210aCharacterizations and potential recovery pathways of phosphate mines waste rocks  aThe phosphate ore production is steadily increasing due to its high demand for agriculture, medicine, and others. Ore extraction generates a considerable quantity of waste rocks that are generally stocked in piles. The current research aims to investigate the characterization of phosphate mine waste rocks (PMWR) generated in Benguerir, Morocco mine site. As a part of a wide project aiming to recycle those stockpiles, sensor-based ore sorting will be employed to separate the different lithologies. As a prior investigation before implementing this technology, two samples of 25 tons from the destoning and screening PMWR piles were sampled and submitted to manual sorting. The latter operation revealed the presence of different lithologies including indured phosphate, different types of siliceous, carbonate, phosphorus, and marly rock types. Those waste rocks were characterized physically, chemically, and mineralogically. Their potential uses for recycling or upcycling was investigated and addressed. About 25% of indured phosphate was found, which can be first recovered by ore sorting. This reserve of residual phosphate could be recovered using beneficiation methods. The flintstone, phosphated flintstone, and dolomitic limestone exhibit good physical and mechanical properties that meet the requirements to produce concrete. The silexite and siliceous marls have a low density and could be used as lightweight aggregate for non-structural concrete blocks production. The investigation on tender marls corroborates the literature and their suitability as alternative binders or as supplementary cementitious materials. Those marls could be used as well as lime binder for repairing historical buildings or as hydraulic lime binder for road construction. PMWR valorization as road construction materials was already proved. However, studying this remediation pathway after the recovery of phosphate and other lithologies by ore sorting is highly recommended. The recycling of those by-products will decrease the natural resources consumption in the civil engineering field alongside with resolving their environmental problems.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbonates 3aconcrete 3adolomitic limestone 3alithology 3amedicine 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3aremediation 3aroad construction 3aMorocco 0aLinear attenuation coefficient 0aMining circular economy 0aOre sorting 0aValorization 0aWaste management 0aPhosphate mine waste rocks (PMWR)1 aAmar, Hicham1 aEl Berdai, Yahya1 aEl Ghorfi, Mustapha1 aTaha, Yassine1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3193-10461 aHakkou, Rachid1 aAl-Dahhan, Muthanna1 aBenzaazoua, Mostafa0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Nov. 10, v. 374 p.134034-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.134034  aDNAL 7aarticle02383naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245011400169300001600283520094100299592002801240650001101268650001401279650002601293650001801319650001701337650001201354650002201366650002001388650001301408650002301421650002401444650004301468650001201511650000901523650002401532650002301556653001801579653002001597653003001617700001401647700001501661700001401676773011601690856008601806852000901892655001201901IND60529426720221119193034.0161019e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052942672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2016.05.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yanlong10aAnti-diabetic effect of citrus pectin in diabetic rats and potential mechanism via PI3K/Akt signaling pathway  ap. 484-488.  aThis study was performed to investigate the anti-diabetic effect of citrus pectin in type 2 diabetic rats and its potential mechanism of action. The results showed that fasting blood glucose levels were significantly decreased after 4 weeks of citrus pectin administration. Citrus pectin improved glucose tolerance, hepatic glycogen content and blood lipid levels (TG, TC, LDL-c and HDL-c) in diabetic rats. Citrus pectin also significantly reduced insulin resistance, which played an important role in the resulting anti-diabetic effect. Moreover, after the pectin treatment, phosphorylated Akt expression was upregulated and GSK3β expression was downregulated, indicating that the potential anti-diabetic mechanism of citrus pectin might occur through regulation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Together, these results suggested that citrus pectin could ameliorate type 2 diabetes and potentially be used as an adjuvant treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aadjuvants 3aanimal disease models 3ablood glucose 3ablood lipids 3afasting 3aglucose tolerance 3aglycemic effect 3aglycogen 3ainsulin resistance 3amechanism of action 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apectins 3arats 3asignal transduction 3atau-protein kinase 0aCitrus pectin 0aType 2 diabetes 0aInsulin signaling pathway1 aDong, Man1 aYang, Ziyu1 aPan, Siyi0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2016 Aug., v. 89 p.484-488dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2016.05.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02887naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005800146245012800204300001800332520137600350592002801726650001501754650002201769650001401791650002301805650001301828650001601841650001701857650001101874650000701885650001501892650001901907650002401926650002601950700005701976700005502033700001802088700001502106700001702121700001502138700001602153773017102169856008002340852000902420655001202429IND60600862120221122031801.0180704e20170405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060086212DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.6b044632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Shaolong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2566-980310aNitrogen Oxide Removal from Simulated Flue Gas by UV-Irradiated Sodium Chlorite Solution in a Bench-Scale Scrubbing Reactor  ap. 3671-3678.  aUltraviolet irradiated sodium chlorite (UV/NaClO₂) solution was introduced to remove nitrogen oxide (NOₓ) from simulated flue gas in a bench-scale scrubbing reactor. Effects of UV irradiation time, NaClO₂ concentration, NO inlet concentration, pH value, and O₂ concentration were investigated separately. Results showed that NaClO₂ solution with UV pretreatment achieved a remarkable promotion in NOₓ removal efficiency. The ClO₂ produced from photodecomposition of NaClO₂ in aqueous solution substantially improved the NO absorption process. The NOₓ removal efficiency by UV/NaClO₂ solution increased from 28 to 77% as the UV irradiation time increased from 0 to 600 s. When the NaClO₂ concentration increased, the NOₓ removal efficiency by UV/NaClO₂ solution increased, whereas the enhancement factor decreased. The NO absorption rate by UV/NaClO₂ solution increased with NO inlet concentration. The NOₓ removal efficiency by UV/NaClO₂ solution was higher than that by NaClO₂ solution without UV pretreatment at a pH range of 3–12. The reaction mechanisms of the NO removal process were suggested to be different in acid and alkaline media. The UV/NaClO₂ process was demonstrated to significantly improve NOₓ removal efficiency, which might be developed to be a potentially cost-effective method for removing NOₓ from flue gas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3achlorites 3acost effectiveness 3aflue gas 3airradiation 3anitric oxide 3aoxygen 3apH 3aphotolysis 3aprocess design 3areaction mechanisms 3aultraviolet radiation1 aPan, Xinxiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0251-56791 aHan, Zhitao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5501-60671 aZheng, Dekang1 aYu, Jingqi1 aXia, Pengfei1 aLiu, Bojun1 aYan, Zhijun0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2017 Apr. 05, v. 56, no. 13 p.3671-3678dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.6b044633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02276naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003600133040001800169100002000187245005300207300001400260506007600274520079900350592002801149506003701177650001301214650001001227650001101237650001301248650001401261650001401275650002101289650006801310650004901378650001201427650002101439650001101460650005501471650001101526650003901537650000901576700002401585773010601609856008201715852000901797655001201806IND4477537620221207085226.0141111e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447753762DNAL7 a213926512pmid7 aPMC30737302pmcid7 a10.1016/j.cveq.2010.12.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHart, Kelsey A.10aAdrenocortical Insufficiency in Horses and Foals  ap. 19-34.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe adrenal cortices produce various steroid hormones that play vital roles in several physiologic processes. Although permanent adrenocortical insufficiency is rare in all species, emerging evidence in both human and equine medicine suggests that transient reversible adrenocortical dysfunction resulting in cortisol insufficiency frequently develops during critical illness. This syndrome is termed relative adrenal insufficiency (RAI) or critical illness–related corticosteroid insufficiency (CIRCI) and can contribute substantially to morbidity and mortality associated with the primary disease. This review discusses the mechanisms, diagnosis, and clinical consequences of adrenocortical insufficiency, with particular focus on the current understanding of RAI/CIRCI in horses and foals.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acortisol 3afoals 3ahumans 3amedicine 3amorbidity 3amortality 3asteroid hormones 2aAddison Diseasexbloodxdiagnosisxphysiopathologyxveterinary. 2aAdrenal Cortexxmetabolismxphysiopathology. 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Newborn 2aFemale 2aHorse Diseasesxbloodxdiagnosisxphysiopathology. 2aHorses 2aHydrocortisonexbloodxdeficiency. 2aMale1 aBarton, Michelle H.0 tVeterinary clinics of North America.g2011 Apr., v. 27, no. 1 p.19-34dElsevier Inc.x0749-07397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cveq.2010.12.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04243naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003300151245008200184520257500266592002802841650002102869650001302890650001502903650001402918650001402932650001202946650001302958650001302971650001802984650001403002650001103016650001303027650000903040650001003049650001203059650001103071650001703082650001303099653001903112653001403131653002003145653001403165653001203179653001403191653002003205700006103225700007103286700006203357700006203419773011303481856008603594852000903680655001203689IND60793218920221120185944.0220921e20221110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079321892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1340362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbbas-Abadi, Mehrdad Seifali10aTowards full recyclability of end-of-life tires: Challenges and opportunities  aEnd-of-life tires are discarded on a daily basis but even at present limited action has been taken towards boosting their recyclability as most of the tires are either incinerated or landfilled/stockpiled. The complexity of tires has also been drastically increased, with little attention to designing them specifically for recycling. The retreading process is currently under intense development, and end-of-life tires have the ability to be retread up to several times. Furthermore, powdering (pulverization and grinding) the tires and separating steel and textile from this stream is a promising route that has found expanding applications. The particle size and surface area of the produced powder, purity, rubber degradation, and the cost of equipment and production are the determining factors. Assessing all these factors shows that sc-CO₂ pulverization is the most promising method overall in this respect. In terms of process-ability, devulcanization has received a lot of attention from the tire recycling industry, and numerous physical, chemical, and microbial processes and combinations are being developed to be industrialized in the near future. Nevertheless none of these processes is currently at a high enough technological readiness level to be operated at large scale. Literature data shows that extrusion in combination with an ultrasonic horn or sc-CO₂ using diphenyl disulfide has the most potential. In the dissolution extraction process, in addition to breaking sulfur bonds, solvent extraction devulcanizes and separates rubber from other tire components at low temperatures. The purity of the extracted products e.g., rubber, carbon black (CB) and minerals in this way is much higher than that of other recycling methods. Since applications of mentioned recycled products (powder and devulcanized tire) are limited, tire pyrolysis has become extremely important. Process parameters and reactor design play a significant role in degradation mechanisms and pyrolysis products e.g., light olefins and dienes, naphthenes, mono-aromatics, tar, polar aromatics and coke. Catalytic pyrolysis with promoted zeolites leads to larger yields of valuable products at the expense of the formation of tar and so-called polar aromatics, i.e. N/S/O containing aromatics. In addition, upgrading processes, e.g., hydro-treating can reduce polar aromatics in the pyrolysis products by up to 90%. Furthermore, the demineralization of pyrolytic carbon black and activated carbon production are promising processes that result in increased tire recovery rates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3abiphenyl 3adisulfides 3aequipment 3aextrusion 3afabrics 3agrinding 3aindustry 3aparticle size 3apyrolysis 3arubber 3asolvents 3asoot 3asteel 3astreams 3asulfur 3asurface area 3azeolites 0aTire recycling 0aPowdering 0aDevulcanization 0aPyrolysis 0aKinetic 0aMechanism 0aPolar aromatics1 aKusenberg, Marvin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3733-32931 aShirazi, Hamed Mohamadzadeh1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9448-23001 aGoshayeshi, Bahman1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8723-50451 aVan Geem, Kevin M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4191-49600 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Nov. 10, v. 374 p.134036-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1340363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03861naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245011600182300001600298520153000314592002801844650001901872650002001891650001701911650001501928650001801943650002801961650001601989650001302005650001302018650001302031650001802044650002402062650001902086650001102105650002302116650000902139650001902148650001102167650002502178650002102203650003202224650003202256650001202288650003902300650002802339650002502367650001002392650006302402650001102465650002802476650005202504650003702556650001802593650000902611650000902620650004702629650002202676650000902698650001702707650003702724700002202761700002102783700001802804700002302822700001502845700001802860773011102878856008102989852000903070655001203079IND4468524820221119182233.0141111e20111208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446852482DNAL7 a220411062pmid7 a10.1016/j.jep.2011.10.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaskar, Sagar10aEvaluation of antihyperglycemic activity of Cocos nucifera Linn. on streptozotocin induced type 2 diabetic rats  ap. 769-773.  aETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The plant Cocos nucifera Linn. (Arecaceae) is commonly known as coconut. Traditionally the juice of the young spadix when fresh is used in diarrhea and diabetes. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of antidiabetic activity and effect on lipid profile as well as cardioprotective effect of hydro-methanol extract of Cocos nucifera (HECN) on streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After 72h of STZ (50mg/kg, b.w. i.p.) administration, animals showing plasma sugar level more than 250mg/dl were considered as diabetic rat. Fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels were measured on 0th (after 72h of STZ), 5th, 10th, and 15th day. On the 15th day all the animals were sacrificed and the serum biochemical parameters and antioxidant enzyme status were measured. RESULTS: HECN treated animals showed a significant reduction in FBG level as compared with diabetic control group. Serum enzyme level (SGOT, SGPT, SALP), lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzyme level such as CAT, GSH, SOD and cholesterol and triglycerides in the HECN treated groups were restored towards normal level as compared to diabetic control groups and the values were comparable with the standard groups (glibenclamide). CONCLUSION: Improvement in the FBG and the restoration of all other biomarker as well as enzymes indicates that HECN has very good antidiabetic activity with very low side effects and provides a scientific rationale for the use as an antidiabetic agent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCocos nucifera 3aadverse effects 3aantioxidants 3abiomarkers 3ablood glucose 3acardioprotective effect 3acholesterol 3acoconuts 3adiabetes 3adiarrhea 3aglibenclamide 3ahypoglycemic agents 3ainflorescences 3ajuices 3alipid peroxidation 3arats 3astreptozotocin 3asugars 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atriacylglycerols 2aAlanine Transaminasexblood 2aAlkaline Phosphatasexblood 2aAnimals 2aAspartate Aminotransferasesxblood 2aBlood Glucosexanalysis 2aCatalasexmetabolism 2aCocos 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Experimentalxdrug therapyxmetabolism. 2aFemale 2aGlutathionexmetabolism 2aHypoglycemic Agentsxtherapeutic usextoxicity. 2aLipid Peroxidationxdrug effects 2aLipidsxblood 2aMale 2aMice 2aPlant Extractsxtherapeutic usextoxicity. 2aPlants, Medicinal 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aSuperoxide Dismutasexmetabolism1 aMazumder, Upal K.1 aPramanik, Goutam1 aGupta, Malaya1 aSuresh Kumar, R.B.1 aBala, Asis1 aIslam, Aminul0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2011 Dec. 8, v. 138, no. 3 p.769-773dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2011.10.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02652naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245014400165300001800309520160200327592002801929650002201957650002701979650001902006650001102025650001302036650002302049650001602072700001702088700002602105773010002131856008602231852000902317655001202326IND60577295020221120091520.0170807e20150901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057729502DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b019952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Delin10aMultistep Molecular Dynamics Simulations Identify the Highly Cooperative Activity of Melittin in Recognizing and Stabilizing Membrane Pores  ap. 9388-9401.  aThe prototypical antimicrobial peptide, melittin, is well-known for its ability to induce pores in zwitterionic model lipid membranes. However, the mechanism by which melittin accomplishes this is not fully understood. We have conducted all-atom and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations which suggest that melittin employs a highly cooperative mechanism for the induction of both small and large membrane pores. The process by which this peptide induces membrane pores appears to be driven by its affinity to membrane defects via its N-terminus region. In our simulations, a membrane defect was deliberately created through either lipid flip-flop or the reorientation of one adsorbed melittin peptide. In a cooperative response, other melittin molecules also inserted their N-termini into the created defect, thus lowering the overall free energy. The insertion of these peptide molecules ultimately allowed the defect to develop into a small transmembrane pore, with an estimated diameter of ∼1.5 nm and a lifetime of the order of tens of milliseconds. In the presence of a finite membrane tension, we show that this small pore can act as a nucleation site for the stochastic rupture of the lipid bilayer, so as to create a much larger pore. We found that a threshold membrane tension of 25 mN/m was needed to create a ruptured pore. Furthermore, by actively accumulating at its edge, adsorbed peptides are able to cooperatively stabilize this larger pore. The defect-mediated pore formation mechanism revealed in this work may also apply to other amphipathic membrane-active peptides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aantimicrobial peptides 3alipid bilayers 3alipids 3amelittin 3amolecular dynamics 3azwitterions1 aForsman, Jan1 aWoodward, Clifford E.0 tLangmuir.g2015 Sept. 01, v. 31, no. 34 p.9388-9401dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.5b019953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03152naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245008000167300001600247520173600263592002801999650001802027650000802045650001102053650001402064650001302078650001002091650001502101650000902116650002702125650001302152650001702165650001202182653001902194653001402213653001202227653001402239653002202253653001302275653001202288653001202300653002902312653002202341700001502363700001602378773015702394856008602551852000902637655001202646IND60111876720221122231511.0200804e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011187672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.05.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEdgar, J.L.10aProtective mother hens: cognitive influences on the avian maternal response  ap. 223-229.  aWe previously demonstrated that domestic hens, Gallus gallus domesticus, show behavioural and physiological responses when witnessing mild chick distress, and possess the underlying foundations of emotional empathy. However, no studies have determined how cognitive influences affect empathic processes in birds. A fundamental question is whether a mother hen's response to chick distress is mediated by her knowledge about the situation or by chick distress cues. We therefore investigated how manipulating hen and chick knowledge influences hens' responses to chick distress. Each hen's brood of chicks was split into three groups, based on whether they had the same, opposite or no knowledge about a potentially threatening situation (environmental cues signalling air puff administration). We compared hens' behavioural, vocal and physiological responses (heart rate, heart rate variability and surface body temperature) to actual and perceived threat to their chicks. Hens increased maternal vocalizations and walking, and decreased preening, when they perceived their chicks to be threatened, regardless of the chicks' reactions to the situation. Hens exhibited signs of stress-induced hyperthermia only when their perception of threat was in accordance with that of their chicks. Chick behaviour was influenced by the hens' expectations, with all chick groups spending more time distress vocalizing and less time preening when in the environment that the hen associated with threat. We conclude that the protective maternal response of domestic hens is not solely driven by chick distress cues; rather, hens integrate these with their own knowledge to produce a potentially adaptive, flexible and context-dependent response.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGallus gallus 3aair 3achicks 3acognition 3adistress 3afever 3aheart rate 3ahens 3aphysiological response 3apreening 3avocalization 3awalking 0aanimal welfare 0abehaviour 0achicken 0acognition 0acognitive empathy 0adistress 0aemotion 0aempathy 0aGallus gallus domesticus 0amaternal response1 aPaul, E.S.1 aNicol, C.J.0 tAnimal behaviour.g2013 Aug., v. 86, no. 2 p.223-229dElsevier LtdaThe Association for the Study of Animal BehaviourwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.05.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04016naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245007700165520253500242592002802777650002502805650001802830650002302848650002902871650001902900650001502919650001802934650001402952650001702966650001702983650001203000650001503012651001003027651001703037653001603054653001803070653002403088653002703112700005503139700001603194700001703210700001503227700001403242700002003256700002103276773011803297856008603415852000903501655001203510IND60684654020221119134633.0201104e20200401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068465402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1100702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Yanan14aThe size and distribution of tidal creeks affects salt marsh restoration  aSalt marshes are changeable and important ecosystems that currently face various threats, including global climate change and human activities. The influence of these factors can result in the degradation of salt marshes. Tidal creeks, which are an important source of nutrients and other substances for salt marsh vegetation, play an important role in the health of salt marshes. In this study, the morphological characteristics of tidal creeks and the characteristics of two typical plants, Suaeda glauca (SG) and Phragmites communis (PC), in the Yellow River Delta, China were investigated to determine the effect of tidal creeks on these plants. Aerial photography and field measurements of tidal creeks were carried out from May to July 2018 in the study area. At the same time, nine line-intercepts were set in the vertical direction of tidal creeks to investigate plants. The results showed that different grades of tidal creek exerted no significant influence on the growth of either S. glauca or P. communis. However, unlike grade, the size of a creek and the distance from it had marked effects on these plants. The cross-sectional area of a tidal creek had a significant positive impact on the density of S. glauca (r = 0.39, p = 0.02). For P. communis, the depth of a tidal creek had a strong correlation with this species’ density (r = 0.51, p = 0.04) and height (r = 0.63, p = 0.01). Meanwhile, there was a negative relationship between the distance from tidal creeks and the height of S. glauca (r = −0.52, p = 0.02). Conversely, the height (r = 0 0.90, p = 0.00) and density (r = 0.62, p = 0.01) of P. communis were positively affected by its vertical distance from tidal creeks. We found that the subtidal zone near a tidal creek was more conducive to the recovery and growth of S. glauca, and that areas further away from a tidal creek, located in the intertidal and subtidal zones, were more conducive to the recovery and growth of P. communis. The parameters associated with tidal creeks in the subtidal zone (cross sectional area 4.55 m², distance 0–10 m) were beneficial for the growth of S. glauca. For P. communis, relevant features in the intertidal and subtidal zones (depth 0.40–0.45 m, distance 20–60 m) are useful. Our results suggest that attention should be paid to the effects of size and distribution of tidal creeks during the process of salt marsh restoration. This work also provides practical guidance for the restoration of native salt marshes in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhragmites australis 3aSuaeda glauca 3aaerial photography 3aanthropogenic activities 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3alittoral zone 3anutrients 3ariver deltas 3asalt marshes 3astreams 3avegetation 3aChina 3aYellow River 0aTidal creek 0aSuaeda glauca 0aPhragmites communis 0aSalt marsh restoration1 aLiu, Jiakai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3337-19621 aYan, Guoxin1 aZhai, Jiexiu1 aCong, Ling1 aDai, Liyi1 aZhang, Zhenming1 aZhang, Mingxiang0 tJournal of environmental management.g2020 Apr. 01, v. 259 p.110070-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1100703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03348naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011300170300001600283520182600299592002802125650002002153650002002173650002202193650002102215650002302236650002202259650002702281650001902308650002702327650002502354650001102379651002502390651001302415653002402428653002502452653002002477653002202497653002502519700001802544700005602562700001902618700002002637773011402657856008602771852000902857655001202866IND60630764420221119062930.0191214e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063076442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2019.02.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMele, Caterina14aThe genetic diversity of selections and wild populations of myrtle revealed by molecular geographic contexts  ap. 168-176.  aMyrtus communis L. is an aromatic shrub widely diffused in the Mediterranean area. A growing interest for this species is due to its pharmacological and aromatic properties. This study explored the genetic diversity and population structure of 460 myrtle plants including 46 selections genotypes and 414 wild accessions from Sardinia using 14 SSR markers. Genetic diversity parameters showed that 10 markers were sufficiently polymorphic to move forward in the further analysis. The observed heterozygosity ranged from 0.21 (Porto Ferro) to 0.44 (Olia Speciosa), with an average value of 0.32. This parameter significantly varied considering the genetic origin of the plant (selections and natural), and the localization of the myrtle sampling sites (North, Center and South area) (P < 0.0001). The selections showed an observed heterozygosity’s lower (0.40) compared to the wild group (0.45). Based on the geographic division of Sardinia, North region grouped myrtle accessions with the highest level of genetic diversity (0.45), followed by the Central area (0.43) and the South, that collect the lowest value (0.42). Bayesian clustering analysis divided the myrtle accessions in two principal groups, which are in accordance with the division in selections and natural populations. Significant different distribution of the two clusters was found: one cluster was mainly distributed in the South-Center of Sardinia, while the other cluster was predominant the North area (Pearson, P = 0.003). The results presented in this paper, and in particular the characterization of the in situ conserved germplasm, represent an important step for planning future ex situ collections to reinforce the genetic base of breeding programs, allowing to diversify the industrial potential of products derivatives from myrtle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aMyrtus communis 3abreeding programs 3acluster analysis 3agenetic background 3agenetic variation 3agermplasm conservation 3aheterozygosity 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apopulation structure 3ashrubs 3aMediterranean region 3aSardinia 0aNatural populations 0aSelections genotypes 0aMyrtus communis 0aGenetic diversity 0aHabitat distribution1 aCorona, Lucia1 aMelito, Sara1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4910-23531 aRaggi, Lorenzo1 aMulas, Maurizio0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2019 June, v. 132 p.168-176dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2019.02.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04246naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002600145245013000171506002800301520232500329592002802654506003702682650002002719650001102739650001902750650002602769650001202795650001702807650002302824650002202847650002202869650001202891650000902903650003002912650001602942650001602958650002702974650001703001650001003018651001403028651000903042651001403051651001803065651001503083651001203098653000903110653001303119653001203132653002503144653001503169700002603184700003003210700002503240700003303265700002803298700002403326700002703350700002603377773009203403856008003495852000903575655001203584IND60764594620221215143342.0211122e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076459462DNAL7 a10.13057/biodiv/d2109452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPERTIWI, NI PUTU DIAN10aForensic genetic case study: Species identification and traceability of sea turtle caught in illegal trade in Bali, Indonesia  aResource is Open Access  aPertiwi NPD, Suhendro MD, Yusmalinda NLA, Putra ING, Putri IGRM, Artinigsih EY, Al Malik MD, Cahyani NKD, Sembiring A. 2020. Forensic genetic case study: Species identification and traceability of sea turtle caught in illegal trade in Bali, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 21: 4276-4283. Although known as protected endangered species, sea turtle trade is still occurring, especially in Indonesia. Understanding the species and population origin of sea turtle being sold in the illegal market is crucial for its conservation, where it will reveal the traceability of sea turtle trade to its population origin in the management unit areas. Thus, genetic forensic has been used as a key investigating tool to help with this problem. In this research, we aim to identify the species and population origin of the sea turtle caught and traded in the illegal market in Bali. Of the 20 samples collected from confiscated sea turtle during illegal trade, by-catch, and a traditional restaurant serving sea turtle meat, 17 samples were successfully analyzed and identified using PCR (polymerase chain reaction) methods. The result identified 15 samples as a green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas), while two samples were olive ridley sea turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea). Mixed Stock Analysis (MSA) with Bayesian indicated that the green sea turtle caught in illegal trade in Bali is originated mostly from the rookeries populations in Berau (29.98%), Terengganu (17.84%), Sarawak (14.84%), and Ashmore Reef (11.85%). Meanwhile, 18 other locations only showed the MSA value below 2%, including the locations of Penang and Perak, Vietnam, Perhentian, Redang, Pahang, Mersing, Sabah Turtle Island Park (TIP), Sipadan, Coral Sea, western New Caledonia, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Island and Guam, northern New Guinea, Gulf of Carpenteria, Scott Reef, West Java, North West Self, Cobourg Peninsula, Cocos Keeling Island. Therefore, the exploitation of sea turtle in Bali will impact the decline in the genetic diversity of sea turtles population Indonesia and adjacent locations. Monitoring and protection of sea turtle species in Bali have to be a high priority because Bali is known as the hub for sea turtle illegal trade, and the exploitation of sea turtle in Bali will have an impact on the sea turtle population in other locations.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBayesian theory 3aBorneo 3aChelonia mydas 3aLepidochelys olivacea 3abycatch 3acase studies 3aendangered species 3aforensic sciences 3agenetic variation 3amarkets 3ameat 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arestaurants 3asea turtles 3aspecies identification 3atraceability 3atrade 3aCoral Sea 3aGuam 3aIndonesia 3aNew Caledonia 3aNew Guinea 3aVietnam 0abali 0aforensic 0agenetic 0amixed stock analysis 0asea turtle1 aSUHENDRO, MAULID DIO 1 aNI LUH ASTRIA  YUSMALINDA1 aI NYOMAN GIRI  PUTRA1 aI GUSTI RICCA MAHATMA  PUTRI1 aARTININGSIH, ENEX YUNI 1 aAL-MALIK, M.

Modeling of sub-hourly turbidity as a function of streamflow shows that event model parameters vary on an event-by-event basis. Here we examine the extent to which stream turbidity can be predicted through the prediction of event model parameters. Using three mid-sized streams from the Mid-Atlantic region of the U.S., we show the model parameter set for each event can be predicted based on the event characteristics (e.g., hydrologic, meteorologic and antecedent moisture conditions) using a combined cluster analysis and classification tree approach. The results suggest that the ratio of beginning event discharge to peak event discharge (an estimate of the event baseflow index), as well as catchment antecedent moisture, are important factors in the prediction of event turbidity. Indicators of antecedent moisture, particularly those derived from antecedent discharge, account for the majority of the splitting nodes in the classification trees for all three streams. For this study, prediction of turbidity during streamflow events is based upon observed data (e.g., measured streamflow, precipitation and air temperature). However, the results also suggest that the methods presented here can, in future work, be used in conjunction with forecasts of streamflow, precipitation and air temperature to forecast stream turbidity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3aantecedent moisture 3abase flow 3acluster analysis 3ahydrograph 3amodels 3aprediction 3astreams 3aturbidity 3awatersheds 3aMid-Atlantic region 3aUnited States 0aTurbidity 0aEvent model 0aPrediction 0aForecasting 0aStream water quality1 aJohnson, Richard L.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2015 Nov., v. 530 p.751-761dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2015.10.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02947naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245008800163300001600251500001500267520161600282592002801898650002201926650002901948650001601977650001201993650004102005650002002046650002302066650003802089650001002127650002302137650003702160650001402197650000902211653001802220700001202238700001702250700001602267700001602283773011202299856008102411852000902492655001202501IND60441783120221121063811.0151027e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044178312DNAL7 a10.1007/s11626-015-9914-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Zheng10aFAK activity is required for HGF to suppress TGF-β1-induced cellular proliferation  ap. 941-949.  a2019-12-06  aDue to the complex nature of the tendon architecture, the regeneration of these tissues results in the formation of scars. As a direct result of scar formation, the ability of the tendon tissues to function is impaired and often results in further damage that has been afflicted to the tendon architecture. The growth and proliferation of tendon fibroblasts involve a complex network of signalling molecules. To understand and aid in the proper repair of this complex tissue network, a more in-depth understanding is required in the events that induce the growth of tendon cells. Several studies have shown the apoptotic mechanisms induced by the mitogen, hepatocyte growth factor, in multiple biological and pathological systems. In our recent research, we have described a mechanism where hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is able to inhibit the proliferative effects of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and induce apoptosis in rat tendon fibroblasts. Transforming growth factor-β1 is able to induce the proliferation of fibroblast cells by increasing both the gene expression and protein levels of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and c-MET. We have also shown that inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 does not block hepatocyte growth factor-induced growth arrest. However, we have shown that blocking the activity of focal adhesion kinase can prevent the growth inhibition ability of hepatocyte growth factor in tendon fibroblasts. Collectively, our studies show growth inhibitory pathway in tendon fibroblasts induced by hepatocyte growth factor and mediated focal adhesion kinase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aprotein synthesis 3ahepatocyte growth factor 3afibroblasts 3amuscles 3anon-specific protein-tyrosine kinase 3agene expression 3agrowth retardation 3atransforming growth factor beta 1 3aactin 3acell proliferation 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aapoptosis 3arats 0agrowth arrest1 aSun, Yu1 aYang, Sulong1 aCui, Qingbo1 aLi, Zhaozhu0 tIn vitro cellular & developmental biology.g2015 Oct., v. 51, no. 9 p.941-949dSpringer USx1071-26907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11626-015-9914-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02349naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245014000160500001900300520105300319592002801372650001101400650002201411650004601433650001301479650000901492650001401501650001001515650001601525653001401541653002601555653002401581653003101605700001101636700001401647700001601661700001901677700001501696773012401711856008301835852000901918655001201927IND60719385120221120180909.0201230e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071938512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2020.1049802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCui, Da10aPyrolysis temperature effect on compositions of basic nitrogen species in Huadian shale oil using positive-ion ESI FT-ICR MS and GC-NCD  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPositive-ion electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI FT-ICR MS) and gas chromatography-nitrogen chemiluminescence detection (GC-NCD) was used to study the effect of pyrolysis temperature (400℃, 430℃, 460℃, 490℃, and 520℃) on basic nitrogen compounds in Huadian shale oil. Because of the effect of secondary cracking, the relative contents of aliphatic amines and anilines decreased with increase in pyrolysis temperature. The relative abundances of N₁ classes decreased first but later increased. The relative abundances of N₂OX and N₃OX increased first but later decreased, and reached the maximum at 460 °C, which were 21.47 % and 5.27 %, respectively. As the pyrolysis temperature increased, the relative abundance of the N₁ classes within the carbon number ranged from 10 to 30 obviously increased. In conclusion, the pyrolysis temperature had an effect on the number, relative abundance, DBE distribution and carbon number distribution of heteroatom compounds in shale oil.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3achemiluminescence 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3anitrogen 3aoils 3apyrolysis 3ashale 3atemperature 0aShale oil 0aPyrolysis temperature 0aHeteroatom compound 0aPositive-ion ESI FT-ICR MS1 aLi, Ji1 aZhang, Xu1 aZhang, Ling1 aChang, Hongyun1 aWang, Qing0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2021 Jan., v. 153 p.104980-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6382x0165-23707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2020.1049803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03065naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245007300161300001400234500001500248520141800263592002801681650001601709650002501725650002001750650001001770650001401780650002601794650001501820650001701835650002901852650001101881650000901892650002501901650001201926650001901938650001301957650002101970650002301991650001802014650002102032653001702053653003002070653003102100653002602131700001402157700001702171700001502188700001802203700001402221700001902235700001602254773011402270856008202384852000902466655001202475IND60625988720221116160945.0190131e20190325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062598872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2018.12.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yuhua10aParis saponin VII reverses chemoresistance in breast MCF-7/ADR cells  ap. 47-54.  a2019-12-06  aThe development of a multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype is a main obstacle to the successful treatment of breast cancer. Saponins of several herbs are considered as promising candidates for drug resistance treatment. We extracted Paris saponin VII (PS VII) from Trillium tschonoskii Maxim. and investigated whether it could sensitize chemoresistant breast cancer cells MCF-7/ADR to the cytotoxic effects of adriamycin.MCF-7/ADR cells were exposed to 0.5 μM PSVII plus different concentrations of adriamycin (0–100 μM). Then, MTT assay and adriamycin accumulation assay were used to assess cell proliferation and intracellular adriamycin retention. P glycoprotein levels and intracellular rhodamine 123 (Rh-123) accumulations were investigated to measure the expression and activity of P-glycoprotein. A xenograft model of nude mouse was utilized to observe the effect of PSVII in vivo.Treatment with PSVII influenced cell viability of MCF-7/ADR cells, as well as sensitized MCF-7/ADR cells to the cytotoxic effects of adriamycin. Moreover, PSVII significantly downregulated MDR1 expression in MCF-7/ADR cells. Intravenous administration of PSVII significantly enhanced anticancer efficacy of adriamycin to MCF-7/ADR xenograft model in nude mice.These findings suggested a possible application of PSVII in combination with chemotherapy and/or as neo-adjuvant therapy in the treatment of MDR breast cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3adoxorubicin 3atraditional medicine 3aP-glycoproteins 3aherbs 3aphenotype 3aintravenous injection 3arhodamines 3acytotoxicity 3amultiple drug resistance 3amodels 3amice 3aTrillium tschonoskii 3abreasts 3aneoplasm cells 3asaponins 3atoxicity testing 3acell proliferation 3aglycoproteins 3abreast neoplasms 0adrug therapy 0aParis saponin VII (PSVII) 0aMultidrug resistance (MDR) 0aP-glycoprotein (P-gp)1 aSun, Yang1 aTang, Tianle1 aNiu, Yinbo1 aLi, Xiaoqiang1 aXie, Ming1 aJin, Hongchuan1 aMei, Qibing0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2019 Mar. 25, v. 232 p.47-54dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2018.12.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03175naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001100147245014000158300002000298520149900318592002801817650002201845650003701867650001501904650001401919650002001933650001501953650001401968650001501982650001501997650001902012650001102031650001802042650001302060650001902073650002402092650001702116650002102133650001202154650003702166650003102203700001802234700001702252700001302269700001902282700001802301700001602319700005302335773015502388856008102543852000902624655001202633IND60596661720221118191419.0180619e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059666172DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-018-1767-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Ji10aCrystallization of microporous TiO2 through photochemical deposition of Pt for photocatalytic degradation of volatile organic compounds  ap. 15662-15670.  aThe photocatalytic mineralization efficiency of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is determined by adsorption of reactants, separation of charge carriers, and reaction activity of catalyst surface. Herein, we provide a strategy to synthesize a novel catalyst, namely, PhPt-Micro, which is characterized by high adsorption ability, charge separation efficiency, and surface reaction activity. Toluene was chosen as the model VOC. The effects of photochemical deposition of Pt on the physical properties of microporous amorphous TiO₂ (Micro) and toluene mineralization were studied using N₂ adsorption/desorption, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, GC-flame ionization detection, and surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPS) analyses. After photochemical treatment, the structure of Micro was optimized, and Pt nanoparticles were successfully deposited at the outlet of electrons on the catalyst surface. SPS result proved that the optimized structure enhanced the separation efficiency of charge carriers and the migration of photo-generated electrons to the PhPt-Micro surface. The quasi-equilibrium adsorption amount of toluene over PhPt-Micro was two times higher than that with commercial nano TiO₂ (P25). The micropores concentrated toluene on the catalyst surface and hindered intermediate desorption. The mineralization efficiency of toluene over PhPt-Micro was 2.4 and 5.9 times higher than those over Micro and P25, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3acatalysts 3acrystallization 3adesorption 3aelectrons 3aionization 3amicropores 3amineralization 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3anitrogen 3aphotocatalysis 3aphysical properties 3aporous media 3atitanium dioxide 3atoluene 3atransmission electron microscopy 3avolatile organic compounds1 aWang, Yanhong1 aTian, Yiyuan1 aHe, Xuan1 aYang, Pingping1 aYuan, Minghui1 aCao, Yuqing1 aLyu, Jinze1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6505-42400 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2018 June, v. 25, no. 16 p.15662-15670dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x1614-74997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-1767-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02437naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245010700164300001600271520111300287592002801400650001301428650001501441650002101456650002101477650002201498650002701520650001901547650001501566650001201581650002101593650001701614650002201631650002301653650001401676700002101690700001901711700001901730700002101749700001901770773011201789856008101901852000901982655001201991IND60441783220221121063640.0151027e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044178322DNAL7 a10.1007/s11626-015-9925-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMin, Seul Ki10aRegulation of astrocyte activity via control over stiffness of cellulose acetate electrospun nanofiber  ap. 933-940.  aAstrocytes are involved in neuron protection following central nervous system (CNS) injury; accordingly, engineered astrocytes have been investigated for their usefulness in cell therapy for CNS injury. Nanofibers have attracted a great deal of attention in neural tissue engineering, but their mechanical properties greatly influence physiology. Cellulose acetate (CA) has been studied for use in scaffolds owing to its biocompatibility, biodegradability, and good thermal stability. In this study, stiffness of CA nanofibers controlled by heat treatment was shown to regulate astrocyte activity. Adhesion and viability increased in culture as substrate became stiffer but showed saturation at greater than 2 MPa of tensile strength. Astrocytes became more active in terms of increasing intermediate filament glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). The results of this study demonstrate the effects of stiffness alone on cellular behaviors in a three-dimensional culture and highlight the efficacy of heat-treated CA for astrocyte culture in that the simple treatment enables control of astrocyte activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aastrocytes 3abiocompatibility 3abiodegradability 3acellulose acetate 3acentral nervous system 3aheat treatment 3ananofibers 3aneurons 3atensile strength 3atherapeutics 3athermal stability 3atissue engineering 3aviability1 aJung, Sang Myung1 aJu, Jung Hyeon1 aKwon, Yeo Seon1 aYoon, Gwang Heum1 aShin, Hwa Sung0 tIn vitro cellular & developmental biology.g2015 Oct., v. 51, no. 9 p.933-940dSpringer USx1071-26907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11626-015-9925-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03211naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245014000176300002000316520160600336592002801942650002201970650001101992650001602003650000902019650000902028650001402037650001202051650001602063650001102079650001402090650001702104650002802121650001102149650001402160650001902174650001402193650001202207650002402219650001402243650001602257650001202273650001302285650001502298700002802313700002502341700002402366700002002390773016902410856008102579852000902660655001202669IND60596661820221118191441.0180619e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059666182DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-018-1780-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl-Minshawy, AbdelazizM.10aEffects of monoterpenes on mortality, growth, fecundity, and ovarian development of Bactrocera zonata (Saunders) (Diptera: Tephritidae)  ap. 15671-15679.  aThe peach fruit fly (PFF), Bactrocera zonata, is a serious insect pest infesting fruits and vegetables. The insecticidal activity of three monoterpenes, namely, (R)-camphor, (R)-carvone, and (1R,2S,5R)-menthol, was evaluated on the second-instar larvae of B. zonata. In addition, the latent effects of monoterpenes on pupation, adult emergence, deformation, oviposition, adult longevity, and ovarian development were also examined. The three tested monoterpenes showed pronounced insecticidal activity against B. zonata larvae with (R)-carvone being the most potent toxicant. When the second-instar larvae of B. zonata were treated with monoterpenes at concentrations of 20, 50, and 70 mg/kg for 72 h, significant reduction in pupation and adult emergence was observed. The three monoterpenes caused complete suppression of adult emergence at 100 mg/kg. Moreover, monoterpenes induced complete inhibition of egg deposition at all tested concentrations. Some adult deformations were also noticed at 20, 50, and 70 mg/kg. However, (R)-carvone was more effective than (1R,2S,5R)-menthol and (R)-camphor on the examined biological parameters. On the other hand, histological examination of the ovaries of emerged females from larvae that fed on diet treated with (R)-carvone, (1R,2S,5R)-menthol, and (R)-camphor at 20 and 50 mg/L indicated that both concentrations caused retardation in the development of ovarioles. It is clear that all the egg chambers are empty; the germarium region is constricted at base due to the failure of oocyte formation. Many vacant spaces were present between ovarioles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBactrocera zonata 3aadults 3adeformation 3adiet 3aeggs 3afecundity 3afemales 3afruit flies 3afruits 3ahistology 3ainsect pests 3ainsecticidal properties 3alarvae 3alongevity 3amonoterpenoids 3amortality 3aoocytes 3aovarian development 3aovarioles 3aoviposition 3apeaches 3apupation 3avegetables1 aAbdelgaleil, SamirA.

This research delivers an integrated methodology for pollution source apportionment and a soil-rice-human model to predict heavy metal transfer in the farmland soil, rice grain and human blood chain. The source identification integrated positive matrix factorization (PMF), cluster analysis (CA) and the life cycle assessment (LCA) survey of agricultural and industrial production and consumption. Based on the case analysis of Shaoxing, this method showed very good performance through the illustration of the source contributions by PMF and LCA at county level and the identification of the pollution sources using CA and LCA at field scale. According to the overall evaluation, the integrated method was superior for the farmland metals pollution source identification comparing to existing source apportionment methods. To predict metal transformation in soil-rice-human chain, a set of models of metals (As, Pb, Cd, Hg, Cr) accumulation ability in rice grain and human blood has been established by literature review and monitoring data. The models showed adequate predictability for the metal content of rice grains at both the field and regional scale, and plausible simulation of the metal concentration in human blood throughout the whole study region. Therefore, this study provides valuable tools for farmland soil heavy metal pollution source identification and for the prediction of heavy metal transformation in soil-rice-human chain; and it can highlight the need to take mitigating action to reduce farmland metal pollution risks in specific regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aagricultural soils 3aarsenic 3ablood 3acadmium 3achromium 3acluster analysis 3aenvironmental monitoring 3aexposure models 3aexposure pathways 3afood safety 3aheavy metals 3ahuman health 3alead 3alife cycle assessment 3amercury 3apollution 3apollution control 3aprediction 3arice 3asurveys 3aChina 0aSource identification 0aModeling 0aMetal transfer 0aSoil-rice-human chain1 aZhu, Youwei1 aShao, Kan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5512-23771 aZhang, Qi1 aYe, Guohua1 aShen, Jing0 tJournal of environmental management.g2020 Apr. 15, v. 260 p.110092-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1100923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02866naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245005900164300001800223520153400241592002801775650001401803650001801817650001201835650001401847650001501861650002401876650002501900650000901925650001501934650001801949650001401967650001601981650002401997650002902021650001802050651001102068700002302079700002002102700002302122700001902145700001902164773012302183856008102306852000902387655001202396IND60676491120221120183027.0191119e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067649112DNAL7 a10.1134/S10642293191101152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShein, E. V.10aThermophysical Properties of Histosols on Lowmoor Peat  ap. 1363-1368.  aThe temperature regime and the dependence of thermal diffusivity on the volumetric water content in high-ash drained peat soils (Sapric Drainic Histosols (Lignic)) on woody peat underlain by grass, sedge, and woody peat layer in the Yakhroma River valley (Moscow oblast) were studied in terrain and laboratory on undisturbed samples. In the laboratory, the dependences of thermal diffusivity were determined in the course of sample drying by the Kondrat’ev method (a steady-state radial heat flow); whereas the terrain dynamic data on the daily temperature variations were used to solve the inverse problem by the heat wave method. The dependences obtained by laboratory and field methods showed a dome-like shape, the maxima of which were close (at the volumetric water content equal to 57–60%), but the thermal diffusivity obtained from the terrain data was 1.2 times lower at the maximum point. Considering the further use of dependences in predictive mathematical models, approximation of the curves by the method of Chang and Horton made it possible to evaluate the accuracy of the approximation parameters and to compare them. According to the laboratory method, the approximation errors grew reliably with an increase in the measured thermal diffusivity, which points to a systematic error in the laboratory measurement of the latter as dependent on the water content; this effect was not registered in the field method. The systematic errors in laboratory studies must be associated with shrinkage and vapor transfer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHistosols 3afield methods 3agrasses 3aheat flow 3alandscapes 3amathematical models 3amoisture diffusivity 3apeat 3apeat soils 3ariver valleys 3ashrinkage 3atemperature 3athermal diffusivity 3avolumetric water content 3awater content 3aRussia1 aPozdnyakova, A.

Increased inflammation in the adipose tissue and the liver has been so far implicated to affect metabolic homeostasis, mainly insulin resistance. In addition to the peripherals, the inflammation in the hypothalamus which governs systemic metabolism by linking neuronal and endocrine signals has been suggested to be linked to the metabolic disease. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. We hypothesized that a high-fat diet (HFD) led to central metabolic inflammation via transcriptional changes in the hypothalamus. To address the hypothesis, we characterized obesity-related hypothalamic, transcriptional alterations, and their effects on functional networks. Male C57BL/6J mice were fed with either a control diet (CD) or an HFD for 20 weeks. Microarray and gene ontology analyses of the hypothalamus demonstrated that immune-related pathways, including inflammatory and cytokine signaling, were overrepresented in the hypothalamus of HFD-fed mice compared to that of CD mice. In addition, through secondary analysis of leptin-deficient obese (ob/ob) mouse hypothalamus, we found that enriched gene sets for tumor necrosis factor–α signaling pathways and cancer pathways were common in both the obese mouse models. The results suggest that inflammatory pathway is transcriptionally enriched in the hypothalamus in obesity models and is related with hyperadiposity rather than the primary causes of obesity including the dietary fat and the genetic mutation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipose tissue 3aanimal disease models 3adietary fat 3agenes 3ahigh fat diet 3ahomeostasis 3ahypothalamus 3ainflammation 3ainsulin resistance 3aliver 3amales 3ametabolic diseases 3ametabolism 3amice 3amicroarray technology 3amutation 3aneoplasms 3aneurons 3aobesity 3asignal transduction 3atranscription (genetics) 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aHigh-fat diet 0aHypothalamus 0aObesity 0aInflammation 0aMouse 0aAtf3 0aCcl5 0aCD 0acDNA 0aDdc 0aDdit3 0aDEG 0aER 0aFC 0aFDR 0aGSEA 0aHFD 0aIKKβ 0aKEGG 0aMSigDB 0aNF-κB 0aob/ob 0aPtpn2 0aqRT-PCR 0aSlc6a3 0aTG 0aTNFα 0aWT1 aYoo, Yeongran1 aHan, Jihee1 aPark, Yoon Jung0 tNutrition research.g2019 Oct., v. 70 p.40-49dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl32600x0271-53177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nutres.2018.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02660naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245009400173300001600267520123800283592002801521650002701549650001501576650001001591650001501601650002801616650002001644650002101664650001601685650001401701650000901715650001301724653002701737653002301764653002601787653002601813700001801839700001801857700001901875700002001894700002001914700002001934700002001954773011201974856008302086852000902169655001202178IND60611306920221120121112.0200712e20181015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061130692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2018.06.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, David Junghoon,10aFlexible deep brain neural probe for localized stimulation and detection with metal guide  ap. 436-443.  aIn this paper, we present the design, fabrication, and performance evaluation of a polyimide-based flexible neural probe for the precise site stimulation and recording in the deep brain. The probe consists of five electrodes: one for stimulation, another for ground and the other three for recording electrodes. This probe is designed to be foldable, enabling easy insertion into the deep brain via temporary tungsten guide sticks. Because of its small cross-sectional area and the flexibility of the polyimide, the probe causes minimum damage to the neural tissue and does not show any evidence of serious immune reactions such as high density of macrophage or microglia. Around the simulation electrodes, an additional ground electrode prevents the stimulation of the undesired sites in the brain. To ensure we stimulate the target point specifically, for instance STh in this study, we confirm through both finite element analyses and in vitro tests. With the additional ground electrodes, we observe the leakage power decreased by about 80%.

Piezoelectric patches attached onto the flexible beams generate electricity as the proof mass is driven to oscillate by base excitations. A lumped-mass-spring model is built for theoretical analysis, which is verified by both finite element simulations and experiments. The dynamic responses of displacement and output voltage are achieved under different conditions, which indicate that the BDEH has the highest efficiency when the system undergoes cross-well vibration pattern. Both light damping and large excitation are beneficial to trigger cross-well vibration and thus enhance energy harvesting efficiency. A rectifier circuit is built to measure output power of the prototype under different excitations. Maximum power of 0.143 mW is generated under cross-well vibration pattern at an excitation frequency of 4 Hz and acceleration of 0.7g (g = 9.8 m/s²), which implies that the BDEH should be a feasible solution for ultralow-frequency energy harvesting even under low excitation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDiptera 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectricity 3afinite element analysis 3aflight 3amodels 3aprototypes 3avibration 0aEnergy harvester 0aPiezoelectric 0aBionic-dipteran 0aUltralow-frequency1 aZhao, Xuhui1 aWang, Kai1 aChang, Yaopeng1 aXu, Daolin1 aWen, Guilin0 tEnergy.g2021 Aug. 01, v. 228 p.120595-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1205953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02360naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024003000121040001800151100002400169245009100193300001300284520125600297592002801553650002001581650001401601650001901615650001101634650001401645650001101659650001101670650001201681650001701693651001801710700002001728700002601748700002201774773009601796856007301892852000901965655001201974IND60137930620221123001053.0150525e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013793062DNAL7 a10.1111/wej.120972doi7 a10.1111/wej.120972chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSamuels, William B.10aDevelopment and application of the incident command tool for drinking water protection  ap. 1-15.  aThe Incident Command Tool for Drinking Water Protection (ICWater) provides real‐time assessments of the travel and dispersion of contaminants in streams and rivers. It is structured around the RiverSpill model which has been enhanced to make use of the 1:100 000 scale National Hydrography Dataset Plus, Version 1.0 (NHDPlusV1). NHDPlusV1 is a hydrologically connected river network that contains over 3 million reach segments in the United States. This allows for both downstream and upstream tracing (which serves in forensic analysis). Mean flow and velocity have been calculated by the US Geological Survey (USGS) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for each reach. These mean values are updated by flow from web accessible real‐time gauging stations. Example databases available within ICWater include: dams, reservoirs, water supplies, gauges, municipal and industrial dischargers and transportation networks. A contaminant database is also included which identifies biological, chemical and radiological contaminants and their toxicities. Navigating the river network upstream coupled with mass‐balance calculations from breakthrough curves allows for backtracking of the contamination to determine the origin and source strength.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3adatabases 3adrinking water 3agauges 3ahydrology 3amodels 3arivers 3astreams 3awater supply 3aUnited States1 aBahadur, Rakesh1 aZiemniak, Christopher1 aAmstutz, David E.0 tWater and environment journal.g2015 Mar., v. 29, no. 1 p.1-15dLead Mediax1747-65857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/wej.120973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02598naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245017300176300001800349520133900367592002801706650001501734650002801749650001501777650002201792650002001814650001301834650002601847650001101873650001401884650002901898650001601927700001601943700002001959700002701979773011102006856008602117852000902203655001202212IND60533942420170412000000.0160802e20160802xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053394242DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.6b016302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWoldegebriel, Michael10aApplication of Fragment Ion Information as Further Evidence in Probabilistic Compound Screening Using Bayesian Statistics and Machine Learning: A Leap Toward Automation  ap. 7705-7714.  aIn this work, we introduce an automated, efficient, and elegant model to combine all pieces of evidence (e.g., expected retention times, peak shapes, isotope distributions, fragment-to-parent ratio) obtained from liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS/MS) data for screening purposes. Combining all these pieces of evidence requires a careful assessment of the uncertainties in the analytical system as well as all possible outcomes. To-date, the majority of the existing algorithms are highly dependent on user input parameters. Additionally, the screening process is tackled as a deterministic problem. In this work we present a Bayesian framework to deal with the combination of all these pieces of evidence. Contrary to conventional algorithms, the information is treated in a probabilistic way, and a final probability assessment of the presence/absence of a compound feature is computed. Additionally, all the necessary parameters except the chromatographic band broadening for the method are learned from the data in training and learning phase of the algorithm, avoiding the introduction of a large number of user-defined parameters. The proposed method was validated with a large data set and has shown improved sensitivity and specificity in comparison to a threshold-based commercial software package.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aartificial intelligence 3aautomation 3acomputer software 3adata collection 3aisotopes 3aliquid chromatography 3amodels 3ascreening 3atandem mass spectrometry 3auncertainty1 aZomer, Paul1 aMol, Hans G.

Here, we report that tandem nanomicelles co-functionalized with brain tumor-targeting and cell-penetrating peptides, Angiopep-2 and TAT, enable a highly efficacious and specific anti-glioma chemotherapy. Interestingly, tandem nanomicelles with 20 mol% Angiopep-2 and 10 mol% TAT linked via long and short poly(ethylene glycol)s, respectively, while maintaining a high glioma cell selectivity display markedly enhanced BBB permeation, glioma accumulation and penetration, and glioma cell uptake. We further show that docetaxel-loaded tandem nanomicelles have a long blood circulation time in mice and significantly better inhibit orthotopic U87MG human glioma than the corresponding Angiopep-2 single peptide-functionalized control, leading to an improved survival rate with little adverse effects. These tandem nanomicelles uniquely combining brain tumor-targeting and cell-penetrating functions provide a novel and effective strategy for targeted glioma therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3ablood circulation 3ablood-brain barrier 3abrain 3adrug therapy 3adrugs 3ahumans 3amice 3apeptides 3apermeability 3apolyethylene glycol 3asurvival rate 0aNanomicelles 0aReduction-sensitive 0aGlioma 0aTAT 0aBlood-brain barrier1 aJiang, Yu1 aMeng, Fenghua1 aDeng, Chao1 aCheng, Ru1 aZhang, Jian1 aFeijen, Jan1 aZhong, Zhiyuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4175-47410 tJournal of controlled release.g2018 May 28, v. 278 p.1-8dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12462x0168-36597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2018.03.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03574naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245009900165300001600264520191700280592002802197650002602225650002202251650002302273650001602296650001602312650001402328650001102342650001902353650001802372650001702390650001102407650001902418650001802437650001502455650001702470650002402487650001002511650001802521650001002539650002002549650001202569650002702581650001302608650000902621650000902630653002402639653001202663653001402675653001202689700001802701700001802719700001602737700001502753773010102768856008202869852000902951655001202960IND4471136620221121060602.0210302e20111201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447113662DNAL7 a10.2478/s11687-011-0039-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aD’Addabbo, T.10aSuppression of root-knot nematodes in potting mixes amended with different composted biowastes  ap. 278-287.  aSuppressiveness of soil amendments with different rates of composted biowaste materials, olive pomace, municipal green wastes, sewage sludge and spent mushroom substrate, was evaluated against the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita on tomato in potting mixtures. Soil amendments were applied at 0, 10, 25, 50 and 100 g kg−1 soil, according to a randomized block design with five replications for each treatment. Sixty days after tomato transplanting, nematode population density on plant roots and in soil and root gall infestation were assessed on each root system, and plant top and root weight were also recorded. Soil pH, dry and organic matter content, total and ammoniacal nitrogen were analyzed at the same time. Olive pomace-based composts resulted in the highest nematode suppression (73–97 %, according to the rate) and significantly reduced gall formation on tomato roots. Olive-waste compost affected positively tomato growth only in combination with sheep wool wastes, but it caused phytotoxicity when mixed with chicken manure and urea. Soil amendments with composted mushroom substrate also provided a consistent nematode suppression and a significant increase of plant growth, whereas composted municipal green wastes were more suppressive and positively affected tomato growth when combined with sewage sludge. Soil chemical parameters were scarcely affected by compost amendments, as organic matter was significantly increased only by the olive pomace-derived composts and nitrogen content only at the highest rate of the five composts. Data from the experiment confirmed the potential of compost amendments for sustainable management of root-knot nematodes both in field and greenhouse container media, though their technical effectiveness and economic convenience are strictly dependent on a correct proportion and local availability of raw materials used in the composting process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMeloidogyne incognita 3aammonium nitrogen 3adry matter content 3agreen waste 3agreenhouses 3amushrooms 3aolives 3aorganic matter 3aphytotoxicity 3aplant growth 3apomace 3apoultry manure 3araw materials 3aroot galls 3aroot systems 3aroot-knot nematodes 3aroots 3asewage sludge 3asheep 3asoil amendments 3asoil pH 3aspent mushroom compost 3atomatoes 3aurea 3awool 0aroot-knot nematodes 0acontrol 0abiowastes 0acompost1 aPapajová, I.1 aSasanelli, N.1 aRadicci, V.1 aRenčo, M.0 tHelminthologia.g2011 Dec. 1, v. 48, no. 4 p.278-287dVersitawJournal:jnl24740x1336-90837nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11687-011-0039-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03292naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245011100158300001800269520199000287592002802277650001202305650002002317650002702337650001902364650001202383650001302395650001202408650002302420650001302443650001102456650001102467650001802478650001102496650001602507651001802523700001602541700002102557700001802578700001402596700001702610773012302627856007502750852000902825655001202834IND60534850320170606000000.0160803e20130507xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053485032DNAL7 a10.1021/es304472d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPucko, Monika,10aImportance of Arctic Zooplankton Seasonal Migrations for α-Hexachlorocyclohexane Bioaccumulation Dynamics  ap. 4155-4163.  aLike most zooplankton, Calanus hyperboreus undergoes seasonal migration spending late spring and summer grazing at the surface and the rest of the year in diapause at depth. As a result, in the Arctic Ocean this copepod resides for part of the year in the hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) enriched surface water and for part of the year at depth where HCH undergoes significant microbial degradation resulting in far lower concentrations (∼3 times for α-HCH). We collected C. hyperboreus from summer and winter from the Amundsen Gulf and measured their α-HCH concentrations, enantiomeric compositions, and bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) to investigate how this copepod responds to the change in exposure to α-HCH. C. hyperboreus collected in winter were also cultured for 5 weeks under surface water conditions without feeding to investigate bioconcentration dynamics following spring ascent. Concentration of α-HCH was 2–3 times higher in individuals from the summer than those from the winter. Log BAF from the summer (feeding period) does not exceed log BCF (bioconcentration factor) from the culturing experiment (no feeding) suggesting that α-HCH concentration in C. hyperboreus is maintained through equilibration rather than feeding. After the spring ascent from deep waters, C. hyperboreus approach equilibrium partitioning with the higher surface water concentrations of α-HCH within 3–4 weeks with about 60% of bioconcentration taking place in the first week. The C. hyperboreus α-HCH chiral signature also reflects ambient seawater and can therefore be used as a determinant of residence depth. Even though a single cycle of seasonal migration does not result in a significant redistribution of α-HCH in the water column, this process could have a significant cumulative effect over longer time scales with particular local importance where the zooplankton biomass is high and the ocean depth is great enough to provide substantial vertical concentration gradients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCalanus 3aHCH (pesticide) 3abioaccumulation factor 3abiodegradation 3abiomass 3adiapause 3agrazing 3amigratory behavior 3aseawater 3aspring 3asummer 3asurface water 3awinter 3azooplankton 3aArctic region1 aWalkusz, W.1 aMacdonald, R.

We employed a sequence-homology-based computational approach to identify conserved miRNAs and their target genes in Persian (English) walnut, Juglans regia, and its North American wild relative, J. microcarpa. A total of 119 miRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs) were detected in the J. regia genome and 121 in the J. microcarpa genome and miRNA target genes were predicted and their functional annotations were performed in both genomes. In the J. regia genome, 325 different genes were targets; 87.08% were regulated by transcript cleavage and 12.92% by translation repression. In the J. microcarpa genome, 316 different genes were targets; 88.92% were regulated by transcript cleavage and 11.08% were regulated by translation repression. Totals of 1.3% and 2.0% of all resistance gene analogues (RGA) and 2.7% and 2.6% of all transcription factors (TFs) were regulated by miRNAs in the J. regia and J. microcarpa genomes, respectively. Juglans genomes evolved by a whole genome duplication (WGD) and consist of eight pairs of fractionated homoeologous chromosomes. Within each pair, the chromosome that has more genes with greater average transcription also harbors more pre-miRNAs and more target genes than its homoeologue. While only minor differences were detected in pre-miRNAs between the J. regia and J. microcarpa genomes, about one-third of the pre-miRNA loci were not conserved between homoeologous chromosome within each genome. Pre-miRNA and their corresponding target genes showed a tendency to be collocated within a subgenome.  aPublisher supplied data  cEconomic Research Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000091750 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aJuglans microcarpa 3aJuglans regia 3afractionation 3aloci 3amicroRNA 3aresistance genes 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3awalnuts 3awild relatives1 aZhu, Tingting 1 aDeal, Karin  R.1 aDvořák, Jan,1 aLuo, Ming-Cheng 0 tPlants.g2020 Oct. 09, v. 9, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants91013303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02284naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003900135040001800174100006600192245008500258500001900343506007600362520081900438592002801257506003701285650001801322650001601340650002701356650002001383650001401403650002001417650001301437653001501450700002201465700002301487700002101510700002601531700002101557700002101578700001501599700002501614773009201639856008601731852000901817655001201826IND60690838320221207111416.0201230e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069083832DNAL7 a311931142pmid7 aPMC65175162pmcid7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e017092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcCall, William Vaughn1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5035-785810aBedtime doses of prazosin do not affect daytime salivary amylase markers in PTSD  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOveractivity of the noradrenergic (NE) system within the central nervous system (CNS) has been postulated as a key pathophysiology of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The activity of the enzyme salivary α-amylase (sAA) has been proposed as an indirect measure of CNS NE activity, and sAA is elevated in PTSD. As an antagonist of the α-1 NE receptor, prazosin would be expected to alter sAA values in PTSD patients. However, given its short half-life, it is not clear whether bedtime doses would have an effect on daytime sAA. In the present study, we assayed daytime sAA in 20 suicidal PTSD patients who were randomized to prazosin versus placebo at bedtime-only, and found no effect in daytime sAA. These findings are consistent with studies showing an advantage for twice daily dosing of prazosin in PTSD.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalpha-amylase 3aantagonists 3acentral nervous system 3aenzyme activity 3ahalf life 3apathophysiology 3aplacebos 0aPsychiatry1 aPillai, Anilkumar1 aPandya, Chirayu D.1 aMcCloud, Laryssa1 aMoraczewski, Jason A.1 aTauhidul, Liniya1 aYoussef, Nagy A.1 aCase, Doug1 aRosenquist, Peter B.0 tHeliyon.g2019 May, v. 5, no. 5 p.e01709-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e017093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02526naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245009300167500001900260520134400279592002801623650001701651650002101668650001101689650000901700653002701709653001601736653001801752653001601770653004901786653002001835700001701855700001601872700005201888700001601940773009001956856008502046852000902131655001202140IND60734054020221121021301.0210603e20210801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073405402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1205992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Ruihua12aA cycle research methodology for thermo-chemical engines: From ideal cycle to case study  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe current researches on thermo-chemical engines that convert heat into chemical work lack a systematic thermodynamic research methodology, which hinders the deepening and generalization of the study on thermo-chemical engines. In this study, a cycle research methodology for thermo-chemical engines is proposed with respect to the basic concepts, physical picture, ideal cycle and degradation analysis. Firstly, the ideal cycle of thermo-chemical engines is presented and analyzed in detail based on the concept of chemical work and the physical picture. Then, a comparison between the presented ideal cycle and the Carnot cycle is performed, which indicates significant differences between the two except for the temperature-entropy diagram. In addition, with reference to conventional heat engines, the degradation from the ideal cycle to actual cycles is extended to analyses for configuration degradation and irreversibility of thermo-chemical engines. Finally, a case study for the thermally regenerative electrochemical cycle is performed to support the applicability of the cycle research methodology for thermo-chemical engines. The proposed cycle research methodology fills the theoretical gap in the conversion of heat to chemical work, and is expected to guide the improvement and innovation of actual thermo-chemical engines.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3aheat 0aThermo-chemical engine 0aHeat engine 0aChemical work 0aIdeal cycle 0aThermally regenerative electrochemical cycle 0aIrreversibility1 aZhao, Ruikai1 aDeng, Shuai1 aZhao, Li1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6269-67821 aXu, Weicong0 tEnergy.g2021 Aug. 01, v. 228 p.120599-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1205993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03998naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002900166245016200195300001600357520188500373592002802258650003302286650001802319650002702337650001702364650002702381650001002408650002002418650001702438650002102455650000902476650001902485650002802504650002002532650001302552650002502565650001202590650003602602650002902638650004302667650001402710650002302724650001502747650001102762650006202773650005602835650003302891650000902924650002402933650001902957650003002976650005603006650006403062700002603126700002303152700002403175773009203199856004803291852000903339655001203348IND50059020720221121080146.0121011e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005902072DNAL7 a230014822pmid7 a10.1007/s12250-012-3258-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSedeh, Farahnaz Motamedi10aComparison of immune responses against FMD by a DNA vaccine encoding the FMDV/O/IRN/2007 VP1 gene and the conventional inactivated vaccine in an animal model  ap. 286-291.  aFoot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is highly contagious and responsible for huge outbreaks among cloven hoofed animals. The aim of the present study is to evaluate a plasmid DNA immunization system that expresses the FMDV/O/IRN/2007 VP1 gene and compare it with the conventional inactivated vaccine in an animal model. The VP1 gene was sub-cloned into the unique Kpn I and BamH I cloning sites of the pcDNA3.1+ and pEGFP-N1 vectors to construct the VP1 gene cassettes. The transfected BHKT7 cells with sub-cloned pEGFP-N1-VP1 vector expressed GFP-VP1 fusion protein and displayed more green fluorescence spots than the transfected BHKT7 cells with pEGFP-N1 vector, which solely expressed the GFP protein. Six mice groups were respectively immunized by the sub-cloned pcDNA3.1+-VP1 gene cassette as the DNA vaccine, DNA vaccine and PCMV-SPORT-GMCSF vector (as molecular adjuvant) together, conventional vaccine, PBS (as negative control), pcDNA3.1+ vector (as control group) and PCMV-SPORT vector that contained the GMCSF gene (as control group). Significant neutralizing antibody responses were induced in the mice which were immunized using plasmid vectors expressing the VP1 and GMCSF genes together, the DNA vaccine alone and the conventional inactivated vaccine (P<0.05). Co-administration of DNA vaccine and GMCSF gene improved neutralizing antibody response in comparison with administration of the DNA vaccine alone, but this response was the most for the conventional vaccine group. However, induction of humeral immunity response in the conventional vaccine group was more protective than for the DNA vaccine, but T-cell proliferation and IFN-γ concentration were the most in DNA vaccine with the GMCSF gene. Therefore the group that was vaccinated by DNA vaccine with the GMCSF gene, showed protective neutralizing antibody response and the most Th1 cellular immunity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFoot-and-mouth disease virus 3aanimal models 3acell-mediated immunity 3afluorescence 3afoot-and-mouth disease 3agenes 3aimmune response 3aimmunization 3ainterferon-gamma 3amice 3aneutralization 3aneutralizing antibodies 3aplasmid vectors 3aplasmids 3arecombinant vaccines 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Neutralizingxblood 2aAntibodies, Viralxblood 2aCapsid Proteinsxgeneticsximmunology. 2aCell Line 2aCell Proliferation 2aCricetinae 2aFemale 2aFoot-and-Mouth Diseaseximmunologyxprevention & control. 2aFoot-and-Mouth Disease Virusxgeneticsximmunology. 2aInterferon-gammaxsecretion. 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aModels, Animal 2aT-Lymphocytesximmunology 2aVaccines, DNAxadministration & dosageximmunology. 2aVaccines, Inactivatedxadministration & dosageximmunology.1 aSoleimanjahi, Hoorieh1 aJalilian, AmirReza1 aMahravani, Homayoon0 tVirologica Sinica.g2012 Oct., v. 27, no. 5 p.286-291dSpringer-Verlagx1674-07697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12250-012-3258-5  aDNAL 7aarticle02212naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002600149245009200175300001600267520102600283592002801309650000801337650003201345650000801377650001501385650002001400650001301420650002901433653000801462653001201470653003101482653001601513653001401529653002301543700003101566700002801597773009601625856008401721852000901805655001201814IND60630185020221119132617.0190620e20190415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063018502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymeth.2019.01.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJordán-Pla, Antonio,10aMeasuring RNA polymerase activity genome-wide with high-resolution run-on-based methods  ap. 177-182.  aThe biogenesis of RNAs is a multi-layered and highly regulated process that involves a diverse set of players acting in an orchestrated manner throughout the transcription cycle. Transcription initiation, elongation and termination factors act on RNA polymerases to modulate their movement along the DNA template in a very precise manner, more complex than previously anticipated. Genome-scale run-on-based methodologies have been developed to study in detail the position of transcriptionally-engaged RNA polymerases. Genomic run-on (GRO), and its many variants and refinements made over the years, are helping the community to address an increasing amount of scientific questions, spanning an increasing range of organisms and systems. In this review, we aim to summarize the most relevant high throughput methodologies developed to study nascent RNA by run-on methods, compare their main features, advantages and limitations, while putting them in context with alternative ways of studying the transcriptional process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aRNA 3abiogenesis 3aenzyme activity 3agenomics 3atranscription initiation 0aRNA 0aGRO-seq 0aNext generation sequencing 0aGenome-wide 0aChromatin 0aTranscription rate1 aPérez-Martínez, Maria E.1 aPérez-Ortín, José E.0 tMethods.g2019 Apr. 15, v. 159-160 p.177-182dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12000x1046-20237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymeth.2019.01.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03963naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002400181245009700205506007600302520240900378592002802787506003702815650002502852650001702877650001202894650001202906650001402918650001002932650001302942650001602955650002002971650001202991650001603003650002303019650001303042650001403055650002603069650001903095650002003114650001303134700002203147700002103169700002803190700002303218773012103241856007403362852000903436655001203445IND60650300320221207130416.0190709e20180526xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065030032DNAL7 a10.3390/nu100606752doi7 aPMC60248512pmcid7 a298614442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRenna, Massimiliano10aMicrogreens Production with Low Potassium Content for Patients with Impaired Kidney Function  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aChronic kidney disease represents a global problem together with other so-called &lsquo;lifestyle-related diseases&rsquo;. Unlike the healthy population, for the patients with impaired kidney function, it is of course prudent to recommend a restriction of high-potassium foods. Thus, it is suggested to limit the consumption of vegetables, because they generally contain high concentrations of potassium. At the same time, a lower consumption of vegetables reduces the intake of healthy compounds such as vitamins, fibers, and antioxidants, which also reduces the vegetables&rsquo; potential benefit in chronic kidney disease patients. Microgreens are an emerging class of specialty crop that represent a nutritious and refined food. In this study, for the first time, some chicory (local variety &lsquo;Molfetta&rsquo; and cultivar &lsquo;Italico a costa rossa&rsquo;) and lettuce (cultivar &lsquo;Bionda da taglio&rsquo;) genotypes were grown using a hydroponic system with different potassium (K) levels (0, 29.1, 58.4, and 117 mg L&minus;1) in order to produce microgreens with a low potassium content. The crop performances, cations content, proximate composition, and antioxidant activity were analyzed. Independent of the genotype, the K content in the microgreens was successfully reduced using a nutrient solution (NS), without K or with 29.1 mg K L&minus;1, which supplied between 103 and 129 mg of K 100 g&minus;1 FW (about 7.7&ndash;8.6% of the K daily intake that was recommended for the patients that were affected by chronic kidney disease). Whereas, 100 g of microgreens that were grown by using an NS with 58.4 or 117 mg K L&minus;1 supply between 225 and 250 mg of K (about 15.8&ndash;16.5% of the K daily intake recommended for patients affected by chronic kidney disease). No differences were observed in terms of the shoot height, dry matter, proximate composition, and visual quality. A slightly lower yield was observed using an NS with a K concentration <58.4 mg L&minus;1. These results suggest that by using an NS without K or with low K concentrations, it is possible to obtain a useful reduction of K in microgreens, without negatively affecting the quality. Unlike conventional vegetables, the microgreens that were produced in the present study could reduce the potassium intake in patients with impaired kidney function who were accustomed to eating vegetable-based dishes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acations 3achicory 3acultivars 3afoods 3agenotype 3ahydroponics 3akidney diseases 3alettuce 3amicrogreens 3anutrient solutions 3apatients 3apotassium 3aproximate composition 3arenal function 3aspecialty crops 3avitamins1 aCastellino, Maria1 aLeoni, Beniamino1 aParadiso, Vito  Michele1 aSantamaria, Pietro0 tNutrients.g2018 May 26, v. 10, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu100606753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02119naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245009900163300001600262520114300278592002801421650001301449650001301462650001301475650002001488700002401508700001501532700002101547700002401568773012901592856007501721852000901796655001201805IND60538845120170628000000.0160815e20130116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053884512DNAL7 a10.1021/ja311842r2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoughton, Adrian
Y.10aMechanistic Studies on the Metal-Free Activation of Dihydrogen by Antiaromatic Pentarylboroles  ap. 941-947.  aThe perfluoro- and perprotiopentaphenylboroles 1 and 2 react with dihydrogen to effect H–H bond cleavage and formation of boracyclopentene products. The mechanism of this reaction has been studied experimentally through evaluation of the kinetic properties of the slower reaction between 2 and H₂. The reaction is first-order in both [borole] and [H₂] with activation parameters of ΔH⧧ = 34(8) kJ/mol and ΔS⧧ = −146(25) J mol–¹ K–¹. A minimal kinetic isotope effect of 1.10(5) was observed, suggesting an asynchronous geometry for H–H cleavage in the rate-limiting transition state. To explain the stereochemistry of the observed products, a ring-opening/ring-closing mechanism is proposed and supported by the separate synthesis of a proposed intermediate and its observed conversion to product. Furthermore, extensive DFT mapping of the reaction mechanism supports the plausibility of this proposal. The study illustrates a new mechanism for the activation of H₂ by a strong main group Lewis acid in the absence of an external base, a process driven in part by the antiaromaticity of the borole rings in 1 and 2.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageometry 3ahydrogen 3aisotopes 3astereochemistry1 aKarttunen, Virve A.1 aFan, Cheng1 aPiers, Warren E.1 aTuononen, Heikki M.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2013 Jan. 16, v. 135, no. 2 p.941-947dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja311842r3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02062naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245010100162300001600263520104500279592002801324650002501352650001601377650001301393650001501406650001301421650000901434650002501443650002001468651001201488651001001500700002101510773009901531856007301630852000901703655001201712IND60137931220221123001043.0150525e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013793122DNAL7 a10.1111/wej.121022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTurner, Sean W.

The study focuses on strengths and weaknesses of existing practice and the case for change towards a risk‐based approach informed by stochastic modelling assessments. In‐depth, structured interviews were conducted to capture the views of planners, regulators and consultants closely involved in the planning process. We found broad agreement that the existing water availability assessment methods are fallible; they lack transparency, are often highly subjective and may fail to adequately expose problems of resilience. While most practitioners believe these issues warrant a more detailed examination of risk in the planning process, few believe there is a strong case for a fundamental shift towards risk‐based planning informed by stochastic modelling assessments. The study identifies perceived business risks associated with change and exposes widespread scepticism of stochastic methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3aconsultants 3aindustry 3ainterviews 3aplanning 3arisk 3astochastic processes 3awater resources 3aEngland 3aWales1 aJeffrey, Paul J.0 tWater and environment journal.g2015 June, v. 29, no. 2 p.161-168dLead Mediax1747-65857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/wej.121023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03509naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100002200157245008100179300001600260520168200276592002801958650002001986650001502006650001102021650001302032650001202045650002002057650001402077650001602091650001102107650001502118650001102133650001102144650001002155650001302165650001302178650001602191650001502207650001302222650002002235650001302255650001602268653001002284653003802294653002002332653002602352700002102378700003102399700001902430700002802449700002302477700001902500700002402519700006402543700002502607700002502632773011302657856009202770852000902862655001202871IND60662972120221122041638.0191126e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066297212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2019.08.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGené-Mola, Jordi10aFruit detection in an apple orchard using a mobile terrestrial laser scanner  ap. 171-184.  aThe development of reliable fruit detection and localization systems provides an opportunity to improve the crop value and management by limiting fruit spoilage and optimised harvesting practices. Most proposed systems for fruit detection are based on RGB cameras and thus are affected by intrinsic constraints, such as variable lighting conditions. This work presents a new technique that uses a mobile terrestrial laser scanner (MTLS) to detect and localise Fuji apples. An experimental test focused on Fuji apple trees (Malus domestica Borkh. cv. Fuji) was carried out. A 3D point cloud of the scene was generated using an MTLS composed of a Velodyne VLP-16 LiDAR sensor synchronised with an RTK-GNSS satellite navigation receiver. A reflectance analysis of tree elements was performed, obtaining mean apparent reflectance values of 28.9%, 29.1%, and 44.3% for leaves, branches and trunks, and apples, respectively. These results suggest that the apparent reflectance parameter (at 905 nm wavelength) can be useful to detect apples. For that purpose, a four-step fruit detection algorithm was developed. By applying this algorithm, a localization success of 87.5%, an identification success of 82.4%, and an F1-score of 0.858 were obtained in relation to the total amount of fruits. These detection rates are similar to those obtained by RGB-based systems, but with the additional advantages of providing direct 3D fruit location information, which is not affected by sunlight variations. From the experimental results, it can be concluded that LiDAR-based technology and, particularly, its reflectance information, has potential for remote apple detection and 3D location.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMalus domestica 3aalgorithms 3aapples 3abranches 3acameras 3adata collection 3adetection 3afruit trees 3afruits 3aharvesting 3alasers 3aleaves 3alidar 3alighting 3aorchards 3areflectance 3asatellites 3ascanners 3asolar radiation 3aspoilage 3awavelengths 0aLiDAR 0aMobile terrestrial laser scanning 0aFruit detection 0aAgricultural robotics1 aGregorio, Eduard1 aGuevara Martínez, Javier,1 aAuat, Fernando1 aSanz-Cortiella, Ricardo1 aEscolà, Alexandre1 aLlorens, Jordi1 aMorros, Josep-Ramon1 aRuiz-Hidalgo, Javier1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6774-685X1 aVilaplana, Verónica1 aRosell-Polo, Joan R.0 tBiosystems engineering.g2019 Nov., v. 187 p.171-184dElsevier LtdaIAgrEwJournal:jnl70639x1537-51107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2019.08.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03108naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245012300153300001800276520186400294592002802158650001402186650002002200650002602220650002102246650001902267650001302286650001302299650001902312650001102331650001402342650002002356650002302376651001702399700001702416700001602433700001502449700001502464773012302479856007502602852000902677655001202686IND60534850620221118161505.0160803e20130507xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053485062DNAL7 a10.1021/es304504m2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Ting10aAcceleration of Denitrification in Turbid Rivers Due to Denitrification Occurring on Suspended Sediment in Oxic Waters  ap. 4053-4061.  aHigh suspended sediment (SPS) concentration exists in many rivers of the world. In the present study, the effects of SPS concentration on denitrification were investigated in airtight chambers with sediment samples collected from the Yellow River which is the largest turbid river in the world. Results from the nitrogen stable (¹⁵N) isotopic tracer experiments showed that denitrification could occur on SPS in oxic waters and the denitrification rate increased with SPS concentration; this was probably caused by the presence of low-oxygen microsites in SPS. For the water systems with both bed-sediment and SPS, the denitrification kinetics fit well to Logistic model, and the denitrification rate constant increased linearly with SPS concentration (p < 0.01). The denitrification caused by the presence of SPS accounted for 22%, 38%, 53%, and 67% of the total denitrification in systems with 2.5, 8, 15, and 20 g L–¹ SPS, respectively. The activity of denitrifying bacteria in SPS was approximately twice that in bed-sediment, and the denitrifying bacteria population showed an increasing trend with SPS concentration in both SPS and bed-sediment, leading to the increase of denitrification rate with SPS concentration. Furthermore, the denitrification in bed-sediment was accelerated by increased diffusion of nitrate from overlying water to bed-sediment under agitation conditions, which accompanied with the presence of SPS. When with 8 g L–¹ SPS, approximately 66% of the increased denitrification compared to that without SPS was attributed to denitrification on SPS and 34% to agitation conditions. This is the first report of the occurrence of denitrification on SPS in oxic waters. The results suggest that SPS plays an important role in denitrification in turbid rivers; its effect on nitrogen cycle should be considered in future study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagitation 3adenitrification 3adenitrifying bacteria 3aisotope labeling 3alogit analysis 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anitrogen cycle 3arivers 3asediments 3astable isotopes 3asuspended sediment 3aYellow River1 aXia, Xinghui1 aLiu, Shaoda1 aMou, Xinli1 aQiu, Yiwen0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2013 May 07, v. 47, no. 9 p.4053-4061dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes304504m3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01803naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245010500173300001600278520070600294592002801000650002701028650001501055650001501070650001701085650001401102650000901116653002501125653003101150653001301181653001501194653002401209700001401233773009801247856008701345852000901432655001201441IND60592679020221119141205.0190318e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059267902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plantsci.2018.03.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Liangsheng10aFunctions and regulation of phosphate starvation-induced secreted acid phosphatases in higher plants  ap. 108-116.  aPhosphorus is essential for plant growth and development, but levels of inorganic phosphate (Pi), the major form of phosphorus that plants assimilate, are quite limiting in most soils.

The basis of each information system’s functioning is the collection of relevant data about real-world objects, in terms of their completeness, quality and reliability. Due to the very rapid development of information technology, GIS systems have found a wide application, eg. in spatial planning, real estate management, administration, infrastructure management and many other areas of life. The authors within the article have made a detailed review of the current using of GIS, with particular emphasis on the mining industry. In the latter, particular attention was focused on the use of this type of tools to monitor and analyse the effects of mining activities.

The location is a chernozem steppe with frequent frosts and insufficient and unstable moistening over the years. The technology of breeding was common: the pedigree and bulk methods were used. When laying a breeding nursery, the following approaches were new: sowing up to 45 000 untreated ears of a designed planter (to eliminate weeding during threshing ears), determining the frost resistance of plants that have been hardened in the field in bundles placed in plastic bags in low temperatures, and determining their viability for 3 days after freezing by the Don method. A large layer of studies (more than 11 000 populations) was analyzed, starting with the F₁ population and ending with the completion of formation for each one. It is confirmed that transgression that is the result of the recombination is observed in populations whose parents do not have extreme expression of the trait. It is established that populations should be heterogeneous with long-term formation. This happens when parents have very few common genes and when there is no restriction on recombination due to too large differences in components. With the presence of overdominance in F₁ in many studied populations, it is possible to predict the appearance of transgressions (for frost-resistance and productivity in our case) with an average frequency of 0.25-4.36%. They are also possible, but an order of magnitude less than when overdominated, with the incomplete and complete dominance of the trait of the best parent, the excess of parents in F₂ on average for the population, or with an intermediate inheritance in F₂. This should be accompanied by large volumes of studying the breeding material in the first stages and the presence of various stresses.

These characterizations show that the groundwater is fresh to brackish, slightly alkaline and the major ions are Na⁺, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Cl⁻ and SO₄²–. According to WHO standards, 50% of the analysed water are suitable as a drinking source while the other samples are not in compliance with drinking water standards. This non-compliance is basically due to the high concentrations of Na⁺, Cl⁻, and SO₄²– requesting further treatment to reach the stringent standards. According to the results of nitrate concentrations, anthropogenic source seems to influence the groundwater quality. The present study shows that Béchar groundwater may represent an important drinking and irrigation water source. However, a specific management strategy should be adapted in order to avoid the contamination by anthropogenic sources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3aanthropogenic activities 3aaquifers 3aarid zones 3acalcium 3achlorides 3acompliance 3adrinking 3adrinking water 3aelectrical conductivity 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3aions 3airrigation water 3amagnesium 3anitrates 3apH 3asodium 3asulfates 3awater quality 3aAlgeria 0aBéchar region 0agroundwater 0ahydrochemistry 0aTuronian aquifer 0awater quality1 aBelhachemi, Meriem1 aMerzougui, Touhami1 aNabbou, Noria1 aLachache, Salih0 tJournal of water and land development.g2018 Dec. 01, v. 39, no. 1 p.109-117dSciendowJournal:jnl4334744x2083-45357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/jwld-2018-00653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03316naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245014200169300001800311500001500329520189000344592002802234650003302262650001502295650001502310650001202325650002202337650002102359650001902380650000902399650001702408650001902425650001402444650001402458650001302472650001202485650001802497653001702515700002102532700001702553700001502570700002402585700001902609773011102628856008602739852000902825655001202834IND60533943120221122011454.0160802e20160802xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053394312DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.6b017472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Haiqiang10aProbing Ion Transfer across Liquid–Liquid Interfaces by Monitoring Collisions of Single Femtoliter Oil Droplets on Ultramicroelectrodes  ap. 7754-7761.  a2019-12-06  aWe describe a method of observing collisions of single femtoliter (fL) oil (i.e., toluene) droplets that are dispersed in water on an ultramicroelectrode (UME) to probe the ion transfer across the oil/water interface. The oil-in-water emulsion was stabilized by an ionic liquid, in which the oil droplet trapped a highly hydrophobic redox probe, rubrene. The ionic liquid also functions as the supporting electrolyte in toluene. When the potential of the UME was biased such that rubrene oxidation would be possible when a droplet collided with the electrode, no current spikes were observed. This implies that the rubrene radical cation is not hydrophilic enough to transfer into the aqueous phase. We show that current spikes are observed when tetrabutylammonium trifluoromethanesulfonate or tetrahexylammonium hexafluorophosphate are introduced into the toluene phase and when tetrabutylammonium perchlorate is introduced into the water phase, implying that the ion transfer facilitates electron transfer in the droplet collisions. The current (i)–time (t) behavior was evaluated quantitatively, which indicated the ion transfer is fast and reversible. Furthermore, the size of these emulsion droplets can also be calculated from the electrochemical collision. We further investigated the potential dependence on the electrochemical collision response in the presence of tetrabutylammonium trifluoromethanesulfonate in toluene to obtain the formal ion transfer potential of tetrabutylammonium across the toluene/water interface, which was determined to be 0.754 V in the inner potential scale. The results yield new physical insights into the charge balance mechanism in emulsion droplet collisions and indicate that the electrochemical collision technique can be used to probe formal ion transfer potentials between water and solvents with very low (ε < 5) dielectric constants.  aPublisher supplied data 3atetrabutylammonium compounds 3amonitoring 3aelectrodes 3acations 3aelectron transfer 3aelectrochemistry 3ahydrophilicity 3aoils 3aperchlorates 3ahydrophobicity 3aoxidation 3aemulsions 3adroplets 3atoluene 3aionic liquids 0aelectrolytes1 aDick, Jeffrey E.1 aKummer, Sina1 aKragl, Udo1 aStrauss, Steven H.,1 aBard, Allen J.0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2016 Aug. 02, v. 88, no. 15 p.7754-7761dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.analchem.6b017473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03251naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245016000158300001800318520184000336592002802176650001702204650002502221650002202246650001102268650000902279650001902288650002202307650002602329650001502355650003502370650003002405650001402435650002002449651001002469700001802479700001602497700001902513700001902532700001802551700001702569773012302586856007502709852000902784655001202793IND60534850820221118165511.0160803e20130507xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053485082DNAL7 a10.1021/es304558y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Yan-Hong10aUsing Compound-Specific Stable Carbon Isotope Analysis to Trace Metabolism and Trophic Transfer of PCBs and PBDEs in Fish from an e-Waste Site, South China  ap. 4062-4068.  aTwo fish species (mud carp and northern snakehead) forming a predator/prey relationship and sediment samples were collected from a pond contaminated by e-waste. The concentrations and stable carbon isotope ratios (δ¹³C) of individual polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) and polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners were measured to determine if compound-specific carbon isotope analysis (CSIA) could be used to provide insight into the metabolism and trophic dynamics of PCBs and PBDEs. Significant correlations were found in the isotopic data of PCB congeners between the sediment and the fish species and between the two fish indicating identical origin of PCBs in sediment and fish. Most PCB congeners in the fish species were enriched in ¹³C compared with the PCB congeners in the sediments as a result of isotopic fractionation during the metabolism of PCBs in fish. The isotopic data of several PCB congeners showing isotopic agreement or isotopic depletion could be used for source apportionment or to trace the reductive dechlorination process of PCBs in the environment. The PCB isotopic data covaried more in the northern snakehead than in the mud carp when compared to the sediment, implying that a similar isotopic fractionation occurs from the prey to the predator fish for a PCB congener possibly due to similar metabolic pathways. The PBDE congener patterns differed in the three sample types with a high abundance of BDE209, 183, 99, and 47 in the sediment, BDE47, 153, and 49 in the mud carp and BDE47, 100, and 154 in the northern snakehead. The isotopic change of BDE congeners, such as BDE47 and BDE49, in two fish species, provides evidence for biotransformation of PBDEs in biota. The results of this study suggest that CSIA is a promising tool for deciphering the fate of PCBs and PBDEs in the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChanna argus 3abiochemical pathways 3abiotransformation 3acarbon 3acarp 3adechlorination 3aelectronic wastes 3aisotope fractionation 3ametabolism 3apolybrominated diphenyl ethers 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3asediments 3astable isotopes 3aChina1 aLuo, Xiao-Jun1 aYu, Le-Huan1 aChen, Hua-Shan1 aWu, Jiang-Ping1 aChen, She-Jun1 aMai, Bi-Xian0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2013 May 07, v. 47, no. 9 p.4062-4068dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes304558y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02447naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245009600173500001900269520114200288592002801430650000801458650002001466650001301486650002301499650001101522650001401533650001501547650001401562650003001576650001201606651001301618653001401631653002401645653001501669653002001684700002101704700002401725700002201749700002101771773011501792856008501907852000901992655001202001IND60662972420221122025946.0200318e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066297242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2019.1040132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNantachit, Nattika10aMolecular surveillance and genetic analyses of bufavirus in environmental water in Thailand  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBufavirus (BuV), a recent discovery virus of the family Parvoviridae, has been suggested to be a potential causative agent of diarrhea in humans. The prevalence of BuV has been demonstrated mostly in fecal specimens of diarrheic patients. Little is known about the presence of BuV in the environmental water. The aim of the present study was to conduct a surveillance for BuV in the environmental water in Thailand. A total of 125 water samples were collected during November 2016 and July 2018 from six different areas in Chiang Mai city, Thailand. Water samples were concentrated and extracted to obtain BuV genomic DNA. The BuV was screened by amplification of NS1 region using nested-PCR. The detected BuV was further characterized by amplification of VP2 region. The NS1 and VP2 genes were sequenced and analyzed phylogenetically. The BuV strain (CMW88/18) detected in this study belonged to BuV1 with the prevalence of 0.8%. The CMW88/18 strain was most closely related to human BuV1 strains reported previously worldwide suggesting contamination of BuV in the environmental water could be a potential source of infection in human.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aProtoparvovirus 3adiarrhea 3aetiological agents 3ahumans 3ainfection 3amonitoring 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aviruses 3aThailand 0aBufavirus 0aEnvironmental water 0aGenotype 1 0aGastroenteritis1 aKhamrin, Pattara1 aKumthip, Kattareeya1 aMalasao, Rungnapa1 aManeekarn, Niwat0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2019 Nov., v. 75 p.104013-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2019.1040133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02936naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245011400172300001600286520160000302592002801902650002301930650001201953650001501965650001301980650002101993650001502014650001502029650002502044650001902069650001502088653002602103653001402129653002002143653002402163653004102187653003002228700002202258700001802280773011202298856008302410852000902493655001202502IND60611307820221122150238.0200128e20181030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061130782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2018.06.0592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChampigneux, Pierre10aImpact of electrode micro- and nano-scale topography on the formation and performance of microbial electrodes  ap. 231-246.  aFrom a fundamental standpoint, microbial electrochemistry is unravelling a thrilling link between life and materials. Technically, it may be the source of a large number of new processes such as microbial fuel cells for powering remote sensors, autonomous sensors, microbial electrolysers and equipment for effluent treatment. Microbial electron transfers are also involved in many natural processes such as biocorrosion. In these contexts, a huge number of studies have dealt with the impact of electrode materials, coatings and surface functionalizations but very few have focused on the effect of the surface topography, although it has often been pointed out as a key parameter impacting the performance of electroactive biofilms.The first part of the review gives an overview of the influence of electrode topography on abiotic electrochemical reactions. The second part recalls some basics of the effect of surface topography on bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation, in a broad domain reaching beyond the context of electroactivity. On these well-established bases, the effect of surface topography is reviewed and analysed in the field of electroactive biofilms. General trends are extracted and fundamental questions are pointed out, which should be addressed to boost future research endeavours. The objective is to provide basic guidelines useful to the widest possible range of research communities so that they can exploit surface topography as a powerful lever to improve, or to mitigate in the case of biocorrosion for instance, the performance of electrode/biofilm interfaces.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacterial adhesion 3abiofilm 3abiosensors 3acoatings 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aguidelines 3amicrobial fuel cells 3aremote sensing 3atopography 0aElectroactive biofilm 0aRoughness 0aMicrobial anode 0aMicrobial fuel cell 0aMicrobial electrochemical technology 0aBioelectrochemical system1 aDelia, Marie-Line1 aBergel, Alain0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2018 Oct. 30, v. 118 p.231-246dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2018.06.0593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02709naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245008200162300001800244520163900262592002801901650001401929650001301943650001501956650001501971650002501986650001702011650001102028650000902039700002302048700002202071700002302093700002402116773012302140856007502263852000902338655001202347IND60534850920221118161531.0160803e20130507xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053485092DNAL7 a10.1021/es304580r2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl Badawy, Amro M.10aKey Factors Controlling the Transport of Silver Nanoparticles in Porous Media  ap. 4039-4045.  aThe current study investigated the mobility of four silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) stabilized using different capping agents and represent the common stabilization mechanisms as well as surface charging scenarios in reactive and nonreactive porous media. The AgNPs were (1) uncoated H₂–AgNPs (electrostatically stabilized) and (2) citrate coated AgNPs (Citrate-AgNPs) (electrostatically stabilized), (3) polyvinylpyrrolidone coated AgNPs (PVP-AgNPs) (sterically stabilized), and (4) branched polyethyleneimine coated AgNPs (BPEI-AgNPs) (electrosterically stabilized). The porous media were (1) quartz sand (QS), (2) ferrihydrite-coated sand (FcS), and (3) kaolin-coated sand (KcS). The H₂–AgNPs and Citrate-AgNPs were readily mobile in QS but significantly retained in FcS and KcS with more deposition achieved in the KcS media. The deposition of the H₂–AgNPs and Citrate-AgNPs followed the order of KcS > FcS > QS. The PVP-AgNPs breakthrough occurred more rapid as compared to the H₂–AgNPs and Citrate-AgNPs but the deposition of PVP-AgNPs followed the same order of the electrostatically stabilized AgNPs (KcS > FcS > QS). The BPEI-AgNPs were readily mobile regardless of the porous media reactivity. Physicochemical interactions were the dominant filtration mechanism in the majority of the investigated cases but straining played the major role in the deposition of the electrostatically stabilized H₂–AgNPs and Citrate-AgNPs in the KcS media. The results highlight the importance of both the stabilization mechanism and capping agent chemistry as key factors governing the transport of AgNPs in the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemistry 3acitrates 3afiltration 3ananosilver 3apolyvinylpyrrolidone 3aporous media 3aquartz 3asand1 aAly Hassan, Ashraf1 aScheckel, Kirk G.1 aSuidan, Makram T.,1 aTolaymat, Thabet M.0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2013 May 07, v. 47, no. 9 p.4039-4045dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes304580r3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04151naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245016900168300001600337520240200353592002802755650001202783650001802795650002502813650001202838650001702850650002702867650001302894650001402907650001602921650002402937650002002961650002202981650001903003650001403022650001503036650001103051650002003062650001503082650001803097650001403115650000703129650001003136650002503146650001803171650001003189650001403199650002103213650002503234650001103259700002303270700002003293700001703313773012903330856008103459852000903540655001203549IND60676492520221121180648.0191119e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067649252DNAL7 a10.3103/S10683674190500692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFomichev, Yu. P.10aBio Correction of Enzymatic and Microbial Processes in Rumen and Intermediary Metabolism in Sheep with the Use of Antioxidant and Organic Iodine Dietary Supplements  ap. 464-469.  aDihydroquercetin, the antioxidant added to the sheep diet either alone or in combination with organic iodine had a significant effect on the rumen enzymatic and microbiological processes, the intermediary metabolism, and the sheep’s resistance. Under the effect of dihydroquercetin in combination with the organic iodine, insignificant increases in the chyme’s pH, the advanced oxidation processes, the elevated level of ammonia, and the greater number of microorganisms in the rumen were recorded generally due to infuzoria. In case of adding dihydroquercetin alone, the chyme’s pH normalized, its oxidation lowered, the reduction processes intensified, and the microorganism number increased due to infuzoria and bacteria. Some decreases in the chyme concentrations of volatile fatty acids and ammonia were simultaneously observed. The feed additives had a significant impact on the rumen microbiota. Under the effect of dihydroquercetin in combination with the organic iodine, the numbers of lactobacilli and mesophilic aerobic and facultatively anaerobic microorganisms (MAFAnM) in the rumen content increased tenfold and fourfold, respectively, while the rumen lactose-positive strains and fungal species, including the fungi of the genus Candida, the molds, and the yeasts, decreased by 98.9 and 65.3%, respectively. In case of adding dihydroquercetin alone, the numbers of lactobacilli and MAFAnM increased 11.5-fold and 21-fold, respectively, while the lactose-positive strains decreased by 92.2%. The numbers of fungal species, including fungi, molds, and yeasts, increased 2.2-fold. Under the effect of dihydroquercetin in combination with the organic iodine, the serum globulin concentrations increased, while the levels of triglycerides and bilirubin and the ALT and AST activities lowered in the sheep blood. In case of adding dihydroquercetin alone, the increases in serum albumin concentration, together with the globulin concentrations, were recorded. Therefore, the albumin-globulin ratio comprised 0.99. The levels of triglycerides and bilirubin and the ALT and AST activities also lowered. Dihydroquercetin in combination with the organic iodine and alone lowered the white blood cell count by 22.7 and 27.1%, respectively, increased the red blood cell count by 13.9 and 16.5%, respectively, and elevated the hematocrit level, indicating the sheep’s health improvements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida 3aLactobacillus 3aalanine transaminase 3aammonia 3aantioxidants 3aaspartate transaminase 3abacteria 3abilirubin 3ablood serum 3adietary supplements 3aenzyme activity 3aerythrocyte count 3afeed additives 3aglobulins 3ahematocrit 3aiodine 3aleukocyte count 3ametabolism 3amolds (fungi) 3aoxidation 3apH 3arumen 3arumen microorganisms 3aserum albumin 3asheep 3ataxifolin 3atriacylglycerols 3avolatile fatty acids 3ayeasts1 aBogolyubova, N.

Recently, the immune function of ferritins have attracted increasing attention, especially their roles in defense against pathogenic infections. However, the immune regulatory mechanism of fish ferritins are not well known. In the present study, comparative digital gene expression (DGE) profiling was performed to explore the regulatory effects of the Megalobrama amblycephala ferritins (MamFers) using MamFers overexpressed and control L8824 cells (Ctenopharyngodon idella hepatic cell line). Clean reads were aligned to the C. idella genome and differential expression analysis was conducted with representative differentially expressed genes pointed out. On that basis, further studies were performed to verify two pivotal regulated pathways in L8824 and EPC (Epithelioma Papulosum Cyprini cell line) cells, respectively. The results showed that NLRC5 (NOD-like Receptor Family CARD Domain Containing 5) mediated the regulation of MamFers on expression of MHC I (Major Histocompatibility Complex Class I) and its chaperone β2M (Beta-2-Microglobulin) in L8824 cells. Then, β2M further mediated the regulation of MamFers on hepcidin expression, indicating that MamFers regulated the expression of hepcidin via NLRC5/MHC I/β2M axis. In addition, MamFers regulated the adhesion of Aeromonas hydrophila to EPC cells by regulating the expression of two extracellular matrix proteins Intgβ1 (integrin β1) and FN (fibronectin). In a word, the present study provided novel insights into the immune regulatory functions of fish ferritins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAeromonas hydrophila 3aCD29 antigen 3aCtenopharyngodon idella 3aMegalobrama amblycephala 3aadhesion 3acell lines 3aferritin 3afibronectins 3afish 3agene expression regulation 3agene overexpression 3ahepcidin 3ahomeostasis 3aimmune response 3airon 3amajor histocompatibility complex 0aMegalobrama amblycephala 0aFerritins 0aDigital gene expression 0aRegulatory effects 0aImmune pathways1 aZhao, Xiaoheng1 aCui, Lei1 aSun, Qianhui1 aZhang, Feng1 aWang, Jixiu1 aWang, Weimin1 aLiu, Hong0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2019 Apr., v. 87 p.679-687dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2019.01.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02137naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245009900165300001600264520101800280592002801298650001801326650001801344650001501362650002501377650002301402650001501425651001101440653002101451653001601472653002801488653002301516700002201539773012701561856007801688852000901766655001201775IND60626626020221119093613.0181222e20181201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062662602DNAL7 a10.2478/jwld-2018-00672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPardela, Łukasz10aEstimated soil water storage within a historical bunker during the growth period of vegetation  ap. 125-130.  aThe objective of the study was to estimate the variation of soil water retention on the site of a historical bunker, an element of the former Wrocław Fortress in Poland. Measurements of soil moisture in the study area were taken in the period from March to September, 2017. Measurements of volumetric soil moisture were taken by means of a hand-held gauge, type FOM/mts with an FP/mts probe, operating on the basis of the reflectometric technique TDR. Soil moisture measurements realized in the vegetation period demonstrated that soil moisture resources in profiles situated in the section of the bunker varied within the range of 37–135 mm in the layer of 50 cm, and 66–203 mm in the layer of 100 cm. The maximum differences of the average value of soil moisture of the soil profiles studied in the period covered by the measurements were 31 mm and 56 mm, respectively. This indicates a significant differentiation of the retention properties of soils used for the construction of individual shelter areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3areflectometry 3asoil profiles 3asoil water 3asoil water retention 3asoil water storage 3avegetation 3aPoland 0aabandoned places 0agreen roofs 0apost-military landscape 0aurban green spaces1 aKowalczyk, Tomasz0 tJournal of water and land development.g2018 Dec. 01, v. 39, no. 1 p.125-130dSciendowJournal:jnl4334744x2083-45357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/jwld-2018-00673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02788naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003900135040001800174100001400192245008800206500001900294506007600313520135900389592002801748506003701776650002301813650002201836650001001858650001401868650002101882650001601903650001001919650001901929650001601948650002401964650002001988650002202008650001702030651001002047653001702057653001402074700001702088700001402105773009202119856008602211852000902297655001202306IND60690839320221207112622.0201230e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069083932DNAL7 a311933722pmid7 aPMC65262312pmcid7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e016132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMba, O.I.10aKinetic modelling of polyphenol degradation during common beans soaking and cooking  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPhenolic compounds are phytonutrients with anti-inflammatory attributes that are significant for brain, heart and gut health. Losses of natural phenolic compounds in foods occur due to degradation during processing. The extent of degradation depends on the processing conditions applied. In this study, the degradation of total phenolic compounds during the processing of common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) cultivars was investigated. The effects of soaking time, soaking water temperature and cooking conditions on polyphenol degradation were examined. The total phenolic compounds were determined as gallic acid equivalents. The result shows that increase of hydration time and process water temperature significantly (p < 0.05) increased polyphenol degradation. There was a strong positive Pearson correlation (r > 0. 85) between the rate of water uptake and polyphenol degradation regardless of the water temperature and cultivar. The rate of degradation varied from 0.041 – 0.098 and 0.014–0.069 mg/g per hour for Kabulangeti and Maine cultivar, respectively. The addition sodium chloride (NaCl) and potassium carbonate (K₂CO₃) during cooking to soften the beans significantly increased the degree of degradation. The activation energy for degradation was estimated as 45.4 and 26.3 kJ/mol for Kabulangeti and Maine cultivar, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aactivation energy 3abrain 3acultivars 3adigestive system 3agallic acid 3aheart 3aphytonutrients 3apolyphenols 3apotassium carbonate 3asodium chloride 3awater temperature 3awater uptake 3aMaine 0aFood science 0aChemistry1 aKwofie, E.M.1 aNgadi, M.0 tHeliyon.g2019 May, v. 5, no. 5 p.e01613-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e016133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02942naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245013700159300001600296520152400312592002801836650001101864650002501875650001301900650003501913650001501948650001601963650001301979650001901992650001902011650001102030650000902041650001202050650001802062650001502080650002302095651001002118653002502128653002602153653003702179700002002216700002202236773012702258856007802385852000902463655001202472IND60626626120221119093258.0181222e20181201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062662612DNAL7 a10.2478/jwld-2018-00682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaid, Saif10aMorphometric analysis and sub-watersheds prioritization of Nagmati River watershed, Kutch District, Gujarat using GIS based approach  ap. 131-139.  aMorphometric analysis of any watershed and its prioritization is one of the important aspects of planning for implementation of management programmes. Present study evaluates the quantitative morphometric characteristics of Nagmati River watershed in Kutch District of Gujarat by utilizing Cartosat-1 data (CartoDEM). In all 19 aerial and 6 linear morphometric parameters of the watershed have been evaluated. Drainage map of the study area reveals a dendritic drainage pattern with sixth order stream network comprising 492 numbers of streams and confining an area of 129.41 km². Mean bifurcation ratio (Rb) and stream length ratio (RL) of the watershed evaluated are 3.44 and 0.54 respectively which corroborates the fact that drainage pattern is not influenced by the geological evolutions and disturbances in the recent past. The drainage density of 2.68 kmꞏkm⁻² indicates impermeable subsoil material with sparse vegetation and moderate to low relief. Elongation ratio of 0.956 infers the basin to be closer to a circular shape. The geologic stage of development and erosion proneness of the watershed is quantified by hypsometric integral (HI) bearing value as 0.5, indicating the landscape to be uniform and in early mature stage. The study prioritizes eight sub-watersheds as high, medium and low for taking up soil and water conservation activities. Hence, remote sensing applications proved to be highly useful in extracting the precise data for the evaluation and analysis of watershed characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3adevelopmental stages 3adrainage 3ageographic information systems 3alandscapes 3amorphometry 3aplanning 3aprioritization 3aremote sensing 3arivers 3asoil 3astreams 3asubwatersheds 3avegetation 3awater conservation 3aIndia 0ahypsometric analysis 0amorphometric analysis 0aNagmati watershed prioritization1 aSiddique, Rabab1 aShakeel, Mohammad0 tJournal of water and land development.g2018 Dec. 01, v. 39, no. 1 p.131-139dSciendowJournal:jnl4334744x2083-45357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/jwld-2018-00683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02290naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245012000171300001400291520112100305592002801426650001401454650002701468650002101495650001501516650002201531653001101553653001301564653001501577653001101592653001601603700006901619700002501688773012301713856008301836852000901919655001201928IND60610528520221120070730.0180828e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061052852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvp.2016.11.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorton, Thomas A.10aSeeing our self reflected in the world around us: The role of identity in making (natural) environments restorative  ap. 65-77.  aExposure to nature has been shown to restore cognitive capacities and activate intrinsic motivational states. The present research considered the role of salient identities in determining these effects. Three studies demonstrated that salient identities modify how people respond to natural environments. Exposure to images of natural environments increased the strength of intrinsic over extrinsic aspirations, and improved cognitive capacity, only when nature was central to a salient identity (Studies 1 & 2), or when the specific nature portrayed was connected to the salient identity (Study 3). Conversely, when nature was inconsistent with a salient identity, exposure had deleterious effects on aspiration and cognition. Together these studies suggest that the restorative potential of environments is determined, at least in part, by social and psychological processes connected to identity. These findings invite a more nuanced approach to understanding the possible psychological benefits of exposure to nature, and suggest that a variety of environments (natural and urban) can have restorative potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3acognition 3aecological restoration 3aecological value 3ahinterland 3avisual perception 0aNature 0aIdentity 0aAspiration 0aMemory 0aRestoration1 avan der Bles, Anne Marthe1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7953-94251 aHaslam, S.

R.10aSingle Cell Chemical Cytometry of Akt Activity in Rheumatoid Arthritis and Normal Fibroblast-like Synoviocytes in Response to Tumor Necrosis Factor α  ap. 7786-7792.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe etiology of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is poorly understood, and 30% of patients are unresponsive to established treatments targeting tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα). Akt kinase is implicated in TNFα signaling and may act as a barometer of patient responses to biologic therapies. Fluorescent peptide sensors and chemical cytometry were employed to directly measure Akt activity as well as proteolytic activity in individual fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) from RA and normal subjects. The specificity of the peptide reporter was evaluated and shown to be a valid measure of Akt activity in single cells. The effect of TNFα treatment on Akt activity was highly heterogeneous between normal and RA subjects, which was not observable in bulk analyses. In 2 RA subjects, a bimodal distribution of Akt activity was observed, primarily due to a subpopulation (21.7%: RA Subject 5; 23.8%: RA Subject 6) of cells in which >60% of the reporter was phosphorylated. These subjects also possessed statistically elevated proteolytic cleavage of the reporter relative to normal subjects, suggesting heterogeneity in Akt and protease activity that may play a role in the RA-affected joint. We expect that chemical cytometry studies pairing peptide reporters with capillary electrophoresis will provide valuable data regarding aberrant kinase activity from small samples of clinical interest.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acapillary electrophoresis 3aenzyme activity 3aetiology 3afluorescence 3apatients 3aproteolysis 3arheumatoid arthritis 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aSerafin, D.

These ARB and other mobile genetic elements can be easily spread from hospital facilities, the point in which, for sure, they are more concentrated. For this reason, novel clean and efficient technologies are being developed for allowing to remove these ARB and other mobile genetic elements before their uncontrolled spread. In this paper, a review on the recent knowledge about the state of the art of the main disinfection technologies to control the antibiotic resistance spread from natural water, wastewater, and hospital wastewater (including urine matrices) is reported. These technologies involve not only conventional processes, but also the recent advances on advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), including electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOPs). This review summarizes the state of the art on the applicability of these technologies and also focuses on the description of the disinfection mechanisms by each technology, highlighting the promising impact of EAOPs on the remediation of this important environmental and health problem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotic resistance 3adisinfection 3aelectrochemistry 3aenvironment 3ahospitals 3aoxidation 3aremediation 3arisk 3aurine 3awastewater 0aAntibiotic-resistant bacteria 0aHospital urine1 aCotillas, Salvador1 aLacasa, Engracia1 aSainz de Baranda, Caridad1 aRiquelme, Eva1 aCañizares, Pablo1 aRodrigo, Manuel A.1 aSáez, Cristina,0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Nov. 25, v. 797 p.149150-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1491503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02148naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245014500179300001800324520093000342592002801272650001701300650001601317650001401333650001701347650001801364650003101382650001301413650001401426700002701440700001601467700002401483700002001507700002301527700001801550773009901568856008601667852000901753655001201762IND60577292520221122202750.0170807e20150825xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057729252DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b020042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLandarani-Isfahani, Amir10aXylanase Immobilized on Novel Multifunctional Hyperbranched Polyglycerol-Grafted Magnetic Nanoparticles: An Efficient and Robust Biocatalyst  ap. 9219-9227.  aAlthough several strategies are now available for immobilization of enzymes to magnetic nanoparticles for bioapplications, little progresses have been reported on the use of dendritic or hyperbranched polymers for the same purpose. Herein, we demonstrated synthesis of magnetic nanoparticles supported hyperbranched polyglycerol (MNP/HPG) and a derivative conjugated with citric acid (MNP/HPG-CA) as unique and convenient nanoplatforms for immobilization of enzymes. Then, an important industrial enzyme, xylanase, was immobilized on the nanocarriers to produce robust biocatalysts. A variety of analytical tools were used to study the morphological, structural, and chemical properties of the biocatalysts. Additionally, the results of biocatalyst systems exhibited the substantial improvement of reactivity, reusability, and stability of xylanase due to this strategy, which might confer them a wider range of applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocatalysts 3acitric acid 3amagnetism 3ananocarriers 3ananoparticles 3aphysicochemical properties 3apolymers 3axylanases1 aTaheri-Kafrani, Asghar1 aAmini, Mina1 aMirkhani, Valiollah1 aMoghadam, Majid1 aSoozanipour, Asieh1 aRazmjou, Amir0 tLangmuir.g2015 Aug. 25, v. 31, no. 33 p.9219-9227dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.5b020043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02727naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003600151245012600187520128300313592002801596650001801624650001701642650001401659650002001673650001501693650001601708650001301724650001201737650001101749650001701760650002801777651000901805651001401814651001101828653004501839653002101884653002701905653002001932653003201952700006201984700001502046773011302061856008602174852000902260655001202269IND60793215820221120181233.0220921e20221110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079321582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1339972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeerasinghe, Nilmini Pradeepika10aLearning from success: A machine learning approach to guiding solar building envelope applications in non-domestic market  aSolar building envelopes, also known as Building Integrated PV (BIPV) show significant growth in Asia and Europe, although other regions such as Australia are still lagging. The decision to uptake BIPV is complex due to the heterogeneous interest of adopters and multi-dimensional features. Instead of redesigning BIPV in hypothetical buildings, we built a machine learning model using a database of real BIPV and building-attached PV (BAPV) applications, for the purpose of learning and predicting a BIPV adoption decision-making in non-domestic buildings in western countries. We used Australia as a case study to execute the support vector machine (SVM) prediction model. It was revealed that the combination of project determinants such as geographical conditions, equivalent building materials, interest rates and capital cost influenced the decision of BIPV. The prediction model provides pieces of information for stakeholders across the BIPV ecosystem to take their decision on investment, policymaking, and research directions. The current global industry transformation and innovations in technology are favourable to politically promoting and investing in BIPV. Such promotion and investment would help both expand the current market and reach the greenhouse targets.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapital costs 3acase studies 3adatabases 3adecision making 3aecosystems 3agreenhouses 3aindustry 3amarkets 3amodels 3astakeholders 3asupport vector machines 3aAsia 3aAustralia 3aEurope 0aBuilding integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) 0aMachine learning 0aSupport vector machine 0aDecision-making 0aSolar building applications1 aYang, Rebecca Jing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0418-19671 aWang, Chen0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Nov. 10, v. 374 p.133997-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1339973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03595naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245013300164506002800297520209800325592002802423506003702451650001702488650001602505650002502521650001502546650001202561650001502573650001302588650001702601650002302618651001402641653002902655653003102684653002702715653003202742653002302774700001902797700002302816700001602839700005302855700003602908773009202944856008003036852000903116655001203125IND60764591320221215142601.0211122e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076459132DNAL7 a10.13057/biodiv/d2105572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuana, I Wayan10aEnvironment carrying capacity and willingness to pay for bird-watching ecotourism in Kerandangan Natural Park, Lombok, Indonesia  aResource is Open Access  aSuana IW, Ahyadi H, Hadiprayitno G, Amin S, Kalih LATTWS, Sudaryanto FX. 2020. Environment carrying capacity and willingness to pay for bird-watching ecotourism in Kerandangan Natural Park, Lombok, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 21: 2266-2274. Five trails of interest to bird-watchers and an observation point by the guest house of Kerandangan Natural Park (KNP) have potential to be developed as bird-watching ecotourism packages. In order to develop sustainable bird-watching ecotourism in KNP, we analyzed the environment carrying capacity and willingness to pay (WTP) for bird-watching ecotourism packages. All of the trails and an observation point in KNP were explored to determine the width and length of the trails, the visit time, as well as the soil texture and slope along the trails. Interviews with KNP managers and secondary data from Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Council (BMKG)-Climatology Station Class I-West Lombok were also used to determine the status of biophysical habitats. The environment carrying capacity was calculated by combining the physical carrying capacity, real carrying capacity, and effective carrying capacity. The results show that environment carrying capacity of bird-watching ecotourism packages in KNP was higher than the actual visitation levels. It indicates that opportunity to develop and increase the number of visitors is considerable. WTP was determined by Contingent Valuation Method (CVM) with payment card approach. Through the brochure, 150 respondents were given information on bird-watching ecotourism packages, then are offered three options, and only allowed to choose one that can be paid. Data were collected by the incidental sampling method. The results show that the visitors are willing to pay for bird-watching ecotourism packages, with mean WTP of US$ 20.7 per visitor. It implies that they are willing to shoulder the financial support for management and conservation of birds and their habitat in KNP. The findings provide important information for KNP managers for planning and marketing bird-watching ecotourism in KNP.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abirdwatching 3aclimatology 3acontingent valuation 3aecotourism 3afunding 3ageophysics 3ahabitats 3asoil texture 3awillingness to pay 3aIndonesia 0abird-watching ecotourism 0aphysical carrying capacity 0areal carrying capacity 0aeffective carrying capacity 0awillingness to pay1 aAhyadi, Hilman1 aHadiprayitno, Gito1 aAmin, Saleh1 aLalu Achmad Tan Tilar Wangsajati Sukmaring Kalih1 aSudaryanto, Franciscus Xaverius0 tBiodiversitas.g2020 Apr., v. 21, no. 5dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.13057/biodiv/d2105573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02826naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245013000168300001400298520120700312592002801519650004301547650001001590650002201600650001701622650001301639650002301652650001201675650001201687650001901699650002101718650001801739650003301757650002401790650001501814651001001829653003101839653002001870653002301890653003301913653002801946653001901974700001701993700001302010700001702023700001502040700001602055700001502071773010302086856008602189852000902275655001202284IND60643033920221120062623.0190529e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064303392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2019.05.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Liquan14aThe potential source of nitrous oxide in the pristine riparian marsh during freeze-thaw cycles, case study in Northeast China  ap. 18-25.  aSoil Freeze-Thaw Cycles (FTCs) can provide large amounts of labile C and N to microorganisms to stimulate nitrous oxide (N2O) production and emission in the soil. To explore the effects of FTCs on N2O fluxes in the pristine riparian marsh, we used the static chamber-GC techniques to investigate N2O fluxes in the marsh meadow Calamagrostis angustifolia wetland (MMCW), Ecotone wetland (EW) and Carex Schmidtii Meinsh. marsh (CSMM) in Sanjiang Plain from March to April 2016. The results showed that the three marshes were potential sources of N2O during FTCS. The variations of N2O fluxes in the three marshes were significantly different (P < 0.001) during FTCS. Principal component analysis and regression analysis indicated that soil NH4+-N and NO3−-N content were the main driving factors of N2O fluxes in MMCW. Though significant correlations were observed between N2O fluxes and soil NH4+-N content in 0 to10 cm soil depth in EW (r = 0.98, P < 0.01) and in CSMM (r = 0.93, P < 0.05) respectively, the driving factors of N2O fluxes during FTCS in EW and CSMM were uncertain. In conclusion, soil FTCS might contribute to the emissions of N2O in the pristine riparian marshes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCalamagrostis purpurea subsp. purpurea 3aCarex 3aammonium nitrogen 3acase studies 3aecotones 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3amarshes 3ameadows 3amicroorganisms 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrous oxide 3aprincipal component analysis 3aregression analysis 3asoil depth 3aChina 0aNitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes 0aDriving factors 0aFreeze-Thaw cycles 0aPrincipal component analysis 0aPristine riparian marsh 0aSanjiang Plain1 aYao, Yunlong1 aLin, Lin1 aGao, Weifeng1 aCai, Tijiu1 aLiang, Hong1 aGao, Dawen0 tEcological engineering.g2019 Sept., v. 134 p.18-25dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2019.05.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02963naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005800151245006900209520170000278592002801978650001202006650001502018650001902033650003102052650001402083650001302097650002102110650001202131653002202143653001802165653002802183653002102211653002302232700005902255700001902314700005802333773011302391856005202504852000902556655001202565IND60793216020221120190035.0220914e20221110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079321602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1340002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarkas, Andrea1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1820-798810aEnergy savings potential of hull cleaning in a shipping industry  aThe operational performance of ships, which is reflected through fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emission, is affected by various influential parameters. One of the important parameters is biofouling, which occurs at the immersed surfaces in between maintenance periods. Containerships are usually fouled with biofilm, which is commonly neglected during ship operation, as it is considered that biofilm does not affect ship performance significantly. This study investigates the potential energy savings of cleaning the biofilm for Post Panamax and Post Panamax Plus class of containerships, which are estimated for calm water condition, under weather and oceanographic conditions and for various draughts. The method for the estimation of the detrimental effects of biofilm using actual ship operating profiles and engine loads is proposed, and the potential fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emission reduction with hull cleaning is estimated and discussed. For the investigated containership fleets, an annual increase in fuel oil consumption for sailing in calm water is up to 153,689.9 t/year, while in CO₂ emission is up to 478,590.5 t/year for Post Panamax containerships, while for Post Panamax Plus containerships these increases are up to 157,650.7 t/year and 490,924.1 t/year, respectively. The annual costs related to the increased fuel costs due to biofilm presence for the investigated fleets are therefore up to 64 M$/year for Post Panamax fleet and 66.6 M$/year for Post Panamax Plus fleet. The obtained results highlight the importance of keeping the hull clean from both an environmental and economic point of view and indicate the detrimental effects of biofilm.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofilm 3abiofouling 3acarbon dioxide 3aenergy use and consumption 3afuel oils 3aindustry 3apotential energy 3aweather 0aEnergy efficiency 0aContainership 0aCarbon dioxide emission 0aFuel consumption 0aMaritime transport1 aDegiuli, Nastia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1596-70811 aMartić, Ivana1 aAnčić, Ivica1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1887-66040 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Nov. 10, v. 374 p.134000-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.134000  aDNAL 7aarticle02465naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245009800172300002000270520145800290592002801748650001501776650001401791650001001805650001101815650001501826650001401841650002301855700001501878773016801893856008102061852000902142655001202151IND60596658920221119164930.0180619e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059665892DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-018-1777-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, G.q(Guangrui),10aVariation laws and release characteristics of phosphorus on surface sediment of Dongting Lake  ap. 12342-12351.  aThe variation trend and growth rate of P were analyzed by the concentration of the phosphorus fraction on surface sediment of Dongting Lake from 2012 to 2016, to reveal the cumulative effect of P in the actual environment. Meanwhile, the adsorption kinetics and adsorption isotherm were employed to examine the P-release possibility of sediment, which predicts the yearly released sediment phosphorus in Dongting Lake. The actual growth rate of TP (Total Phosphorus) is 53 mg·(kg·year)⁻¹ in East Dongting Lake, 39 mg·(kg·year)⁻¹ in South Dongting Lake, and 29 mg·(kg·year)⁻¹ in West Dongting Lake, while the sum of the phosphorus fraction growth rates has little difference from the rate of TP in sediments of the three areas of Dongting Lake. Furthermore, the Elovich model and the Langmuir crossover-type equations are established to present the adsorption characteristic of sediment in Dongting Lake; the result shows that the sediments play a source role for phosphorus in East and South Dongting Lake from zero equilibrium phosphorus concentration (EPC₀) in the present situation, but an adsorption effect on TP is shown in West Dongting Lake. When the conditions of environment change are ignored, the maximum P-sorption level in sediments of East Dongting Lake will reach in 2040 according to the actual growth rate of sediments, while that in West Dongting Lake and South Dongting Lake will be in 2046 and 2061, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aequations 3alakes 3amodels 3aphosphorus 3asediments 3asorption isotherms1 aYang, Ying0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2018 May, v. 25, no. 13 p.12342-12351dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-1777-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02692naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245011300169300001600282520128800298592002801586650001401614650001201628650001101640650001901651650001901670650002501689650001901714650000901733650002201742650001101764650001601775650001901791650002201810650001801832650001101850650001701861650002901878650001401907650002501921650001601946700001601962700001601978700001801994773009602012856008102108852000902189655001202198IND60441780420221121053501.0151027e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044178042DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-015-1469-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNemet, Gregory F.10aCharacterizing the effects of policy instruments on the future costs of carbon capture for coal power plants  ap. 155-168.  aWe develop a methodology with which to assess the effects of policy instruments on the long-term abatement and costs of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies for coal power plants. Using an expert elicitation, historical data on the determinants of technological change in energy, values from the engineering literature, and demand estimates from an integrated assessment model, we simulate ranges of outcomes between 2025 and 2095. We introduce probability distributions of all important parameters and propagate them through the model to generate probability distributions of electricity costs, abatement costs, and CO₂ avoided over time. Carbon pricing has larger effects than R&D and subsidies. But much of the range of outcomes is driven by uncertainty in other parameters, such as capital costs and returns to scale. Availability of other low carbon technologies, particularly bioenergy with CCS affects outcomes. Subsidies have the biggest impacts when they coincide with expanding manufacturing scale of CCS components. Our results point to 4 parameters for which better information is needed for future work informing technology policy to address climate change: capital costs, demonstration plants, growth constraints, and knowledge spillovers among technologies.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioenergy 3acapital 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon markets 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimate change 3acoal 3aelectricity costs 3aenergy 3aengineering 3aexpert opinion 3aissues and policy 3amanufacturing 3amodels 3apower plants 3aprobability distribution 3asubsidies 3atechnological change 3auncertainty1 aBaker, Erin1 aBarron, Bob1 aHarms, Samuel0 tClimatic change.g2015 Nov., v. 133, no. 2 p.155-168dSpringer Netherlandsx0165-00097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-015-1469-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02471naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245008000168300001600248520129200264592002801556650001301584650001201597650001901609650001001628650002201638650001201660650001401672650000901686650001301695650001501708650001101723650001101734651002601745700001801771700002401789700002701813700002301840773009601863856008101959852000902040655001202049IND60575783320221119083550.0170728e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057578332DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-017-1899-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGergel, Diana R.10aEffects of climate change on snowpack and fire potential in the western USA  ap. 287-299.  aWe evaluate the implications of ten twenty-first century climate scenarios for snow, soil moisture, and fuel moisture across the conterminous western USA using the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrology model. A decline in mountain snowpack, an advance in the timing of spring melt, and a reduction in snow season are projected for five mountain ranges in the region. For the southernmost range (the White Mountains), spring snow at most elevations will disappear by the end of the twenty-first century. We investigate soil and fuel moisture changes for the five mountain ranges and for six lowland regions. The accelerated depletion of mountain snowpack due to warming leads to reduced summer soil moisture across mountain environments. Similarly, warmer and drier summers lead to decreases of up to 25% in dead fuel moisture across all mountain ranges. Collective declines in spring mountain snowpack, summer soil moisture, and fuel moisture across western mountain ranges will increase fire potential in flammability-limited forested systems where fuels are not limiting. Projected changes in fire potential in predominately fuel-limited systems at lower elevations are more uncertain given the confounding signals between projected changes in soil moisture and fuel moisture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3afuels 3ahydrologic models 3amelting 3amountains 3asnow 3asnowpack 3asoil water 3aspring 3asummer 3aWestern United States1 aNijssen, Bart1 aAbatzoglou, John T.1 aLettenmaier, Dennis P.1 aStumbaugh, Matt R.0 tClimatic change.g2017 Mar., v. 141, no. 2 p.287-299dSpringer Netherlandsx0165-00097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-017-1899-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02924naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245015200165300001400317520124200331592002801573650002401601650001501625650002001640650001001660650001501670650001501685650001201700650001301712650002101725650001401746650001401760650001501774650000901789650001901798650002401817650001501841650002101856653001301877653001701890653001901907653002401926653001401950653002201964700001601986700001702002700001802019700005702037700002002094700001702114700001702131773010302148856008602251852000902337655001202346IND60643034020221120053145.0190529e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064303402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2019.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jian10aEffect of clipping on aboveground biomass and nutrients varies with slope position but not with slope aspect in a hilly semiarid restored grassland  ap. 47-55.  aClipping is a common management option in semiarid grasslands, but whether topography mediates the effects of clipping on plant and soil nutrients is poorly studied. We examined the interacting effects of clipping and topography (slope aspect and slope position) on the aboveground biomass and carbon (C) and nutrient concentration of graminoid and forb, as well as on soil organic carbon (OC) and nutrient content in a restored grassland under long-term grazing exclusion. Clipping increased the aboveground biomass of forb and total community, and decreased most C and nutrient concentration in aboveground biomass, but did not influence the aboveground biomass of graminoid or the content of soil OC and nutrient. Slope aspect did not change the effects of clipping on most plant aboveground biomass, or soil OC and nutrients. However, slope position altered the effects of clipping on soil inorganic nitrogen, total phosphorus, and available potassium, with lower nutrient levels on the upper slope but higher nutrient levels on the middle and lower slopes. The results demonstrate that slope position should be considered in predicting the response of soil biogeochemical processes to clipping in hilly semiarid restored grasslands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaboveground biomass 3aarid lands 3abiogeochemistry 3aforbs 3agraminoids 3agrasslands 3agrazing 3anitrogen 3anutrient content 3anutrients 3apotassium 3aprediction 3asoil 3asoil nutrients 3asoil organic carbon 3atopography 3atotal phosphorus 0aClipping 0aSlope aspect 0aSlope position 0aAboveground biomass 0aNutrients 0aGrazing exclusion1 aQiu, Liping1 aAo, Gukailin1 aZheng, Bangyu1 aWei, Xiaorong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0359-03391 aZhang, Yanjiang1 aGao, Hailong1 aCheng, Jimin0 tEcological engineering.g2019 Sept., v. 134 p.47-55dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2019.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03080naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245012300169520153600292592002801828650002601856650001901882650001701901650001501918650001701933650001201950650001601962650002001978650002101998650001302019650001602032650001102048650001702059650001602076650001702092650001302109650002302122653002902145653002602174653001602200653002302216700001802239700001302257700001902270700001402289700001402303700001702317773011902334856008802453852000902541655001202550IND60745107620221118174409.0211003e20211201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074510762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1491542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Meihui10aSuppressing the formation of chlorinated aromatics by inhibitor sodium thiocyanate in solid waste incineration process  aSuppressing the formation of chlorinated aromatics (Cl-aromatics) by chemical inhibitors is an important measure to reduce dioxin emission from the solid waste incineration plants. In this study, we first investigated the reduction effect of a novel inhibitor sodium thiocyanate (NaSCN) on the emission of dioxins in 2 full-scale solid waste incineration systems. Injection of NaSCN solution into the higher temperature flue gas resulted in about 60% reduction in the concentration of total tetra- to octa-chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans in stack flue gas. The suppression effect was further verified by a laboratory study on the chlorination of naphthalene over model fly ashes with or without NaSCN addition. By characterizing the reaction products between NaSCN and key catalysts Cu and Fe chlorides, two main suppression mechanisms were proposed: (i) reduction of highly active cupric chloride (CuCl₂) and ferric chloride (FeCl₃) to less active cuprous chloride (CuCl) and ferrous chloride (FeCl₂), (ii) sulfidation of Cu chlorides. The laboratory study indicated that the unreacted NaSCN in the combustion flue gas could be mainly decomposed into Na₂S, C₃N₄, Na₂S₂O₃, NaS₂, Na₂SO₄, CO₂, SO₂, NO₂ and COS. These decomposition products are low toxic or can be effectively removed by the air pollution control devices.NaSCN suppressed the formation of chlorinated aromatics in combustion flue gas mainly through inducing the reduction of highly active Cu (II) and Fe (III) chlorides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution control 3acarbon dioxide 3achlorination 3acombustion 3adibenzofuran 3adioxins 3aenvironment 3aferric chloride 3aferrous chloride 3aflue gas 3anaphthalene 3asodium 3asolid wastes 3atemperature 3athiocyanates 3atoxicity 3awaste incineration 0aSolid waste incineration 0aChlorinated aromatics 0aSuppression 0aEmission reduction1 aZhang, Haijun1 aFan, Yun1 aZhou, Hongquan1 aCao, Rong1 aGao, Yuan1 aChen, Jiping0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Dec. 01, v. 798 p.149154-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1491543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03560naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011700169520212500286592002802411650001502439650001602454650001902470650001402489650002102503650002002524650002502544650001302569650002402582650001602606650001402622650001802636650001902654650002102673650002502694650001302719653003102732653003302763653003102796653003402827700001402861700001602875700001302891773011302904856005203017852000903069655001203078IND60793216220221120190129.0220914e20221110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079321622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1340022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Shuting10aFloating treatment wetland integrated with sediment microbial fuel cell for low-strength surface water treatment  aThe combination of floating treatment wetland (FTW) and sediment microbial fuel cell (SMFC) has drawn increasing interest as an economical, effective, and environmentally sustainable method for energy recovery, remediation of contaminated sediments, and wastewater treatment. In this study, a novel FTW-SMFC system with vertical floating biocathodes was developed to evaluate the performance and mechanism of plants, substrates, and bio-electrochemical systems for treating low-strength surface water. Experiments were operated in batch mode and conducted in microcosms with the following six treatments: control system only containing water and sediment (CS), normal SMFC (SMFC), only plant system (PS), SMFC with plants (PSMFC), SMFC with substrates (S-SMFC), and SMFC with plants and substrates (S-PSMFC). The results show that introducing plants into SMFCs could increase the power density by 32.9–42.5%, proving that plants played an important role in enhancing bioelectricity production. The alkaline substrates reduced the cathode potential and made the cathode inefficient. The presence of plants and substrates greatly improved the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus. The removal efficiency of total nitrogen and total phosphorus increased by 8.3–27.8% and 3.5–13.9% under electrochemical treatment. There existed competition between electrochemical and plant removal approaches for nitrogen in FTW-SMFC, and electrochemical removal was prior to plant removal. Phosphorus removal was mainly through plant uptake and substrate-mediated adsorption and precipitation. The electrochemical process promoted the removal of phosphorus by enhancing the conversion of non-reactive phosphorus (NRP) to reactive phosphorus, providing 5.0–6.9% additional NRP conversion. This study furthers our understanding of the contribution and interaction of each component in the FTW-SMFC system to pollutant removal and bioenergy generation, which will contribute to the performance enhancement of FTW and further facilitate the application of FTW-SMFC technology for in-situ remediations of the polluted surface water body.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abiocathodes 3abioelectricity 3abioenergy 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy recovery 3amicrobial fuel cells 3anitrogen 3areactive phosphorus 3aremediation 3asediments 3asurface water 3atotal nitrogen 3atotal phosphorus 3awastewater treatment 3awetlands 0aBio-electrochemical system 0aSediment microbial fuel cell 0aFloating treatment wetland 0aVertical floating biocathodes1 aLi, Xiang1 aDai, Zheqin1 aLu, Xiwu0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Nov. 10, v. 374 p.134002-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.134002  aDNAL 7aarticle02359naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245008900169520111300258592002801371650001201399650002101411650001601432650001101448650001101459650001201470650002401482650001301506650001101519650002501530651001101555653004601566653002501612653001301637653001401650653001601664653000801680653000801688653000801696700002201704773009401726856008401820852000901904655001201913IND60684651620221119133846.0201125e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068465162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2020.1113552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuosmanen, Timo10aCapital bias in the Nordic revenue cap regulation: Averch-Johnson critique revisited  aNordic energy market reform and the regulation of local monopolies in electricity transmission and distribution sectors have served as role models for many other countries worldwide. The first contribution of this paper is to clarify the conceptual distinction between the Nordic revenue cap approach and the British revenue cap regulation. Our second contribution is to show that the Nordic revenue cap is similar to the U.S.-style rate of return regulation in that both are subject to capital bias, known as the Averch-Johnson effect. The third contribution of this paper is to examine the magnitude of the capital bias and its welfare effects by means of numerical simulations. We show that the Nordic revenue cap generally decreases the monopoly profit, increases the output, decreases the price, and hence increases consumer surplus compared to the unregulated monopoly. The simulation results prove robust to changes in the parameter values and the functional form of the production function. Our numerical simulations reveal that relatively light handed regulation suffices to yield the main benefits.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapital 3aconsumer surplus 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aincome 3amarkets 3amathematical models 3amonopoly 3aprices 3aproduction functions 3aNorway 0aElectricity transmission and distribution 0aIncentive regulation 0aMonopoly 0aPrice-cap 0aRevenue-cap 0aD24 0aD42 0aL431 aNguyễn, Tuấn,0 tEnergy policy.g2020 Apr., v. 139 p.111355-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2020.1113553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02519naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245011700167300001800284520143000302592002801732650001501760650001801775650001401793650001601807650001101823650001101834650002401845650000901869650002701878650002101905700001901926700001801945773009901963856008602062852000902148655001202157IND60577292920221122170647.0170807e20150825xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057729292DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b021112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Hua-Neng10aBlocking and Blending: Different Assembly Models of Cyclodextrin and Sodium Caseinate at the Oil/Water Interface  ap. 9061-9069.  aThe stability of cyclodextrin (CD)-based emulsions is attributed to the formation of a solid film of oil–CD complexes at the oil/water interface. However, competitive interactions between CDs and other components at the interface still need to be understood. Here we develop two different routes that allow the incorporation of a model protein (sodium caseinate, SC) into emulsions based on β-CD. One route is the components adsorbed simultaneously from a mixed solution to the oil/water interface (route I), and the other is SC was added to a previously established CD-stabilized interface (route II). The adsorption mechanism of β-CD modified by SC at the oil/water interface is investigated by rheological and optical methods. Strong sensitivity of the rheological behavior to the routes is indicated by both steady-state and small-deformation oscillatory experiments. Possible β-CD/SC interaction models at the interface are proposed. In route I, the protein, due to its higher affinity for the interface, adsorbs strongly at the interface with blocking of the adsorption of β-CD and formation of oil–CD complexes. In route II, the protein penetrates and blends into the preadsorbed layer of oil–CD complexes already formed at the interface. The revelation of interfacial assembly is expected to help better understand CD-based emulsions in natural systems and improve their designs in engineering applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acyclodextrins 3aemulsions 3aengineering 3amixing 3amodels 3aoil-water interface 3aoils 3arheological properties 3asodium caseinate1 aLiu, Huan-Huan1 aZhang, Lianfu0 tLangmuir.g2015 Aug. 25, v. 31, no. 33 p.9061-9069dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.5b021113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02987naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245011700164506002800281520163000309592002801939506003701967650001802004650003802022650001802060650002002078650002102098650001202119650001002131650001002141650001702151650001402168650000902182650002202191651001402213653001102227653003602238653001602274653002602290700001702316700001502333773009202348856008002440852000902520655001202529IND60764591720221207134211.0211121e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076459172DNAL7 a10.13057/biodiv/d2007212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEFFENDI, YUNUS10aMetagenomic analysis of Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. cubense-infected soil in banana plantation, Sukabumi, Indonesia  aResource is Open Access  aEffendi Y, Pambudi A, Pancoro A. 2019. Metagenomic analysis of Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. cubense-infected soil in banana plantation, Sukabumi, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 20: 1939-1945. Fusarium wilt is one of the most devastating diseases in banana plantation which caused by soil-borne fungal pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. cubense. In this study, metagenomic analysis of 16SrRNA gene was performed for comparing composition, richness, and abundance of healthy soils and Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. cubense (Foc)-infected soil microbes in rhizospheral area of banana plants. Data showed about 10969 OTU and 10755 OTU of bacteria were identified in healthy soils and Foc-infected soils respectively. The Foc-infected soils showed higher species abundance than healthy soil (ACE index 73,6 and 68,8 respectively). However, healthy soils have more taxa richness than infected-soil (Fisher index 447,7 and 343,4 respectively). Beta diversity analysis indicated infected-soils had lower bacterial diversity in comparison with healthy soils. About 37 phyla were identified and no statistical difference between both soil conditions in the OTUs abundance. However, Acidobacteria (22%) and Verrucomicrobia (13%) tend more abundance in the health soils in comparison in the infected soils 19% and 10% respectively, whereas Proteobacteria was found more abundance in the infected soil (11%) in comparison with the health soil (7%). Interestingly, high abundance of Xanthomonadaceae, member of Proteobacteria was identified in the infected soils which might have a positive correlation with incidence of Fusarium development in the soils.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAcidobacteria 3aFusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense 3aFusarium wilt 3aVerrucomicrobia 3aXanthomonadaceae 3abananas 3afungi 3agenes 3ametagenomics 3apathogens 3asoil 3aspecies abundance 3aIndonesia 0abanana 0afusarium oxysporum f.sp cubense 0ametagenomic 0arhizospheral microbes1 aPambudi, A.,1 aPANCORO, A0 tBiodiversitas.g2019 June, v. 20, no. 7dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.13057/biodiv/d2007213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01631naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100000700142245010100149300001400250520056800264592002800832650001300860650001100873650001000884650001300894650001500907653002000922653002100942653002300963653002200986700000701008773019101015856007801206852000901284655001201293IND60515587020221117234003.0160322e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051558702DNAL7 a10.15553/c2016v711a42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 a, 10aLectotypification of Three Species of Silene sect.

Despite research advancement in the recent decades, results inconsistencies have been reported related to chaotic, stochastic and black box approaches for multi-step ahead prediction of ET₀. This study aimed at applying ensemble approaches to improve single and multi-step ahead predictions of ET₀. To do so, several Artificial Intelligence (AI) based techniques including Support Vector Regression (SVR), Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) models, were employed for one, two and three-steps ahead predictions of ET₀ for numerous climatic stations in Iraq, North Cyprus and Turkey. Monthly meteorological parameters were used as inputs for the models development. Finally, two linear ensemble methods (simple averaging and weighted averaging) and a nonlinear ensemble method (neural ensemble) were applied for the single models performance and reliability improvements. The results showed superior performance of AI based models with regard to the MLR model. In addition, promising improvements were achieved in single and multi-step ahead ET₀ modeling by the application of the ensemble models. The overall results revealed that the ensemble models proposed in this study could lead to increase in single models performance in the validation phase up to 60%, 33% and 24% for Turkey, North Cyprus and Iraq stations, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aevapotranspiration 3afuzzy logic 3airrigation 3ameteorological parameters 3aneural networks 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3awater management 3aCyprus 3aIraq 3aTurkey (country) 0aReference evapotranspiration 0aEnsemble models 0aArtificial intelligence 0aArtificial neural network 0aPan evaporation1 aElkiran, Gozen1 aAbdullahi, Jazuli1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2971-44750 tJournal of hydrology.g2020 Feb., v. 581 p.124434-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.1244343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03097naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002600145245012600171506002800297520169300325592002802018506003702046650001102083650001202094650001902106650002302125650001802148650001502166650001202181650002902193650001502222650000902237650001102246650000902257650001102266650002102277650001102298650001502309651001402324653001402338653001702352653001602369653001402385700002302399773009202422856008002514852000902594655001202603IND60764591820221207134207.0211121e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076459182DNAL7 a10.13057/biodiv/d2009232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaharjo, Bambang Hero10aShort Communication: Land cover changes from 2005 to 2015 in Mantangai area of Dayak Ngaju, Central Kalimantan, Indonesia  aResource is Open Access  aSaharjo BH, Hadiwijoyo E. 2019. Short Communication: Land cover changes from 2005 to 2015 in Mantangai area of Dayak Ngaju, Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 20: 2596-2602. Forest and land fires in Indonesia are well recognized, directly or indirectly, as the main contributors to deforestation and greenhouse gas emission related to the global climate change. Usually, local peoples are blamed for those fires especially when negative impact occurred. Fortunately, not all of the local peoples do the same thing as it is shown by Dayak Ngaju in Block A of ex-Mega Rice Project (Ex-MRP) Project area located in Mantangai sub-district Kapuas district, Central Kalimantan Province, Indonesia, where this research was conducted. The objective of this study was to know land the cover changes related to the use of fire for land preparation, and how the Dayak Ngaju people implement their knowledge and experience in the field. This objective was achieved by analyzing satellite images of Landsat 7 and 8 for a period of time starting from 2005 to 2015. Results of the research showed that the local people started clearing the land with fire at the end of September (dry season) or early October (the rainy season) yearly, as it could be seen from the changes of the land cover from secondary swamp forest into swamp shrub and from secondary swamp forest into fields. Meanwhile, at the protected area where peat was dominant, land cover change occurred due to land rights conflicts, and not to the use of fire for land preparation using fire by Dayak Ngaju communities, because they found that the results were not good and the planted rice would die three months after planting..  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBorneo 3aLandsat 3aclimate change 3aconservation areas 3adeforestation 3adry season 3aforests 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aland cover 3apeat 3apeople 3arice 3ashrubs 3asite preparation 3aswamps 3awet season 3aIndonesia 0acommunity 0acover change 0adayak ngaju 0afire peat1 aHadiwijoyo, Erekso0 tBiodiversitas.g2019 Aug., v. 20, no. 9dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.13057/biodiv/d2009233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02819naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245019000163300002000353520123300373592002801606650002201634650002501656650001501681650001001696650001001706650001301716650002001729650001401749650001901763650001701782650001201799650001101811650001601822650001901838650001501857650001501872650001901887650002501906650004401931650001201975651001201987700001701999700001802016700002002034773016902054856008102223852000902304655001202313IND60596659320221119164728.0180619e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059665932DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-018-1640-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmri, Nahed10aNephrotoxicity in Hybrid sparrow (Passer domesticus × Passer hispaniolensis) living near a phosphate treatment factory complex in southern Tunisia: a biochemical and histological study  ap. 15404-15410.  aOur study was designed to evaluate impacts of exposure to pollutants, released by the Gabès–Ghannouche factory complex of phosphate treatment, on biochemical biomarkers and histopathological indices in kidney tissues of Hybrid sparrow (Passer domesticus × Passer hispaniolensis) in Gabès city. Our results show evidence of a pronounced impairment in kidney function which is confirmed by remarkable blood chemical alterations in sparrows living in Ghannouche, the most polluted site. Moreover, superoxide dismutase and catalase activities were found to be decreased in birds sampled from the contaminated site when compared to less polluted areas. The population of sparrows feeding in Ghannouche had enhanced renal thiobarbituric acid reactive substance levels, indicating oxidative damage to membrane lipids. Some histopathological alterations were also observed including kidney interstitial dilatations. Overall, our findings demonstrated that the exposure to pollutants released by the factory complex possessed nephrotoxic by depleting renal antioxidant defense system and promoting kidney morphometric damage in sparrows. These results constitute an early warning of an ecological change in relation to human health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPasser domesticus 3aantioxidant activity 3abiomarkers 3abirds 3ablood 3acatalase 3aenzyme activity 3ahistology 3ahistopathology 3ahuman health 3akidneys 3alipids 3amorphometry 3anephrotoxicity 3aphosphates 3apollutants 3arenal function 3asuperoxide dismutase 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 3atissues 3aTunisia1 aRebai, Tarek1 aJardak, Neila1 aBadraoui, Riadh0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2018 June, v. 25, no. 16 p.15404-15410dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-1640-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02881naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245011100171300001600282520156600298592002801864650001101892650002001903650001401923650001101937650002001948650001101968650002301979650001102002650001102013650001102024650002502035650001502060650001902075650001102094651001302105653002002118653003002138653002202168700001702190700001602207773010502223856008602328852000902414655001202423IND60539820720221121134923.0190318e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053982072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2015.10.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos, Mónica10aHistorical damaging flood records for 1871–2011 in Northern Portugal and underlying atmospheric forcings  ap. 591-603.  aA long time series of damaging flood records in Northern Portugal for 1871–2011, gathered from a large number of documentary sources, is analyzed. The relationships between damaging floods (DFs) and relevant circulation weather types (CWTs) are also assessed. The DFs database has 1861 records and CWTs are identified using the 20th century reanalysis dataset v2. A coefficient of effectiveness (CE) is calculated for each weather type in order to assess DF–CWT relationships. Furthermore, conditions in the 10days preceding a DF outbreak, type of flood and season were taken into account in CE calculations. The DF occurrences were responsible for 186 killed people, 59 injured, 29 missing, 1873 displaced and 15,924 homeless people. The monthly frequencies each CWT show that anticyclonic (A) and easterly wind (E) types are prevalent in winter, whereas R tends to prevail in the summer half of the year. However, the results show that the cyclonic (C) type has a positive frequency with DF occurrence (i.e. anomalously frequent), both on the DF day and on the nine previous days. The C type is commonly associated with southwesterly flow and unsettled weather conditions over Portugal, which are favorable to rain-generating mechanisms. The results also highlight some seasonal variation: in autumn, winter and spring, the C type is largely related to DFs, while the A and E types acquire higher preponderance in the summer. In effect, the latter two CWTs may trigger thunderstorms and heavy precipitation episodes in the Douro River catchment in summer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautumn 3adata collection 3adatabases 3afloods 3ahomeless people 3arivers 3aseasonal variation 3aspring 3astorms 3asummer 3atime series analysis 3awatersheds 3awind direction 3awinter 3aPortugal 0aDamaging floods 0aCirculation weather types 0aNorthern Portugal1 aSantos, J.A.1 aFragoso, M.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2015 Nov., v. 530 p.591-603dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2015.10.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03189naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245012000164506002800284520175900312592002802071506003702099650001502136650001502151650001502166650001802181650001802199650001602217650002802233650001102261650001202272650001202284650001602296650001802312650000902330650002202339650001102361651001402372653001402386653001602400653001502416653002102431700001402452700001502466700002102481773009202502856008002594852000902674655001202683IND60764592020221215142544.0211122e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076459202DNAL7 a10.13057/biodiv/d2103232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIKHSAN, ZAHLUL14aThe diversity and abundance of Hymenoptera insects on tidal swamp rice field in Indragiri Hilir District, Indonesia  aResource is Open Access  aIkhsan Z, Hidrayani, Yaherwandi, Hamid H. 2020. The diversity and abundance of Hymenoptera insects on tidal swamp rice field in Indragiri Hilir District, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 21: 1020-1026. Hymenoptera is one of the four largest insect orders and it plays a vital role in human life as pollinators, parasitoids, and predators. Hymenoptera parasitoids are particularly important as agents of biological control of pest. The objective of this research was to study the diversity and abundance of Hymenoptera on tidal swamp rice field in Indragiri Hilir District, Riau Province, Indonesia. Samplings were conducted in 3 sub-districts of rice production centers, namely Batang Tuaka, Keritang and Reteh, using four trapping techniques (i.e. insect net, malaise trap, pitfall trap, and yellow pan trap). Shannon diversity index (H '), Krebs evenness index (E), and Jaccard similarity index (Is) were calculated. We found 4,701 individuals consisting of 39 families and 319 species of Hymenoptera at the three studied areas. Tidal swamp rice in Indragiri Hilir District had a high species diversity of Hymenoptera parasitoids and Hymenoptera predators, but a moderate species diversity of Hymenoptera pollinators. Species diversity and evenness of Hymenoptera parasitoids and predators were higher in Keritang than in Batang Tuaka and Reteh. The families of Formicidae, Braconidae, Ichneumonidae, and Scelionidae had the highest number of species, while Formicidae, Scelionidae, Diapriidae, and Braconidae had the highest number of individuals. Based on these findings, the abundance and diversity of Hymenoptera insects in Indragiri Hilir District have the potentials to be developed as biological agents to control pests on tidal swamp rice in this area.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBraconidae 3aDiapriidae 3aFormicidae 3aIchneumonidae 3aMalaise traps 3aScelionidae 3abiological pest control 3ahumans 3ainsects 3apaddies 3aparasitoids 3apitfall traps 3arice 3aspecies diversity 3aswamps 3aIndonesia 0adiversity 0ahymenoptera 0aparasitoid 0atidal swamp rice1 aHIDRAYANI1 aYAHERWANDI1 aHAMID, HASMIANDY0 tBiodiversitas.g2020 Feb., v. 21, no. 3dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.13057/biodiv/d2103233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02765naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006100150245012100211520124300332592002801575650005201603650001401655650001601669650002401685650001501709650001301724650001701737653002201754653001401776653003801790653001801828653001701846653001301863653001101876653001301887700006001900700006201960700006102022710004902083773010502132856008502237852000902322655001202331IND60719382920221121023310.0210624e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071938292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2020.1062782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiutsko, Liudmila1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2569-076014aThe SHAMISEN Recommendations on preparedness and health surveillance of populations affected by a radiation accident  aThis paper, the last in the Special Issue (SI) on the SHAMISEN project, presents an overview of the SHAMISEN Recommendations for Preparedness and Health Surveillance of Populations Affected by a Radiation Accident. The recommendations are based on the lessons learnt from previous nuclear accidents, and the engagement activities with different stakeholder groups, described in the other papers of this SI. The SHAMISEN project developed a total of 28 recommendations. They include general recommendations, applicable across all phases of an accident, and specific recommendations for each of the three main phases: preparedness, early and intermediate, and long-term recovery. The recommendations are subdivided by topic: health surveillance, epidemiological studies, dose reconstruction, evacuation, and training of and communication with health personnel and other actors involved in liaising with affected populations. Each recommendation is divided into 3 sections - why, how and who - thus providing background and concrete advice as to how each SHAMISEN recommendation should be implemented and by whom. It is notable that many recommendations are also applicable to other disaster types, including the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aaccidents 3aenvironment 3ahealth care workers 3amonitoring 3apandemic 3astakeholders 0aNuclear accidents 0aDisasters 0aHealth surveillance, preparedness 0aCommunication 0aStakeholders 0aCOVID-19 0aOPERRA 0aSHAMISEN1 aOughton, Deborah1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5481-200X1 aSarukhan, Adelaida1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3747-63041 aCardis, Elisabeth1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0999-68392 aon behalf of the SHAMISEN Consortiumeauthor0 tEnvironment international.g2021 Jan., v. 146 p.106278-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.1062783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02201naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245004800168520110600216592002801322650001601350650002201366650001301388650001501401650001401416650001801430650001201448650001201460651001001472653002201482653001501504653001501519653001301534653003001547653001701577700002201594773009401616856008401710852000901794655001201803IND60684652020221119134539.0201125e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068465202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2020.1113592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFaure, Corinne10aPoor energy ratings when appliances convey?  aConveyance, i.e., leaving one's appliance in the dwelling when moving out, shortens the expected length of ownership of an appliance and may therefore lead to the purchase of less energy-efficient appliances. Employing a demographically representative survey in Spain, this paper uses statistical-econometric analyses to explore the effects of conveyance on stated adoption of energy-efficient appliances (refrigerators or fridge-freezer combinations, freezers, dishwashers, and washing machines). The findings suggest that the take-up of energy-efficient appliances is on average about 8%-points lower when appliances convey. In addition, conveyance appears to have comparable effects for renters and homeowners. These findings therefore suggest that conveyance contributes to explaining the energy efficiency paradox. Finally, the results appear robust to a series of robustness checks involving alternative assumptions about the distribution and data generating process, the specifications of the dependent variable, and the handling of missing values. They also provide insights for policy-making.  aPublisher supplied data 3adishwashers 3aenergy efficiency 3afreezers 3ahomeowners 3aownership 3arefrigerators 3asurveys 3awashing 3aSpain 0aEnergy efficiency 0aConveyance 0aAppliances 0aAdoption 0aEnergy efficiency paradox 0aEconometrics1 aSchleich, Joachim0 tEnergy policy.g2020 Apr., v. 139 p.111359-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2020.1113593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02169naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245006300162300001600225500001500241520089400256592002801150650001701178650001801195650001601213650001401229650003001243650001101273650001401284650002001298650002001318650001001338651001201348653001201360653001201372653001001384653001201394700001501406700001501421700001801436700001701454700001601471773012401487856007901611852000901690655001201699IND60478526420221119031559.0160112e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047852642DNAL7 a10.1556/038.50.2015.2.42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelahmar, M.10aPlant Parasitic Nematodes Associated with Olive in Algeria  ap. 187-193.  a2019-12-06  aSurveys were conducted during 2010–2013 in olive growing areas of south and north of Algeria to identify plant parasitic nematodes associated with this crop. Sixteen genera of plant-parasitic nematodes were identified. Among them four are considered as having economic importance for olive. Among these the endoparasites Pratylenchus spp. were detected in the majority of the sampled areas and were the most frequent. Meloidogyne spp. were also present in some areas. Helicotylenchus spp. were present with a high frequency in almost all surveyed sites. Among the ectoparasites, only Xiphinema spp. have potential to damage olive. Other nematodes of less importance were poorly represented. Nematode densities varied according to taxa identified and areas surveyed. Excepted Pratylenchus spp. and Helicotylenchus spp., the others taxa are reported for the first time on olive in Algeria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPratylenchus 3aectoparasites 3aMeloidogyne 3aeconomics 3aplant parasitic nematodes 3aolives 3aXiphinema 3adisease surveys 3aHelicotylenchus 3acrops 3aAlgeria 0anursery 0asurveys 0aolive 0aorchard1 aElkfel, F.1 aMihoub, M.1 aAbdewahab, S.1 aMateille, M.1 aSellami, S.0 tActa phytopathologica et entomologica Hungarica.g2015 Dec., v. 50, no. 2 p.187-193dAkadémiai Kiadóx1588-26917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556/038.50.2015.2.43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02725naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005700151245016500208520149500373592002801868650001901896650001901915650002101934650001401955650000901969650001101978650002501989650001502014650001202029651001602041653004902057653002902106653002802135773010502163856008602268852000902354655001202363IND60678210520221119140654.0200318e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067821052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.1244432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhn, Kuk-Hyun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8142-081310aCoupled annual and daily multivariate and multisite stochastic weather generator to preserve low- and high-frequency variability to assess climate vulnerability  aMultivariate and multisite stochastic weather generators have been proposed to produce an ensemble of climate time series but are often limited to preserving low-frequency variability of climate variables as well as producing extreme rainfall events. This study presents a new, two-stage, multivariate, multisite weather generator by coupling annual and daily weather generators. A daily weather generator is first developed using heavy tailed distribution, spatial tail dependence, and multivariate autoregressive models. For the second stage, annual climate variables over the region are modeled using a wavelet decomposition approach coupled with a multivariate autoregressive model. The generated annual time series are used to reconstruct daily simulations to embed multiple low-frequency oscillations in a daily time series. The proposed weather generator is applied to the Geum River Basin in South Korea, and its performance is compared to that of a nested simplified model. Results show that the proposed model performs well with respect to reproducing marginal distributional attributes, multisite dependencies, and climate variability at the daily and annual scales. Lastly, the weather generator adopts a quantile mapping procedure to incorporate long-term distributional changes into generated climate sequences for use in climate change assessments. Results show that inter-annual variability is also well preserved while climate sequences are adjusted by various alterations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3aclimatic factors 3ahydrology 3arain 3arivers 3atime series analysis 3awatersheds 3awavelet 3aSouth Korea 0aMultivariate and multisite weather generator 0aInter-annual variability 0aExtreme rainfall events0 tJournal of hydrology.g2020 Feb., v. 581 p.124443-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.1244433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03305naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245011000165300001600275506002800291520155200319592002801871506003701899650001801936650001301954650001601967650002401983650001102007650003202018650002002050650002202070650001002092650001902102650001402121650001702135650001402152650001102166650001902177650001402196650001502210650002202225650002602247650001802273653002302291653001002314653001102324653002702335700002502362700002402387700003402411700002202445700002302467700002202490773010202512856008002614852000902694655001202703IND60764592420221207133612.0211116e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076459242DNAL7 a10.13057/biodiv/d1901482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSUSILOWATI, ARI10aLipolytic bacteria isolated from Indonesian sticky rice cake wajik and jenang experiencing with rancidity  ap. 351-356.  aResource is Open Access  aSusilowati A, Sari SLA, Setyaningsih R, Muthmainna HN, Handarwati H, Pangastuti A, Purwoko T. 2018. Lipolytic bacteria isolated from Indonesian sticky rice cake wajik and jenang experiencing with rancidity. Biodiversitas 19: 351-356. Lipolytic bacteria are lipase producing bacteria. These bacteria can be isolated from various sources such as vegetable oil wastes, industrial dairy products, oil-contaminated soil, seeds, and foods containing fat. The lipolytic bacteria were isolated from wajik, jenang manten and jenang alot that have been cultured for 4-35 days using minimum media containing MgSO4.7H2O 0.03%, K2HPO4 0.005%, (NH4) SO40.5% (w/v) supplemented with olive oil as a carbon source. Lipolytic activity was marked by orange luminescence when it was exposed to UV light at 350 nm on colonies grown on media containing olive oil-rhodamine B. Lipolytic bacteria were identified based on colony morphology, cell morphology and sequences of 16S rRNA gene. The 16S rRNA gene sequences were analyzed to determine the identity of bacterial isolates based on the percentage of sequence identity using BLAST Nucleotide software on NCBI website. Results showed there were 7 lipolytic bacteria of 52 isolates. Those bacteria were Gram-negative with spherical and rods shape. The identity of four isolates obtained in wajik indicated 97-98% of similarity to Acinetobacter and one isolate showed 96% of similarity to Pseudomonas. The last two isolates obtained from jenang manten had 99% similarity belonging to the species of Serratia marcescens.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAcinetobacter 3aInternet 3aPseudomonas 3aSerratia marcescens 3acarbon 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3acell structures 3acomputer software 3agenes 3aglutinous rice 3alipolysis 3aluminescence 3aolive oil 3aolives 3apolluted soils 3arancidity 3arice cakes 3asequence analysis 3aultraviolet radiation 3avegetable oil 0alipolytic bacteria 0awajik 0ajenang 0a16s rrna gene sequence1 aSARI, SITI LUSI ARUM1 aSETYANINGSIH, RATNA1 aMUTHMAINNA, HANIâ€™A NUR1 aHANDARWATI, HAYYU1 aPANGASTUTI, ARTINI1 aPURWOKO, TJAHJADI0 tBiodiversitas.g2018 Jan., v. 19, no. 1 p.351-356dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.13057/biodiv/d1901483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02664naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245012200168520143000290592002801720650001101748650001601759650001501775650001601790650002101806650002401827650001701851650001301868650002401881650001401905650001301919650001001932650002301942653001601965653000901981653002301990700001302013700001602026773010502042856008602147852000902233655001202242IND60678210620221119140852.0200318e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067821062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.1244442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Yiqian10aCombined effect of cutoff wall and tides on groundwater flow and salinity distribution in coastal unconfined aquifers  aCutoff walls are widely used to alter groundwater flow and mitigate seawater intrusion in coastal areas. While their behavior and performance in aquifers under static oceanic conditions are well established, how do they combine with tides to affect groundwater flow and salinity distribution in coastal aquifers remains unclear. Here we addressed this research question based on physical experiments and numerical simulations. Cutoff walls were showed to regulate the inland freshwater flow and thus form a sharp waterlevel change in the landside of the cutoff wall. As such, inland groundwater flow was concentrated in the lower aquifer that inhibited seawater intrusion in the unconfined aquifer subjected to a static sea level (under the non-tidal condition). This modification was enhanced as the cutoff wall went deeper or seaward. However, the tide pushed the saltwater wedge seaward in comparison with the case under the non-tidal condition. Under this tidal condition, the modification of the cutoff wall on saltwater intrusion was no longer evident. In both cases under non-tidal and tidal conditions, the cutoff wall was found to alter the path and travel time of the inland fresh groundwater and seawater, and total freshwater storage in the aquifer. These results offer significant implications for designing engineering measures to mitigate seawater intrusion and managing groundwater resources in coastal zones.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3aengineering 3afreshwater 3agroundwater 3agroundwater flow 3amathematical models 3asaline water 3asalinity 3asaltwater intrusion 3asea level 3aseawater 3atides 3aunconfined aquifer 0aCutoff wall 0aTide 0aSeawater intrusion1 aXin, Pei1 aYu, Xiayang0 tJournal of hydrology.g2020 Feb., v. 581 p.124444-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.1244443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02854naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245018700169520147100356592002801827650001101855650001401866650002301880650002001903651001001923653001901933653002701952653000701979653003001986653000802016700001302024700001502037700005902052700001802111700001602129700001602145700001702161700001802178700001602196773011302212856008602325852000902411655001202420IND60793217120221120190151.0220921e20221115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079321712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1340132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Zhigong10aCoefficient correction of Ångström–Prescott equation for China and its influence on solar radiation and reference crop evapotranspiration at different temporal and spatial scales  aIn recognition of the lack of solar radiation (Rₛ) monitoring data at some meteorological stations, FAO56 recommends the Ångström–Prescott (A–P) equation for estimating Rₛ and gives recommended coefficient values (recommended values), which are widely used in the estimation of the reference crop evapotranspiration (ETₒ). Compared with the corrected coefficient values (corrected values), the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of the average relative errors (MRE) of Rₛ and ETₒ in China caused by the recommended values are studied. The MRE of the estimated annual Rₛ and ETₒ all tend to increase from the northwest inland to the southeast coast. However, the monthly Rₛ and the monthly ETₒ have an MRE that presents a double-valley curve and a unimodal curve, respectively, of the year, leading to inconsistency between the inter-monthly spatial distribution of the MRE of the monthly Rₛ and the monthly ETₒ. The recommended values have considerable influence on the daily Rₛ in the year and the daily ETₒ during the critical crop growth period (April–September). Therefore, the suitability of the recommended values should be scrutinized by taking into account the influence on Rₛ and ETₒ at different temporal and spatial scales. For the lack of Rₛ monitoring data in China, this paper can support whether the recommended values can be used in estimating Rₛ and ETₒ by using A-P equation and its error.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3aequations 3aevapotranspiration 3asolar radiation 3aChina 0aA–P equation 0aCoefficient correction 0aRs 0aPenman–Monteith formula 0aETo1 aChen, He1 aWei, Zheng1 aZhang, Baozhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9408-648X1 aZhang, Suyang1 aGong, Liqin1 aYang, Guiyu1 aCai, Jiabing1 aLi, Wangcheng1 aZhang, Qian0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Nov. 15, v. 375 p.134013-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1340133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02614naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245011600166300001600282520106300298592002801361650002101389650003501410650002001445650002501465650001901490650003101509650001801540650001101558650001701569650001801586650002101604650002001625650002801645650003201673653003601705653002801741653001701769700001501786700001401801700001301815700001801828700001801846700001501864700001801879773011601897856008602013852000902099655001202108IND60529425320221119193353.0161019e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052942532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2016.05.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYue, Long10aBletilla striata polysaccharide inhibits angiotensin II-induced ROS and inflammation via NOX4 and TLR2 pathways  ap. 376-388.  aIn the current study, we analyzed the functions and mechanisms of Bletilla striata polysaccharide b (BSPb) against Angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced oxidative stress and inflammation in human mesangial cells (HMCs). It was found that BSPb could inhibit generation of Ang II-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activation of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) in a dose-dependent manner. Further studies revealed that BSPb effectively blocked upregulation of NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4). Moreover, knockdown of NOX4 significantly impaired the anti-oxidative function of BSPb. In addition, BSPb decreased overexpression of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) induced by Ang II. Blocking TLR2 expression impaired the anti-inflammatory effects of BSPb. In conclusion, BSPb was found to possess anti-oxidative stress and anti-inflammatory functions against Ang II-induced ROS generation and proinflammatory cytokines activation. The NOX4 and TLR2 pathways played important roles in the biological effects mediated by BSPb.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBletilla striata 3aNAD(P)H oxidase (H2O2-forming) 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aToll-like receptor 2 3aangiotensin II 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3adose response 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3aoxidative stress 3apolysaccharides 3areactive oxygen species 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aBletilla striata polysaccharide 0aReactive oxygen species 0aInflammation1 aWang, Wang1 aWang, Yan1 aDu, Ting1 aShen, Weiping1 aTang, Huiling1 aWang, Ying1 aYin, Hongping0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2016 Aug., v. 89 p.376-388dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2016.05.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03161naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245012500173520208500298592002802383650002402411650002102435650001502456651001102471653003802482653001802520653002602538700002002564700001802584700001702602773011902619856008802738852000902826655001202835IND60745108420221118171155.0210926e20211125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074510842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1491632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHwang, Yaw-Huei10aCharacterization of Ti-containing nanoparticles in the aquatic environment of the Tamsuei River Basin in northern Taiwan  aTitanium dioxide (TiO₂) is commonly contained in many commercial products and there are concerns about its release into the aquatic environment after use. This study was designed to characterize the distribution of Ti-containing nanoparticulates (NPs) in the water of the Tamsuei River Basin in northern Taiwan. Water samples were collected from the upstream, mid-stream, and downstream areas of the Tamsuei River Basin and analyzed with single-particle ICPMS to profile the Ti-containing NPs in terms of mass concentration, number concentration and particulate size. The lowest mass concentration of Ti-containing NPs, 1.04 ± 0.04 μg/L, was found in the upstream water samples, while the highest mass concentration, 31.7 ± 0.6 μg/L, was observed in downstream samples; there was an increasing trend from upstream to downstream. The highest particulate number concentration, 479 ± 163 × 10³/mL, was observed for the downstream samples, but the lowest concentration, 45.4 ± 5.6 × 10³/mL, was found in the mid-stream water samples taken from Site C. Moreover, the average mode values for particulate sizes were approximately 50 nm for all samples, although a relatively larger average mode value of 62 ± 5.7 nm was observed in the mid-stream samples from Site A. Increasing mass concentrations and particulate number concentrations from upstream to downstream implied that these NPs might have originally resulted from anthropogenic activities involving the use of TiO₂ NPs–containing products. Surprisingly, however, the lowest number concentrations for Ti-containing NPs in the mid-stream samples can probably be attributed to the fact that the corresponding sampling sites were located in the water preservation zone, which exhibits a particle-settling effect. Additionally, the sizes of Ti-containing NPs in downstream samples were not significantly larger than those in the upstream and mid-stream samples, as expected, which was probably due to the steric effects resulting from the presence of large amounts of macromolecule polymers in aquatic environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic environment 3atitanium dioxide 3awatersheds 3aTaiwan 0aTitanium containing nanoparticles 0aSurface water 0aSingle-particle ICPMS1 aChung, Chi-Huan1 aChen, Yen-Tzu1 aChen, Jou-An0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Nov. 25, v. 797 p.149163-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1491633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02735naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005400151245012700205300001600332520108200348592002801430650004401458650002301502650002501525650001901550650001001569650004101579650002301620650002501643650001501668650004401683650001501727650001201742650001801754650003301772650002401805650002401829650002101853653002201874653002801896653003301924700001301957700001501970700001501985700001602000773011802016856008602134852000902220655001202229IND60643034920221120062440.0190523e20190915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064303492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2019.04.0732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Rong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0193-694910aPreparation, characterization and thermal degradation behavior of rigid polyurethane foam using a malic acid based polyols  ap. 121-128.  aA series of multi-functionality polyester polyols (MAP) were synthesized successfully by using a renewable resource of malic acid and 1,6-hexanediol via esterification. The chemical structure of MAP was characterized by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR), gel permeation chromatography (GPC) as well as acid and hydroxyl values. Then it was used to prepare rigid polyurethane foams (RPUFs). The results suggested that MAP based RPUFs showed lower density (37˜39 kg/m3), compressive strength (154˜156 kPa) and better insulation (0.019˜0.025 W/(m·K)) than that of the commercial petrochemical polyol. Moreover, thermal degradation behavior of MAP based RPUF were demonstrated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), thermogravimetric analysis connected with Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (TG-FTIR) and pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) in detail. It indicated that as a bio-resource polyol, MAP could totally substitute petrochemical polyol to prepare RPUF with a good comprehensive performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3achemical structure 3acompression strength 3aesterification 3afoams 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agel chromatography 3ainsulating materials 3amalic acid 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolyesters 3apolyols 3apolyurethanes 3apyrolysis gas chromatography 3arenewable resources 3athermal degradation 3athermogravimetry 0aBio-based polyols 0aRigid polyurethane foam 0aThermal degradation behavior1 aWang, Bo1 aLi, Mengdi1 aZhang, Xin1 aLi, Jinchun0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2019 Sept. 15, v. 136 p.121-128dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2019.04.0733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03386naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245013300163300001600296520166600312592002801978650002302006650001402029650002302043650001302066650002302079650001802102650001402120650001802134650001902152650001802171650001102189650001502200650001502215650001002230650002302240650001402263650001302277653001602290653002102306653002702327653002302354653002802377700001502405700001502420700001402435700001802449700001602467700001502483700001902498700001902517700002002536700001502556773011802571856008602689852000902775655001202784IND60630762720221119062842.0190408e20180901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063076272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2018.04.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Ke10aNanosized nickel decorated sisal fibers with tailored aggregation structures for catalysis reduction of toxic aromatic compounds  ap. 226-236.  aIntegration of highly-active nanoscale metal-based components into unique skeleton materials to enhance their intrinsic properties is significant for the cost-efficient application of catalyst. Here, two sisal fiber templates with different structure were chemically obtained and employed as the supporters to immobilize nickel nanoparticles by electroless deposition method in nickel bath. The coating of nickel nanoparticles (NPs) inherited preferably the micromorphology of fiber with lumen and surface micro convex structure. Compared to sisal fiber bundle (SFB), elementary sisal fibers (ESFs) afford a superior deposited substrate for Ni NPs, which exhibit highest catalytic rate constant 16.14 × 10−3 s−1 and turnover frequency 1.82 × 10−3 mol mol−1 s−1 at 20 °C and molar ratio of NaBH4: p-NP (100) for reduction of p-NP with only 3.39 wt.% Ni. The outstanding performance of Ni/ESFs obtained here can be assigned to the high content of metallic nickel in nanoparticles, the flexible fiber based 3D network and the synergistic effect of Ni NPs and ESFs. Ni/ESF catalysts were also successfully applied for the catalytic hydrogenation of methyl orange (MO) and Rhodamine B (RhB). Moreover, present catalyst further exhibited excellent reusability derived from their stable physic-chemical structure and magnetically separable feature in the catalytic reaction. As a result, supported by the widely-available sisal fiber templates with tailored structures, present catalysts show the certain superiority in cost-effective hydrogenation of refractory aromatic pollutants compared to the catalysts reported in the literatures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaromatic compounds 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acoatings 3acost effectiveness 3ahydrogenation 3amagnetism 3amethyl orange 3amicrostructure 3ananoparticles 3anickel 3apollutants 3arhodamines 3asisal 3asodium borohydride 3asynergism 3atoxicity 0aSisal fiber 0aNanosized nickel 0aElectroless deposition 0aComposite catalyst 0aCatalytic hydrogenation1 aWang, Yuan1 aCheng, Pan1 aLiu, Ying1 aKong, Chuncai1 aYi, Zhibing1 aLi, Mufang1 aLiu, Qiongzhen1 aZhong, Weibing1 aTakagi, Hitoshi1 aWang, Dong0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2018 Sept. 01, v. 119 p.226-236dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2018.04.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02417naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245005700174300001600231520128100247592002801528650002001556650001101576650001901587650001901606650001101625653002001636653002001656653002501676653002701701653002801728653002401756700002301780773015701803856008601960852000902046655001202055IND60111875220221121101048.0200804e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011187522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.05.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBode, Nikolai W.F.10aHuman exit route choice in virtual crowd evacuations  ap. 347-358.  aThe collective behaviour of human crowds emerges from the local interactions of individuals. To understand human crowds we therefore need to identify the behavioural rules individual pedestrians follow. This is crucial for the control of emergency evacuations from confined spaces, for example. At a microscopic level we seek to predict the next step of pedestrians based on their local environment. However, we also have to consider ‘tactical-level’ individual behaviour that is not an immediate response to the local environment, such as the choice between different routes to exit a building. We used an interactive virtual environment to study human exit route decisions in simulated evacuations. Participants had to escape from a building and had to choose between different exit routes in the presence of evacuating simulated agents. We found no inherent preference for familiar routes, but under a stress-inducing treatment, subjects were more likely to display behaviour in their route choice that was detrimental to their evacuation time. Most strikingly, subjects were less likely to avoid a congested exit by changing their original decision to move towards it under this treatment. Age and gender had clear effects on reaction times in the virtual environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal behavior 3agender 3agroup behavior 3ahuman behavior 3ahumans 0acrowd behaviour 0adecision making 0aemergency evacuation 0aindividual-based model 0apedestrian interactions 0avirtual environment1 aCodling, Edward A.0 tAnimal behaviour.g2013 Aug., v. 86, no. 2 p.347-358dElsevier LtdaThe Association for the Study of Animal BehaviourwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.05.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02914naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245020400177300001200381520146000393592002801853650001601881650001401897650002001911650001601931650001201947650002001959650001201979650002201991650000902013650001102022650002502033650001902058650001302077650001102090651001102101651001702112651001402129700002602143700003302169700003002202773013402232856008102366852000902447655001202456IND60441781520221121053435.0151123e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044178152DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-015-4916-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpanopoulos-Zarco, Pamela10aBioaccumulation of arsenic and selenium in bycatch fishes Diapterus peruvianus, Pseudupeneus grandisquamis, and Trachinotus kennedyi from shrimp trawling in the continental shelf of Guerrero, México  ap. 700.  aWith the aim of determining arsenic (As) and selenium (Se) concentrations in bycatch fishes from SW Mexico and comparing elemental concentrations with limits for human consumption set in the national and international legislation, three fish species (Diapterus peruvianus, Pseudupeneus grandisquamis, and Trachinotus kennedyi) were collected from Guerrero state during trawling operations. Additionally, As and Se levels in muscle tissue were compared with similar species from diverse areas. The order of As and Se concentrations was T. kennedyi > P. grandisquamis > D. peruvianus. In Mexico, there is no regulation of As and Se levels in fish. In comparison to the legal limit (0.1 μg g⁻¹ wet weight) set by legislation in Venezuela, As levels in the edible portion of T. kennedyi (0.632 μg g⁻¹ wet weight), P. grandisquamis (0.166 μg g⁻¹ wet weight), and D. peruvianus (0.157 μg g⁻¹ wet weight) were above this limit. In the case of Se, average concentrations in T. kennedyi (0.323 μg g⁻¹ wet weight) were above the maximum permissible limit (0.30 μg g⁻¹ wet weight) set in the Chilean legislation. Se concentrations in Carangoides bajad from Saudi Arabia were comparable to values in T. kennedyi (this study). In relation to As, concentrations varied in magnitude orders; the highest As concentration (range 10.35 to 23.71 μg g⁻¹ wet weight) corresponded to Mullus barbatus from the Iberian Mediterranean.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarangoides 3aDiapterus 3aMullus barbatus 3aTrachinotus 3aarsenic 3abioaccumulation 3abycatch 3acontinental shelf 3afish 3ahumans 3alaws and regulations 3amuscle tissues 3aselenium 3ashrimp 3aMexico 3aSaudi Arabia 3aVenezuela1 aRuelas-Inzunza, Jorge1 aJara-Marini, Martín Enrique1 aMeza-Montenegro, Mercedes0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2015 Nov., v. 187, no. 11 p.700-700dSpringer International Publishingx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-015-4916-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01918naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245012300165300001600288520082800304592002801132653003401160653003301194653002901227653003101256653003501287700001401322700001701336700001301353700001401366773012101380856008201501852000901583655001201592IND60554335820221120112404.0161024e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055433582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcyt.2015.01.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Senquan10aProgress and challenges in generating functional hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells from human pluripotent stem cells  ap. 344-358.  aThe generation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) in vitro holds great potential for providing alternative sources of donor cells for clinical HSC transplantation.

Here we seek to challenge that viewpoint. We argue that a completely decarbonized, energy-rich and sustainable future could be achieved with a dominant deployment of next-generation nuclear fission and associated technologies for synthesizing liquid fuels and recycling waste. By contrast, non-dispatchable energy sources like wind and solar energy are arguably superfluous, other than for niche applications, and run the risk of diverting resources away from viable and holistic solutions. For instance, the pairing of variable renewables with natural-gas backup fails to address many of the entrenched problems we seek to solve. Our conclusion is that, given the urgent time frame and massive extent of the energy-replacement challenge, half-measures that distract from or stymie effective policy and infrastructure investment should be avoided.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 3aenergy 3aenergy policy 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aliquids 3anatural gas 3arecycling 3arisk 3asolar energy 3awastes 3awind 3awind power1 aBlees, Tom1 aWigley, Tom M.

Tabor oak (Quercus aegilops L. ssp. ithaburensis [Decne] Boiss.)  ap. 1-10.  aThe Tabor oak (Quercus aegilops L. ssp. ithaburensis [Decne] Boiss.) is a tree species of ecological and aesthetic importance in Israel, but it is among the many Mediterranean oak species for which we lack the genetic knowledge that is needed as a basis for genetic conservation and forest management. Therefore, random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis was used to determine genetic diversity within and among 16 natural populations. According to the allele frequencies in 72 polymorphic loci, these populations were aggregated according to main geographic regions: the Golan Heights, the Lower Galilee, and the Coastal Plain groups. Only a few of the primers used revealed allele frequencies that were significantly correlated with geo-climatic parameters. Three populations, those of the Kachal, Alona Forest, and Hirbet-Zerkess, were clustered with geographically distant groups, which may indicate the possibility that these populations are the result of human activity. The overall total genetic diversity (Ht) was 0.414, the overall within-population diversity (Hs) was 0.362, and the overall proportion of total diversity stemming from differences between populations (Gst) was 0.126.

Consequently, they should use all the tools available when deciding which management option is the most suitable for urban water service, given how important that service is and the variety of criteria involved in making such a decision. This article employs ‘analytic hierarchy process’ techniques to perform an ex post analysis of the decision to transfer the management of the urban water service in Granada (in southern Spain) to a public-private partnership. The main conclusion is that the decision was rational, in that it was the best possible alternative considering the hierarchy of preferences at the time. Furthermore, confronting the serious financial difficulties faced by the local government took clear precedence over other aspects when the decision was taken.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecision making 3adeveloped countries 3aissues and policy 3alocal government 3aSpain 0apublic choice 0alocal policymakers 0aintegrated urban water management 0aprivatization1 aGonzález Gómez, Francisco,1 aPicazo-Tadeo, Andrés J.0 tInternational journal of water resources development.g2013 Sept. 1, v. 29, no. 3 p.385-399dTaylor & Francis Groupx1360-06487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07900627.2012.721668  aDNAL 7aarticle02511naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001800141245013000159300001600289520117800305592002801483650002201511650002101533650001101554650001001565650001101575650001101586650001401597650001101611650001001622651001001632653002201642653001601664653002101680653001301701653002401714700002001738700002101758700002201779700001601801700002001817700001901837773010001856856007601956852000902032655001202041IND60614718320221122234219.0210530e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061471832DNAL7 a10.3106/ms2017-00322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakajima, Ami10aFeeding Habits of Asian Black Bears (Ursus thibetanus) in Relation to the Abundance and Timing of Fruiting in 13 Tree Species  ap. 167-178.  aWe examined the relationship between the feeding habits of Asian black bears (Ursusthibetanus) and fruit availability during summer and autumn from 2008 to 2011 in the Ashio-Nikko Mountains, Japan. Our main questions were as follows: 1) How does the availability of multiple fruit species influence the feeding habits during summer and autumn? and 2) When do bears begin to forage on hard mast in relation to the availability of various fruit species during summer and autumn? The relationship between feeding habits and fruit availability differed between seasons: in summer, bears ate any fruit species that was available, whereas in autumn, Quercus crispula was the first fruit used, even in poor masting years when other fruit species were more available. In addition, the time when bears started to consume Q. crispula differed between years; more than half a month earlier in years when Padus grayana, the main food item prior to Q. crispula in this area, was not available. Thus, the timing of presence of prior foods may influence the timing of food transition. This demonstrates that both the abundance and timing of fruiting influence the feeding habits of bears.  aPublisher supplied data 3aQuercus mongolica 3aUrsus thibetanus 3aautumn 3afoods 3aforage 3afruits 3amountains 3asummer 3atrees 3aJapan 0afood availability 0afood habits 0aforaging ecology 0afruiting 0aJapanese black bear1 aKoike, Shinsuke1 aYamazaki, Kōji,1 aKozakai, Chinatsu1 aNemoto, Yui1 aMasaki, Takashi1 aKaji, Kōichi,0 tMammal study.g2018 Sept., v. 43, no. 3 p.167-178dUniBio PresswJournal:19720x1348-61607nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3106/ms2017-00323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02985naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001400145245019000159300001800349520150200367592002801869650001601897650002201913650001101935650001401946650001201960650002201972650003101994650001502025650001302040650005202053650001002105650001102115650004202126650000802168650002902176650002602205650001302231650001702244650001702261650001702278700001802295700002402313773010902337856004802446852000902494655001202503IND4473328220221120093731.0120821e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447332822DNAL7 a10.1007/s11105-012-0422-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDas, Akan10aIdentification of Differentially Expressed Gene Profiles in Young Roots of Tea [Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze] Subjected to Drought Stress Using Suppression Subtractive Hybridization  ap. 1088-1101.  aDrought is an important abiotic stress that limits the production of tea in different regions of the world. Young roots of tea are responsible for nutrient and water uptake; hence, they are the first tissues to perceive drought stress. In this study, a forward suppression subtractive hybridization library was constructed from the tender roots of drought-tolerant tea (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze) cultivar (TV-23) subjected to 21Â days of drought stress. A total of 572 quality expressed sequence tags were generated by sequencing of 1,052 random clones which have resulted to 246 unigenes comprising 54 contigs and 192 singlets. The unigenes were assigned to various functional categories, i.e. cellular components, biological processes and molecular functions as defined for the Arabidopsis proteome. There were 13.04% of differentially regulated genes that have been associated to various stresses. A total of 123 putative drought-responsive genes were identified which include candidate genes of ubiquitin-proteasome, glutathione metabolism and sugar metabolism pathways and several transcription factors. In order to determine the possible expression, 10 genes associated to drought-responsive pathways were further analysed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. This study provides a basis for studying the drought tolerance mechanism of this important commercial crop which will also be a valuable resource for the functional genomics study of woody plants in future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aCamellia sinensis 3aclones 3acultivars 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3agene expression regulation 3ametabolism 3aproteome 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aroots 3asugars 3asuppression subtractive hybridization 3atea 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3aunigenes 3awater stress 3awater uptake 3awoody plants1 aDas, Sudripta1 aMondal, Tapan Kumar0 tPlant molecular biology reporter.g2012 Oct., v. 30, no. 5 p.1088-1101dSpringer-Verlagx0735-96407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11105-012-0422-x  aDNAL 7aarticle02599naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245008100155300001600236520144100252592002801693650001301721650001401734650001601748650001101764650002301775650001901798650001001817650002601827650001401853650002301867650001801890650001001908700001801918700001701936700001401953773015101967856007402118852000902192655001202201IND60082234520221119105706.0141017e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008223452DNAL7 a10.1111/ajgw.120952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDarici, M.10aChemical and sensory characterisation of the aroma of Çalkarası rosé wine  ap. 340-346.  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Rosé wines play an important role in the Turkish wine industry, and among them, rosé wines made with the grape cultivar Çalkarası are the most appreciated. The aim of this work was to characterise, for the first time, the aroma of Çalkarası rosé wine. METHODS AND RESULTS: The aroma of a Çalkarası rosé wine from Turkey has been studied by sensory analysis, gas chromatography‐olfactometry (GC‐O) and four quantitative methods for the chemical analysis of volatile compounds. The aroma of the wine was dominated by fresh fruit, floral and red fruit notes. An extract obtained by a dynamic headspace technique was subjected to GC‐O. The strategy allowed the odorants in the Çalkarası rosé wine to be identified and quantified. The aroma showed a complex profile with 28 compounds determined above their odour threshold. CONCLUSIONS: The results correlated well with previous studies of the aroma of rosé wines. Fruity ethyl esters, β‐damascenone, furaneol, fatty acids and a small amount of 3‐mercapto‐1‐hexanol and 3‐mercaptohexyl acetate all contribute to the aroma, but Çalkarası rosé wine has high level of isoamyl and 2‐phenylethyl acetates, which therefore appear to be responsible for its distinctive flowery aroma. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: This work confirms a common base of aroma compounds for rosé wines but also highlights important differences in Çalkarası wine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3acultivars 3afatty acids 3agrapes 3aheadspace analysis 3aodor compounds 3aodors 3aquantitative analysis 3araw fruit 3asensory evaluation 3awine industry 3awines1 aCabaroglu, T.1 aFerreira, V.1 aLopez, R.0 tAustralian journal of grape and wine research.g2014 Oct., v. 20, no. 3 p.340-346dAustralian Society of Viticulture and Oenologyx1322-71307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ajgw.120953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02413naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002400112245016800136300001600304506002800320520117900348592002801527506003701555650002601592650001701618650002201635650001901657650002201676650002301698650002001721651000901741651001301750653001801763653001301781653002201794653001301816653002401829700002301853773013001876852000902006655001202015IND60739643120221207074654.0210420e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073964312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUossefgomrokchi, A.10aInvestigation of Energy Consumption in Agriculture Water Pumping Stations by Different Operation Methods (A Case Study: Ashrafiyeh Agro-Industry Irrigation System)  ap. 143-157.  aResource is Open Access  aIn the recent decades, due to the development of the pressurized irrigation systems, the relationship between the water and energy has been extended more than ever. So, according to problems due to the water shortage, energy saving is considered as one of the most important challenges in the agriculture section. In this study, by considering the capabilities of the pumping systems, variable speed pumps have been examined in an agro-industrial region of Ashrafiyeh (Qazvin province, Iran) with an area of 85 ha. The energy consumption during the ten-year operation was analyzed in the five operation scenarios by the MATLAB/SIMULINK software. The results showed that the consumed electrical energy by using variable speed pumps was approximately decreased up to about 18 percent, as compared to the fixed speed pumps. The results of the evaluation of the consumed energy showed that the current operation circumstance increased energy losses up to about 60 percent, as compared to the other operation methods. The results also revealed that the overall energy efficiency for the current operation circumstance was 52 percent (78 percent of Nebraska Performance Criteria).  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagricultural industry 3acase studies 3acomputer software 3aelectric power 3aenergy efficiency 3airrigation systems 3awater shortages 3aIran 3aNebraska 0aenergy saving 0amodeling 0anebraska criteria 0asimulink 0avariable speed pump1 aRizi, A.

Benth. and S. asiatica (L.) Kuntze severely constrain cereal production in sub-Saharan Africa. A resistance mechanism to these root parasites in sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] is low exudation of striga seed germination stimulants. The trait is controlled by a single recessive gene in the sorghum × S. asiatica interaction, but information is lacking for S. hermonthica Objectives of this investigation were to study the inheritance of stimulation of S. hermonthica seed germination in three F₂ and two F₃:₅ recombinant inbred populations of sorghum, and to determine the effects of striga populations from Mali, Niger, and Kenya on the effectiveness of the low-stimulant character. An agar-gel assay was employed for this purpose. In this laboratory assay, the maximal distance between sorghum rootlets and germinated striga seed (“maximal germination distance”) reflects the magnitude of germination stimulation. Bimodal frequency distributions supported the hypothesis of one recessive gene with a major effect for low maximal germination distance in progenies from crosses of low-stimulant lines (Framida, IS 9830) with a high-stimulant line (E 36-1), tested with striga from Mali or Niger. However, low- versus high-stimulant classes were not always clearly distinct, indicating that additional minor genes modified maximal germination distance in the progenies. The Kenyan striga population led to higher maximal germination distances and larger overlap of low- and high-stimulant classes than striga from Mali or Niger. Minor genes seemed therefore more important with Kenyan striga seed. The general involvement of minor genes in stimulating S. hermonthica seed germination was also evident from the heritable, quantitative variation observed in F₃:₅ lines derived from a cross of the high-stimulant lines N 13 and E 36-1.

Elemental analysis showed the presence of toxic elements (As, Cd, and Pb), as well as high mineral content (Fe, Na, P, K, and Mg): The concentrations of toxic elements were below the permissible limits by the WHO. Chemometrics was performed by cluster analysis (CA), principal component analysis (PCA), and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). In all cases, a correct classification of each type of seed was obtained. The combination of elemental analysis (major, minor, and toxic elements) and chemometrics was useful to determine nutritional quality in the studied seeds, as well as to classify them according to the botanical origin. For that, this method can be useful for the analysis of raw material as quality control in food factories and government control labs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3aaluminum 3aarsenic 3abarium 3acadmium 3acalcium 3achemometrics 3achromium 3acluster analysis 3acobalt 3acopper 3adiscriminant analysis 3afood industry 3afood safety 3airon 3alead 3aleast squares 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3amineral content 3anutritive value 3apotassium 3aprincipal component analysis 3aquality control 3araw materials 3arubidium 3aseeds 3aselenium 3asilicon 3asilver 3asodium 3aspectroscopy 3astrontium 3atitanium 3atoxic substances 3avanadium 3azinc1 aMarchevsky, Eduardo J.1 aCamiña, José M.0 tFood analytical methods.g2016 Feb., v. 9, no. 2 p.477-484dSpringer USx1936-97517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12161-015-0217-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01980naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002900156245005400185300001600239520077300255592002801028650002001056650001201076650002701088650002001115650002901135650001401164650002301178650001401201650001601215650001301231650001501244650001201259650001001271650002501281650001001306651001001316651001101326651001901337700002301356773008901379856005701468852000901525655001201534IND50073715820221118043304.0140307e200409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007371582DNAL7 a10.1023/B:NEFO.0000040956.68838.972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSánchez Rejón, Luis A.10aPlantations of Gmelina arborea in southern Mexico  ap. 293-297.  aPetroCam is a forest products company with land in Campeche, Mexico.

These detailed terrestrially-based findings have however relied on observations made from only the outer edges of the former ice mass, as the North Sea Lobe (NSL) of the British-Irish Ice Sheet (BIIS) occupied an area that is now almost entirely submarine (c.21–15 ka). Compounded by the fact that marine-acquired data have been primarily of insufficient quality and density, the configuration and behaviour of the last BIIS in the southern North Sea remains surprisingly poorly constrained.This paper presents analysis of a new, integrated set of extensive seabed geomorphological and seismo-stratigraphic observations that both advances the principles developed previously onshore (e.g. multiple advance and retreat cycles), and provides a more detailed and accurate reconstruction of the BIIS at its southern-most extent in the North Sea. A new bathymetry compilation of the region reveals a series of broad sedimentary wedges and associated moraines that represent several terminal positions of the NSL. These former still-stand ice margins (1–4) are also found to relate to newly-identified architectural patterns (shallow stacked sedimentary wedges) in the region's seismic stratigraphy (previously mapped singularly as the Bolders Bank Formation). With ground-truthing constraint provided by sediment cores, these wedges are interpreted as sub-marginal till wedges, formed by complex subglacial accretionary processes that resulted in till thickening towards the former ice-sheet margins. The newly sub-divided shallow seismic stratigraphy (at least five units) also provides an indication of the relative event chronology of the NSL. While there is a general record of south-to-north retreat, seismic data also indicate episodes of ice-sheet re-advance suggestive of an oscillating margin (e.g. MIS 2 maximum not related to first incursion of ice into region). Demonstrating further landform interdependence, geographically-grouped sets of tunnel valleys are shown to be genetically related to these individual ice margins, providing clear insight into how meltwater drainage was organised at the evolving termini of this dynamic ice lobe. The newly reconstructed offshore ice margins are found to be well correlated with previously observed terrestrial limits in Lincolnshire and E. Yorkshire (Holderness) (e.g. MIS 2 maximum and Withernsea Till). This reconstruction will hopefully provide a useful framework for studies targeting the climatic, mass-balance, and external glaciological factors (i.e. Fennoscandian Ice Sheet) that influenced late-stage advance and deglaciation, important for accurately characterising both modern and palaeo-ice sheets.  aPublisher supplied data 0aPleistocene glaciation 0aLast Glacial Maximum 0aDeglaciation 0aGlaciology 0aNorthwest Europe 0aNorth Sea 0aBathymetry 0aGlacial geomorphology 0aSeismic stratigraphy1 aEvans, David J.A.1 aLee, Jonathan R.1 aRoberts, David H.1 aTappin, David R.1 aMellett, Claire L.1 aLong, David1 aCallard, S.

Its application in degrading nitrogen-heterocyclic compounds (NHCs) exhibited high catalytic efficiency over a wide applicable pH range from 3.0 to 9.0. SAC-Fe worked as both CPEs and a heterogeneous catalyst in this 3D EF system, enhancing oxidation activity. Degradation pathways of the NHCs (indole, quinoline and pyridine) and reasonable reaction mechanisms involved in this 3D EF were proposed. At pH 3.0, hydroxyl radicals were the dominant participant oxidants, following a Haber–Weiss mechanism. The Feᴵᴵ sites catalyzed the decomposition of electro-generated H₂O₂ to yield ˙OH. At pH 9.0, the oxidants generated from the decomposition of H₂O₂ were mainly ˙O₂⁻/HO₂˙ and to lesser extent were ˙OH. The formation and decomposition of H₂O₂ complex with catalytic sites (Feᴵᴵ and Feᴵᴵᴵ) as well as the catalytic decomposition of H₂O₂ were involved in the catalytic reactions to generate ˙O₂⁻/HO₂˙ and ˙OH. A quantitative structure–activity relationship analysis (QSAR) model was developed to describe the relationship between degradation properties of NHCs and their structures by involving quantum descriptors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aactive sites 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aelectrodes 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydroxyl radicals 3airon 3amodels 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3apH 3apyridines 3aquantitative structure-activity relationships 3aquinoline 3areaction mechanisms 3asewage 3asludge1 aRen, Bozhi1 aDeng, Renjian1 aZhu, Guocheng1 aWang, Zhenghua1 aLi, Zhi0 tRSC advances.g2017 Mar. 08, v. 7, no. 25 p.15455-15462dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra00361g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02985naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100002200146245011400168300001400282520160600296592002801902650002801930650002401958650001101982650001501993650002102008650000902029650001202038650001302050650001202063650001102075650001402086650001002100650001402110650001002124650001302134650002202147650001402169650001502183650001602198700003202214700002602246700003502272773010502307856008202412852000902494655001202503IND4455961720221120073048.0141111e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445596172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jspr.2010.07.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAli, Mahmoud Fadl10aEffect of temperature and humidity on the biology of Attagenus fasciatus (Thunberg) (Coleoptera: Dermestidae)  ap. 25-31.  aThe effect of temperature and relative humidity (r.h.) on the biology of the carpet beetle Attagenus fasciatus was studied under laboratory conditions. The influence of two temperatures (30Â Â°C and 35Â Â°C) and three humidities (40, 60 and 80% r.h.) on the number, duration, mortality and pupation of larval instars, as well as on the biology of fed and starved adult beetles, was investigated. Attagenus fasciatus larvae were reared on dried milk. The mean duration of each successive larval instar generally increased slightly but there was much fluctuation, particularly for the later instars. The highest mortality was recorded during the first two or three instars. At 30Â Â°C pupal duration decreased with increasing r.h. while at 35Â Â°C there was a slight increase. However, the duration at 35Â Â°C was always shorter than at 30Â Â°C. There was 100% emergence of adults from pupae under all test conditions except 40 and 60% r.h. at 35Â Â°C where it fell to about 90%. Humidity and starvation strongly affected egg hatchability under all conditions tested. At 35Â Â°C, eggs took less time to hatch than at 30Â Â°C and there was a positive correlation between egg duration and r.h. The duration of the egg stage was longer for eggs of starved females than those of fed ones. Adult longevity was longer at higher humidity, females lived longer than males and unmated beetles lived longer than mated ones. Starvation reduced adult longevity in all cases. The sex ratio was male biased at 30Â Â°C except at 80% r.h. but the reverse was true at 35Â Â°C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnthrenus scrophulariae 3aAttagenus fasciatus 3aadults 3adried milk 3aegg hatchability 3aeggs 3afemales 3ahatching 3ainstars 3alarvae 3alongevity 3amales 3amortality 3apupae 3apupation 3arelative humidity 3asex ratio 3astarvation 3atemperature1 aMashaly, Ashraf Mohamed Ali1 aMohammed, Asmaa Ahmed1 aEl -Magd Mahmoud Mohammed, Abo0 tJournal of stored products research.g2011 Jan., v. 47, no. 1 p.25-31dElsevier Ltdx0022-474X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jspr.2010.07.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01957naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006600140245007200206300001400278520085700292592002801149650001701177650002301194650001801217650001801235650002001253650002601273650001701299650001901316700002001335700002001355700002001375773012901395856007401524852000901598655001201607IND60626229120221120093619.0181220e20181218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062622912DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cc06526h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKimThese authors contributed equally to this work., Chang Sup10aOn-chip biosynthesis of GM1 pentasaccharide-related complex glycans  ap. 71-74.  aA functional glycan chip combined with on-chip enzymatic glycosylation was developed to prepare complex glycan sources and to apply glycan-involved applications simultaneously.

Thus, the proposed on-chip glycan biosynthesis system can provide a new direction toward obtaining complex glycan sources and complex glycan-involved applications such as glycan–protein interaction analysis and glycan biomarker-based diagnosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosynthesis 3achemical compounds 3acholera toxin 3aglycosylation 3apolysaccharides 3asubstrate specificity 3atransferases 3atrisaccharides1 aHeo, Hye Ryoung1 aSeo, Jeong Hyun1 aCha, Hyung Joon0 tChemical communications.g2018 Dec. 18, v. 55, no. 1 p.71-74dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8cc06526h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02832naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245019700167300001600364520177000380592002802150653002602178653002302204653001902227653001902246653001302265700002002278700002102298773012002319856008202439852000902521655001202530IND60554336120221120070654.0161024e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055433612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcyt.2015.01.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHira, S.

One group of treated mice received an additional dose of rIL-15 to boost the DC-based adoptive cell therapy (ACT). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and multiple immunologic and enzymatic parameters were assessed to demonstrate the efficacy of the vaccination protocol.Therapy with tumor lysate–pulsed, rIL-15–activated DCs plus cucurbitacin I significantly prolongs the survival of tumor-bearing mice but fails to provide a complete cure. Additional treatment of vaccinated mice with rIL-15 dramatically improves the therapeutic efficacy and provides a lifelong cure with no relapse. DCs derived from the surviving vaccinated mice regained their anti-tumor potential against the lymphoma cells with respect to growth inhibition and cytotoxicity. Both cluster of differentiation (CD)4+ and CD8+ T cells were mobilized in metastatic organs of successfully vaccinated mice in large numbers and demonstrated antigen-specific proliferation and tumor cell cytotoxicity. ACT also augments DC function by upregulating tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand and tumor necrosis factor-α expression. In addition, combinatorial immunotherapy restores the levels of antioxidant enzymes and liver function enzyme activities that are severely repressed in untreated tumor-bearing mice.Effective vaccination for a complete cure against aggressive lymphoma requires DC-based ACT in combination with chemotherapy and cytokine therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 0aadoptive cell therapy 0aantioxidant enzyme 0adendritic cell 0ainterleukin-15 0alymphoma1 aMondal, Indrani1 aManna, Partha P.0 tCytotherapy.g2015 May, v. 17 p.647-664dElsevier Inc.aInternational Society for Cellular Therapyx1465-32497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcyt.2015.01.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02976naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006400152245009500216520161900311592002801930650001101958650001701969650001201986650001101998650002102009650001102030650001602041651001202057653002102069653001702090653002702107653002402134653001702158653002102175700002302196700005602219700002702275700002602302700002002328773009802348856008702446852000902533655001202542IND60666137520221120021819.0201125e20191201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066613752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.1139052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTorabi Haghighi, Ali1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5157-015612aA power market-based operation support model for sub-daily hydropower regulation practices  aWith increasing power production from renewable energy sources, sub-daily variations in energy demand need to be balanced. Today, hydropower is commonly used as balancing power. In this study, we quantified the impact of capacity constraints, in terms of reservoir volume and hydropower capacity, on the potential to comply with instant energy demand. To evaluate the impact, we developed two new metrics, power market impact and system efficiency ratio, which are based on two threshold flow regimes derived from natural flow as lower threshold release and regulated flow (based on hourly energy prices) as upper threshold release. The operation support model comprises 96 different regulation scenarios based on varying combinations of hydropower and reservoir capacities. For each scenario, an hourly water balance was simulated, to obtain the highest complying with upper threshold release based on actual energy demand. We tested the framework on the Kemijoki river with defined thresholds based on the natural flow regime (tributary river Ounasjoki) and the hourly energy price in Finland in 2017, and estimated the impact of regulation on hourly flow regime at the Taivalkoski hydropower station. The annual flow regime impact in 2013, 2014 and 2015 was estimated to be 74%, 84% and 61%, respectively, while the monthly impact varied from 27% to 100%. Our framework for evaluating interactions between the power market and sub-daily regulation practices is a useful novel tool for sustainable river management and can be easily applied to different rivers and regions and evaluated for different timescales.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aenergy costs 3amarkets 3amodels 3apower generation 3arivers 3awater power 3aFinland 0aRiver regulation 0aHydropeaking 0aFlow regime alteration 0aSub-daily variation 0aPower market 0aRenewable energy1 aAshraf, Faisal Bin1 aRiml, Joakim1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2716-44461 aKoskela, J.q(Jarkko),1 aKløve, B.q(Bjørn),1 aMarttila, Hannu0 tApplied energy.g2019 Dec. 01, v. 255 p.113905-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.1139053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03565naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245014600168520181300314592002802127650001802155650001902173650001902192650001902211650001902230650002002249650002002269650003002289650001302319650002402332650001502356650002002371650001902391650002202410650001402432650002402446650001202470650002102482650001502503651001002518653002702528653002402555653002902579653002502608653001402633700001302647700001302660700001302673700001202686700001302698700001302711700001202724700001702736773011602753856008502869852000902954655001202963IND60755109720221118233202.0211213e20220101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075510972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2021.1197932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Yonghua10aSoil characteristics and microbial community structure on along elevation gradient in a Pinus armandii forest of the Qinling Mountains, China  aLots of studies have shown that elevation, plant species, and soil characteristics and their relationships significantly affect microbial community in forest soils. However, how do elevation, soil characteristics, and their relationship affect microbial community in the same plant community in different latitudes, such as warm temperature zone and subtropical zone, remains unclear. Here, microbial community structure, soil characteristics, and their relationship were analyzed in Pinus armandii forests in subtropical zone at an altitude of 1700–2300 m in the Huoditang Forest of the Qinling Mountains, China. Bacterial and fungal communities were analyzed by Illumina sequencing. Elevation showed a significant effect on soil organic matter (SOM) and pH. Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Ascomycota, and Basidiomycota were higher abundant phyla across elevations. Ectomycorrhizal fungi abundance decreased with increasing elevation. The fungi richness decreased with increasing elevation and was negatively and significantly correlated with SOM and elevation. The relative abundance of Acidobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Sordariomycetes, and Eurotiomycetes and Ectomycorrhizal fungi abundance was significantly correlated with soil pH. Additionally, Agaricomycetes abundance was positively correlated (p < 0.05) with available potassium (AK) in soils. Elevation, pH, soil temperature, SOM, and AK were significant factors affecting microbial communities according to the data on Pearson and redundancy analyses. Overall, responses of soil characteristics to elevation significantly affected microbial community structure in P. armandii forests of the Qinling Mountains. The results will make us better understand the roles of microbial communities in providing ecosystem services in subtropical forests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcidobacteria 3aAgaricomycetes 3aEurotiomycetes 3aPinus armandii 3aProteobacteria 3aSordariomycetes 3aVerrucomicrobia 3aadministrative management 3aaltitude 3acommunity structure 3aecosystems 3aectomycorrhizae 3aforest ecology 3aplant communities 3apotassium 3asoil organic matter 3asoil pH 3asoil temperature 3asubtropics 3aChina 0aDiversity and richness 0aMicrobial community 0aFunctional fungal groups 0aSoil characteristics 0aElevation1 aSu, San,1 aJia, Xia1 aHan, Lei1 aLiu, Li1 aRen, Kun1 aYe, Xuan1 aQu, Zhi1 aPei, Yuanjie0 tForest ecology and management.g2022 Jan. 01, v. 503 p.119793-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2021.1197933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02884naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245015700170300001600327520127300343592002801616650001501644650001601659650001101675650002201686650001801708650002001726650001501746650001701761650001001778650000901788650001101797650001301808650001901821650002001840650003101860650001801891650001101909650001801920650001601938653001601954653001801970653001601988653002902004653002902033700002002062700002102082700001802103700002002121773009502141856008502236852000902321655001202330IND60570734020221118112847.0180831e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057073402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2017.06.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEzzariai, Amine10aEvaluation of the antibiotics effects on the physical and chemical parameters during the co-composting of sewage sludge with palm wastes in a bioreactor  ap. 388-397.  aThe objective of this study was to investigate thermal and physicochemical parameters of sewage sludge-palm waste mixtures contaminated by different families of antibiotics (tetracyclines, macrolides and fluoroquinolones) during co-composting. Sludge was spiked with chlortetracycline (CTC), oxytetracycline (OTC), roxithromycin (RXY), enrofloxacin (ENR) and ciprofloxacin (CIP). Antibiotics were spiked at a low level, medium level, high level and a control without antibiotics was conducted. The results showed that the organic matter degradation was delayed and the carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio was affected by an increase of the antibiotics concentration. The presence of antibiotics, especially at high level, delayed the coming of the temperature maxima, and disturbed the thermophilic phase. The calorific model showed that the heat release is affected during the thermophilic phase when high antibiotics concentrations were used. In addition, the microbiological approach showed that the adsorption of antibiotics on the rachis could be probably responsible of the fungi inhibition especially during the maturation phase. Therefore, the medium and high levels of antibiotics affected the thermal, physical and chemical parameters as well as the compost quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abioreactors 3acarbon 3achlortetracycline 3aciprofloxacin 3acompost quality 3acomposting 3aenrofloxacin 3afungi 3aheat 3amodels 3anitrogen 3aorganic matter 3aoxytetracycline 3aphysicochemical properties 3aroxithromycin 3asewage 3asewage sludge 3atemperature 0aAntibiotics 0aSewage sludge 0aPalm wastes 0aBioreactor co-composting 0aMicrobiological approach1 aBarret, Maialen1 aMerlina, Georges1 aPinelli, Eric1 aHafidi, Mohamed0 tWaste management.g2017 Oct., v. 68 p.388-397dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.06.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03242naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245014900165300001600314520163300330592002801963650001201991650002202003650001602025650002002041650001002061650002902071650002102100650002102121650002202142650001802164650001802182650004302200650001702243650002002260650002102280653003802301653002402339653001602363653001702379653002302396653002002419700001702439700001602456700001702472700001702489700001702506773009502523856008502618852000902703655001202712IND60570734120221118112844.0180831e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057073412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2017.06.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Weihua10aContributions of nitrification and denitrification to N2O emissions from aged refuse bioreactor at different feeding loads of ammonia substrates  ap. 319-328.  aNitrous oxide (N2O) is a strong greenhouse gas, and its emissions from microbial nitrification (NF) and denitrification (DNF) are a threat to the environment. In the present study, a combined approach consisting of ¹⁵N stable isotope and molecular biology (qPCR) was used to determine the contributions of autotrophic nitrification (ANF), heterotrophic nitrification (HNF), and DNF to N2O emissions in laboratory incubations of aged refuse for different ammonia (NH4⁺-N) loads (200, 400, and 800mg·NH4⁺-N/kg·aged refuse) and incubation times (2–144h). Experimental results showed that the N2O emissions increased with the increase in applied amount of NH4⁺-N substrates. Simultaneous nitrification and denitrification (SND) were demonstrated to be present in the incubations of aged refuse. The results of ¹⁵N stable isotope labelling experiment indicated that NF (54.60%–68.8%) and DNF (83.38%–85.90%) contributed to majority of N2O emissions in the incubations of 24h and 72h, respectively. The results of functional genes (amoA and nosZ) quantification experiments indicated that the high gene copies of amoA and nosZ were present at 24h and 72h, respectively. The study also demonstrated the utility of a combined stable isotope and molecular biology approach. The approaches not only provide similar inferences about the N2O emissions, but also enable the determination of relative contributions of ANF, HNF, and DNF to N2O emissions. The results of the study are important in providing guidance to artificially optimize the operating conditions for alleviating N2O emissions in aged refuse bioreactors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3aammonium nitrogen 3abioreactors 3adenitrification 3agenes 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3aisotope labeling 3amolecular biology 3anitrification 3anitrous oxide 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asolid wastes 3astable isotopes 3awaste management 0aNitrification and denitrification 0aNitrous oxide (N2O) 0aAged refuse 0aAmmonia load 0a15N stable isotope 0aFunctional gene1 aSun, Yingjie1 aLi, Gongwei1 aLiu, Ziliang1 aWang, Huawei1 aZhang, Dalei0 tWaste management.g2017 Oct., v. 68 p.319-328dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.06.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03632naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092024003200112040001800144100002500162245010000187300001800287500000900305520222300314592002802537650001502565650001702580650002002597650002002617650001902637650001402656650001702670650001802687650002102705650002202726651001502748700001902763700001702782700001502799700002102814773013902835852000902974856011102983856007903094961001303173655001203186IND4376191720221120104238.0191228e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437619172DNAL7 a10113/41282hdl7 a10.2136/sssaj2005.00762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStromberger, Mary E.10aMicrobial Populations and Enzyme Activities in Soils Fumigated with Methyl Bromide Alternatives  ap. 1987-1999.  aepub  aMethyl bromide (MeBr; CH₃Br) use for soil fumigation will be banned in 2005 due to its ozone depleting properties. Potential alternative chemicals to replace MeBr include chloropicrin (CP; CCl₃NO₂), 1,3-dichloropropene (1,3-D; C₃H₄Cl₂), iodomethane (IM; CH₃I), and propargyl bromide (PrBr; C₃H₃Br). The goal of this research was to assess changes in soil fungal populations, microbial biomass C (MBC) and respiration, nitrification potential, and enzyme activities after fumigation with MeBr and alternative fumigants. Four formulations of alternative fumigants (CP, InLine [61% 1,3-D plus 33% CP], Midas [50% IM plus 50% CP], and PrBr) were applied at commercial rates through drip irrigation systems to two field plots located in main strawberry production areas in California, USA. Soil samples (0–15 cm) were taken at 1, 4, and 30 or 37 wk after fumigant application. Fumigation with MeBr plus CP and the alternative chemicals eliminated soil-borne fungal pathogens in soil and reduced culturable fungal populations up to 4 wk post fumigation. Soil microbial respiration decreased with fumigant application and was the least (>40% reduction relative to the control) in the PrBr treatment 1 wk after fumigation, while soil MBC was not affected by fumigation. The activities of acid phosphatase and arylsulfatase were generally lower in fumigated soils over the 30- or 37-wk study, and those of β-glucosidase and dehydrogenase were lower up to 4 wk past fumigation. Potential nitrification rates were substantially reduced (>55% reduction relative to the control) by the fumigants, but rates recovered toward the end of this study. Results of this study suggested that fungal populations and the activities of acid phosphatase and arylsulfatase were more sensitive to fumigation with the tested MeBr and the alternative fumigants than total microbial biomass, microbial respiration, nitrification, and the activities of dehydrogenases and β-glucosidase. Short-term impacts of MeBr and its alternative fumigants on microbial activities and enzymatic processes suggest that all the tested fumigants have the potential to alter important microbial and enzymatic functions such as nutrient cycling.  aPublisher supplied data 3asoil fungi 3asoil enzymes 3aenzyme activity 3asoil fumigation 3amethyl bromide 3afumigants 3achloropicrin 3anitrification 3asoil respiration 3amicrobial biomass 3aCalifornia1 aKlose, Susanne1 aAjwa, Husein1 aTrout, Tom1 aFennimore, Steve0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2005 Nov., v. 69, no. 6 p.1987-1999dSoil Science SocietywJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/41283Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2005.00763Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02719naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005400153245013100207500001900338520144900357592002801806650001501834650001501849650001901864650001701883650001601900650001401916650001501930650000901945650001501954653001301969653003201982653001702014653001202031700001902043700001402062700001702076773011902093856008802212852000902300655001202309IND60708754720221122075218.0210226e20210120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070875472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1420242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSendra, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9317-021713aAn overview of the internalization and effects of microplastics and nanoplastics as pollutants of emerging concern in bivalves  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMicroplastic and nanoplastic pollution in aquatic environments is a topic of emerging concern due to the internalization, retention time and effects of these particles in aquatic biota. Bivalves are considered bioindicators due to their wide distribution, sessile behaviour, occupation of ecological niches and ability to filter a large water volume. The study of microplastics and nanoplastics in bivalves has revealed the uptake mechanisms, internalization, distribution and depuration of these particles as well as their effects on physiological parameters, morphological alterations, immunotoxicity and changes in gene expression and proteomic profiles. In this review, we examine the primary characteristics of microplastics and nanoplastics (type of material, size, coating, density, additives and shapes) involved in their possible toxicity in bivalves. Furthermore, secondary characteristics such as the suspension media, aggregation stage and adsorption of persistent pollutants were also recorded to assess the impact of these materials on bivalves. Here, we have highlighted the efforts exerted thus far and the remaining gaps in understanding the extent of microplastic and nanoplastic impacts on bivalves on the basis of laboratory experiments and mesocosm bioassays and in the field. Furthermore, further microplastic and nanoplastic toxicological studies are proposed to facilitate the realistic assessment of environmental risk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3adepuration 3aimmunotoxicity 3ananoplastics 3aoccupations 3apollution 3aproteomics 3arisk 3atoxicology 0aBivalves 0aBioindicators microplastics 0aAccumulation 0aEffects1 aSparaventi, E.1 aNovoa, B.1 aFigueras, A.0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Jan. 20, v. 753 p.142024-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1420243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03265naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245006500172300001400237520211900251592002802370650001502398650001502413650002002428650001602448650001102464650001002475650001202485653001502497653001402512653001202526653001602538653000802554700001902562700002102581700002102602773014902623856008602772852000902858655001202867IND60556339420221120161424.0190214e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055633942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2016.08.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCamerlink, Irene10aComplex contests and the influence of aggressiveness in pigs  ap. 71-78.  aAnimal contests vary greatly in behavioural tactics used and intensity reached, with some encounters resolved without physical contact while others escalate to damaging fighting. However, the reasons for such variation remains to be fully explained. Aggressiveness, in terms of a personality trait, offers a potentially important source of variation that has typically been overlooked. Therefore, we studied how aggressiveness as a personality trait influenced escalation between contestants matched for resource-holding potential (RHP), using detailed observations of the contest behaviour, contest dynamics and escalation levels. We predicted that winner and loser behaviour would differ depending on personality. This was tested by examining 52 dyadic contests between pigs, Sus scrofa. Aggressiveness was assayed in resident–intruder tests prior to the contest. Contests were then staged between pigs matched for RHP in terms of body weight but differing in their aggressiveness. In 27% of the contests a winner emerged without escalated physical fighting, demonstrating that a fight is not a prerequisite between RHP-matched contestants. However, the duration of contests with or without fighting was the same. In contests without a fight, opponents spent more time on mutual investigation and noncontact displays such as parallel walking, which suggests that ritualized display may facilitate assessment and decision making. Winners low in aggressiveness invested more time in opponent investigation and display and showed substantially less aggression towards the loser after its retreat compared to aggressive winners. Aggressiveness influenced contest dynamics but did not predict the level of escalation. Prominent behavioural differences were found for the interaction between personality and outcome and we therefore recommend including this interaction in models where personality is considered. Analyses based on contest duration only would miss many of the subtleties shown here and we therefore encourage more detailed analyses of animal contests, irrespective of the level of contest escalation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSus scrofa 3aaggression 3aanimal behavior 3abody weight 3amodels 3aswine 3awalking 0aaggression 0abehaviour 0acontest 0apersonality 0apig1 aArnott, Gareth1 aFarish, Marianne1 aTurner, Simon P.0 tAnimal behaviour.g2016 Nov., v. 121 p.71-78dElsevier LtdaThe Association for the Study of Animal BehaviourwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2016.08.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02544naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005300150245014800203300001600351520105900367592002801426650002901454650002901483650001601512650002101528650001001549650001501559650003701574650001601611650001601627650001901643650001701662700001901679700001701698700001901715700005201734700002001786700002001806700002001826773017101846856008402017852000902101655001202110IND60631401220221119061247.0190222e20190129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063140122DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jnatprod.8b009302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Min1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6702-399310aNaBr-Induced Production of Brominated Azaphilones and Related Tricyclic Polyketides by the Marine-Derived Fungus Penicillium janthinellum HK1-6  ap. 368-374.  aCultivation of the mangrove rhizosphere soil-derived fungus Penicillium janthinellum HK1-6 with NaBr led to the isolation of two new brominated azaphilones, penicilones G and H (5, 6), two new tricyclic polyketides, penijanthinones A and B (7, 8), and two known azaphilones, penicilones A and B (1, 2). The planar structures and relative configurations of the new compounds were elucidated using comprehensive spectroscopic methods including 1D and 2D NOE spectra. Their absolute configurations were determined by chemical conversions, TDDFT ECD calculations, and comparisons of their ECD spectra. Interestingly, the NaBr-induced brominated azaphilones (5, 6) had the opposite configuration at C-7 compared to the chloro analogues (3, 4) produced by this fungus cultivated with sea salt. Ester hydrolysis of penicilone B (2) afforded the carboxylic acid side chain 2,4-dimethyldec-2-enoic acid (9), with a 4S configuration assigned by its specific rotation. Penicilone H (6) showed antibacterial activity with MIC values ranging from 3.13 to 12.5 μg/mL.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPenicillium janthinellum 3aantibacterial properties 3abromination 3acarboxylic acids 3afungi 3ahydrolysis 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3apolyketides 3arhizosphere 3asodium bromide 3aspectroscopy1 aZheng, Yao-Yao1 aChen, Zhi-Qi1 aShen, Nan-Xing1 aShen, Li1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1947-52361 aZhang, Feng-Min1 aZhou, Xiao-Jian1 aWang, Chang-Yun0 tJournal of natural products.g2019 Jan. 29, v. 82, no. 2 p.368-374dAmerican Chemical Society and American Society of PharmacognosywJournal:jnl11422x1520-60257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jnatprod.8b009303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03016naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245012000162300001800282520171200300592002802012650001502040650001402055650001902069650002202088650002502110650002002135650001302155650002202168650002102190650001702211650001502228650002502243653001702268653003102285653001302316653001102329653001502340773015302355856007702508852000902585655001202594IND60522612320221122054451.0160603e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052261232DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-1979-12192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRadunz, Alfons10aBinding of Antibodies onto the Thylakoid Membrane. V. Distribution of Proteins and Lipids in the Thylakoid Membrane  ap. 1199-1204.  aBinding of antibodies to proteins and lipids onto fragments of the thylakoid membrane was stu­died and compared with the binding of antibodies by stroma-freed chloroplasts. The membrane fragments were prepared from stroma-free chloroplasts by ultrasonication and fractional centrifugation. The fragments have an average diameter of 200 A. Their thickness corresponds to that of the thylakoid membrane. The membrane fragments adsorb out of an antiserum to lipids approximately the same amount of antibodies as out of an antiserum to proteins. In comparison to this, stroma-free chloroplasts bind 4 times more antibodies to proteins than to lipids. From this it follows that the major part of the lipids is located in the membrane surface which is directed towards the inside or is located inside the membrane. As the chemical analysis has shown these results are not caused by an altered chemical composition of the membrane fragments. Despite the fact that membrane proteins bind considerably less protein antibodies than stroma-free chloroplasts, the antibody binding in membrane fragment might be considerably increased for certain proteins such as a polypeptide with an apparent molecular weight 24000 and cytochrome f. Antibodies to the major components of the lipid mixture, such as to monogalactosyl diglyceride, trigalactosyl diglyceride, sulfoquinovosyl diglyceride and phosphatidyl glycerol are 3 to 4 times more bound by membrane fragments than by stroma-free chloroplasts. From these results it is concluded that the thylakoid membrane surface directed towards the inside is preponderently composed of lipids whereas the surface directed towards the outside consists only by 10 to 15% of lipids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3aantiserum 3acentrifugation 3achemical analysis 3achemical composition 3adiacylglycerols 3aglycerol 3amembrane proteins 3amolecular weight 3apolypeptides 3athylakoids 3aultrasonic treatment 0aChloroplasts 0aThylakoid Membrane Surface 0aProteins 0aLipids 0aAntibodies0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 34, no. 12 p.1199-1204dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23183x1865-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znc-1979-12193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04387naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094024003800135040001800173100002100191245013800212506007600350506003100426520251000457592002802967596002402995506003703019650002003056650001103076650003003087650001903117650002103136650001203157650003003169650001403199650001403213650002003227650001003247651001503257653003503272653001703307653002503324653002303349653003003372653003403402653002303436700001903459700002503478700002003503700002003523700002203543700002203565773011603587856008503703961001203788852000903800655001203809IND60755109920221207100207.0211213e20220101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075510992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2021.1197972chorus7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2021.1197972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMerriam, Kyle E.10aReestablishing natural fire regimes to restore forest structure in California’s red fir forests: The importance of regional context  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aThe reestablishment of natural fire regimes can have numerous benefits for forest ecosystems, including the restoration of stand structure through a reduction in tree densities and increased representation of large diameter trees. However, fire effects may depend on how departed the ecosystem is from its historical fire frequency. Red fir (Abies magnifica) forests occupy a broad geographic area across which historical fire return intervals and stand structures vary. Using historical stand inventory data from the Vegetation Type Mapping (VTM) project, we evaluated red fir forests in the Sierra Nevada in California and the Cascade-Klamath region of northwestern California and southern Oregon to determine how reintroduced fire effects vary regionally and if these differences are related to historical fire return intervals or structural conditions. We sampled a total of 29 overlapping fires and found that reestablishing fire in red fir forests consistently restored historical forest structure across a wide geographic range by reducing the density of small trees and maintaining large trees. However, the effect of fire was most evident in the Sierra Nevada where the percent difference in total tree density between unburned and burned plots was significantly greater (77% difference) than in the Cascade-Klamath (53% difference), and burned plots in the Sierra Nevada had significantly lower densities of both small (<30 cm dbh) and medium sized trees (30–60 cm dbh). These stronger fire effects may be related to greater departure from reference fire return intervals in the Sierra Nevada, as well as the region’s warmer and drier conditions increasing the availability of fuel to burn and susceptibility of trees to fire-related mortality. We found that departure from reference fire return intervals followed a similar pattern to departure from historical tree density in both study regions. Unburned plots were 61% departed from reference fire return intervals in the Cascade-Klamath and 69% departed in the Sierra Nevada. In these same plots, departure from VTM total tree density estimates were 37% in the Cascade-Klamath and 44% in the Sierra Nevada. We suggest that incorporating historical references for structural conditions together with regional or local estimates of historical fire return intervals contributes to an improved understanding of how reference conditions varied at local and regional scales, and their importance in the restoration of fire-dependent forests.  aPublisher supplied data  cU.S. Forest Service0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAbies magnifica 3aOregon 3aadministrative management 3afire frequency 3aforest inventory 3aforests 3ageographical distribution 3amortality 3amountains 3astand structure 3atrees 3aCalifornia 0aFire return interval departure 0aFire effects 0aNatural fire regimes 0aForest restoration 0aRed fir (Abies magnifica) 0aVegetation Type Mapping (VTM) 0aHistorical ecology1 aMeyer, Marc D.1 aCoppoletta, Michelle1 aButz, Ramona J.1 aEstes, Becky L.1 aFarris, Calvin A.1 aNorth, Malcolm P.0 tForest ecology and management.g2022 Jan. 01, v. 503 p.119797-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2021.1197973Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle02511naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245021000165300001600375520129800391592002801689650002001717650002201737650002001759650001701779650001701796650001201813650001201825650001101837650000901848650002501857650000701882650001501889650001701904700002101921773009301942856008102035852000902116655001202125IND60479299020221123015523.0160120e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047929902DNAL7 a10.1007/s12161-015-0220-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAltunay, Nail12aA New Micellar Mediated Cloud-Point Extraction Procedure for Sensitive and Selective Determination of Trace Amounts of Total Iodine in Milk-Based Nutritional Products by Means of Indirect Spectrophotometry  ap. 505-518.  aA new micellar mediated cloud-point extraction procedure (CPE) has been developed for sensitive and selective determination of trace amounts of total iodine by means of indirect spectrophotometry. The method is based on selective charge transfer complex formation of I₃, which is produced by the reaction of iodate in presence of 25-fold excess periodate with excess iodide and with acridine orange (AOH⁺) being a selective fluorescent cationic dye at pH 3.0 phthalate buffer, and then the CPE of charge transfer complex formed from aqueous solution at phthalate buffer using nonionic surfactant, Triton X-114. The calibration graphs were rectilinear in the ranges of 1.5–20 and 20–160 μg L⁻¹ for IO₃ ⁻, with r ² higher than 0.9996 in two linear regions with changing sensitivity. Under optimal conditions obtained, the limits of detection and quantification were 0.4 and 1.5 μg L⁻¹ and the precision (as RSD) for determination of 10, 50, and 100 μg L⁻¹ of iodate was in the range of 2.4–4.7 % (n 5). The method was successfully applied to selective and reliable determination of total iodine in milk-based nutritional products. The accuracy of the method was controlled by analyzing two standard reference materials (SRMs) at suitable matrix to milk samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacridine orange 3aaqueous solutions 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3ahealth foods 3aiodates 3aiodides 3aiodine 3amilk 3anonionic surfactants 3apH 3aphthalates 3aspectroscopy1 aGürkan, Ramazan0 tFood analytical methods.g2016 Feb., v. 9, no. 2 p.505-518dSpringer USx1936-97517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12161-015-0220-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02974naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245013500168300001600303520164200319592002801961653002201989653003802011653002502049653003002074700002102104700001802125700002102143700001902164700002102183700001902204700002002223700002402243700002102267700002202288700002102310700002102331773012102352856008202473852000902555655001202564IND60554336320221120070706.0161024e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055433632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcyt.2015.01.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKittaka, Mizuho10aClumps of a mesenchymal stromal cell/extracellular matrix complex can be a novel tissue engineering therapy for bone regeneration  ap. 860-873.  aThe transplantation of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) to damaged tissue has attracted attention in scientific and medical fields as an effective regenerative therapy. Nevertheless, additional studies are required to develop an MSC transplant method for bone regeneration because the use of an artificial scaffold restricts the number of transplanted cells and their function. Furthermore, regulating the degree of cell differentiation in vitro is desirable for a more effective regenerative therapy. To address these unresolved issues, with the use of a self-produced extracellular matrix (ECM), we developed clumps of an MSC/ECM complex (C-MSCs).MSCs isolated from rat femur were cultured in growth medium supplemented with 50 μg/mL of ascorbic acid for 7 days. To obtain C-MSCs, confluent cells were scratched with the use of a micropipette tip to roll up the cellular sheet, which consisted of ECM produced by the MSCs. The biological properties of C-MSCs were assessed in vitro and their bone regenerative activity was tested by use of a rat calvarial defect model.Immunofluorescent confocal microscopic analysis revealed that type I collagen formed C-MSCs. Osteopontin messenger RNA expression and amount of calcium content were higher in C-MSCs cultured in osteo-inductive medium than those of untreated C-MSCs. The transplantation of osteogenic-differentiated C-MSCs led to rapid bone regeneration in the rat calvarial defect model.These results suggest that the use of C-MSCs refined by self-produced ECM, which contain no artificial scaffold and can be processed in vitro, may represent a novel tissue engineering therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 0abone regeneration 0acomplex mesenchymal stromal cells 0aextracellular matrix 0amesenchymal stromal cells1 aKajiya, Mikihito1 aShiba, Hideki1 aTakewaki, Manabu1 aTakeshita, Kei1 aKhung, Rathvisal1 aFujita, Takako1 aIwata, Tomoyuki1 aNguyen, Truong Quoc1 aOuhara, Kazuhisa1 aTakeda, Katsuhiro1 aFujita, Tsuyoshi1 aKurihara, Hidemi0 tCytotherapy.g2015 July, v. 17 p.860-873dElsevier Inc.aInternational Society for Cellular Therapyx1465-32497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcyt.2015.01.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03009naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245013000169300001600299520140800315592002801723650001801751650001101769650001201780650001901792650001401811650001301825650001301838650001101851650001101862650001701873650000901890650000901899650001401908650001101922650002601933650001101959650002201970650001301992650001302005650001202018650002102030650000902051653001602060653001802076653001302094653001602107653001802123700001702141700001102158700001402169700001702183700001802200773009502218856008502313852000902398655001202407IND60570734320221118112828.0180831e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057073432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2017.06.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Zhenzhou10aEffect of water-washing on the co-removal of chlorine and heavy metals in air pollution control residue from MSW incineration  ap. 221-231.  aThe present study systemically investigated the effect of a water-washing process on the removal of harmful chlorides, sulfates, and heavy metals in the air pollution control (APC) residue from municipal solid wastes incineration (MSWI), for sake of a better reuse and disposal of this kind of waste. In addition, the kinetic study was conducted to reveal the releasing mechanism of relevant element in the residue. The results show that, over 70wt.% of chlorides and nearly 25wt.% of sulfates in the residue could be removed by water washing. Based on an economical consideration, the optimal operation conditions for water washing of APC residue was at liquid/solid (L/S) ratio of 3mL:1g and extracting time of 5min. As expected, the concentrations of Co, Cr, Fe, Ni, V and Cu in the washing effluent increased with time during the washing process. However, the extracting regime differs among different heavy metals. The concentrations of Ba and Mn increased firstly but declined afterwards, and concentrations of Pb and Zn gradually declined while Cd and As kept constant with the increase of extracting time. It is worth mentioning that the bubbling of CO2 into the washing effluent is promisingly effective for a further removal of Pb, Cu and Zn. Furthermore, kinetic study of the water washing process reveals that the extracting of heavy metals during water washing follows a second-order model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3abarium 3acadmium 3acarbon dioxide 3achlorides 3achlorine 3achromium 3acobalt 3acopper 3aheavy metals 3airon 3alead 3amanganese 3amodels 3amunicipal solid waste 3anickel 3apollution control 3asulfates 3avanadium 3awashing 3awaste management 3azinc 0aAPC residue 0aWater washing 0aChloride 0aHeavy metal 0aKinetic study1 aTian, Sicong1 aJi, Ru1 aLiu, Lili1 aWang, Xidong1 aZhang, Zuotai0 tWaste management.g2017 Oct., v. 68 p.221-231dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.06.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03418naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245015200172300001600324520142100340592002801761650001701789650002601806650001701832650001801849650001101867650001701878650003201895650001801927650000901945650002401954650000901978650003701987650001102024650001602035650001602051650002002067650003102087650001402118650002902132650003202161700002502193700006202218700002502280700006302305700002102368700002402389700001702413700003302430700002202463700002202485700005702507773017102564856008402735852000902819655001202828IND60631401320190403000000.0190222e20190117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063140132DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jnatprod.8b009392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMichalak, Barbara10aEupatoriopicrin Inhibits Pro-inflammatory Functions of Neutrophils via Suppression of IL-8 and TNF-alpha Production and p38 and ERK 1/2 MAP Kinases  ap. 375-385.  aDuring chronic inflammation, neutrophils acting locally as effector cells not only activate antibacterial defense but also promote the inflammatory response. Interleukin 8 (IL-8), the main cytokine produced by activated neutrophils, positively correlates with the severity of respiratory tract diseases. By screening European plants traditionally used for treating respiratory tract diseases, we found that extracts of aerial parts of Eupatorium cannabinum inhibit IL-8 release from neutrophils. Using bioassay-guided fractionation, we identified five sesquiterpene lactones, eupatoriopicrin (1), 5′-deoxyeupatoriopicrin (2), hiyodorilactone A (3), 3-hydroxy-5′-O-acetyleupatoriopicrin = hiyodorilactone D (4), and hiyodorilactone B (5), that efficiently (IC₅₀ < 1 μM) inhibited IL-8 and TNF-α release in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human neutrophils. Moreover, all these sesquiterpene lactones suppressed the adhesion of human neutrophils to an endothelial monolayer by downregulating the expression of the β2 integrin CD11b/CD18 on the neutrophil surface. Furthermore, eupatoriopicrin efficiently suppressed LPS-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and ERK and attenuated neutrophil infiltration in the thioglycolate-induced peritonitis model in mice. Altogether, these results demonstrate the potential of the sesquiterpene lactone eupatoriopicrin as a lead substance for targeting inflammation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCD18 antigen 3aEupatorium cannabinum 3aaerial parts 3afractionation 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3ainterleukin-8 3alead 3alipopolysaccharides 3amice 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amodels 3aneutrophils 3aperitonitis 3aphosphorylation 3arespiratory tract diseases 3ascreening 3asesquiterpenoid lactones 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aPiwowarski, Jakub P.1 aGranica, Sebastian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1876-13211 aWaltenberger, Birgit1 aAtanasov, Atanas G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2545-09671 aKhan, Shafaat Y.1 aBreuss, Johannes M.1 aUhrin, Pavel1 aŻyżyńska-Granica, Barbara1 aStojakowska, Anna1 aStuppner, Hermann1 aKiss, Anna K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8258-28490 tJournal of natural products.g2019 Jan. 17, v. 82, no. 2 p.375-385dAmerican Chemical Society and American Society of PharmacognosywJournal:jnl11422x1520-60257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jnatprod.8b009393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01734naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100004000143245009900183300001400282520077400296592002801070653002301098653002101121653001101142653001201153653001401165653001401179700003201193773012101225856007701346852000901423655001201432IND60480498820221119132556.0160128e20150727xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048049882DNAL7 a10.1515/bog-2015-00242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález González, María Jesús,10aStrategic planning and change management.

Our aim is to highlight planning as a way of learning, that is, planning implies changing ways of thinking, not making plans. Strategic learning requires releasing the mind in order to slip flexibly into the continuous line and to achieve the creation of possible action courses from a fertile dialogue between thought and action. Using our insights from the two literatures, we propose a dynamic, integrative conceptual model of change based on organizational learning. This practice has been analysed in three Spanish cities where important events have taken place.  aPublisher supplied data 0astrategic planning 0alearning process 0achange 0aSeville 0aBarcelona 0aSaragossa1 aGonzález, Alejandro López0 tBulletin of Geography.

This study aimed to assess the vertical variation of both C/N, N/P, C/P ratios and their determining factors along soil profiles in subalpine forests of the eastern Tibetan Plateau. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Soil samples at five depths (0–10, 10–20, 20–30, 30–50, and 50–100 cm) were collected from 132 forest sites to evaluate the vertical distribution of soil C/N, N/P, and C/P ratios. Eleven relevant environmental factors (e.g., altitude, latitude, longitude, soil pH, soil bulk density, relative stone contents, soil order, slope, position, forest type, and dominant tree species) were measured to examine their relative contribution on stoichiometric ratios within each soil layer using boosted regression tree (BRT) analysis. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Soil C/N, N/P, and C/P ratios consistently decreased with increasing soil depth. BRT models accurately predicted the soil C/N, N/P, and C/P ratios in the upper four layers (R ² = 49–97 %). For soil C/N and N/P ratios, altitude associated with latitude had the highest contribution across five soil layers, while the contributions of soil pH and bulk density were significant within soil layers closer to the surface. Independently, soil bulk density and altitude were the most important factors of C/P ratios in 0–30- and 30–100-cm soil layers. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated that soil C/N/P stoichiometric ratios, and the relative importance of their controlling factors, shifted within soil profiles across Tibetan Plateau forests. Further research will be needed to understand the regulatory mechanism of soil stoichiometry and biogeochemistry in response to environmental change at whole soil profiles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3abiogeochemistry 3abulk density 3acarbon 3aforest types 3alatitude 3alongitude 3amodels 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3aregression analysis 3asoil density 3asoil depth 3asoil pH 3asoil profiles 3asoil sampling 3aspatial distribution 3astoichiometry 3asubalpine forests 3atrees 3aChina1 aBao, Weikai1 aPang, Xueyong0 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2017 Aug., v. 17, no. 8 p.2054-2065dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1439-01087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-017-1665-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02962naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245015600166520152200322592002801844650001801872650001401890650001201904650001501916650001701931650001001948650002901958650001101987650002701998650001202025650001602037650001302053650003502066650002602101650001702127650001502144650000902159651001102168700002702179700002602206700002902232700002102261773012702282856007402409852000902483655001202492IND60652159020221118053142.0190712e20180216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065215902DNAL7 a10.3390/su100205312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIōannou, Kōstas E.,12aA Spatial Decision Support System Framework for the Evaluation of Biomass Energy Production Locations: Case Study in the Regional Unit of Drama, Greece  aRenewable Energy Sources are expected to play a very important role in energy production in the following years. They constitute an energy production methodology which, if properly enabled, can ensure energy sufficiency as well as the protection of the environment. Energy production from biomass in particular is a very common method, which exploits a variety of resources (wood and wood waste, agricultural crops and their by-products after cultivation, animal wastes, Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) and food processing wastes) for the production of energy. This paper presents a Spatial Decision Support System, which enables managers to locate the most suitable areas for biomass power plant installation. For doing this, fuzzy logic and fuzzy membership functions are used for the creation of criteria layers and suitability maps. In this paper, we use a Multicriteria Decision Analysis methodology (Analytical Hierarchy Process) combined with fuzzy system elements for the determination of the weight coefficients of the participating criteria. Then, based on the combination of fuzzy logic and theAnalytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), a final proposal is created thatdivides the area into four categories regarding their suitability forsupporting a biomass energy production power plant. For the two optimal locations, the biomass is also calculated.The framework is applied to theRegional Unit of Drama, which is situated in Northern Greece and is very well known for the area’s forest and agricultural production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal wastes 3abioenergy 3abiomass 3abyproducts 3acase studies 3acrops 3adecision support systems 3aenergy 3afood processing wastes 3aforests 3afuzzy logic 3amanagers 3amulti-criteria decision making 3amunicipal solid waste 3apower plants 3awaste wood 3awood 3aGreece1 aTsantopoulos, Georgios1 aArabatzis, Garyfallos1 aAndreopoulou, Zacharoula1 aZafeiriou, Eleni0 tSustainability.g2018 Feb. 16, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100205313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02132naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245012000171520110600291592002801397653003001425653002201455653002901477653001801506653001901524700001501543700001801558700005201576773010601628856008701734852000901821655001201830IND60677293820221119221827.0200106e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067729382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2019.1224732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiu, Zhongyang12aA short-chain dehydrogenase plays a key role in cellulosic D-lactic acid fermentability of Pediococcus acidilactici  aPhenolic aldehydes from lignocellulose pretreatment are strong inhibitors of cell growth and metabolism of cellulosic lactic acid bacteria. Their low solubility and recalcitrance highly reduce the removal efficiency of various detoxification methods. This study shows a simultaneous conversion of phenolic aldehydes and fermentation of D-lactic acid by Pediococcus acidilactici using corn stover feedstock. Vanillin was found to be the strongest phenolic aldehyde inhibitor to P. acidilactici. The overexpression of a short-chain dehydrogenase encoded by the gene CGS9114_RS09725 from Corynebacterium glutamicum was identified to play a key role in D-lactic acid fermentability of P. acidilactici. The engineered P. acidilactici with the genome integration of CGS9114_RS09725 showed the accelerated vanillin reduction and improved cellulosic D-lactic acid production. This study reveals that vanillin conversion is crucial for D-lactic acid fermentation, and the direct expression of a specific vanillin reduction gene in lactic acid bacterium efficiently improves cellulosic D-lactic acid production.  aPublisher supplied data 0aLignin derived inhibitors 0aBiodetoxification 0aPediococcus acidilactici 0aD-lactic acid 0aLignocellulose1 aFang, Chun1 aGao, Qiuqiang1 aBao, Jie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6521-30990 tBioresource technology.g2020 Feb., v. 297 p.122473-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2019.1224733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02750naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245008900167520157800256592002801834650001101862650000901873650001801882650002501900650002401925650002501949650001601974650000901990650001801999653001202017653001002029653001502039653001602054653001202070653002702082700001502109700001402124773010602138856008702244852000902331655001202340IND60666138020221120045749.0200210e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066613802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.1024162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Wenbin10aEffect of surface modification on the dynamic heat and mass transfer of wool fabrics  aSurface functionalization of fibers is widely used to grant performance or functions to textiles. Modified textile surface, with different morphology and wettability together with different thermal conductivity, has a profound effect on the wellbeing of wearer, because the thermal and moisture transfer of the surface-modified textiles in dynamic moving conditions is totally different to unmodified ones. To benefit the design of performance/functional textiles with enhanced wellbeing of wearer, it is important to understand the dynamic thermal and mass transfer of textiles before and after surface modification. Using wool as a sample fiber, this work reveals the effect of typical surface modification on the dynamic thermal and moisture transfer of wool fabrics. It has been found that the surface characters of wool fiber change after surface modification with etched and peeled off scales, enhanced water absorbing capacity and wettability. The surface temperature of modified wool fabrics was lower than pristine wool fabrics when attaching to a rotating hotplate with a temperature of 35 °C, resulting in a lower energy consumption of the hotplate and enhanced warmth retention rate. Modified wool fabrics took longer time to accomplish the dynamic moisture transfer process with a longer stage three in the transfer cycle. This work will provide insights on how the surface of fiber affects the dynamic thermal and moisture transfer of textiles, which will further benefit the development of functional/performance clothing with its comfort well maintained.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aheat 3amass transfer 3amoisture diffusivity 3asurface temperature 3athermal conductivity 3awettability 3awool 3awoolen fabric 0aSurface 0aFiber 0aMorphology 0aWettability 0aDynamic 0aHeat and mass transfer1 aZhao, Yuan1 aWang, Xin0 tJournal of thermal biology.g2019 Oct., v. 85 p.102416-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12493x0306-45657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.1024163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02476naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006000150245014000210300001600350520075200366592002801118650001401146650002001160650001801180650001701198650001601215650002101231650001101252650001301263650002101276700006401297700002701361700002401388700003101412700001701443700003001460700002501490700002201515700006701537700002301604700001801627700002601645700005901671773017101730856008401901852000901985655001201994IND60631401520190403000000.0190222e20190204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063140152DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jnatprod.8b010382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCosta, Margarida1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9147-862110aStructure of Hierridin C, Synthesis of Hierridins B and C, and Evidence for Prevalent Alkylresorcinol Biosynthesis in Picocyanobacteria  ap. 393-402.  aSmall, single-celled planktonic cyanobacteria are ubiquitous in the world’s oceans yet tend not to be perceived as secondary metabolite-rich organisms.

The purpose of this study was to understand the levels and profiles of POPs in breast milk in China and assess their potential health risks among breastfed infants under six months of age. A literature review focused on China was performed for studies published from 2001 to 2020. The POP levels in breast milk along with other important variables were extracted, and then the average individual POP levels in breast milk were estimated. This review summarises the distribution of traditional and new POPs, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), legacy brominated flame retardants (BFRs), perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), and chlorinated paraffins (CPs) and reported notably high levels of short-chain chlorinated paraffins and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis (p-chlorophenyl) ethylene (p,p’-DDE) in breast milk. Although the levels of traditional POPs generally declined over time, especially p,p’-DDE and beta-hexachlorocyclohexane (β-HCH), women living in coastal areas, urban areas, and southern China still have a high body burden of certain POPs. In the present study, the estimated daily intake (EDI) of POPs through breastfeeding was used to evaluate the health risk for infants by comparing with acceptable levels. The findings suggested that infants born in coastal areas most likely suffered potential health risk from exposure to DDT, and the health risk of hexachlorobenzene (HCB) in infants in most nationwide regions remains a concern. More importantly, the EDI of PCBs for infants exceeds the safe limit on a national scale. Continuous surveillance of PCBs in breast milk is critical to evaluate the potential health effects on humans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDDE (pesticide) 3aHCH (pesticide) 3aaverage daily intake 3abreast feeding 3abreast milk 3abromination 3aenvironment 3ahexachlorobenzene 3ahumans 3amonitoring 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3arisk 3aChina 0aPersistent organic pollutants 0aHazard quotient 0aTotal toxic equivalent1 aLuo, Dan1 aWang, Limei1 aYu, Meng1 aZhao, Shizhen1 aWang, Youjie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7031-29721 aMei, Surong1 aZhang, Gan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9010-81400 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Jan. 20, v. 753 p.142028-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1420283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02738naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002400145245014300169520132800312592002801640650001601668650001501684650002501699650002101724650001301745650001501758650002801773650001501801650001401816650001601830650001401846650001301860650002101873650001101894650000901905650002501914700001601939700002001955700002101975700002201996700002002018700002002038773012102058856008002179852000902259655001202268IND60780859420221118214937.0220623e20220617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078085942DNAL7 a10.3390/biology110609272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTresnakova, Nikola 10aChronic Toxicity of Primary Metabolites of Chloroacetamide and Glyphosate to Early Life Stages of Marbled Crayfish Procambarus virginalis  aDegradation products of herbicides, alone and in combination, may affect non-target aquatic organisms via leaching or runoff from the soil. The effects of 50-day exposure of primary metabolites of chloroacetamide herbicide, acetochlor ESA (AE; 4 µg/L), and glyphosate, aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA; 4 µg/L), and their combination (AMPA + AE; 4 + 4 µg/L) on mortality, growth, oxidative stress, antioxidant response, behaviour, and gill histology of early life stages of marbled crayfish (Procambarus virginalis) were investigated. While no treatment effects were observed on cumulative mortality or early ontogeny, growth was significantly lower in all exposed groups compared with the control group. Significant superoxide dismutase activity was observed in exposure groups, and significantly higher glutathione S-transferase activity only in the AMPA + AE group. The gill epithelium in AMPA + AE-exposed crayfish showed swelling as well as numerous unidentified fragments in interlamellar space. Velocity and distance moved in crayfish exposed to metabolites did not differ from controls, but increased activity was observed in the AMPA and AE groups.

These dual influences create the potential for threshold relationships between DOC and primary production, but empirical tests for the prevalence of thresholds are scarce. We used Box–Cox regression and environmental monitoring data from 703 subarctic and boreal lakes to assess patterns and potential threshold relationships between light and nutrient availability along gradients of DOC in northern Sweden’s six major watersheds. We found consistent patterns of increasing nutrient concentration and light attenuation with DOC. Further, we identified thresholds (mean = 5.96 mg·L⁻¹) below which nutrient concentrations increased more rapidly than light extinction and above where the opposite occurred. These results suggest consistent patterns in primary production with shifts from nutrient to light limitation with increasing DOC. Accordingly, the thresholds agree with the vertex of the curvilinear relationship between lake primary production and DOC. We estimated that most lakes in Sweden are within ±3 mg·L⁻¹ of the threshold, indicating high potential for changes from positive to negative influences of DOC on primary production if forecasted increases in DOC concentrations due to climate and land cover change are realized.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3adissolved organic carbon 3aenvironmental monitoring 3alakes 3aland cover 3anutrient availability 3anutrient content 3anutrients 3aphotolysis 3aprimary productivity 3awatersheds 3aSweden1 aLapierre, Jean-François1 aKarlsson, Jan0 tCanadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences.g2015 July 14, v. 72, no. 11 p.1663-1671dNRC Research Pressx1205-75337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2015-01873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03030naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245014200168300001400310500001500324520150300339592002801842650001501870650002601885650000801911650002501919650002801944650001001972650003301982650002102015650001502036650001902051650001302070650002602083650000902109650002702118650001802145650000702163650001102170650001502181650002902196653001502225653000902240653002702249653001802276700002902294773009302323856008702416852000902503655001202512IND60526592520221123034048.0190408e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052659252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2015.07.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, Imran10aProbiotic potential of nutritionally improved Lactobacillus plantarum DGK-17 isolated from Kimchi – A traditional Korean fermented food  ap. 88-94.  a2019-12-06  aThe aim of the study was to evaluate the functional properties of the Lactic acid bacterium Lactobacillus plantarum DGK-17 isolated from Kimchi-a traditional fermented Korean food, and to assess its antimicrobial and cell-invasion protection activity. Nutritionally improved DGK-17 showed antimicrobial activity, checked via agar well diffusion assay against several pathogenic microorganisms and showed enhanced antimicrobial activity against target microbes Pseudomonas aeruginosa 03K711 and Klebsiella pneumoniae 05K279. Bactericidal activity of DGK-17 Cell-free Culture Supernatant (CFCS) was evident from the decreased growth of P. aeruginosa 03K711 and K. pneumoniae 05K279. Altered membrane integrity was observed in scanning electron microscopy which indicated that CFCS acts on cell membrane of bacteria leading to a cell burst. CFCS also acts on DNA as shown by the DNA damage study. Our auto-aggregation, co-aggregation and adhesion studies indicated that DGK-17 prevents colonization of pathogenic bacteria thereby limiting their infection. Also, DGK-17 is able to survive under low pH and high bile salt conditions – a simulated gastric juice environment. Efficacy of DGK-17 to protect HCT 116 colon cells against P. aeruginosa (03K711) and K. pneumoniae (05K279) invasion suggests its role in protection of host cells from such infections. Finally we conclude that L. plantarum DGK-17 has a strong probiotic potential, antimicrobial activity and a potential for invasion protection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3afunctional properties 3aDNA 3alactic acid bacteria 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3acolon 3ascanning electron microscopy 3acell free system 3abile salts 3acell membranes 3aadhesion 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3aagar 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3agastric juice 3apH 3akimchi 3aprobiotics 3aantibacterial properties 0aProbiotics 0aCFCS 0aAntimicrobial activity 0acell invasion1 aKang, S.

Using data collected from a choice experiment on Fuji apples in a face-to-face survey in six Chinese cities, the results show that (i) consumers are willing to pay for traceable food but their valuations can differ upon the degree of their trust in government’s supervision of food safety and food labels; (ii) consumers are willing to pay for traceability with strong evidence of preference heterogeneity; (iii) government is not the most trusted safety inspection and certificate authority as found in prior studies using animal food products in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3afood policy 3afood safety 3asurveys 3atraceability 3awillingness to pay 3aChina 0aChoice experiment 0aInteraction effects 0aFuji apple products 0aChinese consumer 0aD12 0aQ181 aGao, Zhifeng1 aNayga, Rodolfo M.,cJr.1 aSnell, Heather Arielle1 aMa, Hengyun0 tFood policy.g2019 Sept. 06, dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl9768x0306-91927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodpol.2019.1017683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02325naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245010600174520088300280592002801163650001301191650001201204650002201216650001501238650001701253650002001270650001901290650001501309650001801324650002701342653001801369653001601387653003101403653002801434653003601462700003101498700002501529700001901554700002001573700001901593700005301612773010601665856008701771852000901858655001201867IND60677294120221119221649.0200110e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067729412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2019.1224762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSankaran, Revathy10aRecent advances in the pretreatment of microalgal and lignocellulosic biomass: A comprehensive review  aMicroalgal and lignocellulosic biomass is the most sumptuous renewable bioresource raw material existing on earth. Recently, the bioconversion of biomass into biofuels have received significant attention replacing fossil fuels. Pretreatment of biomass is a critical process in the conversion due to the nature and structure of the biomass cell wall that is complex. Although green technologies for biofuel production are advancing, the productivity and yield from these techniques are low. Over the past years, various pretreatment techniques have been developed and successfully employed to improve the technology. This paper presents an in-depth review of the recent advancement of pretreatment methods focusing on microalgal and lignocellulosic biomass. The technological approaches involving physical, chemical, biological and other latest pretreatment methods are reviewed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3abiotransformation 3acell walls 3afossil fuels 3afuel production 3alignocellulose 3amicroalgae 3araw materials 3asustainable technology 0aBioconversion 0aIrradiation 0aHydrothermal carbonization 0aAmmonia fiber explosion 0aMicroalgae and lignocellulosics1 aParra Cruz, Ricardo Andres1 aPakalapati, Harshini1 aShow, Pau Loke1 aLing, Tau Chuan1 aChen, Wei-Hsin1 aTao, Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5276-85460 tBioresource technology.g2020 Feb., v. 298 p.122476-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2019.1224763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03142naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002400145245016000169520193300329592002802262650002102290650001402311650001202325650002302337650001902360650002602379650001702405650002702422650001602449650001102465650001902476650001702495700002502512700002202537773012002559856008002679852000902759655001202768IND60780859520221118214956.0220623e20220525xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078085952DNAL7 a10.3390/biology110608112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVarlamova, Elena G.14aThe Role of Selenoproteins SELENOM and SELENOT in the Regulation of Apoptosis, ER Stress, and Calcium Homeostasis in the A-172 Human Glioblastoma Cell Line  aIt is known that seven mammalian selenoproteins are localized in the endoplasmic reticulum: SELENOM, SELENOT, SELENOF, SELENOK, SELENOS, SELENON, and DIO2. Among them, SELENOM and SELENOT are the least studied; therefore, the study of their function using the widespread method of suppressing the expression of genes encoding these proteins and the activity of the enzymes themselves by RNA interference is of great interest. We have shown that a decrease in the expression of SELENOM and SELENOT mRNA in the A-172 human glioblastoma cell line by more than 10 times and the quantitative content of enzymes by more than 3 times leads to ER stress, expressed as a decrease in the ER capacity for storing Ca²⁺ ions. At the level of regulation of apoptotic processes, SELENOM knockdown leads to an increase in the expression of pro-apoptotic CHOP, GADD34, PUMA, and BIM genes, but a compensatory increase in the levels of SELENOT and antioxidant genes from the group of glutathione peroxidases and thioredoxins did not induce cell death. Knockdown of SELENOT had the opposite effect, reducing the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins and regulating the level of a smaller number of genes encoding antioxidant enzymes, which also did not affect the baseline level of apoptosis in the studied cells. At the same time, ER stress induced by MSA or SeNPs induced a more pronounced pro-apoptotic effect in SELENOT knockdown cells through suppression of the expression of selenium-containing antioxidant proteins. Thus, in this work, for the first time, the mechanisms of fine regulation of the processes of apoptosis, cell proliferation, and ER stress by two ER resident proteins, SELENOM and SELENOT, are touched upon, which is not only fundamental but also applied to clinical importance due to the close relationship between the calcium signaling system of cells, folding proteins-regulators of apoptosis and cell survival pathways.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA interference 3aapoptosis 3acalcium 3acell proliferation 3acell viability 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aglioblastoma 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3aselenoproteins 3athioredoxins1 aGoltyaev, Michael V.1 aTurovsky, Egor A.0 tBiology.g2022 May 25, v. 11, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology110608113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02198naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245014900179300001800328520083300346592002801179650002201207650002501229650001901254650002301273650001901296650002601315650005801341650001701399651001001416653001201426653001901438653001901457653001701476653001201493700002001505700002901525700002301554773010501577856008501682852000901767655001201776IND60396117120221119115915.0150825e20151002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6039611712DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2015.10041742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKshirsagar, Parthraj R.10aQuantitative determination of three pentacyclic triterpenes from five Swertia L. species endemic to Western Ghats, India, using RP-HPLC analysis  ap. 1783-1788.  aAim of this study was to identify pentacyclic triterpenoids betulinic acid (BA), oleanolic acid (OA) and ursolic acid (UA) from five Swertia species endemic to Western Ghats, which are used as substitutes as well as adulterants to Swertia chirayita .

Dams, however, create discontinua in these processes and change the hierarchical structure. We examined the relative roles of hydrology and other instream factors, within a hierarchical landscape context, in organizing fish communities in regulated and unregulated tributaries to the Upper Tennessee River, USA. We used multivariate regression trees to identify factors that partition fish assemblages based on trait similarities, irrespective of spatial scale. We then used classical path analysis and structural equation modeling to evaluate the most plausible hierarchical causal structure of specific trait-based community components, given the data. Both statistical approaches suggested that river regulation affects stream fishes through a variety of reach-scale variables, not always through hydrology itself. Although we observed different changes in flow, temperature, and biotic responses according to regulation types, the most predominant path in which dam regulation affected biota was via temperature alterations. Diversion dams had the strongest effects on fish assemblages. Diversion dams reduced flow magnitudes, leading to declines in fish richness but increased temperatures, leading to lower abundances in equilibrium species and nest guarders. Peaking and run-of-river dams increased flow variability, leading to lower abundances in nest-guarding fishes. Flow displayed direct relationships with biotic responses; however, results indicated that changes in temperature and substrate had equal, if not stronger, effects on fish assemblage composition. The strength and nature of relationships depended on whether flow metrics were standardized for river size. We suggest that restoration efforts in regulated rivers focus on improving flow conditions in conjunction with temperature and substrate restoration.  aPublisher supplied data 3afish 3afish communities 3ahydrology 3alandscapes 3amicrohabitats 3anests 3arivers 3astructural equation modeling 3atemperature 3aTennessee River 3aUnited States1 aPeoples, Brandon K.1 aOrth, Donald J.1 aDolloff, Charles A.1 aMatthews, David C.0 tCanadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences.g2015 July 7, v. 72, no. 11 p.1731-1748dNRC Research Pressx1205-75337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2015-02273Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle02579naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245016400164520158600328592002801914650000801942650002001950650003001970650001702000650002102017650002302038700001802061773012102079856008002200852000902280655001202289IND60780859620221118215502.0220623e20220617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078085962DNAL7 a10.3390/biology110609282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanaka, Seiji 10aDimerization of Firing Factors for Replication Origin Activation in Eukaryotes: A Crucial Process for Simultaneous Assembly of Bidirectional Replication Forks?  aControlling the activity of the heterohexameric Mcm2–7 replicative helicase is crucial for regulation of replication origin activity in eukaryotes. Because bidirectional replication forks are generated from every replication origin, when origins are licensed for replication in the first step of DNA replication, two inactive Mcm2–7 heterohexiameric complexes are loaded around double stranded DNA as a head-to-head double hexamer. The helicases are subsequently activated via a ‘firing’ reaction, in which the Mcm2–7 double hexamer is converted into two active helicase units, the CMG complex, by firing factors. Dimerization of firing factors may contribute to this process by allowing simultaneous activation of two sets of helicases and thus efficient assembly of bidirectional replication forks. An example of this is dimerization of the firing factor Sld3/Treslin/Ticrr via its binding partner, Sld7/MTBP. In organisms in which no Sld7 ortholog has been identified, such as the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Sld3 itself has a dimerization domain, and it has been suggested that this self-interaction is crucial for the firing reaction in this organism. Dimerization induces a conformational change in Sdl3 that appears to be critical for the firing reaction. Moreover, Mcm10 also seems to be regulated by self-interaction in yeasts. Although it is not yet clear to what extent dimerization of firing factors contributes to the firing reaction in eukaryotes, we discuss the possible roles of firing factor dimerization in simultaneous helicase activation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA replication 3aSchizosaccharomyces pombe 3adimerization 3aeukaryotic cells 3areplication origin1 aOgawa, Shiho 0 tBiology.g2022 June 17, v. 11, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology110609283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02263naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245013700165300001800302520110500320592002801425650001401453650000901467650001501476650003001491650001401521650001901535650001301554650001501567650000901582650001901591651001301610700002001623700002401643773013401667856007901801852000901880655001201889IND60515815720221121035809.0160320e20150727xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051581572DNAL7 a10.1139/cjfas-2015-03072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaoult, Vincent10aNot all sawsharks are equal: species of co-existing sawsharks show plasticity in trophic consumption both within and between species  ap. 1769-1775.  aDespite the global distribution of sawsharks, little is known about their diets or their role in the marine biosphere. As species in higher trophic positions are generally considered to be more at risk to perturbations such as fishing, understanding their role in the food chain will enable better conservation and management strategies for these species. Two sawshark species (Pristiophorus cirratus, Pristiophorus nudipinnis) co-occur in waters off east Tasmania, Australia. This study determined the trophic positions of these sawsharks and whether they avoided competing with each other through resource partitioning. Isotopic analysis of muscle tissue revealed that P.cirratus and P.nudipinnis had significantly different trophic levels, with P.cirratus likely to have a diet of primary consumers and P.nudipinnis likely to have a piscivorous diet. Owing to their different isotopic signatures, it is also likely that the sawshark rostrum has multiple functions. Both species shifted to higher trophic levels during ontogeny. Maternal isotopic signatures were detectable in P.cirratus juveniles.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosphere 3adiet 3afood chain 3ageographical distribution 3ajuveniles 3amuscle tissues 3aontogeny 3apiscivores 3arisk 3atrophic levels 3aTasmania1 aGaston, Troy F.1 aWilliamson, Jane E.0 tCanadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences.g2015 July 27, v. 72, no. 11 p.1769-1775dNRC Research Pressx1205-75337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2015-03073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03525naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245011700184300001600301520237700317592002802694650001602722650001102738650001602749650001702765650003102782650001502813650001302828650001402841650001202855650001702867650002202884651001402906700002202920773010702942856008103049852000903130655001203139IND50073749620221121050822.0150213e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007374962DNAL7 a239797222pmid7 a10.1007/s10695-013-9846-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStewart, John10aSwim bladder function and buoyancy control in pink snapper (Pagrus auratus) and mulloway (Argyrosomus japonicus)  ap. 335-346.  aPhysoclist fish are able to regulate their buoyancy by secreting gas into their hydrostatic organ, the swim bladder, as they descend through the water column and by resorbing gas from their swim bladder as they ascend. Physoclists are restricted in their vertical movements due to increases in swim bladder gas volume that occur as a result of a reduction in hydrostatic pressure, causing fish to become positively buoyant and risking swim bladder rupture. Buoyancy control, rates of swim bladder gas exchange and restrictions to vertical movements are little understood in marine teleosts. We used custom-built hyperbaric chambers and laboratory experiments to examine these aspects of physiology for two important fishing target species in southern Australia, pink snapper (Pagrus auratus) and mulloway (Argyrosomus japonicus). The swim bladders of pink snapper and mulloway averaged 4.2 and 4.9 % of their total body volumes, respectively. The density of pink snapper was not significantly different to the density of seawater (1.026 g/ml), whereas mulloway were significantly denser than seawater. Pink snapper secreted gas into their swim bladders at a rate of 0.027 ± 0.005 ml/kg/min (mean ± SE), almost 4 times faster than mulloway (0.007 ± 0.001 ml/kg/min). Rates of swim bladder gas resorption were 11 and 6 times faster than the rates of gas secretion for pink snapper and mulloway, respectively. Pink snapper resorbed swim bladder gas at a rate of 0.309 ± 0.069 ml/kg/min, 7 times faster than mulloway (0.044 ± 0.009 ml/kg/min). Rates of gas exchange were not affected by water pressure or water temperature over the ranges examined in either species. Pink snapper were able to acclimate to changes in hydrostatic pressure reasonably quickly when compared to other marine teleosts, taking approximately 27 h to refill their swim bladders from empty. Mulloway were able to acclimate at a much slower rate, taking approximately 99 h to refill their swim bladders. We estimated that the swim bladders of pink snapper and mulloway ruptured after decreases in ~2.5 and 2.75 times the hydrostatic pressure to which the fish were acclimated, respectively. Differences in buoyancy, gas exchange rates, limitations to vertical movements and acclimation times between the two species are discussed in terms of their differing behaviour and ecology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArgyrosomus 3aPagrus 3aacclimation 3agas exchange 3alaboratory experimentation 3aresorption 3aseawater 3asecretion 3asnapper 3aswim bladder 3awater temperature 3aAustralia1 aHughes, Julian M.0 tFish physiology and biochemistry.g2014 Apr., v. 40, no. 2 p.335-346dSpringer-Verlagx0920-17427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10695-013-9846-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02788naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002300153245012000176300001400296520167900310592002801989653001302017653001902030653002102049653001402070653002002084653001602104700001902120700002302139700002302162700002402185700002502209773010802234856008702342852000902429655001202438IND60596323120221120135746.0180618e20170815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059632312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quascirev.2017.06.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLasher, G. Everett10aHolocene temperatures and isotopes of precipitation in Northwest Greenland recorded in lacustrine organic materials  ap. 45-55.  aReconstructions of Holocene lake water isotopic composition based upon subfossil aquatic organic material offer new insights into Arctic climate. We present quantitative estimates of warmth during the Holocene Thermal Maximum in northwest Greenland, inferred from oxygen isotopes of chironomid head capsules and aquatic moss preserved in lake sediments. δ¹⁸O values of chironomids from surface sediments of multiple Greenland lakes indicate that these subfossil remains record the δ¹⁸O values of the lake water in which they grow. Our lake water δ¹⁸O reconstruction is supported by downcore agreement with δ¹⁸O values in aquatic moss and chironomid remains. δ¹⁸O of both organic materials from Secret Lake decrease after 4 ka (ka = thousands of years ago) by 3‰ into the Neoglacial. We argue that lake water at Secret Lake primarily reflects precipitation δ¹⁸O values, which is strongly correlated with air temperature in NW Greenland, and that this signal is biased towards summer and early autumn conditions. Other factors may have influenced Secret Lake δ¹⁸O values through the Holocene, including evaporation of lake water and changing seasonality and source of precipitation. The maximum early Holocene summer and early autumn-biased temperature anomaly at Secret Lake is 2.5–4 °C warmer than present from 7.7 (the beginning of our record) to ∼6 ka. The maximum late Holocene cold anomaly (which includes the Little Ice Age) is 1.5–3 °C colder than present. These ranges of possible temperature anomalies reflect uncertainty in the δ¹⁸O – temperature relationship for precipitation at the study site through the Holocene.  aPublisher supplied data 0aHolocene 0aPaleolimnology 0aPaleoclimatology 0aGreenland 0aStable isotopes 0aChironomids1 aAxford, Yarrow1 aMcFarlin, Jamie M.1 aKelly, Meredith A.1 aOsterberg, Erich C.1 aBerkelhammer, Max B.0 tQuaternary science reviews.g2017 Aug. 15, v. 170 p.45-55dElsevier LtdwJournal:26797x0277-37917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2017.06.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02452naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245016600165520103700331592002801368650001101396650001701407650001901424650001401443650002001457650001701477650002501494650001501519650002201534650002401556650001401580650001301594650001201607650002401619651001201643653002501655653000801680653002001688653002301708653001201731700002301743700002101766773010301787856008301890852000901973655001201982IND60666138420221120052617.0200128e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066613842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agsy.2019.1026832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSon, Ho Ngoc10aIndigenous knowledge and climate change adaptation of ethnic minorities in the mountainous regions of Vietnam: A case study of the Yao people in Bac Kan Province  aThis study focuses on the accumulated indigenous knowledge of the Yao ethnic minority in Bac Kan Province of Vietnam.

Data for this study was collected through surveys, interviews, and focus group discussions to gather indigenous knowledge on native crop varieties and animal breeds, weather forecasting, and the timing and location of cultivation practices. In so doing, this study documents unique examples of how indigenous knowledge is being used alone and blended with scientific knowledge to make accurate decisions and help local communities adapt to climate change.

The main purpose of this study was to investigate the changes of aggregates due to drying with shear stress and the effects on the adsorption of P onto air-dried sediments under different shear rates after re-wetting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sediment samples were collected from an alluvial river. Fine wet sediments (<31 μm) were wet-sieved and air-dried, and some air-dried sediments were further sonicated and served as the control. The grain size distribution of the three sediment samples (wet, dried, and sonicated) was measured to evaluate the particle aggregation level. The P sorption capacity of wet and dried sediments was determined by batch equilibrium experiments. The change of aggregate size with shear stress was investigated for dried and sonicated sediments. Sorption equilibrium experiments were performed to investigate the effect of shear stress on the P sorption with and without change of particle aggregation level, respectively. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Fine particles agglomerated into larger aggregates during the drying process, resulting in a significant increase in the aggregate size. The sorption capacity was lower in aggregated sediment than in original wet sediment. Aggregate size in dried sediment decreased with the increase of shear rate, leading to an increase in the surface area and available adsorption sites, whereas the particle size of sonicated sediment was hardly affected. Accordingly, the P sorption amount of dried sediment increased with increasing shear rate, whereas that of sonicated sediment showed no significant change with shear rate after all sediments were suspended. There was a significant curvilinear correlation between aggregate size and P sorption amount for dried sediments, thus indicating that the P sorption amount increased significantly with decreasing aggregate size. CONCLUSIONS: Sediment aggregation is an important factor affecting P adsorption besides the amount of suspended sediments and the exchange between suspended and bed sediments under dynamic conditions. The P equilibrium adsorption amount increases with shear stress for air-dried sediment. The effect of particle aggregation on the amount of P sorbed onto sediments should not be ignored, and thus, more attention should be paid to the pretreatment of sediment samples in the sorption experiments under dynamic conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aair drying 3aparticle size 3aparticle size distribution 3aphosphorus 3arivers 3asediments 3ashear stress 3asurface area 3asuspended sediment1 aLi, Qingxia1 aYuan, Saiyu1 aLi, Zhiwei0 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2017 Aug., v. 17, no. 8 p.2177-2186dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1439-01087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-017-1681-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02240naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005600152245010200208300001400310520074200324592002801066650002601094650001501120650002001135650001701155650002701172650002801199650002301227650000901250650001201259650002401271650001501295650001601310650001701326651001001343653003301353653001701386653001301403653002101416653001001437653001601447700001901463700001701482700005801499773009301557856008701650852000901737655001201746IND60526592820221123034056.0190408e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052659282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2015.07.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbabio, P.F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5123-929810aEffect of good hygiene practices intervention on food safety in senior secondary schools in Ghana  ap. 18-24.  aEleven schools in three different hygiene categories were given hygiene training as an intervention to reported low hygiene standards.

After modified by the inclusion of two envelope proteins (VP19 and VP28) of shrimp white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) into the envelope of the packaged lentivirus, and insertion of a truncated promoter of immediate-early gene 1 (Pᵢₑ₁₋₅₀₄) of shrimp WSSV virus into the lentiviral reporter plasmid, the second-generation lentiviral expression system (pLVX-PEF₁α-IRES-mCherry, psPAX2, and PMD2.G) was found to behave better in the mitosis-arrested shrimp cells than the similarly modified retrovirus expression system did. Results from the insect sf9 cells indicated that the inclusion of VP19 and VP28 into the envelope of packaged lentiviruses could significantly improve the tropism or infectivity of the modified lentiviruses to insect cells in a cumulative way. Notably, the VP28 contributed about 86% of the total increase of the tropism. In the shrimp primary lymphoid cells infected by modified lentivirus IV with both VP19 and VP28 included, the infection efficiency was up to 11% (non-confocal) and 19% (confocal) and no background fluorescent signal was observed. However, background fluorescent signal was observed in the shrimp primary Oka organ cells although only under a confocal microscope. In the lentivirus IV-infected Oka organ cells, the actual infection efficiencies were calculated up to 8% (non-confocal) and 19% (confocal), significantly higher than those of commercial intact lentivirus I of 0 (non-confocal) and 3% (confocal). The insertion of WSSV promoter (Pᵢₑ₁₋₅₀₄) had interrupted the effective expression of reporter plasmid encoding lentiviral construct of pLVX-PEF₁α-Pᵢₑ₁₋₅₀₄-IRES-mCherry in the HEK293T cells, but markedly increased its efficiencies up to 14% (non-confocal) and 26% (confocal) in the Oka organ cells. This improved lentivirus expression system will provide us a useful tool for efficient gene transfer and expression in shrimp cells.  aPublisher supplied data  a31472274 and 31172391cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a201822018 and 201762003cFundamental Research Funds for Central Universities (China) 3aLentivirus 3aPenaeidae 3aWhite spot syndrome virus 3afluorescence 3agene transfer 3agenes 3ainsects 3alymphocytes 3apathogenicity 3aplasmids 3aproteins 3ashrimp 3aviruses1 aChen, Yueru1 aShen, Xiaotong1 aZuo, Jianwei1 aGuo, Huarong0 tMarine biotechnology.g2019 Feb., v. 21, no. 1 p.9-18dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3870069x1436-22287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10126-018-9862-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03038naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002900148245013700177300001400314520122400328592002801552650001501580650002701595650002801622650002201650650001401672650001601686650001501702650002901717650002101746650001201767650002201779650002101801650002501822650001801847650001101865650001201876650001701888650003201905653002101937653001701958653001801975653001801993653003602011700001902047700002002066700002202086700001902108700002302127700002502150700001702175700002402192700001902216773010902235856008302344852000902427655001202436IND60570735120221120090041.0180831e20171115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057073512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2017.05.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález-Arribas, Elena10aTransparent, mediator- and membrane-free enzymatic fuel cell based on nanostructured chemically modified indium tin oxide electrodes  ap. 46-52.  aWe detail a mediator- and membrane-free enzymatic glucose/oxygen biofuel cell based on transparent and nanostructured conducting supports. Chemically modified indium tin oxide nanoparticle modified electrodes were used to substantially increase the active surface area without significantly compromising transparency. Two different procedures for surface nanostructuring were employed, viz. spray-coating and drop-coating. The spray-coated biodevice showed superior characteristics as compared to the drop-coated enzymatic fuel cell, as a result of the higher nanostructured surface area as confirmed by electrochemical characterisation, as well as scanning electron and atomic force microscopy. Subsequent chemical modification with silanes, followed by the immobilisation of either cellobiose dehydrogenase from Corynascus thermophiles or bilirubin oxidase from Myrothecium verrucaria, were performed to obtain the bioanodes and biocathodes, respectively. The optimised biodevice exhibited an OCV of 0.67V and power output of up to 1.4µW/cm² at an operating voltage of 0.35V. This is considered a significant step forward in the field of glucose/oxygen membrane- and mediator-free, transparent enzymatic fuel cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorynascus 3aMyrothecium verrucaria 3aatomic force microscopy 3abilirubin oxidase 3abioanodes 3abiocathodes 3abiosensors 3acellobiose dehydrogenase 3aelectrochemistry 3aglucose 3aimmobilized cells 3aindium tin oxide 3amicrobial fuel cells 3ananoparticles 3aoxygen 3asilanes 3asurface area 3athermophilic microorganisms 0aIndium tin oxide 0aNanoparticle 0aMembrane-free 0aMediator-free 0aTransparent enzymatic fuel cell1 aBobrowski, Tim1 aDi Bari, Chiara1 aSliozberg, Kirill1 aLudwig, Roland1 aToscano, Miguel D.1 aDe Lacey, Antonio L.1 aPita, Marcos1 aSchuhmann, Wolfgang1 aShleev, Sergey0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2017 Nov. 15, v. 97 p.46-52dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2017.05.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03429naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245016900168520172300337592002802060650002102088650004402109650002702153650002902180650001902209650002602228650002302254650001802277650001902295650001002314650001702324650001402341650003302355650002002388650001402408650001202422650001802434650001602452653002102468653001702489653002002506653001902526653002202545653001402567700002502581700002502606700006202631773011102693856008602804852000902890655001202899IND60677294520221119221947.0200128e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067729452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2019.1087912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlves, Diana10aEntrapment of a phage cocktail and cinnamaldehyde on sodium alginate emulsion-based films to fight food contamination by Escherichia coli and Salmonella Enteritidis  aNotwithstanding the implementation of good processing practices in food companies and appropriate washing of food products by the consumer, Salmonella and Escherichia coli outbreaks continue to occur. In this study, different combinations of bacteriophages (phages) and cinnamaldehyde (CNMA) were incorporated on sodium alginate emulsion-based films to impart them with antimicrobial activity towards S. Enteritidis and E. coli. Films were prepared by casting and they were characterized in terms of CNMA and/or phages loading, thickness, moisture content, water vapor permeability (WVP), swelling index (SW), chemical interactions by FTIR, surface morphology by SEM and antimicrobial performance. Results showed that phages incorporation was not compromised by CNMA as evidenced by their viability inside the films. Increasing CNMA concentration yielded formulations less heterogeneous and a higher amount of CNMA loaded. Films characterization revealed that, in general, phages incorporation did not introduce significant changes on films parameters while the presence of CNMA increased the roughness, thickness and swelling ability of films. Sodium alginate films incorporated with EC4 and φ135 phages displayed antimicrobial activity against E. coli and S. Enteritidis, respectively, while CNMA empowered the films with activity against both species. Combination of both phages with the higher concentration of CNMA resulted in a synergic antimicrobial effect against E. coli and a facilitative effect against Salmonella. Overall, incorporation of EC4 and φ135 phages together with CNMA on alginate emulsion-based films holds great potential to be further applied in food packaging to prevent food contamination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aSalmonella Enteritidis 3aantimicrobial properties 3abacteriophages 3achemical interactions 3afood contamination 3afood industry 3afood packaging 3afoods 3apermeability 3aroughness 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asodium alginate 3aviability 3awashing 3awater content 3awater vapor 0aActive packaging 0aEdible films 0aPhages cocktail 0aCinnamaldehyde 0aFoodborne illness 0aSynergism1 aCerqueira, Miguel A.1 aPastrana, Lorenzo M.1 aSillankorva, Sanna1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6614-39420 tFood research international.g2020 Feb., v. 128 p.108791-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2019.1087913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03063naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005500151245015100206520136600357592002801723650001701751650001801768650001601786650001801802650002301820650001801843650001701861650001301878650001001891650001801901650002001919650002101939650001601960650002601976650001902002650002802021650001002049650001802059650003102077653002502108653001702133653001502150653001402165700002102179700001802200700001502218700002202233700006002255773011102315856008602426852000902512655001202521IND60677294620221119222014.0200210e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067729462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2019.1087932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVossen, Els1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7212-356610aRed and processed meat consumption within two different dietary patterns: Effect on the colon microbial community and volatile metabolites in pigs  aPigs were fed either red and processed meat or chicken meat within either a prudent or a Western dietary pattern for four weeks (2 × 2 full factorial design).

In addition, it is plausible that an imbalance in redox markers can be associated with pain amplification and dynapenia in FM patients. The aim of our study was to investigate possible factors associated with muscle pain and lean body mass in FM patients. (2) Methods: This was a quantitative, exploratory and cross-sectional study of 47 patients with FM (53.45 + 7.32 years). We evaluated self-perceptions of muscle pain, lean body mass, body composition, quality of life, sleep quality, depression index, muscle performance and oxidative stress biomarkers. (3) Results: We observed that lower blood levels of antioxidants and poor quality of life explained 21% of the greater muscle pain. In addition, high blood levels of oxidative stress, worse muscle performance and poor quality of life explained 27% of the lower lean mass in patients with FM. (4) Conclusions: Larger amounts of lipid peroxidation and reductions in antioxidant levels, in addition to lower muscle performance and poor life quality, are possible independent contributors to greater muscle pain and lower lean body mass in FM patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3abiomarkers 3ablood 3across-sectional studies 3alean body mass 3alipid peroxidation 3amuscles 3aoxidative stress 3aoxygen 3apain 3aquality of life 3asleep1 aRodrigues Lacerda, Ana Cristina1 aRibeiro, Vanessa Gonçalves César1 aScheidt Figueiredo, Pedro Henrique1 aFonseca, Sueli Ferreira1 ada Silva Lage, Vanessa Kelly1 aCosta, Henrique Silveira1 aPereira Lima, Vanessa 1 aSañudo, Borja 1 aBernardo-Filho, Mario,1 ada Cunha de Sá Caputo, Danúbia 1 aMendonça, Vanessa Amaral1 aTaiar, Redha 0 tBiology.g2022 June 19, v. 11, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology110609353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02823naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002900152245011700181520105500298592002801353650002401381650002501405650003901430650001101469650001801480650000701498650002501505650001101530650002001541650001801561650001601579650001901595650001701614653003401631653003701665653003401702653003601736653004001772653004501812653002201857653003001879653002201909653002101931700002001952700003101972700002602003700003502029700003102064773009002095856008702185852000902272655001202281IND60666138720221120052540.0190913e20200201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066613872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.1254632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaiva, Paulo Henrique C.10aInfluence of protein conformation and selected Hofmeister salts on bovine serum albumin/lutein complex formation  aProtein conformation and the 3D water structure play important roles in the ability of bovine serum albumin (BSA) to form stable nanostructures with bioactive molecules. We studied the influence of BSA unfolding and those of two Hofmeister salts, sodium chloride (NaCl) as kosmotrope and sodium thiocyanate (NaSCN) as chaotrope, on BSA/lutein binding at pH 7.4 using fluorescence spectroscopy. The BSA/lutein complex formation was entropically driven and lutein was preferentially bound to site III of BSA. The binding constant (104 L mol−1), complex stoichiometry (1:1), and thermodynamic potential for BSA/lutein binding were independent of protein conformation and Hofmeister salts. However, the enthalpic and entropic components of BSA/lutein binding in the presence of NaSCN decreased as the temperature increased. The opposite was observed for BSA/lutein binding in the presence of NaCl and for denatured BSA/lutein binding. Therefore, the BSA conformation and 3D water structure directly affected the BSA/lutein binding thermodynamics.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive compounds 3abovine serum albumin 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3alutein 3ananomaterials 3apH 3aprotein conformation 3asodium 3asodium chloride 3astoichiometry 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 3athiocyanates 0aLutein (PubChem CID: 5281243) 0aWarfarin (PubChem CID: 54678486) 0aIbuprofen (PubChem CID: 3672) 0aDigitoxin (PubChem CID: 441207) 0aSodium chloride (PubChem CID: 5234) 0aSodium thiocyanate (PubChem CID: 516871) 0aComplex formation 0aFluorescence spectroscopy 0aProtein unfolding 0aHofmeister salts1 aCoelho, Yara L.1 ada Silva, Luis Henrique M.1 aPinto, Maximiliano S.1 aVidigal, Márcia Cristina T.R.1 aPires, Ana Clarissa dos S.0 tFood chemistry.g2020 Feb. 01, v. 305dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.1254633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02357naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001900171245008000190300001600270520099600286592002801282650001201310650002501322650001601347650001901363650001501382650001201397650001201409650002601421650003801447650000901485650001101494650002201505650003701527650003601564650005101600650001401651650004301665700002101708773011801729856005501847852000901902655001201911IND4485972120221121040458.0120302e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448597212DNAL7 a220774112pmid7 a10.1111/j.1476-5829.2011.00268.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzczubiał, M.10aPrognostic value of regional lymph node status in canine mammary carcinomas  ap. 296-303.  aIn this study, we have determined the prognostic value of the presence of the micrometastases and metastases greater than 2 mm in the regional lymph nodes for bitches with mammary carcinomas.

All animals underwent regional mastectomy; the 4th and 5th mammary glands were removed together with the inguinal lymph node. The lymph nodes were examined immunohistochemically using the anti‐cytokeratin antibody, clone AE1/AE3. The bitches were followed up every 6 months for 2 years after surgery to determine the disease‐free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). The Kaplan–Meier analysis showed a statistically significant difference in DFS and OS only between the group of bitches without metastases and the group with lymph node metastases greater than 2 mm. No significant differences between these two groups versus bitches with lymph node micrometastases were found.  aPublisher supplied data 3abitches 3aimmunohistochemistry 3alymph nodes 3amammary glands 3ametastasis 3asurgery 2aAnimals 2aDisease-Free Survival 2aDog Diseasesxpathologyxsurgery. 2aDogs 2aFemale 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aImmunohistochemistryxveterinary 2aLymphatic Metastasisxdiagnosis 2aMammary Neoplasms, Animalxpathologyxsurgery. 2aPrognosis 2aSentinel Lymph Node Biopsyxveterinary1 aŁopuszynski, W.0 tVeterinary and comparative oncology.g2011 Dec., v. 9, no. 4 p.296-303dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1476-58107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1476-5829.2011.00268.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02653naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245011200174300001600286520136400302592002801666650001601694650002001710650002001730650001701750653001301767653002301780653002301803653003001826653002601856653002201882700006101904700002301965700006401988700002002052773010002072856008602172852000902258655001202267IND60556340320221122012022.0200711e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055634032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2016.09.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArvidsson, Lisa K.10aExploration behaviour in a different light: testing cross-context consistency of a common personality trait  ap. 151-158.  aLaboratory measures of personality traits are often used to answer both evolutionary and ecological questions involving behavioural variations in the wild within and between populations. However, little is known about the actual behavioural mechanisms behind any correlation with behaviours in the wild, and traits often lack validation in a different context. We examined whether the commonly used exploration behaviour trait constitutes an active exploration strategy, by testing whether the activity in the exploration test could also be captured in a different exploration context. We subjected great tits, Parus major, to two different tests, one being the standardized exploration behaviour test and one a newly constructed test. The new test arena contained eight large rooms connected by corridors, where we scored the activity of individuals and the number of rooms visited as a proxy for exploration. We found that our new exploration test captured repeatable behaviour in activity and exploration of rooms both within and across years. We found no correlations between the two tests, suggesting that they may not capture the same behaviour, in terms of exploration of rooms or activity. We conclude that in our study population, the classic exploration behaviour test seems context specific, rather than constituting a general exploration strategy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParus major 3aanimal behavior 3acaptive animals 3awild animals 0aactivity 0aanimal personality 0acontext validation 0across-context consistency 0aexploration behaviour 0anovel environment1 aAdriaensen, Frank1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5160-03511 avan Dongen, Stefan1 aDe Stobbeleere, Nils1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1870-64691 aMatthysen, Erik0 tAnimal behaviour.g2017 Jan., v. 123 p.151-158dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2016.09.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03008naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245016600163300001600329520155900345592002801904650001501932650001501947650001801962650002401980650001302004650001502017650001802032650001202050650001802062650001402080650001902094653001002113653000902123653001902132653001202151653003802163700001802201700002302219700001702242700001502259700001202274700001302286700001202299773011102311856008302422852000902505655001202514IND60570735420221120100813.0180831e20171115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057073542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2017.05.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Dawei13aAn ultrasensitive photoelectrochemical immunosensor for insulin detection based on BiOBr/Ag2S composite by in-situ growth method with high visible-light activity  ap. 253-259.  aA novel ultrasensitive label-free immunosensor based on BiOBr/Ag2S composite with high visible-light photoelectrochemical activity was prepared for the detection of insulin. After BiOBr was modified by thioglycolic acid, Ag2S nanoparticles were grown in-situ on the surface of BiOBr hierarchical microspheres to first form novel BiOBr/Ag2S composite. When ascorbic acid (AA) was used as an efficient electron donor for scavenging photo-generated holes, BiOBr/Ag2S composite material showed excellent photoelectrochemical activity. In order to immobilize insulin antibody, adhesive polydopamine (PDA) film formed by self-polymerization of dopamine was fabricated onto BiOBr/Ag2S modified electrode. Moreover, PDA film could further enhance the visible light absorption of BiOBr/Ag2S. When the solutions of 0.08molL⁻¹AgNO3 and 0.1molL⁻¹ AA were selected respectively during fabrication and detection process of this sensor, the best photocurrent singles were obtained. Under the optimum experimental condition, the specific binding between insulin and antibody resulted in a decrease in photocurrent intensity and the intensity decreased linearly with the logarithm of insulin concentration in the range of 0.001–20ngmL⁻¹ with a detection limit of 0.2pgmL⁻¹. The photoelectrochemical sensor ITO/BiOBr/Ag2S/PDA/anti-Insulin/BSA/Insulin revealed facile preparation, high sensitivity, and acceptable reproducibility, which may have practical applications in the biosensor, clinical diagnosis of cancers, photocatalysis, and other related fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aantibodies 3aascorbic acid 3acomposite materials 3adopamine 3aelectrodes 3aimmunosensors 3ainsulin 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasms 3aphotocatalysis 0aBiOBr 0aAg2S 0aIn-situ growth 0aInsulin 0aPhotoelectrochemical immunosensor1 aWang, Haoyuan1 aKhan, Malik Saddam1 aBao, Chunzhu1 aWang, Huan1 aWu, Dan1 aWei, Qin1 aDu, Bin0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2017 Nov. 15, v. 97 p.253-259dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2017.05.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03213naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245009200166520207200258592002802330650000802358650001602366650001302382650001502395650001502410650001402425650001102439650004202450651002202492651002902514651001302543700002002556700001902576700003402595773012102629856008002750852000902830655001202839IND60780860320221118214212.0220623e20220619xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078086032DNAL7 a10.3390/biology110609332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGabián, María 10aDetecting Local Adaptation between North and South European Atlantic Salmon Populations  aPollution and other anthropogenic effects have driven a decrease in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in the Iberian Peninsula. The restocking effort carried out in the 1980s, with salmon from northern latitudes with the aim of mitigating the decline of native populations, failed, probably due to the deficiency in adaptation of foreign salmon from northern Europe to the warm waters of the Iberian Peninsula. This result would imply that the Iberian populations of Atlantic salmon have experienced local adaptation in their past evolutionary history, as has been described for other populations of this species and other salmonids. Local adaptation can occur by divergent selections between environments, favoring the fixation of alleles that increase the fitness of a population in the environment it inhabits relative to other alleles favored in another population. In this work, we compared the genomes of different populations from the Iberian Peninsula (Atlantic and Cantabric basins) and Scotland in order to provide tentative evidence of candidate SNPs responsible for the adaptive differences between populations, which may explain the failures of restocking carried out during the 1980s. For this purpose, the samples were genotyped with a 220,000 high-density SNP array (Affymetrix) specific to Atlantic salmon. Our results revealed potential evidence of local adaptation for North Spanish and Scottish populations. As expected, most differences concerned the comparison of the Iberian Peninsula with Scotland, although there were also differences between Atlantic and Cantabric populations. A high proportion of the genes identified are related to development and cellular metabolism, DNA transcription and anatomical structure. A particular SNP was identified within the NADP-dependent malic enzyme-2 (ₘMEP-2*), previously reported by independent studies as a candidate for local adaptation in salmon from the Iberian Peninsula. Interestingly, the corresponding SNP within the ₘMEP-2* region was consistent with a genomic pattern of divergent selection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aSalmo salar 3agenomics 3agenotyping 3ametabolism 3apollution 3asalmon 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism arrays 3aIberian Peninsula 3aNorthern European region 3aScotland1 aMorán, Paloma 1 aSaura, María 1 aCarvajal-Rodríguez, Antonio 0 tBiology.g2022 June 19, v. 11, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology110609333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01849naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245014500165300001600310520081000326592002801136650001501164650001901179650002101198650001401219650001601233650001801249650002001267651001701287700002201304773013701326856005101463852000901514655001201523IND50075152120221120061722.0140410e20120901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007515212DNAL7 a10.1080/07900627.2012.6845272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLibert, Bo10aChallenges and Opportunities for Transboundary Water Cooperation in Central Asia: Findings from UNECE's Regional Assessment and Project Work  ap. 565-576.  aThis paper provides an overview of topical issues and problems related to transboundary water resources in Central Asia and their management in the light of the Second Assessment carried out under the UNECE Water Convention (2009– 2011) as well as experiences from ongoing projects. The conflict between water use for hydropower and for agriculture, land degradation and negatively impacted ecosystems resulting from reduced flows and degraded water quality, poor condition of the hydraulic infrastructure, and the legacy of pollution all have implications for health, economy, and stability in the region.

Parasitism may be an important factor determining the coexistence of closely related species. Although host–parasite interactions can affect the ecology and distribution of the host species, virtually nothing is known about how other interspecific interactions affecting the host, such as competition or predation, relate to the parasite burden of the host. 2. We studied parasite‐mediated competition between two closely related Calopteryx damselflies, C. virgo L. and C. splendens Harris. We investigated a total of 31 populations, including 18 allopatric and 13 sympatric populations. We measured the occurrence of gut parasites, eugregarines. 3. We found that the prevalence of gregarines was higher in C. virgo than in C. splendens. On average, more than half of the C. virgo individuals were infected by eugregarines both in allopatric and sympatric populations. However, hardly any allopatric C. splendens populations had gregarines, but most of sympatric populations had infected individuals. 4. According to our results, co‐existence of the host species affects the likelihood of the subordinate species showing higher levels of parasitism.

A key question is how landscape‐scale livestock disturbance and other local‐scale factors influence BSC communities. We hypothesize that at the landscape scale, increased grazing pressure would lead to decreasing cover of BSC, but at the local scale biotic interactions between BSC and vascular plants would modulate the influence of grazing on BSC. METHODS: Spatially explicit sampling of vegetation composition and cover was conducted using point‐sampling methods in digital images along two disturbance gradients in the central Monte Desert in Argentina. RESULTS: The grazing gradient is the major determinant of changes in the structure of plant communities at the landscape scale. Approximately 1500 to 2000 m from a watering point, there is a threshold in vegetation structure associated with a nonlinear trend of the BSC, herb, grass and shrub cover. Bivariate spatial patterns show attraction between BSC and shrubs in the vicinity of settlements, and repulsion between BSC and both grasses and litter in less disturbed sites. CONCLUSION: Grazing affects BSC directly through trampling and indirectly by altering vascular plant communities that interact with the BSC communities. Both these effects vary according to the spatial scale being considered. The results evidence that understanding of livestock impact in structuring arid ecosystems requires an integrated analysis of BSC and vascular plant communities at different spatial scales.  aPublisher supplied data 3abotanical composition 3adigital images 3aecosystems 3agrasses 3agrazing 3alandscapes 3alivestock 3amonitoring 3aplant communities 3arangelands 3ashrubs 3asoil crusts 3atrampling damage 3avascular plants 3avegetation structure 3aArgentina1 aGaribotti, Irene A.1 aPissolito, Clara1 aAranibar, Julieta N.1 aEjrnæs, Rasmus0 tJournal of vegetation science.g2014 Nov., v. 25, no. 6 p.1417-1425dOpulus PresswJournal:jnl46820x1100-92337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jvs.122043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03246naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002200149245012900171300001600300520185500316592002802171650001302199650001602212650002102228650001102249650001302260650001002273650000902283650000902292650001602301650002602317650001902343650001002362650001402372650001202386650002302398650001202421650002702433700002802460700002002488700002802508700002002536700002402556773009002580856008502670852000902755655001202764IND4464242720221120210003.0141111e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446424272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2012.02.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÃakÄ±r, Esra10aInterrelations among physical characteristics, sensory perception and oral processing of protein-based soft-solid structures  ap. 234-245.  aOral processing is essential in breaking down the physicochemical structure of the food and thus important to the sensory perception of food in the mouth. To have an understanding of protein-based, soft-solid texture perception, a multidisciplinary approach was applied that combined studies of food microstructure with mechanical properties, sensory evaluation, and oral physiology. Model foods were developed by combining ion-induced micro-phase separation and protein-polysaccharide phase separation and inversion. Activities of masseter, anterior temporalis and anterior digastric muscles during oral processing were recorded by electromyography (EMG), while jaw movement amplitudes, durations, and velocities were simultaneously collected by a three-dimensional jaw tracking system (JT-3D). Changes in the microstructure of mixed gels significantly altered the characteristics of the chewing sequence, including the muscle activities, number of chews, chewing duration and chewing frequency. Mechanical attributes related to structural breakdown and sensory perception of firmness were highly correlated with the amount of muscle activity required to transform the initial structure into a bolus ready for swallowing. Chewing frequency was linked to mechanical properties such as recoverable energy, fracture strain and water holding capacity of the gels. Increased adhesiveness and moisture release also resulted in slower chewing frequency. Evaluation of oral processing parameters at various stages (i.e., first cycle, first 5 cycles, and last 3 cycles) was found to be a useful method to investigate the dynamic nature of sensory perception at first bite, during chewing and after swallowing. The study showed that muscle activity and jaw movement can be used to understand the links between physical properties of foods and sensory texture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3adeglutition 3aelectromyography 3aenergy 3afirmness 3afoods 3agels 3ajaws 3amastication 3amechanical properties 3amicrostructure 3amouth 3amouthfeel 3amuscles 3asensory evaluation 3atexture 3awater holding capacity1 aVinyard, Christopher J.1 aEssick, Gregory1 aDaubert, Christopher R.1 aDrake, MaryAnne1 aFoegeding, E.

The material with a Fe : Ce ratio of 1.0 : 0.5 (mol : mol) calcined at 473 K shows 24.8 ± 0.5 mg F⁻ g⁻¹ adsorption capacity at pH 5.0–7.0 from a solution with a concentration of 15.0 mg L⁻¹; the material was established to be microcrystalline (∼5 nm) with a 140.711 m² g⁻¹ surface area, irregular surface morphology and porous structure. The time-dependent fluoride adsorption capacities of CIHFO at 293, 303 and 313 K are well described by the pseudo-first order, pseudo-second order and Weber–Morris kinetic models, respectively. The adsorption reaction occurs via a film/boundary layer diffusion process. The very low Arrhenius activation energy (Eₐ = 0.026 kJ mol⁻¹) indicates the high feasibility of fluoride adsorption over CIHFO. The equilibrium data fit better with the Freundlich and Redlich–Peterson (g < 1.0) isotherms than with the Langmuir isotherm, which suggests multilayer adsorption. The values of the Freundlich parameters, n = 3.10, 4.47 and 7.57 and KF = 8.58, 10.88 and 11.25 at 293, 303 and 313 K, respectively, indicate high affinity for fluoride. Thermodynamic analysis of the reaction equilibrium shows that the reaction is highly exothermic (ΔH⁰ = −25.924 and −36.279 kJ mol⁻¹ for Cᵢ = 25.0 and 35.0 mg L⁻¹), whereas the negative ΔG⁰ values indicate the spontaneous nature of the reaction. The fluoride adsorption over CIHFO occurs via ion-exchange that progresses to chemisorption. The presence of sulphate shows an adverse influence on fluoride adsorption by CIHFO, and the fluoride level of 2.4 g per L groundwater (9.05 mg F L⁻¹) can be reduced below the permissible value.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3acerium 3afluorides 3agroundwater 3aheat production 3aion exchange 3airon 3akinetics 3apH 3asorption isotherms 3asulfates 3asurface area1 aGhosh, Abir1 aDas, Supriyo Kumar1 aShow, Bibhutibhushan1 aSasikumar, Palani1 aChand Ghosh, Uday0 tRSC advances.g2017 May 16, v. 7, no. 42 p.26037-26051dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra00265c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02734naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245006100167300001800228520134800246592002801594650001901622650001401641650001601655650001301671650001601684650001401700650001501714650001101729650001701740650002101757650001401778650000801792650001401800653003401814653003401848653003301882653001301915653003601928700001901964700002101983700002102004773015302025856007702178852000902255655001202264IND60522609420221118055454.0160603e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052260942DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-1979-11302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeierabend, Jürgen10aOn the Action of Chlorosis-Inducing Herbicides in Leaves  ap. 1036-1039.  aThe chlorosis induced by several different herbicides (group 1: aminotriazole, haloxidine; group 2: Sandoz 6706, difunon) in developing leaves of rye seedlings (Secale cereale L.) growing in light of 5,000 lx was, in addition to the absence of chlorophyll and carotenoids, accompanied by specific deficiencies of the 70 S ribosomes and of both chloroplastic and peroxisomal enzymes as previously described (Plant Physiol. 61, 1017 - 1022 (1978)) while growth and mitochondrial activities were little or not impaired. In dim light (10 lx) chlorophyll was formed and the chloroplastic and peroxisomal enzymes reached activities comparable to those in untreated leaves at 10 lx. Upon exposure to 30,000 lx a rapid bleaching of existing chlorophyll and a rapid inactivation of the plastidic enzyme NADP-glyceraldehydephosphate dehydrogenase occured after treatment with herbicides of group 2 but not in the presence of herbicides of group 1. After all treatments catalase was rapidly inactivated after transfer to high light intensity. The bleaching of chlorophyll and the enzyme inactivations occurred also at 0 °C. In the herbicide-bleached leaves grown at 5,000 lx the in vivo synthesis of (δ-aminolevulinic acid was low and in the presence of Sandoz 6706 and difunon the capacity for protochlorophyll (ide) synthesis was largely inactivated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSecale cereale 3ableaching 3acarotenoids 3acatalase 3achlorophyll 3achlorosis 3aherbicides 3aleaves 3amitochondria 3aprotochlorophyll 3aribosomes 3arye 3aseedlings 0aChlorosis-Inducing Herbicides 0aPhotooxidation of Chlorophyll 0aPhotoinactivation of Enzymes 0aCatalase 0aCyanide-Insensitive Respiration1 aSchulz, Ulrike1 aKemmerich, Petra1 aLowitz, Theresia0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 34, no. 11 p.1036-1039dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23183x1865-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znc-1979-11303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04449naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005700149245015000206300001400356520236600370592002802736650002602764650002502790650001702815650001602832650001902848650001702867650002002884650001402904650002802918650001402946650001702960650001802977650001802995650001003013650002403023650001303047650001403060650003403074650002003108650004303128650002503171650001803196650001303214650001803227650003603245653003203281653002503313653001403338653005403352653002703406700001803433700001803451700001203469700001703481700001703498700001903515773017203534856008403706852000903790655001203799IND60762448920221121032732.0220207e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076244892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jtcms.2021.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jinfeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3431-364110aElucidation of the hepatoprotective effect and mechanism of Melastoma dodecandrum Lour. based on network pharmacology and experimental validation  ap. 47-58.  aTo systematically explore the effect and mechanism of melastomatis dodecandri herba (Melastoma dodecandrum Lour.) in the treatment of hepatitis based on network pharmacology. We evaluated the hepatoprotective effects of M. dodecandrum in concanavalin A (Con A)-induced hepatitis in mice by assessing survival rate, histological analysis, serum transaminases, and related cytokines. Then the mechanism of action was predicted by a network pharmacology-based strategy. Based on the results, we measured the hepatic expression of related genes at mRNA level and proteins related to the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-кB) pathways. Our study results clearly demonstrated that M. dodecandrum pretreatment significantly alleviated liver injury. This was demonstrated by an increase in survival rate, decreased severity of liver damage, and reduced serum transaminase levels compared with those in the Con A group. Moreover, M. dodecandrum significantly reduced the serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and interferon-γ and increased the liver levels of superoxide dismutase, which indicated that M. dodecandrum exhibits anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. On the basis of network pharmacology, 50 nodes were selected as major hubs based on their topological importance. Pathway enrichment analyses indicated that the putative targets of M. dodecandrum mostly participate in various pathways associated with the anti-inflammation response, which implies the underlying mechanism by which M. dodecandrum acts on hepatitis. Real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR analysis showed that M. dodecandrum downregulates the mRNA expression of interleukin-6, Toll-like receptor 7, interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-4, NF-кB and tumor necrosis factor-α in liver tissues. Western blotting showed that M. dodecandrum pretreatment protected against inflammation through activating the PI3K-Akt pathway by upregulating phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) expression and suppressing NF-кB activation by inhibiting the phosphorylation of IKK, IκBα, and p65. The present work demonstrated the hepatoprotective effects of M. dodecandrum by regulating the PI3K/Akt and NF-кB pathways in Con A-induced mice, which provide insights into the treatment of hepatitis using M. dodecandrum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMelastoma dodecandrum 3aToll-like receptor 7 3aantioxidants 3ablood serum 3aconcanavalin A 3afluorescence 3agene expression 3ahepatitis 3ahepatoprotective effect 3ahistology 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-1 3ainterleukin-6 3aliver 3amechanism of action 3anecrosis 3aneoplasms 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3aphosphorylation 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asuperoxide dismutase 3asurvival rate 3atopology 3atransaminases 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 0aMelastoma dodecandrum Lour. 0aNetwork pharmacology 0aMechanism 0aPhosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B 0aNuclear factor-kappa B1 aWang, Linyuan1 aZhang, Zhihao1 aWu, Min1 aFei, Wenting1 aYang, Zhihui1 aZhang, Jianjun0 tJournal of traditional Chinese medical sciences.g2022 Jan., v. 9, no. 1 p.47-58dElsevier B.V.aBeijing University of Chinese MedicinewJournal:23382x2095-75487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcms.2021.12.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02679naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100001900171245013800190300001600328520078200344592002801126650001801154650001601172650001301188650002601201650001901227650001501246650001601261650002401277650002301301650001901324650001601343650001801359650001501377650003001392650003401422650003001456650003201486650002401518650003801542650001101580650002601591650004301617653001901660653002601679653002901705653002801734653006501762700002101827700001801848700002101866773010601887856008701993852000902080655001202089IND50060684820221119175353.0190409e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006068482DNAL7 a233340272pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2012.12.0972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aForss, Jörgen10aMicrobial diversity in a continuous system based on rice husks for biodegradation of the azo dyes Reactive Red 2 and Reactive Black 5  ap. 681-688.  aIn the present study the degradation of two common azo dyes used in dye houses today, Reactive Black 5 and Reactive Red 2 was evaluated in biofilters.

Molecular analyses showed a diverse and dynamic bacterial community composition in the bioreactors, including members of the Bacteroidetes, Acinetobacter (Gammaproteobacteria) and Clostridium (Firmicutes) that possess the capacity to reduce azo dyes.

Genotype × year‐interaction (G × Y) is a relevant component of G × E, and accounting for it is an important strategy for identifying lines with stable and superior performance across years. In this study, we compared the prediction accuracy of modeling G × Y using covariance structures that differ in their ability to accommodate correlation among environments. We present the use of these approaches in two different rice (Oryza sativa L.) breeding populations (indica and tropical japonica) for predicting grain yield, plant height, and three milling quality traits—milling yield, head rice percentage, and grain chalkiness—under different cross‐validation (CV) scenarios. We also compared model performance in the context of global predictions (i.e., predictions across years). Most of the benefits of multienvironment models come from modeling genetic correlations between environments when predicting performance of lines that have been tested in some environments but not others (CV2). For predicting the performance of newly developed lines (CV1), modeling between environment correlations has no effect compared with considering environments independently. Response to selection of multienvironment models when modeling covariance structures that accommodate covariances between environments was always beneficial when predicting the performance of lines across years. We also show that, for some traits, high prediction accuracies can be obtained in untested years, which is important for resource allocation in small breeding programs.  aPublisher supplied data  cINIA  cFulbright Commission  cUruguayan Research and Innovation Agency (ANII) 3aOryza sativa 3acovariance 3agenotype 3agenotype-environment interaction 3agrain yield 3amodel validation 3aplant height 3aprediction 3aresource allocation 3arice1 aRosas, Juan E.1 aBlanco, Pedro1 aPérez de Vida, Fernando1 aBonnecarrère, Victoria1 aQuero, Gastón1 aGutierrez, Lucía1 aMcCouch, Susan0 tCrop science.g2018 July, v. 58, no. 4 p.1519-1530dThe Crop Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2017.09.05643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02823naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005300149245012700202300001400329520138000343592002801723650002001751650002301771650002401794650002001818650002001838650001601858653003501874653002001909653001801929653001801947653002001965653002201985653002302007653001902030700001602049700001802065700005302083773017202136856008402308852000902392655001202401IND60762449020221121043439.0220207e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076244902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jtcms.2021.12.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Suqin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4277-530910aEffects of Lycium barbarum polysaccharides on the proliferation and differentiation of primary Sertoli cells in young rats  ap. 78-84.  aSertoli cells (SCs) provide physical support and material supply for germ cells and participate in the formation of blood-testis barrier. The number of SCs is directly proportional to the number of germ cells. And mature SCs ensure the growth of germ cells and the production of sperm. In this study, we explored the effect and underlying mechanism of Lycium barbarum polysaccharides (LBP) on primary SCs in young rats. Primary SCs were isolated from the testis of 20-day old rats. The cells were then treated with different concentrations of LBP. Immunocytochemistry was used to detect the expression of Ki67 and the androgen receptor (AR), and western blotting was used to detect the expression of cytokeratin-18 (CK-18), AR and phosphorylated Akt (Ser473) in SCs. The number of SCs increased significantly after LBP treatment, and the 100 mg/mL. LBP group had 14% more cells than the control group. The expression of Ki67 in LBP treated groups also increased significantly. LBP inhibited the expression of cytokeratin 18 in SCs. Besides, LBP increased the expression of AR on SCs and promoted the activation of Akt at the ser473 phosphorylation site. LBP promotes the proliferation of immature SCs in young rats and also accelerates their differentiation and maturation. This seems to be associated with activation of the Akt signaling pathway via up-regulation of AR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLycium barbarum 3aandrogen receptors 3aimmunocytochemistry 3aphosphorylation 3apolysaccharides 3aspermatozoa 0aLycium barbarum polysaccharide 0aSpermatogenesis 0aSertoli cells 0aProliferation 0aDifferentiation 0aAndrogen receptor 0aPhosphorylated-Akt 0aMale fertility1 aLi, Chunrui1 aLiu, Dianlong1 aGuo, Jian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5941-58200 tJournal of traditional Chinese medical sciences.g2022 Jan., v. 9, no. 1 p.78-84dElsevier B.V.aBeijing University of Chinese MedicinewJournal:23382x2095-75487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcms.2021.12.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03205naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245019200166300002000358520166700378592002802045650004402073650002202117650002202139650002002161650001302181650003702194650000902231650001502240650001102255650001802266650001102284650003102295650002002326650003102346650003302377650002002410650002102430650003702451650000902488700001602497700001502513773012302528856007502651852000902726655001202735IND60641541720221117231954.0220513e20170519xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064154172DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra00272f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarzpour Shalmani, F.10aPhysicochemical characterization to assess Ni and Zn incorporation into zeotype SAPO-34 nanoparticles synthesized with different mixing methods through ultrasound-promoted crystallization  ap. 26756-26769.  aThe synthesis of transition metal (Me = Ni and Zn) containing SAPO-34 nanoparticles was conducted by applying insonation as the precrystallization treatment. The effects of synthesis parameters on the properties of SAPO-34 products and their derivatives in terms of the crystallinity, size and morphology of particles, structure and hydroxyl functional groups, and stereochemistry of metal ions were investigated to elucidate how the isomorphous substitution or the mere presence of transition metal ions was influenced by the crystallization treatment, mixing method, or the amount and type of metal species. The physicochemical properties of the prepared samples were characterized by various techniques including XRD, SEM, TEM, EDX, UV-Vis DRS, FTIR, and TGA. The results indicated that sonochemically prepared SAPO-34 samples possessed higher crystallinity and uniform crystals with narrow particle size distribution. The nature of the metal species could affect the physicochemical properties of the synthesized samples and Zn-doped SAPO-34 samples showed a lower crystallinity, larger unit cell parameters, and more uniform crystals. Also, it was found that the significant variations in the morphology, size, and uniformity of the metal-doped SAPO-34 crystals were acquired based on the different mixing methods. Meanwhile, the mixing methods played a key role in the incorporation of metal ions into the SAPO-34 framework, and mixing method (II), in which the metal sources were added to the precursor gel prior to the addition of the phosphoric acid, had prominent capability to locate the metal ions, in particular nickel ions, in the SAPO-34 skeleton.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3acrystal structure 3acrystallization 3acrystals 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3agels 3ametal ions 3amixing 3ananoparticles 3anickel 3aparticle size distribution 3aphosphoric acid 3aphysicochemical properties 3ascanning electron microscopy 3astereochemistry 3athermogravimetry 3atransmission electron microscopy 3azinc1 aHalladj, R.1 aAskari, S.0 tRSC advances.g2017 May 19, v. 7, no. 43 p.26756-26769dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra00272f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01836naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245008500170300001600255520092600271592002801197650001501225650001901240650001301259650001801272650001701290650002001307651001101327773013601338856005101474852000901525655001201534IND50075152820221120061810.0140410e20121201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007515282DNAL7 a10.1080/07900627.2012.6851262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPierce, Gregory14aThe Political Economy of Water Service Privatization in Mexico City, 1994–2011  ap. 675-691.  aThis paper chronicles the implementation of water service privatization to combat severe water shortage in Mexico City, also known as the Distrito Federal (DF), from 1994 to 2011. Initially, the DF's administration successfully employed private actors to provide more extensive and efficient service while retaining public control of infrastructure. Privatization in the DF was unique in its competitive service structure and the support provided it by the city's populist government. However, political manoeuvring stalled progress in contract governance, network extension, and regional coordination, suggesting the need for more robust accountability structures linking municipal and national political outcomes to household service delivery. An improved theoretical understanding of how stakeholders can collectively manage common pool resources in the urban environments of middle-income countries is also essential.  aPublisher supplied data 3agovernance 3ainfrastructure 3apolitics 3aprivatization 3astakeholders 3awater shortages 3aMexico0 tInternational journal of water resources development.g2012 Dec. 1, v. 28, no. 4 p.675-691dTaylor & Francis Groupx1360-06487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07900627.2012.685126  aDNAL 7aarticle01957naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002400142245007800166300001400244520082300258592002801081650001301109650001901122650001401141650001301155650002301168650001601191650001201207650001301219651001501232651001201247653002601259653002601285653001701311700002101328773013501349856007801484852000901562655001201571IND60124896420221118054324.0151029e200107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012489642DNAL7 a10.3161/068.036.01022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGallo-Orsi, Umberto14aThe Slender-billed Curlew Numenius tenuirostris: Threats and Conservation  ap. 73-77.  aWith a population of probably less than 50 individuals, the Slender-billed Curlew is one of the most seriously endangered species in Europe. The scarcity of information on its biology and the fact that its breeding grounds are still unknown are major constraints on its conservation. This paper presents the activities of the Working Group established under the Bonn Convention. Recent intensive efforts to locate breeding areas are described. All records are kept in a specific BirdLife International database. Although hunting is considered to have been the major reason for the species' dramatic decline and is still an important threat, overgrazing of steppes and drainage of wetlands in northern Kazakhstan and south-western Siberia have caused the loss of a number of possible breeding sites recently identified.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNumenius 3abreeding sites 3adatabases 3adrainage 3aendangered species 3aovergrazing 3asteppes 3awetlands 3aKazakhstan 3aSiberia 0aSlender-billed Curlew 0aNumenius tenuirostris 0aconservation1 aBoere, Gerard C.0 tActa ornithologica.g2001 July, v. 36, no. 1 p.73-77dMuseum and Institute of Zoology, Polish Academy of Sciencesx0001-64547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3161%2F068.036.01023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01854naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245006700170300001600237520076600253592002801019650001401047650001601061650001101077650001201088650001301100650002901113650001501142650001101157650002201168650001401190650002101204650001701225650002001242651001001262773013601272856005101408852000901459655001201468IND50075152920221120061711.0140410e20121201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007515292DNAL7 a10.1080/07900627.2012.6941492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIslam, Shahnila10aImplications of Biofuel Policies for Water Management in India  ap. 601-613.  aIndia has developed a national biofuel policy to increase energy security, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and stimulate rural development. In this policy, the government has set blending targets for mixing ethanol and biodiesel with gasoline and diesel, respectively. In India, ethanol is produced from irrigated sugar-cane while biodiesel is produced from jatropha, which is said to require no irrigation. This paper analyzes the possible impacts of an increase in sugar-cane and jatropha production on water management and use. It finds that India's biofuel policy is likely to place additional pressure on scarce water resources. Although the development of biofuels may be necessary, care must be taken to anticipate its likely impacts on water resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiesel 3adiesel fuel 3aenergy 3aethanol 3agasoline 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3airrigation 3amixing 3arural development 3asugarcane 3awater management 3awater policy 3awater resources 3aIndia0 tInternational journal of water resources development.g2012 Dec. 1, v. 28, no. 4 p.601-613dTaylor & Francis Groupx1360-06487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07900627.2012.694149  aDNAL 7aarticle02817naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245014500165520147700310592002801787650002401815650002201839650001801861650001601879650001501895650001501910650002201925650001301947650001901960650001301979650001901992650002302011650003202034651001302066651000902079700002102088700002202109700002202131700002002153773012702173856007402300852000902374655001202383IND60652156820221118053018.0190712e20180214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065215682DNAL7 a10.3390/su100205112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodríguez, Lily O.,10aBuilding Adaptive Capacity in Changing Social-Ecological Systems: Integrating Knowledge in Communal Land-Use Planning in the Peruvian Amazon  aBuilding resilient sustainable social-ecological systems (SES) requires communities to enhance their adaptive capacities. Communal participative land-use planning (Zonificación Participativa Comunal—ZPC) is a tool designed for communities to integrating local and scientific knowledge to sustainably organize and manage their SES. Between 2006 and 2011, a ZPC was developed with communities in the buffer zone of Cordillera Azul National Park (Peru), where rapid demographic changes are converting pre-montane seasonally dry forest into agricultural land. Herein, we analyse how the ZPC enhanced adaptive capacity, enabling the SES to cope with environmental, political and economic changes. Based on qualitative, semi-structured interviews, communities are analysed along their capacities in the dimensions social capital, learning, adaptive management and governance. An analysis of yearly high-resolution forest cover data supports our findings. Deforestation activities in biologically sensitive zones decreased rapidly during the time of the ZPC implementation. We find that particularly the long-term presence of the bridging institution and the continuous testing and reflection of the integrated “hybrid knowledge” enabled communities to develop adaptive capacities. The analysis of ZPC our results reveals the enabling conditions for promoting the learning process to develop a sustainable land-use management in the context of migration and rapid changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadaptive management 3aagricultural land 3adeforestation 3adry forests 3agovernance 3ainterviews 3aland use planning 3alearning 3anational parks 3apolitics 3asocial capital 3asocial environment 3asustainable land management 3aAmazonia 3aPeru1 aCisneros, Elías1 aPequeño, Tatiana1 aFuentes, Maria T.1 aZinngrebe, Yves0 tSustainability.g2018 Feb. 14, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100205113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01499naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001600143245013200159300001800291520023100309592002800540650001700568650001600585650001700601650002100618650002800639650001400667650001200681650002800693653004100721653001600762653001600778653001100794653001400805653001800819653002500837773015300862856007701015852000901092655001201101IND60522609820221118055501.0160603e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052260982DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-1979-11342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEder, F.

L.14aThe effect of simulated cold weather transport on core body temperature and behavior of broilers  ap. 2415-2424.  aDuring the winter in Western Canada, broilers are routinely transported in ambient temperatures ranging from 0°C to –40°C, yet there is little research in this area. This study examined the physiology and behavior of broilers undergoing simulated transport at typical Western Canadian winter temperatures. Groups of 15 broilers aged 32 to 33 d were exposed to an air stream regulated to –5, –10, or –15°C. Birds were placed into a typical transport drawer. Following baseline observations, the drawer was placed into a test chamber where cold air was drawn past the birds for 3 h. Three replications were conducted at each temperature. The birds adjusted their position within the drawer based upon the temperature distribution within the drawer. In comparison to the baseline period, exposing the birds to a cold air stream caused them to avoid the front plane (P = 0.003) which was the coldest area within the drawer. The birds did not adjust their usage of the middle (P = 0.308) and rear (P = 0.640) planes, because these were the warmer areas within the drawer. The total amount of space the birds occupied within the drawer did not decrease when exposed to the test chamber (P = 0.669). The core body temperature (CBT) did not vary and was within the known normal range during the normal (P = 0.528), pre-chamber (P = 0.060), and post-chamber (P = 0.285) periods. The CBT of the birds significantly decreased during the in-chamber period (P < 0.001) and then increased during the lairage period (P < 0.001). The shrink loss (P = 0.981) and amount of time to resume feed consumption (P = 0.357) were not affected by exposing the birds to temperatures of –5°C and colder. Exposing birds to temperatures of –5°C and colder had a negative effect on the CBT of the birds. However, the birds demonstrated behaviors which mitigated the negative effect that cold exposure could have on their CBT.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair flow 3aambient temperature 3aanimal transport 3aavoidance behavior 3abody temperature 3abroiler chickens 3acold 3aenvironmental exposure 3afeed intake 3alairage 3asimulation models 3astress response 3aweather 3awinter 2aAnimal Husbandry 2aAnimal Welfare 2aAnimals 2aBehavior, Animal 2aBody Temperature 2aChickensxphysiology 2aCold Temperature 2aFemale 2aMale 2aSeasons 2aTransportation 2aWeather 3aCanada 0aCanada1 aWatts, J.

A. gossypii has cosmopolitan distribution with broad host range, polyphenism, parthenogenetic mode of reproduction, vectoring abilities, and host alteration which has profound influence on its management. Odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) in insects are involved in olfaction, playing a key role in orienting the insect for feeding or oviposition. Recent studies revealed that OBP2 is found in both sensilla trichodea and sensilla basiconica and is preferentially binds to plant volatiles, thus playing crucial roles in host-seeking, detection of oviposition attractants, etc., However, information about the role of OBP2 in A. gossypii (AgOBP2) is still unavailable. In this study, we cloned and characterized OBP2, ortholog from A. gossypii, and the full-length AgOBP2 complementary DNA (cDNA) consisted of 859 bp with an open reading frame of 732 bp. Phylogenetic analysis resulted in grouping of AgOBP2 protein with members of the tribe Aphidini. Further, diet-mediated delivery of double-stranded RNA for AgOBP2 induced silencing, which was evaluated at 48 and 96 h. The reverse transcriptase real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RTq-PCR) results revealed that the level of AgOBP2 messenger RNA (mRNA) was significantly reduced (55–77 %) in dsAgOBP2 treatment after 96 h as compared to the untreated control. The same was reiterated by the electrophysiological responses in the aphids which was reduced (>50 % at 0.25 μg/μl concentration) as compared to the untreated control. Thus, our results showed the potential of gene silencing, possibly to interfere with the odorant perception of A. gossypii for RNAi-mediated pest management. The results from our study provided the first evidence that AgOBP2 play crucial roles in host-seeking, detection of oviposition attractants, etc.; as a result, we suggests that OBP2 could potentially serve as a practicable target for RNAi-mediated gene silencing in hemipteran insect pest control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA interference 3aoviposition 3aphylogeny 3aodor compounds 3ahost seeking 3aAphis gossypii 3agrowers 3aopen reading frames 3afinancial economics 3asmell 3asensilla 3ahost range 3amessenger RNA 3ainsect pests 3acomplementary DNA 3apest control 3aphloem 3adouble-stranded RNA 3aelectrophysiology 3aproteins 3aparthenogenesis 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aoviposition attractants 0aHemiptera1 aAsokan, R.1 aHande, H.

In general, production of phycocyanin depends mainly on the light conditions during the cultivation period, and purification of phycocyanin requires expensive and complex procedures. In this study, we propose a new two-stage cultivation method to maximize the quantitative content and purity of phycocyanin obtained from Spirulina platensis using red and blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs) under different light intensities. In the first stage, Spirulina was cultured under a combination of red and blue LEDs to obtain the fast growth rate until reaching an absorbance of 1.4–1.6 at 680 nm. Next, blue LEDs were used to enhance the concentration and purity of the phycocyanin in Spirulina. Two weeks of the two-stage cultivation of Spirulina yielded 1.28 mg mL⁻¹ phycocyanin with the purity of 2.7 (OD₆₂₀/OD₂₈₀).  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3alight intensity 3aphycocyanin 3aArthrospira platensis 3aRhodophyta 0aSpirulina platensis1 aLee, Ju Eun1 aKim, Yoori1 aLee, Seung-Yop0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2016 Jan., v. 178, no. 2 p.382-395dSpringer USx0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-015-1879-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02605naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001800184245003900202300001800241506007600259520114400335592002801479506003701507650002001544650001801564650001501582650001601597650001201613650002001625651001001645700001601655700001701671700001601688700001601704700001901720700001201739700001301751700001701764700001801781700001401799700001501813700001801828773017301846856008302019852000902102655001202111IND4481185920221207105212.0120502e20120306xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448118592DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11154301092doi7 aPMC33097222pmcid7 a223551092pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Xiaoyan10aEarly millet use in northern China  ap. 3726-3730.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIt is generally understood that foxtail millet and broomcorn millet were initially domesticated in Northern China where they eventually became the dominant plant food crops. The rarity of older archaeological sites and archaeobotanical work in the region, however, renders both the origins of these plants and their processes of domestication poorly understood. Here we present ancient starch grain assemblages recovered from cultural deposits, including carbonized residues adhering to an early pottery sherd as well as grinding stone tools excavated from the sites of Nanzhuangtou (11.5â11.0 cal kyBP) and Donghulin (11.0â9.5 cal kyBP) in the North China Plain. Our data extend the record of millet use in China by nearly 1,000 y, and the record of foxtail millet in the region by at least two millennia. The patterning of starch residues within the samples allow for the formulation of the hypothesis that foxtail millets were cultivated for an extended period of two millennia, during which this crop plant appears to have been undergoing domestication. Future research in the region will help clarify the processes in place.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSetaria italica 3adomestication 3afood crops 3afood plants 3amillets 3astarch granules 3aChina1 aWan, Zhiwei1 aPerry, Linda1 aLu, Houyuan1 aWang, Qiang1 aZhao, Chaohong1 aLi, Jun1 aXie, Fei1 aYu, Jincheng1 aCui, Tianxing1 aWang, Tao1 aLi, Mingqi1 aGe, Quansheng0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 Mar. 6, v. 109, no. 10 p.3726-3730dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11154301093Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02903naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245009600172300001600268520184900284592002802133653002202161653001202183653001102195653001002206653001102216653001502227653001002242700002202252700002102274700002002295700002602315773012102341856008202462852000902544655001202553IND60554333820221120204013.0161024e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055433382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcyt.2014.11.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbd-Allah, Somia H.10aHuman peripheral blood CD34+ cells attenuate oleic acid–induced acute lung injury in rats  ap. 443-453.  aAdult stem cell–based therapy is a promising novel approach for treatment of acute lung injury (ALI). In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic effect of isolated human peripheral blood CD34+ progenitor cells in an ALI rat model, induced by oleic acid (OA) injection.Seventy-five adult female rats were used in this study. Group A, control without treatment, and group B, control injected with phosphate-buffered saline, comprised 15 rats each; the remaining 45 rats were injected with OA to induce ALI and were further subdivided into 3 groups: group C (ALI group, 15 rats), group D (ALI and fibroblast group, 15 rats) and group E (ALI and CD34+ cell group, 15 rats).CD34+ cells transplantation in rats with OA-induced lung injury improves the arterial PaO2 and wet/dry ratio, reduces infiltration of inflammatory cells and decreases lung vascular permeability as determined by reduced intra-alveolar and interstitial patchy congestion and hemorrhage as well as decreased interstitial edema. Additionally, lung inflammation determined by expression of the pro-inflammatory mediators intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and tumor necrosis factor-α was attenuated in CD34+ cell–treated rats at 6, 24 and 48 h post-OA challenge compared with non-treated rats. Moreover, the expression of anti-inflammatory molecule interleukin-10 was up-regulated in the lung of OA-induced ALI rats after administration of CD34+ cells. The important finding was that human TNF-α-induced protein 6 (TSG-6) gene expression was significantly up-regulated in rats treated with CD34+ cells.The freshly isolated human peripheral blood–derived CD34+ cells may be used as an important source of stem cells that improve ALI. The anti-inflammatory properties of CD34+ cells in the lung are explained, at least in part, by activation of CD34+ cells to express TSG-6.  aPublisher supplied data 0aacute lung injury 0aCD34+ve 0aICAM-1 0aIL-10 0aTNF-α 0aoleic acid 0aTSG-61 aShalaby, Sally M.1 aAbd-Elbary, Eman1 aSaleh, Ayman A.1 aEl-Magd, Mohammed Abu0 tCytotherapy.g2015 Apr., v. 17 p.443-453dElsevier Inc.aInternational Society for Cellular Therapyx1465-32497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcyt.2014.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02736naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245022200175506002800397520135800425592002801783506003701811650001901848650001701867650001401884650001401898650001501912650001301927650001701940651001201957653001701969653001401986653001902000653000902019653001602028700001602044700001902060700002002079773011902099856008702218852000902305655001202314IND60739641020221207085612.0180530e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073964102DNAL7 a10.20870/oeno-one.2016.50.3.562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenmeziane, Farida10aDetermination of major anthocyanin pigments and flavonols in red grape skin of some table grape varieties (<em>Vitis vinifera sp.</em>) by high-performance liquid chromatography–photodiode array detection (HPLC-DAD)  aResource is Open Access  aAim: The aim of this study was the investigation of the anthocyanin and flavonol content in grape skin extracts. Five prevalent anthocyanin-types and four flavonol-types were determined in the skin of three red table grape varieties widely cultivated in El-Tarf (Algeria). Methods and results: The identification of the compounds was performed by HPLC-DAD based on C-18 reversed phase column separation. Results from HPLC analysis showed that malvidin and petunidin-3-O-glucoside were the major anthocyanin glucoside, whereas quercetin-3-O-glucoside was the major flavonol among the four identified. Conclusion: The content of anthocyanins and flavonols in the grape skin of three grapevine (Vitis vinifera) varieties exhibits notable differences among the cultivars studied, confirming their importance in the varietal characterization. The highest concentrations of total anthocyanins and flavonols corresponded to the Gros noir variety. The results of the present study also indicate that the grape skin extracts of these Algerian cultivars can be used as easily accessible source of natural antioxidants. Significance and impact of the study: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the identification of different anthocyanins and flavonols in berry skin from some red grape varieties largely cultivated in this region of Algeria.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aVitis vinifera 3aanthocyanins 3acultivars 3aflavonols 3aglucosides 3amalvidin 3atable grapes 3aAlgeria 0aanthocyanins 0aflavonols 0aVitis vinifera 0aHPLC 0atable grape1 aCadot, Yves1 aDjamai, Rachid1 aDjermoun, Lynda0 tOENO One.g2016 Sept., v. 50, no. 3dInternational Viticulture and Enology SocietywJournal:27875x2494-12717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.20870/oeno-one.2016.50.3.563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01307naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245009600172300001600268520041100284592002800695650001300723650002500736650001100761650001600772650001400788651001700802773010700819856008200926852000901008655001201017IND60614716620221120160506.0181002s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061471662DNAL7 a10.25223/brad.n36.2018.a212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJaarsveld, E.J. van10aCrassula anso-lerouxiae, a new Species from the Robertson Karoo, Western Cape, South Africa  ap. 233-237.  aCrassula anso-lerouxiae, a new Crassula species, is described from the Succulent Karoo region between Worcester and Robertson.

The morphologies of the nanospheres on the substrates, as well as the intermediates, were evaluated by FESEM. During the synthesis, a micelle formation process transforming from rod-like micelles to vesicles to lamellar phases was proposed, attributed to the electrostatic self-assembly process of the oppositely charged cationic cetyltrimethyl-ammonium tosylate (CTATos) and anionic Si–OH in the solution. The processed substrates are transparent and super-hydrophilic with good antifogging properties. The homogeneous growth, firm substrate combination, and facile procedures are significantly advantageous for the fabrication method and can be explored with other substrates such as modified electrodes and nanoscale devices for diverse applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrodes 3aglass 3amicelles 3ananospheres 3aquaternary ammonium compounds 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilica1 aShen, Jie1 aZhou, Wuyi1 aZhang, Shiying1 aWan, Long0 tRSC advances.g2017 Mar. 13, v. 7, no. 26 p.15992-15996dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra27276b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02186naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245009500155300002000250520092100270592002801191650002101219650002001240650001001260650001101270650001301281650001401294650001501308650001501323650002001338650001601358650001601374650002401390650002201414700001301436700001801449700001401467700001701481700001701498700001801515773012401533856007401657852000901731655001201740IND60641542220221117231756.0190505e20170317xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064154222DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra00295e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrieur, B.10aPhosphorylation of lignin: characterization and investigation of the thermal decomposition  ap. 16866-16877.  aLignin is an abundant polyphenol biopolymeric material. Lignin was phosphorylated thanks to the presence of reactive hydroxyl groups in its structure. A detailed characterization allowed us to prove that phosphate groups are covalently bonded to the lignin's structure. The thermal stability of lignin was improved with the presence of phosphorus and was evaluated at 3% w/w. The thermal decomposition of lignin was deeply investigated through gas and condensed phases analyzes. The phosphorus was found to promote dehydration and decarboxylation reactions, thus increasing the amount of carbonaceous residue which was more stable at high temperature. The combustibility of lignin was also lowered when phosphorylated. Finally, even if half of the initial amount was released in the gas phase, the phosphorus mainly acts in the condensed phase by forming different species, which prevents the residue from oxidation.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical bonding 3adecarboxylation 3agases 3alignin 3amoieties 3aoxidation 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3aphosphorylation 3apolyphenols 3atemperature 3athermal degradation 3athermal stability1 aMeub, M.1 aWittemann, M.1 aKlein, R.1 aBellayer, S.1 aFontaine, G.1 aBourbigot, S.0 tRSC advances.g2017 Mar. 17, v. 7, no. 27 p.16866-16877dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra00295e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02345naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005400094040001800148100001900166245014800185300001400333520126200347592002801609653001201637653001901649653000901668653002401677653001501701653002401716700001701740700001901757700001601776773010401792856011401896852000902010655001202019IND60129111320221119034458.0151124e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012911132DNAL7 a10.3375/0885-8608(2006)26[84:COGPPS]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarter, Robert10aClassification of Green Pitcher Plant (Sarracenia oreophila (Kearney) Wherry) Communities in the Little River Canyon National Preserve, Alabama  ap. 84-93.  aPitcher plant bogs of the Little River Canyon National Preserve in northern Alabama contain the federally endangered green pitcher plant (Sarracenia oreophila (Kearney) Wherry).

Moench] is an increasingly popular crop because of its value in the U.S. botanical industry. At present, there is no rapid method of analyzing it for chicoric acid, the predominant phenolic acid associated with immunostimulation in humans. The objective of this study was to quantify chicoric acid in purple coneflower roots by near infrared (NIR) reflectance spectroscopy. One hundred sixty-nine plants were harvested and their root tissues analyzed for chicoric acid by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Root samples were scanned between 1100 and 2498 nm and reflectance data recorded. The HPLC data were regressed against infrared spectra to develop empirical prediction equations. The optimum prediction equation produced coefficients of determination for calibration and cross validation of 0.90 and 0.86, respectively. The mean chicoric acid concentration was 8.29 g kg DM⁻¹, and the standard errors of calibration and cross validation were 0.89 and 1.06 g kg DM⁻¹, respectively. We conclude that NIR reflectance spectroscopy can accurately quantitate chicoric acid in purple coneflower.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEchinacea purpurea 3aequations 3aindustry 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3aphenolic acids 3aprediction 3arapid methods 3areflectance 3areflectance spectroscopy 3aroots 3atissues 3aUnited States1 aRoberts, C.

The literature shows a lack of consensus on basic terminology and definitions of destination performance. While research focuses on business efficiency, areas such as development effectiveness, social equality, and environmental integrity are still not well understood, even though these are salient elements of sustainable development. This paper provides a framework for evaluating destination performance under the 4E rubric of economy, efficiency, effectiveness, and environmental quality, which reflects a more holistic and effective destination performance. The information entropy weight method and a multi-factor comprehensive evaluation model are developed and applied to an international destination, Zhangjiajie, China, which was selected as a case study to test the framework developed. Results show that the economy, efficiency, effectiveness, and environmental quality aspects should be considered when evaluating tourism development performance. The empirical analysis shows that based on these criteria, Zhangjiajie’s destination performance improved measurably during the test period from 2005 to 2009. The results indicate that significant events, natural disasters, and financial crises influence performance most.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adisasters 3aeconomic crises 3aempirical research 3aenvironmental quality 3amodels 3asustainable development 3aterminology 3atourism 3atourists 3aChina0 tSustainability.g2018 Feb. 14, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100205163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02581naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004200113040001800155100001900173245012400192300001600316520079500332592002801127650002001155650001801175650002401193650000901217650001701226650001001243650001001253650002101263650002301284650001001307650001501317650001401332650001801346650001201364650005801376650004601434650000901480650002401489650002101513650006201534650001201596650002401608650006601632650001001698650002901708651003201737700001501769700001801784700002001802773011701822856005501939852000901994655001202003IND50064506120221119175941.0130402e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006450612DNAL7 a227124302pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2915.2011.01008.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDU TOIT, C.

The feeding mechanisms of coprophagous dung beetles restrict the size of the food particles they can ingest and hence may determine which species can be efficient vectors for S. lupi. In this study, we aimed to exclude certain dung beetle species as possible hosts of S. lupi based on whether or not they ingested latex beads of known diameters mixed into fresh cattle dung. We found that the majority (11/14) of species tested can potentially serve as intermediate hosts of S. lupi because their mouthparts allow the passage of food particles larger than the minimum size range of the eggs of this parasite.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSpirocerca lupi 3acattle manure 3adietary restriction 3adogs 3adung beetles 3afeces 3afoods 3ahost preferences 3aintermediate hosts 3alatex 3amouthparts 3aparasites 3aparticle size 2aAnimals 2aColeopteraxclassificationxparasitologyxphysiology. 2aDog Diseasesxparasitologyxtransmission. 2aDogs 2aFecesxparasitology 2aFood Preferences 2aInsect Vectorsxclassificationxparasitologyxphysiology. 2aSeasons 2aSpecies Specificity 2aSpirurida Infectionsxparasitologyxtransmissionxveterinary. 2aSwine 2aThelazioideaxphysiology 0aSouth Africaxepidemiology.1 aHOLTER, P.1 aLUTERMANN, H.1 aScholtz, C.

We might hope that improvements in interface design would tend to reduce these side effects. Unfortunately, history reveals just the opposite: The incidence and severity of motion sickness (for example) is positively related to the progressive sophistication of display technology and systems. In this presentation, I enquire about the future of interface technologies in relation to side effects. I review the types of side effects that occur and what is known about the causes of interface side effects. I suggest new ways of understanding relations between interface technologies and side effects, and new ways to approach the problem of interface side effects.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadverse effects 3aheadache 3atechnology 3awebs0 tBIO web of conferences.g2011 Dec., v. 1 p.00086-dEDP ScienceswJournal:27810x2117-44587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1051/bioconf/201101000863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02121naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245014000152300002000292520088500312592002801197650001101225650001101236650002101247650001401268650001701282650002201299650001501321650001701336650001301353650001401366650001601380650002101396700001601417700001901433700001801452700001401470773014401484856007401628852000901702655001201711IND60670790420221119150810.0191002e20140722xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067079042DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ta02003k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Xin10aHierarchical NiCoO₂ nanosheets supported on amorphous carbon nanotubes for high-capacity lithium-ion batteries with a long cycle life  ap. 13069-13074.  aIn this paper, we report a facile approach to the synthesis of one-dimension (1D) hierarchical NiCoO₂ nanosheets (NSs)@amorphous CNT composites based on the templates and carbon source of polymeric nanotubes (PNTs). Importantly, these sulfonated PNTs can also be used to prepare many other functional 1D metal oxides@amorphous CNT nanostructures, such as TiO₂, SnO₂, CoO and NiO, etc. Due to the outstanding nanostructures and the synergistic effects of the NiCoO₂ NSs and amorphous CNTs, an ultrahigh discharge capacity of 1309 mA h g⁻¹ is delivered by the NiCoO₂@CNT composites, even after 300 cycles at a current density of 400 mA g⁻¹. The favorable improvements of the NiCoO₂ based lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) reported in this work illustrate that the 1D amorphous carbon matrix offers significant benefits for high-capacity metal oxide anode nanomaterials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3achemistry 3acobalt oxide 3alithium batteries 3ananosheets 3anickel oxide 3apolymers 3asynergism 3atin dioxide 3atitanium dioxide1 aDong, Bitao1 aDing, Shujiang1 aXiao, Chunhui1 aYu, Demei0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2014 July 22, v. 2, no. 32 p.13069-13074dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ta02003k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02184naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245010000173300001400273520096000287592002801247650001101275650002101286650002601307650001601333650001101349650002401360650001201384650001501396650001101411650001201422650001301434651001401447653001701461653000801478653001401486653001501500653001701515700002401532773013401556856005101690852000901741655001201750IND50075153920221120072313.0140410e20130301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007515392DNAL7 a10.1080/07900627.2012.7395392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarimi, Syafruddin10aResettlement and development: a survey of two of Indonesia's Koto Panjang resettlement villages  ap. 35-49.  aConstruction of the Koto Panjang Dam was initiated in response to the rapidly increasing demand for electricity in the central region of Sumatra, Indonesia. The process of resettling the villages affected by this construction lasted from 1991 to 2000. The economic factors related to this resettlement programme include monetary compensation, productive capacity, and appropriate distribution of income. Better-off villages (such as those where a rubber plantation was found) received a higher level of compensation and used this compensation to purchase productive assets. Increasing the level of a family's income generates better income distribution and a lower level of poverty, whereas decreasing it creates worse income distribution and a higher level of poverty. The presence of productive capacity is necessary to guarantee the success of an involuntary resettlement programme that attempts to improve the standard of living for displaced peoples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aassets 3aeconomic factors 3aeconomic productivity 3aelectricity 3aincome 3aincome distribution 3apoverty 3apurchasing 3arubber 3asurveys 3avillages 3aIndonesia 0acompensation 0adam 0aIndonesia 0ainundation 0aresettlement1 aTaifur, Werry Darta0 tInternational journal of water resources development.g2013 Mar. 1, v. 29, no. 1 p.35-49dTaylor & Francis Groupx1360-06487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07900627.2012.739539  aDNAL 7aarticle02138naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100003500143245009200178300001600270506002800286520081500314592002801129506003701157650002701194650002201221650002801243650002001271650002801291650001501319650001401334650002201348653002001370653001501390653001901405653001901424653001401443700002401457700002201481773012601503856007801629852000901707655001201716IND60739641520221207085613.0110614s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073964152DNAL7 a10.2298/ZMSPN1120315A2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNatalija, Atanasova-Pančevska10aComparative study of cellulolytic activity of three rumen fungi on different substrates  ap. 315-325.  aResource is Open Access  aAnaerobic chytridiomycete fungi are found in the gastrointestinal tracts of many domesticated ruminant and nonruminant herbivores and of a wide variety of wild herbivorous mammals. They produce high levels of cellulases and hemicellulases; these enzymes are regulated by substrate (especially soluble sugars) available to the organisms. The aim of this paper was to do a comparative study of cellulolytic activity of three rumen fungi on carboxymethyl cellulose and Avicel. The capacity of enzymes was determined by monitoring the growth on carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and Avicel. Enzyme activity was detected extracellularly in culture supernatants after vegetative growth. All of the isolates degraded CMC and avicel, and exhibited cellulolytic activities (carboxymethyl cellulose-(CMC-ase) and avicelase).  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3acomparative study 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aenzyme activity 3agastrointestinal system 3aherbivores 3aruminants 3avegetative growth 0aanaerobic fungi 0acellulases 0agas production 0aNeocallimastix 0aPiromyces1 aDžoko, Kungulovski1 aIvan, Kungulovski0 tZbornik Matice srpske za prirodne nauke.g2011, v. 2011, no. 120 p.315-325dMatica srpskawJournal:27734x0352-49067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2298/ZMSPN1120315A3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04075naa a2200817 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100001600158245008300174300001600257500002400273520169300297650001601990650001302006650002602019650001502045650001102060650001502071650002002086650001002106650001302116650001002129650001502139650001502154650001102169650001202180650001402192650002802206650001002234650001102244650001002255650001602265650001502281650001202296650003902308650001102347650004802358650002802406650003802434650004202472650003202514650003602546650003202582650001102614650002402625650003902649650004102688650004602729650003802775650002002813650001502833650005602848650000902904650001302913650001402926650001402940650003502954700001702989700001403006700001403020700001903034700001403053773009003067852000903157856007903166655001203245IND4457750820221116200747.0110507s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445775082DNAL7 a213108132pmid7 a10.1530/REP-10-02822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLazzari, G.10aEmbryonic genotype and inbreeding affect preimplantation development in cattle  ap. 625-632.  aIncludes references  aInfertility in cattle herds is a growing problem with multifactorial causes.

To investigate this issue, we produced purebred and crossbred bovine embryos by in vitro techniques from Holstein oocytes and Holstein or Brown Swiss semen and analyzed several cellular and molecular features. In the first experiment, purebred and crossbred embryos, obtained from abattoir oocytes, were analyzed for cleavage, development to morula/blastocyst stages, amino acid metabolism and gene expression of developmentally important genes. The results indicated significant differences in the percentage of compacted morulae, in the expression of three genes at the blastocyst stage (MNSOD, GP130 and FGF4) and in the utilization of serine, asparagine, methionine and tryptophan in day 6 embryos. In the second experiment, bovine oocytes were collected by ovum pick up from ten Holstein donors and fertilized with the semen of the respective Holstein sires or with Brown Swiss semen. The derived embryos were grown in vitro up to day 7, and were then transferred to synchronized recipients and recovered on day 12. We found that purebred/inbred embryos had lower blastocyst rate on days 7-8, were smaller on day 12 and had lower expression of the trophoblast gene PLAC8. Overall, these results indicate reduced and delayed development of purebred embryos compared with crossbred embryos. In conclusion, this study provides evidence that embryo genotype and high inbreeding can affect amino acid metabolism, gene expression, preimplantation development and therefore fertility in cattle. 3aBrown Swiss 3aHolstein 3aamino acid metabolism 3aasparagine 3acattle 3acrossbreds 3agene expression 3agenes 3agenotype 3aherds 3ainbreeding 3amethionine 3amorula 3aoocytes 3apurebreds 3areproductive efficiency 3asemen 3aserine 3asires 3atrophoblast 3atryptophan 2aAnimals 2aBlastocystxmetabolismxpathology. 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxgeneticsxphysiopathology. 2aChi-Square Distribution 2aCytokine Receptor gp130xgenetics 2aEmbryo Culture Techniquesxveterinary 2aEmbryo Transferxveterinary 2aEmbryonic Developmentxgenetics 2aEnergy Metabolismxgenetics 2aFemale 2aFertilityxgenetics 2aFertilization in Vitroxveterinary 2aFibroblast Growth Factor 4xgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmental 2aGenetic Predisposition to Disease 2aGestational Age 2aInbreeding 2aInfertilityxgeneticsxphysiopathologyxveterinary. 2aMale 2aPedigree 2aPhenotype 2aPregnancy 2aSuperoxide Dismutasexgenetics1 aColleoni, S.1 aDuchi, R.1 aGalli, A.1 aHoughton, F.D.1 aGalli, C.0 tReproduction.g2011 May, v. 141, no. 5 p.625-632dBioScientifica Ltdx1470-16267nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1530/REP-10-02823Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03150naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072001700135072001700152072001700169072001700186100001900203245014300222300001800365500002300383520139400406650001301800650001801813650001701831650001601848650002601864650001901890650001801909650001501927650001001942650002201952650001201974650001701986650001902003650002002022650002002042650002002062650002202082650002002104650002702124651001202151653001802163653001902181700001702200700001702217700002102234700001602255773011202271852000902383856007502392930003302467945002502500946001102525655001202536IND4363994320221116202223.0040819e200406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436399432DNAL7 a10.1139/x04-0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Our primary objective was to determine whether unharvested patches retain biotic elements that are similar to those of the surrounding uncut forests and to those of patches of forest skipped by wildfires. Beetle assemblages of the harvest residuals were similar to those of the uncut forest, suggesting that harvest residuals retain elements of the mature forest. However, beetle assemblages of harvest residuals differed from those of fire residuals. Thus, harvest residuals sited without regard to microhabitat characteristics or stand structure in fire residuals are insufficient analogues for the late successional habitats provided by fire residuals. There was no relationship between size of harvest residuals and either beetle catch or diversity. Beetle catches were higher in round harvest residuals, and a number of forest species also appeared to be aggregated in round residuals. Forest managers may preserve biotic elements of young uncut forest by leaving round harvest residuals in clearcuts; however, a closer habitat match between harvest and fire residuals is likely required to preserve and maintain landscape-level forest biodiversity. 3aconifers 3aforest stands 3aforest trees 3acanopy gaps 3ahabitat fragmentation 3aforest insects 3aforest litter 3aColeoptera 3afauna 3aspecies diversity 3alogging 3aforest fires 3ainsect ecology 3aforest habitats 3arefuge habitats 3astand structure 3aforest succession 3apopulation size 3aconservation practices 3aAlberta 0aresidual size 0aresidual shape1 aSpence, J.R.1 aLangor, D.W.1 aMorgantini, L.E.1 aCryer, K.J.0 tCanadian journal of forest research.g2004 June, v. 34, no. 6 p.1319-1329wJournal:jnl2003x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x04-0183Available from publisher's Web site  a20050726b20050802c00000000  aINDd1CTe2005/01/08  aNon-US 7aarticle01589naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245009000128300001600218520072500234650002500959650001800984650001501002650001601017650002201033650001501055650001601070650001301086653001301099700001801112773008001130852000901210939003301219946001101252655001201263IND9303442920221116202120.0930604e199005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930344292DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChiew, F.H.S.10aEstimating groundwater recharge using a surface watershed model: sensitivity analyses  ap. 305-325.  aThe methodology used to estimate, groundwater recharge using a surface watershed modelling approach was presented in a complementary paper.

However, our understanding of stand composition and age effects on competition is poor. We used neighbourhood analysis for 748 target conifer trees to examine interspecific competition within 11-, 25-, and 50-year-old mixed, even-aged stands of paper birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca (Beissn.) Franco), western redcedar (Thuja plicata Donn ex D. Don), and western larch (Larix occidentalis Nutt.) in southern interior British Columbia. Critical neighbourhood height and distance were identified where competition accounted for the greatest variation in target conifer diameter. Competition processes were emperically examined using relative height indices. We found that critical neighbourhood distance increased with stand age and was greater for larch than for cedar. Critical neighbourhood height was higher for cedar than for Douglas-fir or larch in the 11-year-old stands but lower in the older stands. The most important competitors in the 11-year-old stands were tall neighbours, whereas those in the older stands were short neighbours. We found asymmetrical relationships between target conifers and neighbours for all species and age-classes, indicating a resource preemption mode of competition. To be useful in developing prescriptions for competition management in mixed species stands, competition indices should consider neighbour identity and critical height for each target species. Assessment radius must also be sufficiently large to adequately characterize competition. 3aplant density 3aforest trees 3aforest ecology 3ainterspecific competition 3aplant competition 3aheight 3aspatial distribution 3amixed stands 3atree age 3aeven-aged stands 3aBetula papyrifera 3aPseudotsuga menziesii 3aThuja plicata 3aLarix occidentalis 3aage structure 3atree classes 3aregression analysis 3aBritish Columbia1 aSachs, D.L.0 tCanadian journal of forest research.g2004 June, v. 34, no. 6 p.1228-1240wJournal:jnl2003x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x04-0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20050726b20050802c00000000  aINDd1CTe2005/01/08  aNon-US 7aarticle01706naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245001700147300001200164520077200176650000900948650002100957650001700978650002500995650001801020650003301038650002101071650002801092650005001120653001501170653002201185773009401207852000901301939003301310946001301343655001201356IND9303444620221116202127.0930604e199304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930344462DNAL7 a84708852pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeilands, J.B.10aSiderophores  ap. 1-3.  aSiderophores, defined as low-iron-induced virtually ferric-specific ligands, are widely distributed in microbial species where they function in the sequestration and transport of iron. In Escherichia coli biosynthesis of siderophores is negatively regulated at the transcriptional level by ferrous ion in conjunction with a repressor protein, Fur (ferric uptake regulation). Siderophores are a component of the virulence armamentarium of clinical isolates of E. coli and of certain other microorganisms pathogenic to man, animals, and plants. The mechanism whereby cells accumulate sufficient iron for activation of essential enzymes while, at the same time, avoiding excess of a potentially toxic element remains one of the most challenging problems in biochemistry. 3airon 3aEscherichia coli 3asiderophores 2aBacteriaxmetabolism 2aBase Sequence 2aEscherichia colixmetabolism 2aIronxmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aSiderophoresxanalysisxgeneticsxphysiology. 0aregulation 0airon accumulation0 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g1993 Apr., v. 302, no. 1 p.1-3x0003-98617nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01328naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245008700129300001600216520052000232650001700752650002200769650002300791650002500814650001000839650002300849700001500872700001900887773006700906852000900973939003300982946001101015655001201026IND9303442520221116201949.0930604s1990    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930344252DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWittkowski, R.10aAnalysis of liquid smoke and smoked meat volatiles by headspace gas chromatography  ap. 135-144.  aHeadspace samples of smoked sausages and bacon were analyzed and compared with headspace samples of a commercial liquid smoke flavoring, in efforts to determine components contributing to the aroma of smoked foods.

Five multilevel groundwater sampling wells show characteristic depth functions of nitrate, proving the denitrification process. A series of 10 samples of 'arable land groundwater' was taken from different depths at these multilevel wells and isotope ratios of 15N/14N and 18(O)/16(O) in the nitrate were measured. The sampling was based on the two-dimensional vertical-plane groundwater flownet and on the knowledge of the landuse upgradient of the multilevel wells. High nitrate concentrations are associated with low delta 15N and low delta 18(O) values, and vice versa. The delta 15N/delta 18(O) ratio indicates a linear increase with a slope of 1:2.1. The microbial dentrification accords with a Rayleigh process with calculated enrichment factors of epsilon = -15.9 per thousand for 15N and epsilon = -8.0 per thousand for 18(O). Three samples taken from groundwater recharged under coniferous forest show deviating characteristics: low nitrate concentrations with low delta 15N values (1-4 per thousand) but very high delta 18(O) values (40-50 per thousand). Using the previously quantified enrichment factors for 15N and 18(O), an attempt was made to ascertain the significance of denitrification in specific depth sections at two other multilevel wells (7 samples). In two cases quantitative assessments on the degree of nitrate concentration decrease owing to denitrification were possible. However, in other cases the specific nitrate isotope fractionation was masked by the variability of nitrate concentration and of nitrate isotope ratios in the corresponding groundwater recharge preventing definite interpretations. 3agroundwater 3adenitrification 3amicrobial activity 3anitrate nitrogen 3astable isotopes 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3adepth 3agroundwater contamination 3aGerman Federal Republic1 aStrebel, O.1 aVoerkelius, S.1 aSchmidt, H.L.0 tJournal of hydrology.g1990 May, v. 114, no. 3/4 p.413-424x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02712naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245009700146300001600243520106400259650002101323650001901344650001101363650001901374650001801393650001801411650003601429650002801465650004101493650001601534650002501550650002901575650003601604650002201640650002001662650002301682650002101705650001701726650003601743650003701779650002901816650003001845650002901875650003601904653001401940653001701954700001701971700001701988773009802005852000902103939003302112946001302145655001202158IND9303441720221116201931.0930604e199303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930344172DNAL7 a83848332pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGasanov, S.E.10aModification of phospholipid membrane structure by the plant toxic peptide Pyrularia thionin  ap. 367-374.  aPyrularia thionin (P thionin) is a bioactive peptide from the parasitic plant Pyrularia pubera. The structural aspects of its interaction with phospholipid membranes were investigated by measuring the responses of phosphorescence quenching, EPR spin labels, and 1H and 31P NMR at different phospholipid compositions. In phosphatidylcholine bilayers containing cardiolipin or phosphatidylinositol, P thionin induced a pronounced increase in the membrane viscosity, and at higher P thionin concentrations the formation of nonbilayer structures was observed. In phosphatidylcholine bilayers containing phosphatidylserine, P thionin induced a significant transformation of membrane lamellar structure accompanied by a decrease of membrane viscosity. In all investigated lipid systems added P thionin caused an increase in membrane permeability and induced a fusion of sonicated liposomes. The specificity of P thionin interaction with phosphatidylserine-containing membrane is discussed and a model of phospholipid membrane modification by P thionin is suggested. 3aparasitic plants 3aplant proteins 3atoxins 3acell membranes 3aphospholipids 3abinding sites 2aAntimicrobial Cationic Peptides 2aCardiolipinsxchemistry 2aElectron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy 2aErythrosine 2aLiposomesxchemistry 2aLuminescent Measurements 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy 2aMembrane Fluidity 2aMembrane Fusion 2aModels, Biological 2aMolecular Probes 2aPermeability 2aPhosphatidylcholinesxchemistry 2aPhosphatidylinositolsxchemistry 2aPhospholipidsxchemistry 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistry 2aPlants, Toxicxchemistry 2aStructure-Activity Relationship 0astructure 0ainteractions1 aVernon, L.P.1 aAripov, T.F.0 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g1993 Mar., v. 301, no. 2 p.367-374x0003-98617nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02793naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002000171245014500191300001600336500002400352520135700376650000801733650002701741650001001768650001201778650001301790650001501803650000901818650001201827650002701839650001501866650003001881650001001911650001201921650001801933650003901951650001101990650001302001650000902014650003902023650002702062651001202089700001702101773011702118852000902235856005502244655001202299IND4449915620221116202210.0110225e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444991562DNAL7 a207046542pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2915.2010.00903.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDHARMARAJAN, G.10aEvaluating levels of PCR efficiency and genotyping error in DNA extracted from engorged and non-engorged female Dermacentor variabilis ticks  ap. 109-112.  aIncludes references  aPolymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods are increasingly used to elucidate tick biology. However, DNA extracted from ticks may provide poor PCR templates as a result of PCR inhibition by mammalian blood or contamination by male DNA (in fertilized females). In this study, the effects of removing the bloodmeal and reproductive organs were evaluated through paired DNA extractions in engorged and non-engorged Dermacentor variabilis (Say) (Acari: Ixodidae), prior to PCR amplification at 12 microsatellites. The first extraction utilized only mouthparts and legs (‘mouthpart' samples) and the second utilized tick bodies (‘body' samples). The results indicated that contamination by male DNA was an unlikely source of genotyping error in mouthpart and body samples. Engorged females showed higher levels of PCR inhibition in body vs. mouthpart samples, with a 29% decrease in amplification success rates per PCR and a 10-fold increase in levels of missing genotypes in body samples. By contrast, non-engorged females showed little difference in amplification success rates or numbers of missing genotypes in body vs. mouthpart samples. We discuss analytical concerns related to this systematic bias in PCR problems and recommend the removal of the bloodmeal and reproductive organs prior to DNA extraction, especially in engorged female ticks. 3aDNA 3aDermacentor variabilis 3ablood 3afemales 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3alegs 3amammals 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amouthparts 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aticks 2aAnimals 2aDNAxanalysis 2aDermacentorxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aFemale 2aGenotype 2aMale 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aRaccoonsxparasitology 0aIndiana1 aRHODES, O.E.0 tMedical and veterinary entomology.g2011 Mar., v. 25, no. 1 p.109-112dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0269-283X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2915.2010.00903.x 7aarticle02428naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245014300168300001800311520132200329650002101651650002601672650001601698650001201714650003101726650000901757650001401766650001301780651001001793700001301803700001301816700001501829773017401844856005102018852000902069655001202078IND60586356820221116202112.0171120e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058635682DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-17-0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiao, Zengmin10aPrevalence and Antimicrobial Resistance of Salmonella Isolates Recovered from Retail Pork in Major Village Markets in Tai'an Region, China  ap. 1635-1640.  aThe current study was undertaken to evaluate Salmonella contamination in retail pork at major village markets of the Tai'an region, China. In total, 200 retail pork samples were collected from four village markets between June 2015 and February 2016, of which 69 samples (34.5%) were determined to be positive for Salmonella. Eleven serotypes were identified from the 69 Salmonella isolates, and Salmonella Derby was the most common (18 of 69, 26.1%), followed by Typhimurium (17 of 69, 24.6%) and Meleagridis (11 of 69, 15.9%). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed that antimicrobial resistance against tetracycline was the most prevalent (42 of 69, 60.9%), but antimicrobial resistance against both ceftriaxone and cefotaxime was 1.4% (1 of 69) and 2.9% (2 of 69), respectively. Multilocus sequence typing revealed that the 69 Salmonella isolates were divided into 11 sequence types (STs), among which ST40 (18 of 69, 26.1%) was the most common, followed by ST34 (15 of 69, 21.7%) and ST64 (13 of 69, 18.8%). Collectively, retail pork at village markets in the Tai'an region has a high Salmonella contamination rate, and these isolates exhibit broad-spectrum antimicrobial resistance. However, the absence of a dominant ST demonstrates that the Salmonella isolates from retail pork may be of diverse origins. 3aSalmonella Derby 3aantibiotic resistance 3aceftriaxone 3amarkets 3amultilocus sequence typing 3apork 3aserotypes 3avillages 3aChina1 aLi, Song1 aQin, Kun1 aZhou, Yufa0 tJournal of food protection.g2017 Oct., v. 80, no. 10 p.1635-1640dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-17-019  aDNAL 7aarticle03330naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245007100172300001600243500002400259520236600283650001502649650002602664650001402690650001002704650001502714650002302729650001902752650001302771650002402784650001802808773010202826852000902928856005502937655001202992IND4450991620221116202105.0110320e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445099162DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2435.2010.01789.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarban, Richard14aThe ecology and evolution of induced resistance against herbivores  ap. 339-347.  aIncludes references  a1. Induced resistance is now widely accepted as a potent and widespread ecological force although several pieces of the story remain very poorly known. Theory predicts that induced defences should be favoured in variable environments especially when plants can use cues to reliably predict future conditions; however, this idea has not been seriously evaluated for plants. 2. Theory also predicts that plastic, induced defences should be favoured over permanent, constitutive defences if defences are costly and not always needed. This hypothesis has received considerable attention and limited support; resource allocation costs have been difficult to detect although ecological costs of defence may be more common. Recently, priming has emerged as a mechanism that may further reduce costs. Primed plants do not immediately produce the gene products associated with induced resistance but later respond more rapidly and strongly to severe or repeated attacks. It remains to be determined how common priming is. 3. Much of what we know about induced resistance is from the herbivore's point of view. Induced resistance will be beneficial from the plant's point of view if herbivores avoid induced plants, but the behavioural responses of herbivores to induced plant variation are still poorly studied. 4. Recent progress in understanding the detailed spatial and temporal extent of induced resistance has improved our appreciation of the phenomenon. Although some induced responses are systemic throughout entire plant individuals, many others have been found to be localized to damaged tissues. Plant vascular architecture and transpiration rates greatly constrain the distribution of vascular cues. Some plants rely on volatile cues that are active over relatively short distances and may be subject to eavesdropping by other plants, herbivores, and carnivores. Similarly, the temporal duration of induced responses may have important consequences on effectiveness although limited information is available concerning lag times before induction and relaxation times following induction. 5. Limited spatial and temporal scales of induced responses make plants more variable from the herbivore's point of view. Recent work suggests that plant heterogeneity may be difficult for herbivores to cope with although this hypothesis awaits further empirical testing. 3acarnivores 3aenvironmental factors 3aevolution 3agenes 3aherbivores 3ainduced resistance 3aplant response 3aplastics 3aresource allocation 3atranspiration0 tFunctional ecology.g2011 Apr., v. 25, no. 2 p.339-347dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0269-84637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2435.2010.01789.x 7aarticle03276naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072001700135072001700152072001700169072001700186072001700203100001800220245015200238300001800390500002300408500001500431520140000446650002001846650001601866650001501882650001501897650002701912650001401939650003201953650001801985650002102003650002302024650002402047650002002071650001702091650001402108650002002122650002002142650001202162650001602174650002002190650002502210651001902235653001802254653001102272653001002283700001802293700001802311700001602329700001802345773009802363852000902461856007502470930003302545945002502578946001102603655001202614IND4362535320221116202208.0040517e200312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436253532DNAL7 a10.1139/x03-1662doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Herein, we present an approach that may be site invariant to estimate monthly LAI for loblolly pine using point-in-time measurements from a LI-COR LAI-2000 plant canopy analyzer (PCA). Our analyses used needle accretion and abscission data from monthly needle counts and destructive harvest data from a replicated 2 x 2 factorial experiment of water and nutrition amendments. No significant treatment effects on relative needle accretion or abscission were observed. Cohort (interannual) differences in needle accretion were found but appeared trivial. Cohort year had variable effects on needle abscission. Abscission of current-year foliage began in July and continued through November of the third year; however, only 7%-9% remained 23 months following bud initiation. A treatment-invariable regression of PCA measurements on cohort foliage biomass (r2 approximately = 0.98) was used to estimate annual cohort LAI. We derived monthly estimates of LAI from cohort accretion and abscission and cohort LAI. Monthly estimates of LAI for loblolly pine, using point-in-time measurements from the PCA, appear possible, although further testing is required. 3aleaf area index 3aPinus taeda 3aestimation 3airrigation 3afertilizer application 3aphenology 3atree and stand measurements 3aforest stands 3aleaf development 3atemporal variation 3amathematical models 3asolar radiation 3aforest trees 3aequations 3aair temperature 3aleaf abscission 3abiomass 3atree growth 3aconifer needles 3atime series analysis 3aNorth Carolina 0aprecipitation 0aleaves 0acrown1 aAlbaugh, T.J.1 aJohnsen, K.H.1 aAllen, H.L.1 aZarnoch, S.J.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2003 Dec., v. 33, no. 12 p.2477-2490x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x03-1663Available from publisher's Web site  a20050111b20050130c00000000  aINDdGAYe2004/06/14  aNon-US 7aarticle03673naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013800170300001800308520194200326650003002268650001702298650001702315650001102332650001602343650001902359650001602378650002102394650001802415650001402433650003802447650003402485650001902519650001502538650001202553650002002565650001402585650000902599650001602608650000902624650003702633650002502670650001102695650001102706650001202717650001802729650001102747651001202758700001702770700002302787700001602810700002302826773017402849856005103023852000903074655001203083IND60586356220221116202323.0171120e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058635622DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-17-0832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElaridi, Jomana10aAnalysis of Aflatoxin M1 in Breast Milk and Its Association with Nutritional and Socioeconomic Status of Lactating Mothers in Lebanon  ap. 1737-1741.  aAflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is the most potent of the dietary aflatoxins, and its major metabolite, aflatoxin M1 (AFM1), is frequently found in the breast milk of lactating mothers. The aim of this study was to assess the occurrence and factors associated with AFM1 contamination of breast milk collected from lactating mothers in Lebanon. A total of 111 breast milk samples were collected according to the guidelines set by the World Health Organization. Samples were analyzed with a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay between December 2015 and November 2016. A survey was used to determine the demographic and anthropometric characteristics of participating lactating mothers. Dietary habits were assessed using a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. Mean (±standard deviation) concentration of AFM1 in the breast milk samples was 4.31 ± 1.8 ng/L, and 93.8% of samples contained AFM1 at 0.2 to 7.9 ng/L. The mean concentration of AFM1 was significantly lower (P < 0.05) in fall and winter (4.1 ± 1.9 ng/L) than in spring and summer (5.0 ± 1.7 ng/L). None of the samples exceeded the European Commission regulation limit (25 ng/L) for infant milk replacement formula. AFM1 contamination was significantly associated (P < 0.05) with the daily consumption of white cheeses but not with the consumption of meat or cereal products. No significant association (P > 0.05) was observed between AFM1 concentrations in breast milk and anthropometric sociodemographic factors (age and level of education) or the governorate of residence of the nursing mothers. The mean AFM1 estimated daily intake was found to be 0.69 ng/day/kg of body weight. Although the incidence of AFM1 contamination was low, our first-of-its-kind study highlights the importance of conducting investigations on mycotoxin contamination in breast milk and of developing protection strategies to tackle the exposure of infants to this potent chemical hazard. 3aWorld Health Organization 3aaflatoxin B1 3aaflatoxin M1 3aautumn 3abody weight 3abreast feeding 3abreast milk 3achemical hazards 3aeating habits 3aeducation 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afood frequency questionnaires 3agrain products 3aguidelines 3ainfants 3alactating women 3alactation 3ameat 3ametabolites 3amilk 3asociodemographic characteristics 3asocioeconomic status 3aspring 3asummer 3asurveys 3awhite cheeses 3awinter 3aLebanon1 aBassil, Maya1 aKharma, Joelle Abi1 aDaou, Farah1 aHassan, Hussein F.0 tJournal of food protection.g2017 Oct., v. 80, no. 10 p.1737-1741dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-17-083  aDNAL 7aarticle03279naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072001700135072001700152072001700169072001700186100001800203245009400221300001800315500002300333500001500356520156200371650001601933650001801949650001501967650001701982650001701999650001402016650002202030650000902052650003202061650002702093650002502120650002102145650002602166650001702192650001602209650002502225650002602250650001402276651001202290653001502302700001602317700001502333700001602348700001802364700001502382773011502397852000902512856007502521930003302596945002502629946001102654655001202665IND4362535220221116202316.0040517e200312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436253522DNAL7 a10.1139/x03-1862doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Both environmental and genetic factors are known to affect the quantity of oleoresin flow in loblolly pine, Pinus taeda L., but little is known about the genetic contribution to phenotypic variation in this trait. Here we report estimates of genetic variation in oleoresin flow and growth traits for a population of this species. Oleoresin yield, total height, and diameter were measured on 10- and 11-year-old trees from an experimental test in Santa Rosa County, Florida. Trees were from 72 full-sib families produced by mating 48 parents according to a disconnected partial diallel mating design. Resin yield was determined from breast-height samples collected at two times: once in the summer of 1999 when latewood was being produced (summer resin flow), and once in the spring of 2000 during earlywood formation (spring resin flow). All traits studied were found to be highly genetically variable and to have much greater additive than dominance variance. Estimates of narrow-sense heritability for spring and summer resin flow were in the moderate range and are comparable to values obtained for the growth traits. Additive genetic correlations between oleoresin yield and the growth traits were positive and moderately high, suggesting that directional selection to improve growth in loblolly pine will also result in increased production of oleoresin. 3atree growth 3agrowth traits 3aoleoresins 3aforest trees 3abark beetles 3aequations 3agenetic variation 3aflow 3atree and stand measurements 3aDendroctonus frontalis 3aphenotypic variation 3adiallel analysis 3aadditive gene effects 3aheritability 3aPinus taeda 3astatistical analysis 3abiological resistance 3ajuveniles 3aFlorida 0aColeoptera1 aStrom, B.L.1 aHain, F.P.1 aGwaze, D.P.1 aMcKeand, S.E.1 aLott, L.H.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2003 Dec., v. 33, no. 12 p.2469-2476wJournal:jnl2003x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x03-1863Available from publisher's Web site  a20040614b00000000c00000000  aINDdGAYe2004/06/14  aNon-US 7aarticle02682naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245014000166300001800306520146700324650002401791650002901815650001801844650001501862650002001877650001001897650001101907650001301918650003001931650001201961650001401973651001201987700001901999700002202018700002202040773017402062856005102236852000902287655001202296IND60586355820221116202534.0171120e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058635582DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-16-5092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJribi, Hela10aPrevalence of Putative Virulence Genes in Campylobacter and Arcobacter Species Isolated from Poultry and Poultry By-Products in Tunisia  ap. 1705-1710.  aCampylobacter and Arcobacter spp. are common causes of gastroenteritis in humans; these infections are commonly due to undercooked poultry. However, their virulence mechanism is still poorly understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of genotypic virulence markers in Campylobacter and Arcobacter species using PCR. The prevalence of virulence and cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) genes was estimated in 71 Campylobacteraceae isolates. PCR was used to detect the presence of virulence genes (iam, cadF, virB1, flaA, cdtA, cdtB, and cdtC) using specific primers for a total of 45 Campylobacter isolates, including 37 C. jejuni and 8 C. coli. All the Campylobacter isolates were positive for the cadF gene. The plasmid gene virB11 was not detected in any strain. The invasion associated marker was not detected in C. jejuni. Lower detection rates were observed for flaA, cdtA, cdtB, and cdtC. The presence of nine putative Arcobacter virulence genes (cadF, ciaB, cj1349, mviN, pldA, tlyA, irgA, hecA, and hecB) was checked in a set of 22 Arcobacter butzleri and 4 Arcobacter cryaerophilus isolates. The pldA and mviN genes were predominant (88.64%). Lower detection rates were observed for tlyA (84.76%), ciaB (84.61%), cadF and cj1349 (76.92%), IrgA and hecA (61.53%), and hecB (57.69%). The findings revealed that a majority of the Campylobacteraceae strains have these putative virulence genes that may lead to pathogenic effects in humans. 3aArcobacter butzleri 3aArcobacter cryaerophilus 3aCampylobacter 3abyproducts 3agastroenteritis 3agenes 3ahumans 3aplasmids 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apoultry 3avirulence 3aTunisia1 aSellami, Hanen1 aBen Hassena, Amal1 aGdoura, Radhouane0 tJournal of food protection.g2017 Oct., v. 80, no. 10 p.1705-1710dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-16-509  aDNAL 7aarticle03863naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245017700169300001800346520188200364650003002246650002302276650002502299650001802324650001602342650002602358650001202384650002602396650002902422650002102451650002102472650001702493650001702510650004402527650001802571650002502589650001802614650001102632650003202643650001502675650002802690650003402718650001202752650001602764650004302780650001502823650001702838650001302855650001402868650001002882700001702892700001702909700001802926700001802944700001302962700001602975773017402991856005103165852000903216655001203225IND60586355620221116202401.0171120e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058635562DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-17-0762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlakomi, H. L.10aEffect of Plant Antimicrobial Agents Containing Marinades on Storage Stability and Microbiological Quality of Broiler Chicken Cuts Packed with Modified Atmosphere Packaging  ap. 1689-1696.  aThe food industry, including the meat industry, is currently looking for natural preservatives to prevent the growth of harmful microbes in foods. The potential of plant-derived antimicrobial extracts to increase the shelf life and to delay the microbiological spoilage of marinated broiler chicken cuts in modified atmosphere packages during cold storage was investigated in this study. We evaluated the impact of aqueous ethanolic extracts of Finnish sea buckthorn berries and lingonberries and supercritical CO2-extracted herbal extracts from an antimicrobial blend and oregano leaves on the shelf life of broiler meat. The commercial antimicrobial blend extract and the oregano extract inhibited the growth of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and Brochothrix thermosphacta in the marinated samples. The antimicrobial blend extract also reduced the growth of psychrotrophic aerobic bacteria, whereas the sea buckthorn and lingonberry extracts did not. Only minor antimicrobial activity against Enterobacteriaceae by all the extracts was observed. Plate count analysis, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, and quantitative real-time PCR indicated that LAB, which are the major spoilage group in marinated modified atmosphere–packaged poultry products, were not significantly affected by the berry extracts studied. During this shelf-life study, LAB isolates of Lactobacillus and Leuconostoc were identified in the marinated samples. Antimicrobial blends and oregano leaf extracts can act as antimicrobial agents in marinade blends, although tailoring of the dose is needed because of their strong taste. Further studies for exploiting synergistic effects of plant extracts could contribute to the development of potential and more effective antimicrobial blends. Studies are needed in meat matrices and in product applications to demonstrate the efficacy of these compounds. 3aBrochothrix thermosphacta 3aEnterobacteriaceae 3aHippophae rhamnoides 3aLactobacillus 3aLeuconostoc 3aVaccinium vitis-idaea 3aaerobes 3aanti-infective agents 3aantimicrobial properties 3abiopreservatives 3abroiler chickens 3achicken meat 3acold storage 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3afood industry 3alactic acid bacteria 3aleaf extracts 3aleaves 3alivestock and meat industry 3amarinating 3amicrobiological quality 3amodified atmosphere packaging 3aoregano 3aplate count 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3ashelf life 3asmall fruits 3aspoilage 3asynergism 3ataste1 aMaukonen, J.1 aHonkapaa, K.1 aStorgards, E.1 aQuirin, K.

Approximately 27% of the DNA sequences from the Populus genome were homologous to protein-coding regions in the Arabidopsis genome. BLAST scores and synteny were used to infer orthologous relationships between the Populus and Arabidopsis homologs. The probability that any pair of genes on a single Populus BAC will have orthologs on the same Arabidopsis chromosome is 46%-58%, substantially greater than the 20% expectation if there is no conservation of synteny between the Populus and Arabidopsis genomes. Likewise, the probability that any pair of genes on a single Populus BAC will have orthologs on a single Arabidopsis BAC is 19%-25%, much higher than the 0.1% expected if the orthologs are randomly distributed. These results provide evidence for substantial "pockets" of conserved microcollinearity between regions of the Populus and Arabidopsis genomes as well as for conservation of synteny even when local gene collinearity is not preserved during genome evolution. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3asequence analysis 3aforest trees 3abacterial artificial chromosomes 3aPopulus balsamifera 3astructural genes 3anucleotide sequences 3agenomics 0acontigs 0agenome 0amolecular sequence data1 aYang, Z.K.1 aGunter, L.E.1 aTuskan, G.A.1 aBradshaw, H.D.

Wet deposition, dry deposition, and throughfall fluxes of ammonium and nitrate were measured during the 2000 and 2001 growing seasons. Estimation of CNU, for both ammonium and nitrate, was obtained by subtracting throughfall (TF) flux from the sum of wet deposition (WD) and dry deposition (DD): CNU = WD + DD - TF. CNU efficiency (CNU/(WD + DD)) for ammonium (0.9) was consistent across 2000 and 2001. For nitrate, this efficiency was 0.8 and 0.7 for 2000 and 2001, respectively. Foliar N requirement for growth in 2000 and 2001 was about 19 and 22 kg N.ha(-1).year(-1), respectively. Growing season estimates of CNU for 2000 and 2001 were approximately 2 and 3 kg N.ha(-1), respectively. Thus, CNU may contribute 10%-15% of the foliar N requirement for canopy growth. Mountain upslope winds bring substantial amounts of anthropogenic N to this forest during the growing season, thereby contributing to CNU. Given that a sizable fraction of CNU is anthropogenic in origin, the forest's N cycle has likely undergone substantial changes on a decadal time scale. 3afoliar uptake 3aatmospheric deposition 3acanopy 3amontane forests 3anitrogen 3aconiferous forests 3anutrient uptake 3anitrate nitrogen 3aconifer needles 3anutrient requirements 3aair pollution 3aammonium nitrogen 3abiogeochemical cycles 3aoverstory 3aColorado 0anitrogen content 0acanopy nitrogen uptake1 aBoyce, R.L.1 aSievering, H.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2003 Nov., v. 33, no. 11 p.2221-2227x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x03-1473Available from publisher's Web site  a20060305b20060402c00000000  aINDdCMMe2005/01/13  aNon-US 7aarticle02886naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072001700135072001700152072001700169072001700186100001400203245005800217300001800275500002300293520147100316650001201787650001501799650001801814650002101832650001301853650001501866650001401881650001201895650001401907650001301921650001701934650000901951650001801960650001601978650002601994651001102020700001802031700001502049700001502064700001402079773009802093852000902191856007502200930003302275945002502308946001102333655001202344IND4363453520221116202103.0040719e200311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436345352DNAL7 a10.1139/x03-1542doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Mean annual litterfall was very sensitive to typhoon frequency and intensity, ranging from 3 to 11 Mg.ha(-1).year(-1). Litterfall was significantly higher in years with strong typhoons than in years without typhoons, and the number of strong typhoons explained 82% of interannual variation in litterfall. Nutrient-use efficiency (dry mass/nutrients in litterfall) was high for N, but low for P compared with other tropical forests. This result supports the idea that the study forest is P limited but not N limited. Nutrient loss via litterfall represents a large percentage of aboveground biomass, especially during years with strong typhoons (e.g., 19%-41%, 15%-40%, 5%-12%, for N, P, and K, respectively). Forests that experience infrequent wind disturbance (e.g., temperate or boreal forests) can gradually regain any lost nutrients prior to the next disturbance; this is different from the situation observed in the Fushan Experimental Forest. At Fu-shan the pattern of not responding to typhoons with a flush of new growth appears to be an adaptation to the frequency with which there are multiple typhoons affecting the forest in a single year. Nutrient loss in litterfall caused by frequent typhoon disturbances appears to limit tree growth and contributes to the very low canopy height of the Fushan Experimental Forest. 3aforests 3asubtropics 3aforest litter 3anutrient content 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3acalcium 3amagnesium 3atyphoons 3aforest trees 3awind 3aforest damage 3atree damage 3abiogeochemical cycles 3aTaiwan1 aHamburg, S.P.1 aTang, S.L.1 aHsia, Y.J.1 aLin, T.C.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2003 Nov., v. 33, no. 11 p.2184-2192x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x03-1543Available from publisher's Web site  a20060305b20060402c00000000  aINDdCMMe2005/01/13  aNon-US 7aarticle03334naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002500181245018300206300001800389500002400407506007600431520161700507506003702124650002502161650002302186650001102209650001102220650002602231650001802257650002102275650001002296650002002306650001402326650001002340650001202350650001802362650001802380650000902398650001702407650001302424700002502437700002202462700002302484700002102507700002102528700001902549773013502568852000902703856008002712655001202792IND4434620220221207064754.0100326e20100401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443462022DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.02993-092doi7 aPMC28492622pmcid7 a201541052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHenderson, Sherri L.10aChanges in Denitrifier Abundance, Denitrification Gene mRNA Levels, Nitrous Oxide Emissions, and Denitrification in Anoxic Soil Microcosms Amended with Glucose and Plant Residues  ap. 2155-2164.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn agricultural cropping systems, crop residues are sources of organic carbon (C), an important factor influencing denitrification. The effects of red clover, soybean, and barley plant residues and of glucose on denitrifier abundance, denitrification gene mRNA levels, nitrous oxide (N₂O) emissions, and denitrification rates were quantified in anoxic soil microcosms for 72 h. nosZ gene abundances and mRNA levels significantly increased in response to all organic carbon treatments over time. In contrast, the abundance and mRNA levels of Pseudomonas mandelii and closely related species (nirSP) increased only in glucose-amended soil: the nirSP guild abundance increased 5-fold over the 72-h incubation period (P < 0.001), while the mRNA level significantly increased more than 15-fold at 12 h (P < 0.001) and then subsequently decreased. The nosZ gene abundance was greater in plant residue-amended soil than in glucose-amended soil. Although plant residue carbon-to-nitrogen (C:N) ratios varied from 15:1 to 30:1, nosZ gene and mRNA levels were not significantly different among plant residue treatments, with an average of 3.5 x 10⁷ gene copies and 6.9 x 10⁷ transcripts g⁻¹ dry soil. Cumulative N₂O emissions and denitrification rates increased over 72 h in both glucose- and plant-tissue-C-treated soil. The nirSP and nosZ communities responded differently to glucose and plant residue amendments. However, the targeted denitrifier communities responded similarly to the different plant residues under the conditions tested despite changes in the quality of organic C and different C:N ratios.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPseudomonas mandelii 3aTrifolium pratense 3abarley 3acarbon 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3acrop residues 3acropping systems 3acrops 3adenitrification 3aemissions 3agenes 3aglucose 3amessenger RNA 3anitrous oxide 3asoil 3asoil ecology 3asoybeans1 aDandie, Catherine E.1 aPatten, Cheryl L.1 aZebarth, Bernie J.1 aBurton, David L.1 aTrevors, Jack T.1 aGoyer, Claudia0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2010 Apr. 1, v. 76, no. 7 p.2155-2164dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.02993-093Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02118naa a2200361 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001800133245005700151300001800208500001500226520111800241650001201359650003001371650001501401650002801416650001801444650002401462650001101486651001301497653002101510653003201531773010501563852001301668939003301681945000801714946001301722852000901735655001201744991589117070742620221116202137.0880817e198712  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI880026602DNAL7 a36808312pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBroughton, J.10aFoodservice for the homeless: an innovative approach  ap. 1684-1685.  a2019-12-04  aA survey was conducted of shelters for the homeless in order to determine whether or not they served food and to obtain details of the foodservice or type of operation, problems encountered, use of donated food, and food funding.

Four centers employed registered dietitians to assist in meal planning. Respondents found problems in obtaining fresh foods and spices to make foods appealing; inadequate storage and cooking facilities; picking up donated foods from the USDA commodities and the Greater Chicago Food Depository; and obtaining funds from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and private donors. Guidance is essential in several areas: food volunteers need help to know what to prepare and when to bring food; shelter coordinators need instructions on stocking and purchasing the non-perishable, non-cooked foods; and shelter board members need a food budget and established nutrition criteria for use in planning. 3asurveys 3acommunity feeding centers 3adietitians 3afood service management 2aFood Services 2aIll-Housed Persons. 2aHumans 3aIllinois 0ahomeless persons 0afood and nutrition programs0 tJournal of the American Dietetic Association.g1987 Dec., v. 87, no. 12 p.1684-1685x0002-82237nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19880817c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle02938naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072001700135100001800152245005600170300001800226500002300244500001500267520163400282650001601916650001701932650002601949650001801975650001501993650002602008650001102034650001202045650002302057651001302080653003002093653001202123653002202135653001902157653002302176700001802199773009802217852000902315856007502324930003302399945002502432946001102457655001202468IND4363452120221116201316.0040719e200311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436345212DNAL7 a10.1139/x03-1312doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

A long-term study (11 years) was established to investigate the effects of selective pruning on radiata pine (Pinus radiata D. Don) stem growth. The 175 stems selected for the experiment had been pruned to 2.4 m at 6 years of age. At ages 8 and 10, the trees were pruned to 45%, 60%, or 75% of tree height and growth was compared with a control (first lift pruned only). Pruning to 45% of tree height had no effect on growth to age 13 years. Responses to the other treatments were apparent soon after pruning and continued until measurements ceased at 17 years of age. Pruning to 60% or 75% of tree height at second lift reduced diameter increment, and increment decreased as pruning severity increased. There was a further separation of the growth curves following third-lift pruning to 60% or 75% of tree height. The results suggested that maintaining a live crown ratio of 55% would minimize effects of pruning on diameter growth. The effect of severe pruning on diameter increment was greater for subdominant trees than for dominant stems. Pruning had less effect on height than diameter increment, but all treatments involving pruning to 75% of height at third lift resulted in trees that were approximately 10% shorter than unpruned trees at 13 years of age. More severe second-lift pruning resulted in smaller diameter over stubs at the time of third-lift pruning. Second-lift pruning to 60% of total height produced acceptable diameter over stubs. Implications for management are discussed. 3atree growth 3aforest trees 3along term experiments 3aPinus radiata 3atree crown 3aplant characteristics 3aheight 3apruning 3aforest plantations 3aTasmania 0athree-lift pruning system 0atopping 0aselective pruning 0apruning height 0adiameter increment1 aPinkard, E.A.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2003 Nov., v. 33, no. 11 p.2067-2073x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x03-1313Available from publisher's Web site  a20060305b20060402c00000000  aINDdCMMe2005/01/13  aNon-US 7aarticle03742naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245019000125300001600315500013900331500008200470500001500552520211700567650001702684650001902701650001402720650002502734650001102759650001302770650001402783650002602797650003202823650001702855650001802872651000902890653001602899653001502915653001302930653001002943653002402953653002402977653002203001653002103023653002403044700001603068773007403084852000903158930003303167945001303200946001103213655001203224IND2201477420221116201056.0991105e199904  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220147742DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalick, J.14aThe interplay of hybridization and clonal reproduction in the evolution of willows: experiments with hybrids of S. eriocephala [R] & S. exigua [X] and S. eriocephala & S. petiolaris [P]  ap. 163-178.  aIn the special issue: Clonal plants and environmental heterogeneity--space, time and scale / edited by C.

The interplay of hybridization and clonal reproduction was first proposed by Stebbins (1950), but previously has not been tested experimentally. Alternative models for the effects of hybridization include speciation, introgression, and swamping. Salix ssp. were chosen to test comparatively these hypotheses because they are easily hybridized and cloned. Over 500 separate crosses and backcrosses were made and over 6000 separate plants were measured in field experiments and statistically compared for significance to both evolutionary theory and plant breeding for biomass production. The F(1) hybrids in this study always equalled, and in the case of the hybrid PR, outperformed their parents in vegetative parameters. It seems likely that even without reproducing sexually, these F(1) hybrids could exist as successful individuals (sensu Stebbins 1950). However, it also seems likely that they would sexually reproduce: three of four F(1) hybrids studied (RX, RP, and PR) equalled or surpassed their parents in sexual parameters when crossing with at least one other accession. Of the alternative models, experimental data suggest that introgression would be the most likely outcome of a hybridization event. The hybrid XR, however, was partially sterile and performed poorly when crossing with all other accessions in its group except S. exigua (pistillate parent). Thus, this hybrid may fit Stebbins' model of a partially sterile yet vegetatively vigorous plant that can exist as a successful individual and make some contribution to interspecific gene flow over time. This is the first experimental study to confirm the evolutionary importance of clonal reproduction coupled with hybridization. However, distinguishing any of these evolutionary pathways would be difficult in nature using morphological techniques, as interspecific hybrids tend to resemble their pistillate parents in terms of leaf shape. 3abackcrossing 3aplant breeding 3aevolution 3aasexual reproduction 3aclones 3aapomixis 3agene flow 3afield experimentation 3ainterspecific hybridization 3aSalix exigua 3aintrogression 3aOhio 0aperformance 0aspeciation 0acrossing 0aSalix 0asexual reproduction 0apopulation genetics 0asalix eriocephala 0asalix petiolaris 0acompetitive ability1 aPfeffer, E.0 tPlant ecology.g1999 Apr., v. 141, no. 1/2 p.163-178x1385-02377nnas  aDNAL  a20000202b20000208c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle03254naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245012500124300001600249500013900265500008200404500001500486520177700501650002802278650002202306650001402328650001402342650002102356650001402377650001202391650001502403650002302418650002002441650001102461650001302472650001302485650001102498653002402509653002302533653001102556653002102567700001502588700001702603773007402620852000902694930003302703945001302736946001102749655001202760IND2201476320221116201306.0991105e199904  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220147632DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuber, H.10aSpatial structure of stoloniferous herbs: an interplay between structural blue-print, ontogeny and phenotypic plasticity  ap. 107-115.  aIn the special issue: Clonal plants and environmental heterogeneity--space, time and scale / edited by C.

Price.  aProceedings of a workshop held Sept. 9-14, 1997, University of Wales, Bangor.  a2019-12-05  aPlant form and spatial structure reflect the basic architectural blue-print of a plant. In most plant species, the expression of the structural blue-print is systematically altered during ontogeny resulting in predictable changes in the allometry of plant structures and in the types of structures that are produced. The expression of the structural blue-print or the timing of ontogenetic changes is also frequently altered by environmental conditions. This latter source of variability, referred to as phenotypic plasticity, is manifested through changes in the timing and rates of meristem initiation and development, the likelihood that meristems will remain dormant or commit to different demographic fates (i.e., vegetative vs. reproductive structures), or the size and structure of the organs formed. Complex interactions among these components can result in considerable differences in form and spatial structure among individuals of the same species. This paper focuses on the importance of these different components in determining the architecture of clonal plants with long internode connections between ramets. A case study is presented that attempts to separate ontogenetic variation and phenotypic plasticity in two stoloniferous species with different structural blue-prints, in their responses to shading. In both species the rate of ontogenetic development responded to intermediate shading levels, but only at very low levels of light availability did plastic changes in branch formation occur. Under shaded conditions the two species achieved similar changes in their architecture in conspicuously different ways. We discuss how different mechanisms leading to a given architecture can be distinguished and what the ecological implications of this are. 3ainterspecific variation 3aplant development 3aphenotype 3astem form 3aartificial shade 3ameristems 3astolons 3ainternodes 3aGlechoma hederacea 3alight intensity 3aclones 3adormancy 3abranches 3aleaves 0aspecies differences 0apotentilla reptans 0agrowth 0aplant morphology1 aLukacs, S.1 aWatson, M.A.0 tPlant ecology.g1999 Apr., v. 141, no. 1/2 p.107-115x1385-02377nnas  aDNAL  a20000202b20000208c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle01687naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002500112245005600137300001600193520077500209650001200984650002200996650001401018650001401032650001401046650001101060650001201071700002101083700002301104773016601127856008301293852000901376655001201385IND60586359820221116201148.0171121e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058635982DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGalinato, Gregmar I.14aThe Trade and Health Effects of Tobacco Regulations  ap. 350-371.  aWe  examine  how  cross-country  differences  in  tobacco  regulations  affect  tobacco  imports  and consumer health. We find that tobacco imports increase when a rich exporter’s tobacco regulations are stringent relative to the regulations of its poor importing trade partner. The main policy driver may  be  differences  in  marketing  and  counter-advertising  tobacco  regulations  between  trading partners. If  a  rich  exporting  country  adopts  counter-advertising  tobacco  regulations,  mortality and morbidity from tobacco-related diseases in the poor importing country increase by four and eighty smokers per million people annually, respectively. Our results highlight the importance of accounting for spillovers in an increasingly multilateral economy. 3aimports 3aissues and policy 3amarketing 3amorbidity 3amortality 3apeople 3atobacco1 aOlanie, Aaron Z.1 aYoder, Jonathan K.0 tJournal of agricultural and resource economics.g2017 Oct., v. 42, no. 3 p.350-371dWestern Agricultural Economics AssociationwJournal:jnl48977x1068-55027nnas40uhttp://www.waeaonline.org/UserFiles/file/JARESeptember20174Galinato350-371.pdf  aDNAL 7aarticle03315naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245011800170300001800288520172000306650002102026650001502047650002602062650001602088650002402104650001902128650001002147650001502157650001602172650002002188650001802208650003802226650001502264650001002279650001302289650003102302650001402333650001402347650001302361650001702374650001402391651001202405700002002417700001802437700002602455700002102481700001802502700001902520773017402539856005102713852000902764655001202773IND60586359220221116201152.0171121e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058635922DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-16-3242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBen Said, Leila10aFirst Detection of CTX-M-1 in Extended-Spectrum β-Lactamase–Producing Escherichia coli in Seafood from Tunisia  ap. 1877-1881.  aThe purpose of this study was to determine the carriage rate of Escherichia coli isolates in seafood, to analyze the phenotype and genotype of antimicrobial resistance in the recovered isolates, and to characterize extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) E. coli producers. E. coli isolates were recovered from 24 (34.3%) of the 70 seafood samples analyzed, and one isolate per sample was further characterized. Antibiotic resistance was determined by the disk diffusion method in the 24 isolates, with the following results (number of resistant isolates): tetracycline (8), streptomycin (7), ampicillin (6), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (4), chloramphenicol (4), ciprofloxacin (3), cefotaxime (2), and ceftazidime (2). Six isolates showed a multiresistant phenotype (including at least three families of antibiotics). Among tetracycline-resistant E. coli isolates, tet(A) was detected in five isolates and tet(B) in two isolates. The qnr(A) or aac(6′)-1b-cr genes were detected in two ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli isolates, and the sul2 gene in two trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole–resistant isolates. ESBL-containing E. coli isolates, carrying the blaCTX-M-1 gene, were detected in 2 of the 70 seafood samples, obtained from gilt-head bream aquaculture. The ESBL isolates were typed phylogenetically and by multilocus sequence typing, and they were ascribed to lineage ST48/A and to the new ST3497/B1; these isolates carried the fimA, aer, and papGIII virulence genes. One of the ESBL-producing E. coli isolates carried an unusual class 1 integron (with the array dfr32-ereA-aadA1). Seafood could be a source of multiresistant E. coli isolates for the aquatic environment, and these could enter the food chain. 3aEscherichia coli 3aampicillin 3aantibiotic resistance 3aaquaculture 3aaquatic environment 3abeta-lactamase 3abream 3acefotaxime 3aceftazidime 3achloramphenicol 3aciprofloxacin 3adisk diffusion antimicrobial test 3afood chain 3agenes 3agenotype 3amultilocus sequence typing 3aphenotype 3aphylogeny 3aseafoods 3astreptomycin 3avirulence 3aTunisia1 aHamdaoui, Mouna1 aJouini, Ahlem1 aBoudabous, Abdellatif1 aBen Slama, Karin1 aKlibi, Naouel1 aTorres, Carmen0 tJournal of food protection.g2017 Nov., v. 80, no. 11 p.1877-1881dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-16-324  aDNAL 7aarticle03657naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245008300126300001600209500014100225500002400366520215500390650000902545650001202554650001102566650001002577650001402587650002302601650002302624650001202647650001902659650001902678650002602697650002002723650001802743650002402761650000902785650001202794650001502806650001602821650002302837650001702860700001702877700001902894700002402913700001602937773014002953852000903093856004903102655001203151IND4457887520221116201504.0110512s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445788752DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrant, O.M.10aApplication of deficit irrigation to controlling growth of hardy nursery stock  ap. 409-416.  aPaper presented at the Sixth International Symposium on Irrigation of Horticultural Crops, held November 2-6, 2009, Vina del Mar, Chile.  aIncludes references  aDeficit irrigation (DI) has proved successful in saving water without severely impacting on yield for a variety of fruit-producing crops. The potential application of DI to hardy nursery stock (HNS) crops, however, has received less attention. Since growth control of many HNS cultivars requires substantial labour investment, the possibility of reducing labour inputs by controlling growth via irrigation scheduling is appealing to growers. Additionally, water costs and the increasing difficulty of obtaining abstraction licences have led to grower interest in reducing water consumption. We aimed, firstly, to determine whether DI could be applied to control growth of selected HNS cultivars without damaging quality, using a highly uniform drip irrigation system. Secondly, we determined the extent to which the benefits of DI were affected by the non-uniformity of water uptake inherent under overhead irrigation, as a result of variation between plants in canopy size, water use, and uptake from the surface on which the pots stand. We also investigated whether DI had different effects depending on the type of growing substrate. Finally, we compared scheduling of DI using an evaporimeter with scheduling using soil moisture sensors. The potential of thermal imaging for scheduling DI was also investigated. The results show that DI successfully controlled growth without deteriorating quality, whether overhead or drip irrigation was used, and whether plants were grown in 100% peat or a peat/ bark mix. Scheduling of a specific severity of DI was more difficult using soil moisture sensors than the evaporimeter, and thus biomass was not reduced in a relatively mild DI treatment (70% crop evapotranspiration) when soil moisture sensors were used. On the other hand, when the evaporimeter was used, growth was significantly reduced either when this mild DI treatment was imposed over the whole growing season or when a more severe DI treatment (50% crop evapotranspiration) was imposed only after pruning in late June. On warm, clear days, thermal images showed notably increased canopy temperatures under DI compared to control irrigation. 3abark 3abiomass 3acanopy 3acrops 3acultivars 3adeficit irrigation 3aevapotranspiration 3agrowers 3agrowing season 3aimage analysis 3airrigation scheduling 3amicroirrigation 3anursery stock 3aoverhead irrigation 3apeat 3apruning 3asoil water 3atemperature 3awater conservation 3awater uptake1 aDavies, M.J.1 aLongbottom, H.1 aHarrison-Murray, R.1 aHerrero, A.0 tActa horticulturae.g2011 Mar., , no. 889 p.409-416dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/889/889_51.htm 7aarticle03546naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245013900167300001800306520199400324650002202318650002702340650002602367650002402393650001702417650001402434650002002448650002202468650002802490650002202518650001002540650001802550650000902568650000902577650002102586650001302607650004302620650001402663651001302677700002102690700001702711700001602728700002202744700002102766700001902787773017402806856005102980852000903031655001203040IND60586358320221116201315.0171121e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058635832DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-17-1332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAfroj, Sayma10aSimultaneous Detection of Multiple Salmonella Serovars from Milk and Chicken Meat by Real-Time PCR Using Unique Genomic Target Regions  ap. 1944-1957.  aA novel genomic and plasmid target-based PCR platform was developed for the detection of Salmonella serovars Heidelberg, Dublin, Hadar, Kentucky, and Enteritidis. Unique genome loci were obtained through extensive genome mining of protein databases and comparative genomic analysis of these serovars. Assays targeting Salmonella serovars Hadar, Heidelberg, Kentucky, and Dublin had 100% specificity and sensitivity, whereas those for Salmonella Enteritidis had 97% specificity and 88% sensitivity. The limits of detection for Salmonella serovars Heidelberg, Kentucky, Hadar, Enteritidis, and Dublin were 12, 9, 40, 13, and 5,280 CFU, respectively. A sensitivity assay was also performed by using milk artificially inoculated with pooled Salmonella serovars, yielding a detection limit of 1 to10 CFU/25 mL of milk samples after enrichment. The minimum DNA detected using the multiplexed TaqMan assay was 75.8 fg (1.53 × 10(1) genomic equivalents [GE]) for Salmonella Heidelberg, 140.8 fg (2.8 × 10(1) GE) for Salmonella Enteritidis, and 3.48 pg (6.96 × 10(2) GE) for Salmonella Dublin. PCR efficiencies were 89.8% for Salmonella Heidelberg, 94.5% for Salmonella Enteritidis, and 75.5% for Salmonella Dublin. Four types of 30 pasteurized milk samples were tested negative by culture techniques and with a genus-specific Salmonella invA gene PCR assay. Among 30 chicken samples similarly tested, 12 (40%) were positive by both culture and the invA PCR. Testing of these 12 samples with the serovar-specific PCR assay detected single and mixed contamination with Salmonella Kentucky, Salmonella Enteritidis, and Salmonella Heidelberg. Five unique primers were designed and tested by multiplex conventional PCR in conjunction with the use of the multiplex TaqMan assay with three of the primers. The diagnostic assays developed in this study could be used as tools for routine detection of these five Salmonella serovars and for epidemiological investigations of foodborne disease outbreaks. 3aSalmonella Dublin 3aSalmonella Enteritidis 3aSalmonella Heidelberg 3aSalmonella Kentucky 3achicken meat 3adatabases 3adetection limit 3adisease outbreaks 3aepidemiological studies 3afoodborne illness 3agenes 3agenome mining 3aloci 3amilk 3apasteurized milk 3aplasmids 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aserotypes 3aKentucky1 aAldahami, Khaled1 aReddy, Gopal1 aGuard, Jean1 aAdesiyun, Abiodun1 aSamuel, Temesgen1 aAbdela, Woubit0 tJournal of food protection.g2017 Nov., v. 80, no. 11 p.1944-1957dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-17-133  aDNAL 7aarticle00990naa a2200265 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245004600132300001200178520026600190650002200456650002300478650001400501650002700515650002300542773008400565852000900649939003300658945000800691946001300699655001200712991589114490742620221116201041.0880705e198802  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI880018492DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThomas, P.R.10aListeria: coming soon to a food near you?  ap. 1-3.  aA technical report discusses the prevalence of morbidity and mortality by listeria monocytogenes in contaminated foods.

With great regularity, particular species establish only poorly. More reliable establishment could improve outcome of restoration projects and increase cost-effectiveness. We investigated the abiotic germination niche of ten poorly establishing calcareous grassland species by simultaneously exploring the effects of moisture and light availability and temperature fluctuation on percentage germination and speed of germination. We also investigated the effects of three different pre-treatments used to enhance seed germination – cold-stratification, osmotic priming and priming in combination with gibberellic acid (GA3) – and how these affected abiotic germination niches. Species varied markedly in width of abiotic germination niche, ranging from Carex flacca with very strict abiotic requirements, to several species reliably germinating across the whole range of abiotic conditions. Our results suggest pronounced differences between species in gap requirements for establishment. Germination was improved in most species by at least one pre-treatment. Evidence for positive effects of adding GA3 to seed priming solutions was limited. In several species, pre-treated seeds germinated under a wider range of abiotic conditions than untreated seeds. Improved knowledge of species-specific germination niches and the effects of seed pre-treatments may help to improve species establishment by sowing, and to identify species for which sowing at a later stage of restoration or introduction as small plants may represent a more viable strategy. 3aCarex 3acost effectiveness 3agibberellic acid 3agrasslands 3aniches 3apretreatment 3aseed germination 3aseed priming 3aseeds 3asowing 3asward 3atemperature1 aPywell, Richard F.1 aKnopp, Tatjana1 aBullock, James M.1 aHeard, Matthew S.0 tSeed science research.g2011 June, v. 21, no. 2 p.117-131dCABI Pubx0960-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S09602585100004503Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02741naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245011700126300001600243500014100259500002400400520147600424650002301900650001401923650001501937650002101952650002601973650002501999650001102024650001502035650002302050650001902073700001502092700001402107700002002121700001602141773014002157852000902297856004902306655001202355IND4457884820221116201117.0110512s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445788482DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPacheco, D.10aPlant and soil water status behavior under different irrigation strategies in cultivar 'Arbequina' olive orchard  ap. 311-316.  aPaper presented at the Sixth International Symposium on Irrigation of Horticultural Crops, held November 2-6, 2009, Vina del Mar, Chile.  aIncludes references  aThe aim of the present work was to evaluate the behaviour of different plant and soil physiological parameters in order to use them as an olive irrigation scheduling tool. Several irrigation treatments, based on regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) strategies, were applied to a six-year-old high density olive orchard (‘Arbequina’): (T3) RDI from fruit set to harvest, (T2) RDI during pit hardening period and (T1) fully irrigated as a control. The soil water content (SWC) was continuously measured with a capacitive (FDR) sensor in order to manage the irrigation strategies. Pre-dawn ((psi)pre-dawn), midday ((psi)l) and stem ((psi)stem) water potentials were periodically measured, showing a high correlation among them (R2>0.7). There was a low correlation among the three water potential measurements and the SWC (R2<0.4) when the whole stress period was evaluated. Nevertheless, a few days after the beginning of the T2 treatment a higher correlation (R2=0.60) was observed between (psi)pre-dawn versus SWC. During the same period, (psi)pre-dawn was more sensitive to water deficit indicating that it is the most reliable tool for irrigation scheduling. However, the high correlation between (psi)pre-dawn/(psi)l and (psi)pre-dawn/(psi)stem and the low vapor pressure deficit (VPD) influence observed in diurnal measurements on leaf water potential make the use of such diurnal indicators interesting due to their ease when incorporated into commercial orchards. 3adeficit irrigation 3afruit set 3aharvesting 3airrigation rates 3airrigation scheduling 3aleaf water potential 3aolives 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3avapor pressure1 aOlguin, A.1 aBueno, L.1 aVita Serman, F.1 aCapraro, F.0 tActa horticulturae.g2011 Mar., , no. 889 p.311-316dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/889/889_37.htm 7aarticle02281naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245010500125300001600230500014100246500002400387520111400411650001201525650002301537650001601560650001901576650001801595650002001613650001101633650001901644650001601663650001001679651001001689700002201699773014001721852000901861856004901870655001201919IND4457884920221116201105.0110512s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445788492DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlores, F.10aEffect of three levels of water application on oil yield and quality for an olive ('Picual') orchard  ap. 317-322.  aPaper presented at the Sixth International Symposium on Irrigation of Horticultural Crops, held November 2-6, 2009, Vina del Mar, Chile.  aIncludes references  aAn experiment was carried out to study the effect of three levels of water application on yield and oil quality for an olive (‘Picual’) orchard, located in the Pencahue Valley, Maule Region of Chile (35°23’ S; 71°44’ W), during the 2007-2008 growing season.

Fruit yield showed significant differences among treatments where T2 presented the highest yield (15.5 t ha-1). However, oil yield was not affected by the levels of water application. Oil yield varied between 2.3 t ha-1 and 2.5 t ha-1. Also, results indicate that there were not significant differences on oil content, acidity, peroxide number, K270, and K232. However, the total polyphenols for T2 and T3 were greater than those for T1. 3aacidity 3aevapotranspiration 3afruit yield 3agrowing season 3alipid content 3amicroirrigation 3aolives 3aperoxide value 3apolyphenols 3atrees 3aChile1 aOrtega-Farias, S.0 tActa horticulturae.g2011 Mar., , no. 889 p.317-322dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/889/889_38.htm 7aarticle01356naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245006100132300001400193500001500207520054200222650002000764650001200784650002000796650002300816650001200839653001400851653001900865653002300884773006400907852000900971939003300980945000801013946000901021655001201030991589114160742620221116201124.0800103e197812  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI794569352DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeimer, Jon.10aPick your own and roadside stands: Who's buying and why?  ap. 23-25.  a2019-12-06  aThe Farmer-to-Consumer Direct Marketing Act was designed to support and promote direct marketing activities.

A comparison was made between crown development in closed understorey forest sites (low light) and in canopy gaps (high light); development was expressed by plant traits at multiple levels or organisation. Dicorynia and Vouacapoua responded to gap creation at all organisation levels, but not for all traits. Both species increased their light interception efficiency in the understorey. Firstly, understorey trees produced relatively wide crowns because they did not favour the growth of shoots in the summit of the crown, as did gap trees. Secondly, they reduced self-shading (expressed by leaf area index) by lower sympodial unit production rates lower leaf production rates per growth unit (only Vouacapoua), and smaller leaf size (only Dicorynia). The reduction in self-shading was weakened by other traits that had the opposite effect on self shading (e.g. longer leaf life span in understorey), and cannot be considered an adaptive response in itself. (3) Understorey trees of Vouacapoua reduced leaf display costs by producing a higher specific leaf area, a shorter space among leaves, a smaller leaf spacing to leaf size ratio, and a longer leaf life span. Thus, all traits contributed to the more economical use of carbon in the understorey. Dicorynia showed the same trends, but not significantly. These result suggest that light availability plays a major role in the development and morphology of trees through its influences at multiple levels of organisation within the crown hierarchy. The two species studied were rather similar in their response at crown level, while they sometimes differed in their responses at the underlying lower organisational levels. The response directions of some individual plant traits were similar for the tall trees studied here and small saplings studied elsewhere. Some of traits investigated here may not be important in the crown level responses of smaller seedling and saplings, while they are important mechanisms for crown level responses in taller trees. 3ainterspecific variation 3atropical rain forests 3aplant development 3aforest trees 3atree age 3aFabaceae 3aleaf area index 3alight intensity 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3acanopy gaps 3abiomass production 3aunderstory 0aspecies differences 0ainterception 0aefficiency 0avouacapoua americana 0acrown 0adicorynia guianensis 0alight0 tPlant ecology.g1999 July, v. 143, no. 1 p.89-98x1385-02377nnas  aDNAL  a20000404b20000411c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle02719naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245013000124300001400254500001500268520138100283650002201664650001901686650003101705650001501736650001401751650001201765650001201777650002001789650002801809650002701837650003601864650001901900650002001919650002101939650001101960653002401971653002801995653001102023653001102034653001602045700001402061700001402075773007002089852000902159930003302168945001302201946001102214655001202225IND2202095520221116201030.0991228e199907  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220209552DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEinig, W.10aGrowth rate, photosynthetic activity, and leaf development of Brazil pine seedlings (Araucaria angustifolia [Bert.] O. Ktze.)  ap. 23-28.  a2019-12-05  aSeedlings of Brazil pine, a large-seeded South American conifer, were grown in a climate chamber to investigate vertical growth pattern and the time course of leaf development. We examined shoot growth, photosynthetic performance and markers of leaf maturation such as contents of soluble sugars and activities of sucrose-phosphate synthase (SPS), neutral invertase (nI) and sucrose synthase (Susy). The daily increment of shoot length showed an optimum curve during the first 70 days after germination. The low growth rate during the first 20 days of development correlated with net CO(2) emission of the seedling. Analyses of leaf maturation markers in older seedlings revealed low sucrose/hexose ratios and high activities of nI and Susy in the uppermost leaves. Although the SPS/Susy ratio was low in these leaves the extractable SPS activity did not change significantly among leaves of different age. The photosynthetic light compensation points of young leaves were about 2-fold higher than those of mature leaves and their photosynthetic capacity was only 50% as high. Our results indicate that a rapid maturation of leaves of Brazil pine seedlings may reduce the respiratory loss of carbohydrates and that the mobilisation of seed storage compounds supports initial shoot growth under light-limiting conditions which may occur in the forest-grassland succession zone. 3aplant development 3acarbon dioxide 3asucrose-phosphate synthase 3abiomarkers 3aseedlings 3asucrose 3ahexoses 3aconifer needles 3abeta-fructofuranosidase 3aAraucaria angustifolia 3achemical constituents of plants 3aphotosynthesis 3aenzyme activity 3asucrose synthase 3ashoots 0ahexosyltransferases 0acarbohydrate metabolism 0aratios 0agrowth 0agrowth rate1 aMertz, A.1 aHampp, R.0 tPlant ecology.g1999 July, v. 143, no. 1 p.23-28x1385-02377nnas  aDNAL  a20000404b20000411c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle03225naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245005200182300001600234500002400250520164700274650001301921650002001934650001401954650001201968650002601980650001602006650002602022650001402048650001902062650001202081650002502093650002202118650000902140650002002149650002202169650000902191650002202200650003502222650001102257650003402268650003302302650003902335650002402374650003702398650003102435773013502466852000902601856008502610655001202695IND4457842520221116201102.0110509s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445784252DNAL7 a210923642pmid7 a10.1017/S00296651100039272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoopman, Rene10aDietary protein and exercise training in ageing  ap. 104-113.  aIncludes references  aAgeing is accompanied by a progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength, leading to the loss of functional capacity and an increased risk for developing chronic metabolic diseases such as diabetes. The age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass results from a chronic disruption in the balance between muscle protein synthesis and degradation. As basal muscle protein synthesis rates are likely not different between healthy young and elderly human subjects, it was proposed that muscles from older adults lack the ability to regulate the protein synthetic response to anabolic stimuli, such as food intake and physical activity. Indeed, the dose– response relationship between myofibrillar protein synthesis and the availability of essential amino acids and/or resistance exercise intensity is shifted down and to the right in elderly human subjects. This so-called ‘anabolic resistance’ represents a key factor responsible for the age-related decline in skeletal muscle mass. Interestingly, long-term resistance exercise training is effective as a therapeutic intervention to augment skeletal muscle mass, and improves functional performance in the elderly. The consumption of different types of proteins, i.e. protein hydrolysates, can have different stimulatory effects on muscle protein synthesis in the elderly, which may be due to their higher rate of digestion and absorption. Current research aims to elucidate the interactions between nutrition, exercise and the skeletal muscle adaptive response that will define more effective strategies to maximise the therapeutic benefits of lifestyle interventions in the elderly. 3adiabetes 3adietary protein 3adigestion 3aelderly 3aessential amino acids 3afood intake 3aintestinal absorption 3alifestyle 3amuscle protein 3amuscles 3aprotein hydrolysates 3aprotein synthesis 3arisk 3askeletal muscle 3astrength training 2aAged 2aAgingxphysiology 2aDietary Proteinsxpharmacology 2aHumans 2aMuscle Proteinsxbiosynthesis 2aMuscle, Skeletalxphysiology 2aProtein Hydrolysatesxpharmacology 2aResistance Training 2aSarcopeniaxprevention & control 2aWeight Liftingxphysiology0 tProceedings of the Nutrition Society.g2011, v. 70, no. 1 p.104-113dCABI Pub. on behalf of the Nutrition Societyx0029-66517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00296651100039273Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02880naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002400164245008700188300001400275500002400289520130900313650001101622650001801633650002101651650001601672650003101688650001001719650001701729650001401746650002101760650002301781650001501804650004301819650001201862650001201874650000901886650001201895650000901907650002401916650001601940650001101956650001101967650004901978650003402027650001402061650004802075773013302123852000902256856008502265655001202350IND4457841820221116201135.0110509s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445784182DNAL7 a212660932pmid7 a10.1017/S00296651100040272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLillycrop, Karen A.10aEffect of maternal diet on the epigenome: implications for human metabolic disease  ap. 64-72.  aIncludes references  aThe rapid increase in the incidence of chronic non-communicable diseases over the past two decades cannot be explained solely by genetic and adult lifestyle factors. There is now considerable evidence that the fetal and early postnatal environment also strongly influences the risk of developing such diseases in later life. Human studies have shown that low birth weight is associated with an increased risk of CVD, type II diabetes, obesity and hypertension, although recent studies have shown that over-nutrition in early life can also increase susceptibility to future metabolic disease. These findings have been replicated in a variety of animal models, which have shown that both maternal under- and over-nutrition can induce persistent changes in gene expression and metabolism within the offspring. The mechanism by which the maternal nutritional environment induces such changes is beginning to be understood and involves the altered epigenetic regulation of specific genes. The demonstration of a role for altered epigenetic regulation of genes in the developmental induction of chronic diseases raises the possibility that nutritional or pharmaceutical interventions may be used to modify long-term cardio-metabolic disease risk and combat this rapid rise in chronic non-communicable diseases. 3aadults 3aanimal models 3achronic diseases 3aepigenetics 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahypertension 3alifestyle 3alow birth weight 3amaternal nutrition 3ametabolism 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aobesity 3aprogeny 3arisk 2aAnimals 2aDiet 2aEpigenesis, Genetic 2aEpigenomics 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMaternal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aMetabolic Syndromexgenetics. 2aPregnancy 2aPrenatal Exposure Delayed Effectsxgenetics0 tProceedings of the Nutrition Society.g2011, v. 70, no. 1 p.64-72dCABI Pub. on behalf of the Nutrition Societyx0029-66517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00296651100040273Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02528naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002400148245008500172300001800257500002400275520130500299650001601604650001601620650002601636650001701662650001201679650004301691650001301734650001301747650002301760650001401783650002001797650002401817700002101841700002901862700002301891700002401914773008301938852000902021856008802030655001202118IND4457838220221116201637.0110509s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445783822DNAL7 a10.3109/13880209.2010.4895642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYousefzadi, Morteza10aOptimization of podophyllotoxin extraction method from Linum album cell cultures  ap. 1421-1425.  aIncludes references  aContext: Suspension cultures of Linum album Kotschy ex Boiss. (Linaceae) accumulate podophyllotoxin (an anticancer agent) and could therefore serve as an alternative source of this important aryltetralin lactone lignan. Objective: The present work compared four podophyllotoxin extraction methods and optimization of the best one by using single factor experiments. Materials and methods: Linum album cell cultures were established from in vitro plantlets and subcultured in MS medium with hormones every 7–8 days. Four podophyllotoxin extraction methods were assayed and the best one was optimized by single factor experiments, studying the effect of methanol concentration, extraction time, and sonication time. Results: Cell cultures accumulated enough podophyllotoxin to be analyzed by HPLC. The methanol/dichloromethane and buffer extraction methods were found to be the best. Methanol alone and hot ethanol were not effective for extracting podophyllotoxin. Discussion and conclusion: The optimized method based on methanol/dichloromethane extraction combined with HPLC quantification was able to determine small amounts of podophyllotoxin in Linum album cell cultures, showing that this system could constitute a possible alternative source of podophyllotoxin to Podophyllum (Berberidaceae). 3aLinum album 3aPodophyllum 3aantineoplastic agents 3acell culture 3aethanol 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahormones 3amethanol 3amethylene chloride 3aplantlets 3apodophyllotoxin 3asystem optimization1 aSharifi, Mozafar1 aChashmi, Najmeh Ahmadian1 aBehmanesh, Mehrdad1 aGhasempour, Alireza0 tPharmaceutical biology.g2010 Dec., v. 48, no. 12 p.1421-1425x1388-02097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3109/13880209.2010.4895643Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03456naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002500148245019000173300001800363500002400381500001500405520165000420650002702070650002402097650001402121650001802135650001402153650002502167650002102192650002502213650001202238650002102250650001902271650002802290650003302318650001702351650002502368650001302393650002502406650001002431650001802441650001602459650002502475650001902500653001702519653002502536653001702561700003002578700002802608700003302636700002902669773008302698852000902781856008802790655001202878IND4457838320221116201537.0110509s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445783832DNAL7 a10.3109/13880209.2010.4895652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaghavendra, Ramappa10aProtective effect of partially purified 35 kDa protein from silk worm (Bombyx mori) fecal matter against carbon tetrachloride induced hepatotoxicity and in vitro anti-viral properties  ap. 1426-1431.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aContext: It has been found that many proteins from silkworm (Bombyx mori L.) fecal matter have been active against human immunodeficiency virus, Sendai virus, herpes simplex virus type-1, and nuclear polyhedrosis virus. Objective: A partially purified 35 kDa protein from silkworm was screened for its hepatoprotective activity, and in vitro antioxidant, and antiviral properties against camelpox and goatpox viruses. Materials and methods: The study investigated the efficiency of the partially purified 35kDa protein from silk worm fecal matter against CCl4-induced liver damage measured in terms of enzyme levels such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine amino transferase(ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and total bilirubin, which maintain liver integrity. In vitro antioxidant potential of this protein was determined based on its ability to scavenge 2, 2-diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and superoxide anions scavenging activity. Further, in vitro cytotoxic effect on Vero cells and antiviral activity against goatpox and camelpox viruses were also studied. Results: The protein had significant hepatoprotection against CCl4-induced liver damage and scavenging of DPPH radical and superoxide anion activity. However, the protein did not inhibit the multiplication of either virus tested at its maximum non-toxic concentration (MNTC) in vitro. Discussion and conclusion: The partially purified 35 kDa protein from silk worm Bombyx mori L fecal matter possessed protective effect against CCl4-induced oxidative stress in rat model. The protein was found to be ineffective against camelpox and goatpox viruses at its MNTC in vitro. 3aaspartate transaminase 3aMurine respirovirus 3abilirubin 3aBaculoviridae 3asilkworms 3acarbon tetrachloride 3aoxidative stress 3aalanine transaminase 3aviruses 3asuperoxide anion 3aherpes simplex 3ahepatoprotective effect 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3acytotoxicity 3aantioxidant activity 3aproteins 3aantiviral properties 3aliver 3aanimal models 3aBombyx mori 3aalkaline phosphatase 3ahepatotoxicity 0aSendai virus 0aNucleopolyhedrovirus 0aantioxidants1 aNeelagund, Shivayogeeswar1 aKuluvar, Gouthamchandra1 aBhanuprakash, Veerakyathappa1 aRevanaiah, Yogisharadhya0 tPharmaceutical biology.g2010 Dec., v. 48, no. 12 p.1426-1431x1388-02097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3109/13880209.2010.4895653Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01811naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245015700128300001600285500001500301520087800316650002401194650001601218650002001234650001601254650001801270653001701288700001401305700001701319700001601336773008001352852000901432939003301441946001101474655001201485IND9303446620221116201423.0930604s1993    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930344662DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHendrickx, M.10aGeneralized (semi)-empirical formulae for optimal sterilization temperatures of conduction-heated foods with infinite surface heat transfer coefficients  ap. 141-158.  a2019-12-04  aA computer program was developed to model heat sterilization of one-dimensional conduction-heated foods with negligible surface resistance to heat transfer. The optimal sterilization temperature, defined as the processing temperature that results in a food product with minimum surface cook-value after achieving the desired degree of sterility, was calculated as a function of food properties (thermal diffusivity, Z-value of the quality factor), processing conditions (dimensions and geometry of the food or container, initial temperature of the product, heating medium come-up-time) and processing criteria (target F0-value). The initial temperature of the food and the heating medium come-up-time have a minor effect on the optimal temperature. Generalized (semi)-empirical formulae relating optimal sterilization temperatures and all relevant variables were developed. 3amathematical models 3asterilizing 3afood processing 3atemperature 3aheat transfer 0aoptimization1 aSilva, C.1 aOliveira, F.1 aTobback, P.0 tJournal of food engineering.g1993, v. 19, no. 2 p.141-158x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01353naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245003600165300001400201500002400215520061700239650001300856650001200869650001500881650001000896773008700906852000900993856008501002655001201087IND4457882620221116201732.0110512s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445788262DNAL7 a10.1017/S09602585110000312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRadtke, Troy M.10aGranivore seed-size preferences  ap. 81-83.  aIncludes references  aAlthough seed-size preference by granivores is relative to the sizes of seeds offered by researchers, preferences are often inappropriately discussed and interpreted as if they are for absolute seed sizes.

These results are consistent with predictions of optimal foraging theory.

Batsch ‘Flordastar’ on GF-677 peach rootstock) planted in drainage lysimeters (5×5×1.5 m) with a clay loam textured soil located in southern Spain was determined during a 24-month period. Trees were drip irrigated during the night using one lateral pipe per tree row and eight emitters per tree, each delivering 2 L h-1. Tree irrigation requirements were determined according to daily reference crop evapotranspiration (ET(o)) by the Penman-Monteith equation, a crop factor based on the time of the year and the percent of ground area shaded by tree canopy. The water balance parameters are shown and discussed. The measured crop water use followed the same trend as the ET(o), increasing with time, but reaching a peak in August, a shift of 1.5 months compared with the peak in ET(o). The crop coefficient (K(c)) was calculated using the measured crop water use and the ET(o) values. Over the two years, K(c) increased gradually, beginning with irrigation in February and extending to early May. There was a brief fall at the end May in K(c), followed by a recovery in early June until a maximum K(c) was reached in August. This was followed by a rapid decline in K(c) in mid November, when irrigation ended. The crop coefficients calculated on the basis of a water balance would have saved up to 33 and 17% for 2007 and 2008, respectively, in irrigation water compared to the FAO-56 recommendations. 3airrigation water 3aevapotranspiration 3acanopy 3apeaches 3amicroirrigation 3asoil 3atrees 3aPrunus persica 3acrop coefficient 3aplanting 3arootstocks 3airrigation requirement 0awater balance1 aVera, J.1 aConejero, W.1 aAbrisqueta, J.M.1 aRuiz-Sanchez, M.C.1 aTapia, L.M.0 tActa horticulturae.g2011 Mar., , no. 889 p.175-180dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/889/889_19.htm 7aarticle02129naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245010800126300001600234500014100250500002400391500001500415520092300430650001001353650001401363650001501377650001701392650001101409650002101420650000901441650001701450650001901467650001301486653001801499700001401517700001401531773014001545852000901685856004901694655001201743IND4457881820221116201833.0110512s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445788182DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrisson, N.10aOn the interest of introducing irrigation and changing practices tomorrow in some French vineyard areas  ap. 167-174.  aPaper presented at the Sixth International Symposium on Irrigation of Horticultural Crops, held November 2-6, 2009, Vina del Mar, Chile.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aThe study aims at analyzing modifications in vine cropping conditions due to climate change for some well known French vineyards and at considering the opportunities of introducing irrigation or changing other cropping options. It is part of a more important modeling project on various cropping systems, CLIMATOR, from which were extracted simulations on four locations with two models: a growth and yield model (STICS) and a vine water balance model (BHV). The results show that a slight increase in water stress has to be feared for the next 50 years but the most harmful consequence for wine quality is probably the long term increase in thermal maturation conditions. As far as the increase in water stress is concerned, technical adaptations such as irrigation, changing soil or planting densities could be considered while changing genotype leads to some contrarily effects regarding water and thermal stresses. 3avines 3avineyards 3airrigation 3awine quality 3amodels 3acropping systems 3asoil 3awater stress 3aclimate change 3agenotype 0awater balance1 aPieri, P.1 aLebon, E.0 tActa horticulturae.g2011 Mar., , no. 889 p.167-174dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/889/889_18.htm 7aarticle02794naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245010700132300001500239500014100254500002400395520153600419650001901955650001101974650002601985650001702011650002102028650001402049650001302063650001102076650001502087650001002102650001402112650002002126650002502146651001302171700001602184773013902200852000902339856004802348655001202396IND4457879620221116194230.0110512s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445787962DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIntrigliolo, D.S.10aEffects of light interception and canopy orientation on grapevine water status and canopy gas exchange  ap. 99-104.  aPaper presented at the Sixth International Symposium on Irrigation of Horticultural Crops, held November 2-6, 2009, Vina del Mar, Chile.  aIncludes references  aAn experiment was conducted in a vineyard planted with Vitis vinifera L. ‘Riesling’ in New York, USA. Vines were fully irrigated and were trained via vertical shoot positioning (VSP) giving a narrow curtain intercepting approximately 27% of the incident light. Vine rows were north-south oriented. In one experiment, the single curtain canopies were opened into a V-shape to increase light interception. Results showed that midday stem water potential decreased by approximately 20%, suggesting an increase in vine water use. In a second experiment, canopies were inclined towards the west for 20 min periods every 40 min in order to modify the daily pattern of vine light interception. The whole canopy gas exchange responses to these practices were measured with Mylar plastic chambers. During the afternoon, decreasing light interception by inclining the vine canopy towards the west, increased vine water use efficiency (WUE, canopy photosynthesis:transpiration) by 40% compared to when the vine canopy was in the vertical position. However, over the whole day WUE increased by only 8%. Overall this study supports the idea that vine gas exchange is driven more by vine light interception than by leaf area. Vines trained as VSP in north-south oriented rows offer a possibility for modifying daily patterns of gas exchange by changing canopy orientation to the sun. These strategies could be employed in order to either increase or decrease vine gas exchange depending on the environmental conditions and soil water status. 3aVitis vinifera 3acanopy 3aenvironmental factors 3agas exchange 3airrigation rates 3aleaf area 3aplanting 3ashoots 3asoil water 3avines 3avineyards 3awater potential 3awater use efficiency 3aNew York1 aLakso, A.N.0 tActa horticulturae.g2011 Mar., , no. 889 p.99-104dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/889/889_9.htm 7aarticle02764naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072001700135072001700152100001500169245012000184300001400304500002300318520134900341650001601690650001801706650003101724650001401755650001101769650001401780650001101794650002101805650001801826650002001844650001701864651001101881651001201892651001201904653002501916653002301941653001801964700001501982700001501997773009302012852000902105856007502114930003302189945002502222946001102247655001202258IND4364727520221116194146.0040930e200401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436472752DNAL7 a10.1139/x03-1892doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Karst and seeds infested with Plemeliella abietina Seitn (Hymenoptera, Torymidae) larva is sensitive to seed origin and year of collection. Five seed lots collected during different years from Sweden, Finland, and Belarus were used in this study. Initially, seeds were classified as infested or uninfested with X-radiography, and then, NIR spectra from single seeds were collected with a NIR spectrometer from 1100 to 2498 nm with a resolution of 2 nm. Discriminant models were derived by partial least squares regression using raw and orthogonal signal corrected spectra (OSC). The resulting OSC model developed on a pooled data set was more robust than the raw model and resulted in 100% classification accuracy. Once irrelevant spectral variations were removed by using OSC pretreatment, single-lot calibration models resulted in similar classification rates for the new samples irrespective of origin and year of collection. Discriminant analyses performed with selected NIR absorption bands also gave nearly 100% classification rate for new samples. The origin of spectral differences between infested and uninfested seeds was attributed to storage lipids and proteins that were completely depleted in the former by the feeding larva. 3aPicea abies 3aplanting seed 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3aTorymidae 3alarvae 3adetection 3alipids 3astorage proteins 3alipid content 3aprotein content 3aforest trees 3aSweden 3aFinland 3aBelarus 0aPlemeliella abietina 0ainsect infestation 0ainfested seed1 aOden, P.C.1 aShen, T.Y.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2004 Jan., v. 34, no. 1 p.76-84x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x03-1893Available from publisher's Web site  a20050809b00000000c00000000  aINDd2CTe2004/11/18  aNon-US 7aarticle02601naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072001700135072001700152100001500169245011200184300001600296500002300312500001500335520125600350650001701606650001801623650002501641650002401666650001501690650001601705650001601721650002701737650002001764650001501784651001001799653002601809700001601835700001401851700001801865773009501883852000901978856007501987930003302062945002502095946001102120655001202131IND4364728520221116194307.0040930e200401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436472852DNAL7 a10.1139/x03-1972doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aGrassi, G.10aDynamics of Norway spruce and silver fir natural regeneration in a mixed stand under uneven-aged management  ap. 141-149.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aIn a 0.75-ha plot in a Norway spruce (Picea abies Karst.) - silver fir (Abies alba Miller) stand in Comelico (Italian eastern Alps), we analysed (i) the distribution and growth of natural regeneration of Norway spruce and silver fir as affected by stand structure and (ii) the age structure of all saplings between 0.2 and 10 m in height in a 30-year-old gap. In both species, most natural regeneration was clumped and located at the margin of the gaps; however, fir saplings were more represented in understorey environments and less represented in gaps as compared with spruce. Age structure of natural regeneration in the selected gap revealed that the majority (75%) of saplings appeared after the formation of the gap; however, for regeneration taller than 2 m (which has a better chance of reaching the uppermost canopy layer), saplings already present at gap formation predominated. We conclude that (i) gap edges represent a preferential regeneration niche in this forest and (ii) saplings established before gap formation can play an important role in gap refilling. These results provide useful information to ensure, through silvicultural practices, favourable conditions for the temporal and spatial continuity of the regeneration process. 3aforest trees 3amixed forests 3anatural regeneration 3aplant establishment 3aAbies alba 3aPicea abies 3acanopy gaps 3auneven-aged management 3astand structure 3aunderstory 3aItaly 0astand characteristics1 aMinotta, G.1 aTonon, G.1 aBagnaresi, U.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2004 Jan., v. 34, no. 1 p.141-149x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x03-1973Available from publisher's Web site  a20050809b00000000c00000000  aINDd2CTe2004/11/18  aNon-US 7aarticle03082naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072001700135072001700152072001700169072001700186100001700203245011900220300001800339500002300357520153500380650002001915650002001935650001101955650002001966650001801986650001302004650001702017650001602034650002102050650001802071650002502089650002302114650002002137650001502157650001202172650001102184650002002195650001302215651001502228700001802243700001702261773009702278852000902375856007502384930003302459945002502492946001102517655001202528IND4363994420221116194211.0040819e200406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436399442DNAL7 a10.1139/x04-0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aGersonde, R.10aCharacterizing the light environment in Sierra Nevada mixed-conifer forests using a spatially explicit light model  ap. 1332-1342.  aSummary in French.  aThe spatially explicit light model tRAYci was calibrated to conditions in multi-aged Sierra Nevada mixedconifer forests. To reflect conditions that are important to growth and regeneration of this forest type, we sampled a variety of managed mature stands with multiple canopy layers and cohorts. Calibration of the light model included determining leaf area density for individual species with the use of leaf area - sapwood area prediction equations. Prediction equations differed between species and could be improved using site index. The light model predicted point measurements from hemispherical photographs well over a range of 27%-63% light. Simplifying the crown representation in the tRAYci model to average values for species and canopy strata resulted in little reduction in model performance and makes the model more useful to applications with lower sampling intensity. Vertical light profiles in managed mixed-conifer stands could be divided into homogeneous, sigmiodal, and continuous gradients, depending on stand structure and foliage distribution. Concentration of leaf area in the upper canopy concentrates light resources on dominant trees in continuous canopies. Irregular canopies of multiaged stands, however, provide more light resources to mid-size trees and could support growth of shade-intolerant species. Knowledge of the vertical distribution of light intensity in connection with stand structural information can guide regulation of irregular stand structures to meet forest management objectives. 3alight intensity 3asolar radiation 3amodels 3amontane forests 3amixed forests 3aconifers 3aforest trees 3acalibration 3amodel validation 3aforest growth 3anatural regeneration 3aconiferous forests 3aleaf area index 3atree crown 3asapwood 3aleaves 3astand structure 3aaccuracy 3aCalifornia1 aBattles, J.J.1 aO'Hara, K.L.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2004 June, v. 34, no. 6 p.1332-1342x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x04-0133Available from publisher's Web site  a20050726b20050802c00000000  aINDd1CTe2005/01/08  aNon-US 7aarticle01594naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001700112245010700129300001600236520072200252650001200974650001100986650001400997650001301011650001501024650002001039773016601059856009401225852000901319655001201328IND60586360320221116194035.0171121e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058636032DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBulut, Harun10aManaging Catastrophic Risk in Agriculture through Ex Ante Subsidized Insurance or Ex Post Disaster Aid  ap. 406-426.  aWe consider a political economy in which government cares about risk-averse farmers’ loss of income but incurs political cost if it provides monetary support to farmers. Farmers’ expectations of government disaster aid and overconfidence (optimism bias) regarding their risk prevent farmers from purchasing full insurance under actuarially fair rates. Considering this conclusion, government prefers to subsidize farmers’ purchases of insurance ex ante rather than solely relying on disaster aid ex post. The resulting subsidy rate depends on the political environment, the degree of systemic risk, the distribution of farmers’ risk preferences, and the nature and distribution of farmers’ risk perceptions. 3afarmers 3aincome 3ainsurance 3apolitics 3apurchasing 3arisk perception0 tJournal of agricultural and resource economics.g2017 Oct., v. 42, no. 3 p.406-426dWestern Agricultural Economics AssociationwJournal:jnl48977x1068-55027nnas40uhttp://www.waeaonline.org/UserFiles/file/JARESeptember20177Bulut406-426withSupplement.pdf  aDNAL 7aarticle01454naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001600112245010500128300001600233520064200249650001200891650001000903650001100913650001100924650000900935773016600944856008101110852000901191655001201200IND60586360220221116193937.0171121e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058636022DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRanjan, Ram10aChallenges to Farm Produce Marketing: A Model of Bargaining between Farmers and Middlemen under Risk  ap. 386-405.  aWe  present  a  model  of  bargaining  between  farmers  and  middlemen  in  which  long-term  risk considerations by farmers constrain their ability to engage in hard bargaining. In order to avoid the risk of middlemen exiting their region in the future due to hard bargaining, farmers settle for lower prices for their produce. The risks of prolonged drought-induced decline in produce quality and future oversupply of the perishable agricultural commodity also result in lower price outcomes under bargaining.

The discrimination was also possible to a lesser extent by cultivar. In particular, canonical variate analysis suggested that the discrimination of wines according to their provenance is based on the following parameters: cis-resveratrol, total polyphenols, spermidine and tryptamine for Basilicata region; agmatine and trans-resveratrol for Calabria and Campania regions; cadaverine, ethanolamine, histamine, putrescine and tyramine for Puglia region. 3aagmatine 3acadaverine 3acultivars 3adiscriminant analysis 3aethanolamine 3ahistamine 3aisomers 3amultivariate analysis 3apolyphenols 3aprovenance 3aputrescine 3ared wines 3aresveratrol 3aspermidine 3atryptamine 3atyramine 3aItaly1 aCaruso, Marisa1 aPerretti, Giuseppe1 aFavati, Fabio0 tEuropean food research & technology.g2011 May, v. 232, no. 5 p.889-897dSpringer-Verlagx1438-23777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00217-011-1457-1 7aarticle03561naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245009100182300001600273500002400289520174400313650002002057650001602077650002002093650001402113650001802127650001702145650001102162650002502173650001202198650001402210650001902224650001902243650001602262650001002278650002002288650002802308650002802336650002002364650001702384650001802401650001102419650002202430650002902452650001102481650006102492650001402553650001602567651001102583651001102594700001902605700002902624700003002653700003102683773012702714852000902841856008502850655001202935IND4457870120221116193733.0110511s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445787012DNAL7 a206428712pmid7 a10.1017/S13689800100019892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsigga, Maria10aHealthy Eating Index during pregnancy according to pre-gravid and gravid weight status  ap. 290-296.  aIncludes references  aObjective: To assess differences in the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) during pregnancy with the pre-gravid and gravid weight status of women. Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: Athens, Greece. Subjects: One hundred pregnant women, inhabitants of Athens. Results: The mean raw HEI score of the sample was 66?9 (SD 7-6) and the mean HEI adjusted for energy intake was 66-9 (SD 0-6). No difference was recorded between the adjusted HEI and different gravidities, the embryo’s sex, different income categories or education. When HEI was categorised as low, average and adequate, living in an urban residence increased the odds for demonstrating low HEI score (OR=10-231, 95% CI 1-300, 80-487). HEI score during pregnancy was significantly higher in participants who were either pre-gravidly underweight or of normal body weight (BW). In relation to the gestational weight status, the highest HEI scores and protein intake were shown in the underweight and of normal BW participants compared with the obese. According to the simple correspondence analysis, adequate HEI was associated with rural residence and being underweight or having normal BW during pregnancy. Low HEI was associated with overweight and obesity during pregnancy, with obesity before pregnancy and living in an urban environment. HEI was negatively correlated to the pre-conceptional and gestational BMI (r= - 0-298, P#0-003 and r=2-345, P#0-001) and to the week of gestation (r=-0-285, P#0-004). Conclusions: Overall, the HEI of the sample was mediocre. Women who were underweight or of normal BWexhibited a better diet quality compared with obese women; thus the latter consist a population in greater need for supervised nutrition and dietary counselling during pregnancy. 3abody mass index 3acorrelation 3adiet counseling 3aeducation 3aenergy intake 3ahealthy diet 3aincome 3anutritional adequacy 3aobesity 3apregnancy 3apregnant women 3aprotein intake 3aunderweight 2aAdult 2aBody Mass Index 2aBody Weightxphysiology 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDietxstandards 2aDiet Surveys 2aEnergy Intake 2aFemale 2aFeeding Behavior. 2aHealth Status Indicators 2aHumans 2aMaternal Nutritional Physiological Phenomenaxphysiology 2aPregnancy 2aWeight Gain 3aGreece 0aGreece1 aFilis, Vlasios1 aHatzopoulou, Konstantina1 aKotzamanidis, Charalambos1 aGrammatikopoulou, Maria G.0 tPublic health nutrition.g2011 Feb., v. 14, no. 2 p.290-296dCABI Pub. on behalf of the Nutrition Societyx1475-27277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800100019893Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03094naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001700154245006500171300001600236500017400252520159300426650002602019650001302045650001102058650002202069650001302091650002002104650001402124650002102138650001202159650001102171650001002182650001802192650001302210650000902223650001102232650001902243650001702262650001002279650001602289650001102305651001102316700001602327700001802343700001802361773014502379856005502524852000902579655001202588IND60586365720221116193802.0171201e20170630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058636572DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1166.212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Szu-Ju12aA year-round production strategy for the wax apple in Taiwan  ap. 149-156.  aPaper presented at the International Symposium on GA3 Tropical Fruit (Guava, Wax Apple, Pineapple and Sugar Apple) held April 8-11 2015, Kaohsiung County, Chinese Taipei  aWax apple (Syzygium samarangense Merr. & Perry) has been a popular fruit crop in Taiwan because of its refreshing taste and attractive appearance. Pingtung County, accounting for 78% of the total planting area, is the major cultivation area. Regardless of the stable domestic and export market demand, the production area in Taiwan has decreased by almost 30% in the past decade, mainly due to labor shortage, high technical threshold, and production risk. Nevertheless, the cultivation area in central Taiwan has been increasing in recent years, especially in Nantou, Chiayi, and Yunlin Counties. The expansion of production regions facilitates year-round supply of wax apple fruits. By choosing suitable cultivars and forcing techniques in combination with adequate geographical and environmental conditions, a continuous supply chain for premium fruit has been established. Between October and December, market demand is fulfilled by fruits from Liukuei District in Kaohsiung City. Fruits from Pintung area satisfied the winter/spring market, from November to May. The cool temperatures in high altitude areas (600-1000 m a.s.l.) of Chiayi and Nantou favor the production of high quality fruits for niche markets from June to September. In addition, quality fruits of cultivars with consistent good fruit coloring and low cracking rates can be produced, from March to May, in Pingtung and, between June and September, in central Taiwan. Innovative production technologies and progressive breeding programs further ensure the sustainability of year-round wax apple production in Taiwan. 3aSyzygium samarangense 3aaltitude 3aapples 3abreeding programs 3acracking 3acrop production 3acultivars 3acultivation area 3aexports 3afruits 3alabor 3aniche markets 3aplanting 3arisk 3aspring 3asupply balance 3asupply chain 3ataste 3atemperature 3awinter 3aTaiwan1 aLi, Kuo-Tan1 aYeh, Der-Ming1 aShu, Zen-Hong0 tActa horticulturae.g2017 June 30, , no. 1166 p.149-156dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1166.21  aDNAL 7aarticle02598naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001400164245009600178300001600274500002400290520086800314650001701182650000901199650001301208650001101221650001101232650002601243650001301269650001301282650002301295650001201318650001201330650002701342650004201369650003801411650002301449650001801472650001101490650002201501650003501523650003301558650003701591650003201628650001001660650002201670650006001692700001401752700001401766700001201780700001501792700001801807700001501825773009901840852000901939856004801948655001201996IND4417771820221116193937.0090313e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441777182DNAL7 a186860072pmid7 a10.1007/s11248-008-9209-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNadai, M.10aHigh-level expression of active human alpha1-antitrypsin in transgenic tobacco chloroplasts  ap. 173-183.  aIncludes references  aWe have produced human alpha1-antitrypsin (A1AT), a major therapeutic protein, in genetically engineered tobacco plastids. Four different expression vectors have been evaluated which encode A1AT under the control of various 5' and 3' plastid expression elements. The use of heterologous promoter and terminator sequences derived from the corn and soybean plastid genomes leads to simpler and predictable recombinant genome patterns, avoiding unwanted recombination products between introduced and resident tobacco sequences. High level expression of unglycosylated A1AT, representing up to 2% of total soluble proteins, has been measured in leaves of transgenic tobacco lines. Some heterogeneity in the recombinant A1AT is detected after 2D protein separation, but the chloroplast-made protease inhibitors are fully active and bind to porcine pancreatic elastase. 3achloroplasts 3acorn 3aelastase 3ahumans 3aleaves 3aproteinase inhibitors 3aproteins 3asoybeans 3aterminator regions 3atobacco 2aAnimals 2aChloroplastsxgenetics 2aElectrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenetic Techniques 2aGlycosylation 2aHumans 2aMass Spectrometry 2aPancreatic Elastasexchemistry 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aPlastidsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aProtein Structure, Tertiary 2aSwine 2aTobaccoxgenetics 2aalpha 1-Antitrypsinxbiosynthesisxchemistryxgenetics.1 aBally, J.1 aVitel, M.1 aJob, C.1 aTissot, G.1 aBotterman, J.1 aDubald, M.0 tTransgenic research.g2009 Apr., v. 18, no. 2 p.173-183dSpringer Netherlandsx0962-88197nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11248-008-9209-0 7aarticle03303naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072001700135072001700152072001700169100001500186245011800201300001600319500002300335500001500358520168400373650002202057650001702079650002202096650001202118650002402130650001502154650001802169650002102187650002102208650002202229650001702251650002202268650002002290651001102310653002202321653002002343653002602363653002202389653001902411700001502430700001402445700001502459773011002474852000902584856007502593930003302668945002502701946001102726655001202737IND4364729420221116193812.0040930e200401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436472942DNAL7 a10.1139/x03-2052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The humic epipedon was investigated through macromorphological characteristics (thickness of the OL, OF, OH, and A horizons) and pH measurements (pH(KCl), pH(H2O), and deltapH). Vegetation diversity was assessed using correspondence analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis to identify the main plant community succession groups. The groups were compared using three diversity measures (species richness, Shannon index, and evenness index) and three indices describing the community composition (similarity index between stands and index of heterogeneity at the stand and herbaceous layer levels). The pH measurements revealed an acidification of the A horizon during pure beech stand maturation. Macromorphological characteristics showed an alternation of an organic matter accumulation phase and organic matter disappearance along the two silvicultural cycles. Vegetation diversity measures showed small differences between the two forests. Indices accounting for community composition revealed a homogenizing effect of the pure beech silvicultural type on species composition of plant communities occurring during stand development. They also revealed a strong heterogeneity at the herbaceous level. Comparison of species composition indicated an increasing occurrence of acidophilous species in the pure beech forest. We discuss the interest of these results for future sustainable management decisions. 3adeciduous forests 3aforest trees 3aforest succession 3asoil pH 3asoil organic matter 3aA horizons 3amixed forests 3aCarpinus betulus 3aorganic horizons 3aspecies diversity 3aforest soils 3astand composition 3aFagus sylvatica 3aFrance 0aplant communities 0asoil morphology 0astand characteristics 0astand development 0aforest ecology1 aBureau, F.1 aAlard, D.1 aBardat, J.0 tCanadian journal of forest research.g2004 Jan., v. 34, no. 1 p.233-248wJournal:jnl2003x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x03-2053Available from publisher's Web site  a20050809b00000000c00000000  aINDd2CTe2004/11/18  aNon-US 7aarticle03537naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245005900170300001400229500017400243520172200417650001002139650002002149650001102169650002102180650002102201650001002222650001402232650001202246650001602258650001102274650001102285650001502296650001302311650001202324650001602336650002702352650002102379650001202400650001102412650001302423650001502436650001902451650000902470650001802479650002102497650001502518650001102533651001502544651001102559651001002570651001002580651001402590651001102604651001202615651001302627651001602640651001302656773014302669856005402812852000902866655001202875IND60586364020221116193727.0171130e20170630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058636402DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1166.52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMitra, S.

Guava has well established markets in more than 60 countries. The top ten guava producers in the world are India, China, Thailand, Pakistan, Mexico, Indonesia, Brazil, Bangladesh, Philippines and Nigeria. Guava bear fruits at different times of the year. However, harvesting all the crops in small amount is not profitable, In India, maximum fruiting is found in the rainy season which are poor in quality due to high water content and severely attacked by fruit fly while the winter harvested fruits are superior in quality having good market demand. Cycling of crop to avoid rainy season crop and increasing winter crop is possible. Cycling of crop by using different methods of flower regulation, it is possible to harvest guava round-the-year. The method(s) to be followed for crop regulation depend on climatic factors, cropping pattern, market and industry demand, cultivar, etc. The different methods used for crop cycling are a) water management to induce stress, b) pruning of shoots at different levels and at different times, c) training (bending) of shoots, and d) manual or chemical thinning of flowers. Spraying of different bioregulators (naphthaleneacetic acid, naphthalene acetamide, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, etc.), chemicals (4,6-dintro-o-cresol, potassium iodide, urea, etc.) at different concentrations were found effective in de-blossoming and regulation of cropping. Crop cycling for round-the-year harvest is possible by pruning of shoots at different times of the year. This paper will discuss the different methods of crop cycling in guava. 3a2,4-D 3aPsidium guajava 3aapples 3aclimatic factors 3acropping systems 3acrops 3acultivars 3aflowers 3afruit flies 3afruits 3aguavas 3aharvesting 3aindustry 3amarkets 3anaphthalene 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3apotassium iodide 3apruning 3ashoots 3aspraying 3asubtropics 3asupply balance 3aurea 3awater content 3awater management 3awet season 3awinter 3aBangladesh 3aBrazil 3aChina 3aIndia 3aIndonesia 3aMexico 3aNigeria 3aPakistan 3aPhilippines 3aThailand0 tActa horticulturae.g2017 June 30, , no. 1166 p.35-40dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1166.5  aDNAL 7aarticle01420naa a2200217 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245010400128300001600232520078800248650001401036653001001050773007701060852000901137939003301146946001101179655001201190IND9303439020221116194022.0930604e199303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930343902DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEiriksson, T.10aFemale preference for specific pulse duration of male songs in the grasshopper, Omocestus viridulus  ap. 471-477.  aThe presence of female Omocestus viridulus for synthetic male songs of different pulse duration was estimated in two experiments. In the first, the probability of the female responding with stridulation was measured during presentation of a randomized series of songs of different pulse duration. The second experiment measured phonotaxis of stridulating females towards loudspeakers in two-choice playbacks of songs of different pulse duration. In both experiments the females preferred songs with an intermediate pulse duration of 70-80 ms, which coincided with the mean for natural songs of 76 ms. The results indicate the presence of stabilizing selection on pulse duration through female preference, and suggest that this song parameter may be important for species recognition. 3aAcrididae 0asongs0 tAnimal behaviour.g1993 Mar., v. 45, no. pt.3 p.471-477x0003-34727nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01832naa a2200229 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245007600129300001600205520119100221650001501412653001001427700002301437773007701460852000901537939003301546946001101579655001201590IND9303439220221116194302.0930604e199303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930343922DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrossley, S.A.14aThe response of Drosophila parabipectinata to simulated courtship songs  ap. 559-570.  aApparatus for simulating the long and short songs of Drosophila parabipectinata, and for measuring and specifying their sound particle velocity level is described, together with methods for observing courtship behaviour in the presence of the simulated songs. Removal of both wings of male flies significantly reduced their courtship success but removal of only one wing had no significant effect: this shows that the wings, as sound producers, are important for courtship success. Simulated D. parabipectinata short song significantly increased the locomotor activity of, and number of courtship interactions between, wingless male flies in the absence of female flies when played at sound levels of 78-84 dB. At 114-120 dB, although the flies became very active, the number of courtship interactions was not significantly different from that with silence at the start of the experiment. Pre-stimulation with simulated long song at 94 dB for 5 min followed by simulated short song at 84 dB during courtship significantly enhanced mating by wingless male D. parabipectinata compared with silence, or with stimulation during courtship by simulated short song alone or by long song alone. 3aDrosophila 0asongs1 aBennet-Clark, H.C.0 tAnimal behaviour.g1993 Mar., v. 45, no. pt.3 p.559-570x0003-34727nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02641naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245004700172300001200219500017400231520126700405650002601672650001101698650002001709650001901729650001001748650001301758650001401771650001201785650001901797650001601816650001301832650001301845650001301858650001301871650001201884650001101896650001101907650001301918650001101931651001401942651001101956773014101967856005402108852000902162655001202171IND60586363620221116194210.0171130e20170630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058636362DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1166.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Chi Cho10aInnovation of wax apple industry in Taiwan  ap. 1-6.  aPaper presented at the International Symposium on GA3 Tropical Fruit (Guava, Wax Apple, Pineapple and Sugar Apple) held April 8-11 2015, Kaohsiung County, Chinese Taipei  aWax apple, Syzygium samarangense Merr. et Perry, is one of the major tropical fruit crops produced in southern Taiwan where the production period is mainly from November through May. The production seasons shift in central and northern Taiwan from April through October. Among the cultivated varieties, 'Pink', 'Big Fruit', 'Thub Thim Chan', and 'Indonesia Big Fruit' are the most popular ones. Adjustment of production period is a unique technique developed in Taiwan, through which fruit production can be manually adjusted from summer to winter, or be extended into spring. In connection to the technique, strategies such as planting in different months, choosing a separate production area, and using various cultivars are also adopted to have year-round production of this fruit. Recently because of the impact brought by climate change, damages and unstable production caused by typhoon, drought, and other extreme weather events became an important issue to the industry. In order to deal with the problems, many techniques and practices have been developed: cross breeding to improve the defect of fruit shape and fruit colour, pruning to enlarge fruit size, girdling to decrease fruit cracking ratio and orchard covering to decrease the chilling injury. 3aSyzygium samarangense 3aapples 3achilling injury 3aclimate change 3acolor 3acrossing 3acultivars 3adrought 3afruit cracking 3afruit crops 3agirdling 3aindustry 3aorchards 3aplanting 3apruning 3aspring 3asummer 3atyphoons 3awinter 3aIndonesia 3aTaiwan0 tActa horticulturae.g2017 June 30, , no. 1166 p.1-6dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1166.1  aDNAL 7aarticle02139naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245009000127300001600217520135400233650001701587650001501604650001401619650001301633650002001646651001301666700001501679700002001694773007001714852000901784939003301793946001101826655001201837IND9303437020221116194249.0930604e19930401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930343702DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiller, E.K.10aDetermination of soil exchangeable-cation loss and weathering rates using Sr isotopes  ap. 438-441.  aTo assess the response of forests to a changing chemical environment, a means is needed for separating the total cation export from the watershed into a component derived from mineral weathering reactions and a component due to the removal of exchangeable (plant-available) cations in the soil. We show that this separation may be possible by using 87Sr/86Sr ratios as a tracer of cation sources in stream water. Our measurements from a high-elevation forest ecosystem in the Adirondack mountains, New York, indicate that mineral weathering reactions contribute about 70% and soil cation-exchange reactions about 30% of annual strontium exports. Based on these results and the ratios of major cations to strontium in the local glacial till, we estimate the release of Ca2+, Mg2+, K+ and Na+ owing to weathering. The present weathering rate seems adequate to replace annual losses of cations from the total soil exchangeable pool, suggesting that the watershed is not in immediate danger of acidification from atmospheric deposition. But as our strontium isotope data indicate that 50-60% of the strontium in the organic-soil-horizon exchangeable and vegetation cation pools has an atmospheric origin, reduction of atmospheric cation inputs coupled with continued strong-acid anion inputs may result in significant depletion of this cation reservoir. 3aforest soils 3aweathering 3astrontium 3aisotopes 3acation exchange 3aNew York1 aBlum, J.D.1 aFriedland, A.J.0 tNature.g1993 Apr. 1, v. 362, no. 6419 p.438-441x0028-08367nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02751naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245009900144300001600243500001500259520104700274650003001321650001301351650002001364650002501384650002501409650004001434650002401474650004601498650002501544650005601569650002101625650004901646650002801695650002401723650001301747650004401760650002301804650002401827650003401851650002101885650003601906650004601942653002801988653003002016700002202046700001802068773007002086852000902156939003302165946001102198655001202209IND9303437220221116194324.0930604e19930401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930343722DNAL7 a84644762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPiper, K.R.10aConjugation factor of Agrobacterium tumefaciens regulates Ti plasmid transfer by autoinduction  ap. 448-450.  a2019-12-04  aConjugal transfer of Ti plasmids from Agrobacterium donors to bacterial recipients is controlled by two types of diffusible signal molecules. Induction is mediated by novel compounds, called opines, that are secreted by crown gall tumours. These neoplasias result from infection of susceptible plants by virulent agrobacteria. The second diffusible signal, called conjugation factor, is synthesized by the donor bacteria themselves. Production of this factor is induced by the opine. Here we show that conjugation is regulated directly by a transcriptional activator, TraR, which requires conjugation factor as a coinducer to activate tra gene expression. TraR is a homologue of LuxR, the lux gene activator from Vibrio fischeri which also requires an endogenously synthesized diffusible coinducer. The two regulatory systems are related; the two activator proteins show amino-acid sequence similarities and the lux system cofactor, autoinducer, will substitute for conjugation factor in the TraR-dependent activation of Ti plasmid tra genes. 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3aplasmids 3agene expression 3aamino acid sequences 3anucleotide sequences 2aAgrobacterium tumefaciensxgenetics 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aConjugation, Genetic 2aDNA, Bacterialxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aHomoserinexanalogs & derivativesxgenetics. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOpen Reading Frames 2aPlasmids 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxmetabolism 2aRepressor Proteins 2aRestriction Mapping 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTrans-Activators 2aTranscription Factorsxgenetics 2abeta-Galactosidasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 0amolecular sequence data 0aAgrobacterium tumefaciens1 aBodman, S.B. von.1 aFarrand, S.K.0 tNature.g1993 Apr. 1, v. 362, no. 6419 p.448-450x0028-08367nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02460naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002000112245014200132300001600274520101300290650002101303650003301324650001601357650002401373650000901397650001001406650001101416650001701427650001101444650002601455650002201481650002901503650001701532650002101549650001501570650002401585700002101609700002401630700002201654700001901676700002101695700001701716773021101733856004901944852000901993655001202002IND60586363220180222000000.0171129e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058636322DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBennett, Rachel14aThe role of active transport in the transcellular movement of the peripheral α2-adrenoceptor antagonist, MK-467: An in vitro pilot study  ap. 318-320.  aMK-467 is a peripherally acting α2-adrenoceptor antagonist due to its low lipid solubility and poor penetration of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The aim of this study was to assess whether MK-467 could be a substrate of an active efflux transport mechanism. Using Madin-Darby Canine Kidney cells (MDCKII) and MDCKII cells transfected with the human multidrug resistance gene 1, drug transport was assessed in apical-basolateral and basolateral-apical directions. MK-467 was studied at 2 concentrations: 200 and 1000 ng/mL. Samples for analysis were taken at 15, 30, 45, 60, and 90 min after drug application. Drug concentrations were measured using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. MK-467 showed no apparent permeability in the apical-basolateral direction, transport in the basolateral-apical direction occurred in both cell lines. Efflux ratios were not calculated. However, MK-467 appeared to undergo active cellular transport. The identity of the transporter requires further investigation. 3aactive transport 3aalpha-2 adrenergic receptors 3aantagonists 3ablood-brain barrier 3adogs 3adrugs 3ahumans 3akidney cells 3alipids 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amultiple drug resistance 3apermeability 3aresistance genes 3asolubility 3aveterinary medicine1 aPalviainen, Mari1 aPeltoniemi, Marikki1 aVuorilehto, Lauri1 aScheinin, Mika1 aRaekallio, Marja1 aVainio, Outi0 tCanadian journal of veterinary research.g2017 Oct., v. 81, no. 4 p.318-320dCanadian Veterinary Medical Association = Association canadienne                des vétérinaireswJournal:2054x0830-90007nnas40uhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29081592  aDNAL 7aarticle02485naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245009900144300001400243520106900257650001301326650002001339650001201359650000801371650001001379650002501389650002501414650002401439650001201463650003401475650002101509650001801530650005001548650002901598650001101627650002801638650004601666650003901712653002801751700001601779700001701795700001501812700001701827773009401844852000901938939003301947946001101980655001201991IND9303436720221116193854.0930604e199211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930343672DNAL7 a14750032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLally, N.C.12aA 2359-base pair DNA fragment from Cryptosporidium parvum encoding a repetitive oocyst protein  ap. 69-78.  aA Cryptosporidium parvum lambda gt11 expression library was constructed using EcoRI-digested genomic DNA extracted from in vitro-excysted oocysts. Screening of this library with rat anti-Cryptosporidium antiserum led to the isolation of a clone containing a 2359-bp EcoRI fragment. When this fragment was ligated into the EcoRI site of plasmid vector pMS1S, the resulting clone expressed a 200-kDa beta-galactosidase fusion protein. Western blot analysis using serum raised against this fusion protein indicated that the EcoRI fragment represented part of a gene encoding a 190-kDa oocyst wall protein of C. parvum. Sequencing of the fragment revealed a continuous open reading frame encoding 786 amino acids. The DNA sequence is relatively low in G + C (39.1%), and the third codon position contains only 17.9% G + C. The deduced peptide sequence has unusually high proportions of cysteine, proline, glutamine and histidine. Another striking feature of the amino acid sequence is the presence of distinctly repetitive regions based on conserved cysteine residues. 3aproteins 3aCryptosporidium 3aoocysts 3aDNA 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aAntigens, Protozoanxgenetics 2aBase Composition 2aBase Sequence 2aCryptosporidium parvumxgeneticsximmunology. 2aDNA, Protozoanxgenetics 2aFemale 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aProtozoan Proteinsxgeneticsximmunology. 2aRepetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid 0amolecular sequence data1 aBaird, G.D.1 aMcQuay, S.J.1 aWright, F.1 aOliver, J.J.0 tMolecular and biochemical parasitology.g1992 Nov., v. 56, no. 1 p.69-78x0166-68517nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03215naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072001700135072001700152072001700169072001700186072001700203100001800220245012200238300001800360500002300378500001500401520148400416650003901900650002101939650001901960650001401979650002401993650001402017650001902031650002102050650002202071650002502093650001902118650002302137650002202160650001702182650001902199650001002218653001902228653003002247700001502277700001702292700001602309700001802325700001902343773009802362852000902460856007502469930003302544945002502577946001102602655001202613IND4363469020221116193121.0040720e200309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436346902DNAL7 a10.1139/x03-0902doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

We measured R(s) at three balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) sites on a climatic gradient from 1997 to 2000 to assess potential responses to global warming. Mean annual R(s) varied from 0.67 kg C.m(-2).year(-1) at the cool site, to 1.19 kg C.m(-2).year(-1) at the midtransect site, to 1.52 kg C.m(-2).year(-1) at the warm site. Trenched plots were installed in 1999 to partition R(s) into root respiration (R(r)) and heterotrophic respiration (R(h)). Differences in trenched-plot respiration (R(t)) among sites were much less than differences in R(s), because trenching reduced R(s) at the warm site more than at the cool site. Annual R(t) was 22% less than annual R(s) at the cool site, 36% less at the midtransect site, and 50% less at the warm site. After making adjustments for extraordinary decomposition of killed roots in trenched plots, it was estimated that annual R(h) varied little among sites (0.40 kg C.m(-2).year(-1) at the cool site to 0.54 kg C.m(-2).year(-1) at the warm site), but annual R(r) varied substantially among sites (0.24 kg C.m(-2).year(-1) at the cool site to 0.98 kg C.m(-2).year(-1) at the warm site). We conclude that R(s) varied among sites, because climatically driven differences in primary productivity caused greater R(r) and greater detrital production for R(h). 3asoil-plant-atmosphere interactions 3asoil temperature 3aAbies balsamea 3aequations 3aambient temperature 3atrenching 3aglobal warming 3asoil respiration 3aforest ecosystems 3astatistical analysis 3aclimate models 3aseasonal variation 3adiurnal variation 3aforest soils 3aclimatic zones 3aroots 0aclimate change 0aheterotrophic respiration1 aBoutin, R.1 aFoster, R.J.1 aGoodine, G.1 aBernier, P.Y.1 aRobitaille, G.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2003 Sept., v. 33, no. 9 p.1744-1753x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x03-0903Available from publisher's Web site  a20060307b20060402c00000000  aINDdLYNe2006/03/07  aNon-US 7aarticle03073naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072001700135072001700152072001700169072001700186072001700203072001700220100002000237245017500257300001800432500002300450520134200473650002001815650001701835650002101852650001601873650001701889650001901906650001601925650002001941650001901961650001601980650002001996650003202016650001702048650003002065650001002095650002402105650001902129650001902148650001402167651001202181653002102193700001802214773009802232852000902330856007502339930003302414945002502447946001102472655001202483IND4363468420221116193027.0040720e200309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436346842DNAL7 a10.1139/x03-0842doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Fumigation increased bed densities for loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) in 1996 and slash pine (Pinus elliottii Engelm. var. elliottii) in 1998; differences were not observed between treatments in other years. The root collar diameter, height, and root and shoot masses of loblolly pine seedlings were often greater in fumigated plots during the first 3 years. Morphological characteristics rarely differed between treatments for slash pine. The primary pest problem was nutsedge (Cyperus spp.); most other weeds were controlled with herbicides used operationally at the nursery. Plant-parasitic nematode populations did not increase over time and were not a problem. Although Fusarium and Pythium spp. were more common in soil and on roots in nonfumigated plots, evidence of disease was rare. Fumigation increased the abundance of and changed the composition of Trichoderma spp. in soil and on roots. Soil manganese and iron, and foliar manganese, phosphorus, and nitrogen were greater in the fumigation treatment in some years. A better understanding of the risks of soilborne diseases may facilitate the development of pest management programs that are more cost-effective. 3asoil fumigation 3aforest trees 3aforest nurseries 3aplant pests 3aforest pests 3amethyl bromide 3aPinus taeda 3aPinus elliottii 3asoil treatment 3atree growth 3aseedling growth 3atree and stand measurements 3aweed control 3aplant parasitic nematodes 3afungi 3asoil-borne diseases 3asoil nutrients 3atree nutrition 3aseedlings 3aGeorgia 0afoliar nutrients1 aDwinell, L.D.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2003 Sept., v. 33, no. 9 p.1698-1708x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x03-0843Available from publisher's Web site  a20060526b20060607c00000000  aINDdLYNe2006/05/26  aNon-US 7aarticle02933naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072001700135072001700152072001700169072001700186100001900203245013200222300001800354500002300372500001500395520124300410650000901653650001401662650002501676650001301701650001401714650002701728650002101755650003201776650002101808650001001829650001001839650002201849650001901871650002601890650002101916651002101937653002101958653001901979653001201998653002502010653001602035653002602051653001502077773009802092852000902190856007502199930003302274945002502307946001102332655001202343IND4363467220221116193158.0040720e200309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436346722DNAL7 a10.1139/x03-0772doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Franco) seedlings were planted in a factorial experiment with three levels of shading (0, 30, and 60%), three levels of mechanical stimulus (staked, freestanding, and bent), and two levels of nitrogen fertilization (0 and 200 kg/ha) to investigate the separate and combined effects of these factors on morphology and bending resistance. Fertilization increased branch angle and increased the sensitivity of branch and leader extension to bending stresses but did not affect volume increment, stem form, or bending resistance. The effects of shading and mechanical treatments on morphology were independent and additive. Shading reduced stem diameter and volume increment, but did not affect height increment, producing more slender trees. Bending produced less slender trees through a combination of reduced height increment and increased diameter increment. Staking did not affect tree morphology. Trees under heavy shade were responsive to bending but were more slender and had lower bending resistance than unshaded trees with the same mechanical stimulus. These results point towards the biological basis for the development of tree instability in high density stands. 3awind 3awindthrow 3aanalysis of variance 3anitrogen 3aseedlings 3afertilizer application 3abending strength 3atree and stand measurements 3astand basal area 3atrees 3ashade 3amechanical stress 3aabiotic stress 3aPseudotsuga menziesii 3aplant morphology 3aBritish Columbia 0atree slenderness 0atree stability 0astaking 0astatistical analysis 0astem volume 0aenvironmental factors 0abasal area0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2003 Sept., v. 33, no. 9 p.1602-1609x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x03-0773Available from publisher's Web site  a20060305b20060402c00000000  aINDdLYNe2006/03/04  aNon-US 7aarticle02200naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072001700135072001700152100001600169245012800185300001800313500002300331520091200354650002601266650001701292650002001309650000901329650001501338650003601353650002301389650002001412650001301432650002701445650001101472650001101483651002101494773009801515852000901613856007501622930003301697945002501730946001101755655001201766IND4363455020221116192821.0040719e200311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436345502DNAL7 a10.1139/x03-1512doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Franco) from six sites varying in elevation and geographic location with sampling from early spring to midsummer. Eleven terpenes were found in virtually all samples (tricyclene, alpha-pinene, camphene, sabinene, beta-pinene, myrcene, delta-3-carene, limonene, beta-phellandrene, terpinolene, and bornyl acetate) and represented an average of 87% of the total terpenes. In each year, composition of the terpene mix varied significantly (P less than or equal to 0.05) for all sites and dates, with some significant site and date interactions. Degree-day accumulations were calculated for all sites and years. Patterns of change in terpene composition between sites, areas, and years were strongly related to the temperature regimes associated with site and year. 3aPseudotsuga menziesii 3aforest trees 3aconifer needles 3abuds 3aterpenoids 3achemical constituents of plants 3aseasonal variation 3aair temperature 3aaltitude 3ageographical variation 3aspring 3asummer 3aBritish Columbia0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2003 Nov., v. 33, no. 11 p.2269-2273x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x03-1513Available from publisher's Web site  a20060305b20060402c00000000  aINDdCMMe2005/01/26  aNon-US 7aarticle02949naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072001700135072001700152072001700169072001700186072001700203100001900220245009100239300001800330500002300348500001500371520139700386650002801783650001401811650001401825650002901839650002001868650002001888650002801908650002301936650001301959651001801972651002801990653002202018653002802040653003702068653002702105700002002132700001602152773009802168852000902266856007502275930003302350945002502383946001102408655001202419IND4363467720221116193113.0040720e200309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436346772DNAL7 a10.1139/x03-0832doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aBolkesjo, T.F.10aInformation technology and the newsprint demand in Western Europe: a Bayesian approach  ap. 1644-1652.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aThis paper focuses on the impacts of new information technology on newsprint demand in a sample of West European countries (Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom). It is hypothesized that information technology, through the ready and free availability of news content on the Internet, could induce a structural shift in the newsprint consumption pattern in these markets. Econometric analyses based on historical data for the four countries mentioned above do not yet support this hypothesis. Based on evidence from the United States, where Internet penetration is higher, and several recently published market studies, there is, however, reason to expect stagnating newsprint consumption in Western Europe. By using Bayesian demand models, we try to incorporate prior information from these market studies in the econometric analysis. A classical demand model, based solely on historical data from 1971 to 1999, is estimated for comparison with the Bayesian models. Predictions for newsprint consumption based on the Bayesian approach show lower future consumption levels than those predicted by the classical models, which are commonly used in forest product demand studies. We conclude that Bayesian models carry the potential to improve the quality of forest products demand analyses when a structural break can be expected and sufficient information on its dynamics is available. 3aconsumption (economics) 3aequations 3anewsprint 3aforest products industry 3aBayesian theory 3aconsumer demand 3apulp and paper industry 3aeconometric models 3aInternet 3aUnited States 3aWestern European region 0aeconomic analysis 0apulp and paper products 0aCobb-Douglas production function 0ainformation technology1 aObersteiner, M.1 aSolberg, B.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2003 Sept., v. 33, no. 9 p.1644-1652x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x03-0833Available from publisher's Web site  a20060306b20060402c00000000  aINDdLYNe2006/03/06  aNon-US 7aarticle02544naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245010900161300001400270520150300284650002201787650001101809650002501820650001101845650001301856650001001869650000901879650002001888650001001908651001001918700001901928700001401947700001901961700001801980773011801998856004502116852000902161655001202170IND60586361520221116193148.0171128s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058636152DNAL7 a10.4454/jpp.v99i0.39222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLlorente, I.10aFire blight risk assessment in Girona region (Catalonia): comparison of Maryblyt and Cougarblight models  ap. 75-80.  aFire blight is a serious disease of apple and pear in some areas of Catalonia (Northeastern Spain). However, fire blight has only been detected in a few trees of two orchards in Girona region in the last 10 years. The first detection took place in 2007 on pear and the second one occurred in 2013 on apple. All the trees in the affected orchards were eradicated according to the legal measures. Fire blight can quickly become an epidemic in Catalonia, for this reason an intensive surveillance has been done in the last years through rigorous disease monitoring. In order to have a better guidance for inspection, two fire blight predictive models were used: Maryblyt and CougarBlight. The fire blight risk was established during 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 on pear (cv. Conference) and apple (cvs Fuji, Gala, Golden and Pink Lady©) using meteorological and phenological data of three representative locations. A detailed analysis was also performed in an apple orchard placed near to the location where the last outbreak had been detected in 2013. Results showed that CougarBlight is more appropriate than Maryblyt when the disease is not present in the area using the scenario 1 (no fire blight in neighborhood orchard last year); according to CougarBlight the overall fire blight risk in Girona was low or moderate. When forecasting models are used to guide the inspections in orchards, Maryblyt or CougarBlight with scenario 3 (fire blight is now active in the neighborhood orchards) are useful. 3aErwinia amylovora 3aapples 3adisease surveillance 3amodels 3aorchards 3apears 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3atrees 3aSpain1 aVilaredell, P.1 aIsern, M.1 aMontesinos, E.1 aMoragrega, C.0 tJournal of plant pathology.g2017, v. 99, no.

In the present study, ME1, a type-1 RIP, was cloned and sequenced from storage roots of Mirabilis expansa (Ruiz & Pavon). The full-length cDNA sequence of ME1 has 1,129 nucleotides with an open reading frame of 951 nucleotides representing 317 amino acids. Nucleotide analysis revealed that the N-terminal region of ME1 was cleaved, and the mature protein started at amino acid 34. ME1 showed very close similarities to MAP and MAP-4 from Mirabilis jalapa. Southern blot analysis revealed the presence of two homologous genes for ME1 cDNA in M. expansa. Northern blot analysis showed high levels of ME1 transcripts in primary and storage roots. Interestingly, jasmonic acid induced ME1 transcript expression in cell suspension cultures of M. expansa; however, the production of ME1 protein was not enhanced as observed by Western blot analysis. Our data suggest that ME1 has the ability to depurinate its own mRNA, thus inhibiting its translation. These observations suggest a possible mechanism by which ME1 protein levels are post-transcriptionally regulated. 3areticulocytes 3amessenger RNA 3atranslation (genetics) 3aMirabilis expansa 3acomplementary DNA 3acell growth 3asequence alignment 3apurines 3ahistology 3atissue distribution 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3aMirabilis jalapa 3anucleotide sequences 3amolecular cloning 3aroots 3acell suspension culture 3aplant proteins 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aBlotting, Southern 2aCells, Cultured 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Complementaryxchemistryxgenetics. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aMirabilisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aPlant Rootsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Processing, Post-Translational. 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRabbits 2aReticulocytesxdrug effects 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 0apolynucleotide adenosine glycosidase 0aMirabilis 0amirabilis antiviral protein 0amolecular sequence data 0apost-transcriptional rna processing 0aplant anatomy 0ame1 protein1 aBais, H.P.1 aVivanco, J.M.0 tPlanta.g2003 July, v. 217, no. 3 p.498-506x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-003-1014-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20031103b20031113c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03620naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002600164245013800190300001600328520141400344650001801758650001501776650001601791650001101807650001101818650001901829650001801848650003101866650002201897650002001919650002501939650001201964650002301976650003101999650001702030650002202047650001002069650002102079650004102100650003802141650006902179650003102248650003102279650005802310650003402368650005602402650003302458650003902491650003802530650005602568653002902624653002902653653001602682700001702698700001502715773006502730852000902795856008502804930003302889945001302922946001102935655001202946IND2334121820221116193211.0030917e200307  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233412182DNAL7 a145205752pmid7 a10.1007/s00425-003-1011-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRansom-Hodgkins, W.D.10aProtein phosphorylation plays a key role in sucrose-mediated transcriptional regulation of a phloem-specific proton-sucrose symporter  ap. 483-489.  aAssimilate partitioning refers to the systemic distribution of sugars and amino acids from sites of primary assimilation (source tissue) to import-dependent tissues and organs (sinks). One of the defining questions in this area is how plants balance source productivity with sink demand. Recent results from our laboratory showed that sucrose transport activity is directly proportional to the transcription rate of the phloem-specific proton-sucrose symporter BvSUT1 in Beta vulgaris L. Moreover, symporter gene transcription is regulated by sucrose levels in the leaf. Here we show that sucrose-dependent regulation of BvSUT1 transcription is mediated, at least in part, by a protein phosphorylation relay pathway. Protein phosphatase inhibitors decreased sucrose transport activity, symporter protein and mRNA abundance, and the relative transcription rate of the symporter gene. In contrast, protein kinase inhibitors had no effect or increased sucrose transport, protein and mRNA abundance, and transcription. Furthermore, pretreating leaves with kinase inhibitors before feeding with sucrose blocked the sucrose-dependent decrease in symporter transcription and transport activity. The latter observation provides direct evidence for a protein phosphorylation cascade operating between the sucrose-sensor and the transcriptional regulator that controls BvSUT1 expression and, ultimately, phloem loading. 3aBeta vulgaris 3asugar beet 3asugar crops 3aleaves 3aphloem 3aplant proteins 3amessenger RNA 3agene expression regulation 3aprotein synthesis 3aphosphorylation 3abiochemical pathways 3asucrose 3anutrient transport 3aphosphoprotein phosphatase 3aokadaic acid 3aenzyme inhibitors 3awater 3aprotein kinase C 2aBeta vulgarisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aMembrane Transport Proteinsxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aNaphthalenesxpharmacology 2aOkadaic Acidxpharmacology 2aPhosphoprotein Phosphatasesxantagonists & inhibitors 2aPhosphorylationxdrug effects 2aPlant Proteinsxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Structuresxmetabolism 2aSucrosexmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aSymportersxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTranscriptional Activationxdrug effectsxgenetics. 0aplasma membrane vesicles 0aproton-sucrose symporter 0abvsut1 gene1 aVaughn, M.W.1 aBush, D.R.0 tPlanta.g2003 July, v. 217, no. 3 p.483-489x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-003-1011-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20031103b20031113c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle04191naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002900164245016500193300001600358500001500374520168500389650001302074650001802087650001702105650001902122650002202141650002002163650002302183650002002206650001902226650002802245650002502273650002002298650002502318650001302343650001202356650002202368650001602390650004302406650002402449650001802473650002302491650003102514650003502545650003502580650002802615650005502643650004402698650003802742650007002780650002802850650004202878650003402920653002302954653004602977653002803023653003903051653002703090653002503117700001503142700001503157700001703172700001603189773006503205852000903270856008503279930003303364945001303397946001103410655001203421IND2334121520221116193412.0030917e200307  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233412152DNAL7 a127216772pmid7 a10.1007/s00425-003-1008-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodriguez-Concepcion, M.10aBioinformatic and molecular analysis of hydroxymethylbutenyl diphosphate synthase (GCPE) gene expression during carotenoid accumulation in ripening tomato fruit  ap. 476-482.  a2019-12-04  aCarotenoids are plastidic isoprenoid pigments of great biological and biotechnological interest. The precursors for carotenoid production are synthesized through the recently elucidated methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway. Here we have identified a tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) cDNA sequence encoding a full-length protein with homology to the MEP pathway enzyme hydroxymethylbutenyl 4-diphosphate synthase (HDS, also called GCPE). Comparison with other plant and bacterial HDS sequences showed that the plant enzymes contain a plastid-targeting N-terminal sequence and two highly conserved plant-specific domains in the mature protein with no homology to any other sequence in the databases. The ubiquitous distribution of HDS-encoding expressed sequence tags (ESTs) in the tomato collections suggests that the corresponding gene is likely expressed throughout the plant. The role of HDS in controlling the supply of precursors for carotenoid biosynthesis was estimated from the bioinformatic and molecular analysis of transcript abundance in different stages of fruit development. No significant changes in HDS gene expression were deduced from the statistical analysis of EST distribution during fruit ripening, when an active MEP pathway is required to support a massive accumulation of carotenoids. RNA blot experiments confirmed that similar transcript levels were present in both the wild-type and carotenoid-depleted yellow ripe (r) mutant fruit independent of the stage of development and the carotenoid composition of the fruit. Together, our results are consistent with a non-limiting role for HDS in carotenoid biosynthesis during tomato fruit ripening. 3atomatoes 3amessenger RNA 3abiosynthesis 3aplant pigments 3acomplementary DNA 3abioaccumulation 3asequence alignment 3avegetable crops 3aplant proteins 3aexpressed sequence tags 3abiochemical pathways 3agene expression 3aamino acid sequences 3aripening 3amutants 3amolecular cloning 3acarotenoids 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aBlotting, Northern 2aCarotenoidsxbiosynthesis. 2aComputational Biologyxmethods 2aEnzymesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aExpressed Sequence Tags 2aFruitxenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aSolanum lycopersicumxenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 0ayellow ripe mutant 0ahydroxymethylbutenyl diphosphate synthase 0amolecular sequence data 0amethylerythritol phosphate pathway 0afruits (plant anatomy) 0anucleotide sequences1 aQuerol, J.1 aLois, L.M.1 aImperial, S.1 aBoronat, A.0 tPlanta.g2003 July, v. 217, no. 3 p.476-482x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-003-1008-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20031103b20031113c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle04261naa a2200781 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245015100181300001600332500001500348520168800363650002202051650001102073650001302084650003702097650002602134650001902160650002002179650001502199650002102214650001302235650001102248650000902259650002502268650002802293650002002321650001302341650001602354650001702370650001402387650002502401650002702426650003602453650003602489650004402525650005802569650005202627650004402679650003302723650006702756650002902823650004402852650004302896650003702939650004502976650003603021653001703057653002803074653005203102700001603154700001503170700001603185700001703201700001603218700001703234773006503251852000903316856008503325930003303410945001303443946001103456655001203467IND2334121020221116193410.0030917e200307  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233412102DNAL7 a145205722pmid7 a10.1007/s00425-003-1000-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurger, B.T.10aRelative turnover numbers of maize endosperm and potato tuber ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylases in the absence and presence of 3-phosphoglyceric acid  ap. 449-456.  a2019-12-04  aAdenosine diphosphate glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase; EC 2.7.7.27) synthesizes the starch precursor, ADP-glucose. It is a rate-limiting enzyme in starch biosynthesis and its activation by 3-phosphoglyceric acid (3PGA) and/or inhibition by inorganic phosphate (Pi) are believed to be physiologically important. Leaf, tuber and cereal embryo AGPases are highly sensitive to these effectors, whereas endosperm AGPases are much less responsive. Two hypotheses can explain the 3PGA activation differences. Compared to leaf AGPases, endosperm AGPases (i) lack the marked ability to be activated by 3PGA or (ii) they are less dependent on 3PGA for activity. The absence of purified preparations has heretofore negated answering this question. To resolve this issue, heterotetrameric maize (Zea mays L.) endosperm and potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) tuber AGPases expressed in Escherichia coli were isolated and the relative amounts of enzyme protein were measured by reaction to antibodies against a motif resident in both small subunits. Resulting reaction rates of both AGPases are comparable in the presence but not in the absence of 3PGA when expressed on an active-protein basis. We also placed the potato tuber UpReg1 mutation into the maize AGPase. This mutation greatly enhances 3PGA sensitivity of the potato AGPase but it has little effect on the maize AGPase. Thirdly, lysines known to bind 3PGA in potato tuber AGPase, but missing from the maize endosperm AGPase, were introduced into the maize enzyme. These had minimal effect on maize endosperm activity. In conclusion, the maize endosperm AGPase is not nearly as dependent on 3PGA for activity as is the potato tuber AGPase. 3aSolanum tuberosum 3atubers 3apotatoes 3astructure-activity relationships 3aliquid chromatography 3aplant proteins 3agene expression 3aphosphates 3aEscherichia coli 3aZea mays 3alysine 3acorn 3aamino acid sequences 3anucleotidyltransferases 3aenzyme activity 3aisozymes 3agrain crops 3astarch crops 3aendosperm 3anucleotide sequences 3a3-phosphoglyceric acid 2aEnzyme Activationxdrug effects 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aEscherichia colixgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologicxdrug effects 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxdrug effects 2aGlucose-1-Phosphate Adenylyltransferase 2aGlyceric Acidsxpharmacology 2aNucleotidyltransferasesxantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aPhosphatesxpharmacology 2aPlant Leavesxdrug effectsxenzymology. 2aPlant Stemsxdrug effectsxenzymology. 2aSeedsxdrug effectsxenzymology. 2aSolanum tuberosumxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aZea maysxenzymologyxgenetics. 0apurification 0amolecular sequence data 0aadenosine diphosphate glucose pyrophosphorylase1 aCross, J.M.1 aShaw, J.R.1 aCaren, J.R.1 aGreene, T.W.1 aOkita, T.W.1 aHannah, L.C.0 tPlanta.g2003 July, v. 217, no. 3 p.449-456x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-003-1000-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20031103b20031113c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03649naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245014300181300001600324500001500340520117500355650000901530650001801539650001601557650002601573650002201599650002301621650001701644650003101661650002501692650002501717650002201742650002001764650001701784650001501801650002401816650003801840650002301878650004501901650004801946650006501994650005702059650006502116650002802181650006202209650004202271650002602313650002702339650003402366650002102400653001902421653003902440653001602479653003102495653002802526653002202554653001602576700001802592700001802610700001402628700001802642700001502660773006502675852000902740856008502749930003302834945001302867946001102880655001202891IND2334121320221116193101.0030917e200307  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233412132DNAL7 a145205732pmid7 a10.1007/s00425-003-1001-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarwedel, T.10aPlant-specific regulation of replication protein A2 (OsRPA2) from rice during the cell cycle and in response to ultraviolet light exposure  ap. 457-465.  a2019-12-04  aDNA replication is a process that is highly conserved among eukaryotes. Nonetheless, little is known about the proteins involved in it in plants. Replication protein A (RPA) is a heterotrimeric, single-stranded DNA-binding protein with several functions in DNA metabolism in humans and yeast and supposedly also in plants. Here we report on the regulation of OsRPA2, the 32-kDa subunit of RPA from rice (Oryza sativa L.). We found conserved regulation mechanisms at the level of gene expression between animal and plant RPA2 genes and distinct features of OsRPA2 regulation at the level of protein expression. Unlike in animals or in yeast, protein abundance in rice was regulated in a cell cycle phase-specific manner and was altered after UV-C light exposure. On the other hand, posttranslational modification through phosphorylation did not appear to play a pivotal role in rice as it does in animal cells. Our results indicate that plant-specific mechanisms of regulation have evolved for RPA2 within the generally well-conserved process of DNA replication, suggesting specific requirements for regulation of DNA metabolism in plants as compared to other eukaryotes. 3arice 3amessenger RNA 3agrain crops 3aultraviolet radiation 3acomplementary DNA 3asequence alignment 3aOryza sativa 3agene expression regulation 3aamino acid sequences 3aDNA-binding proteins 3amolecular cloning 3aphosphorylation 3arice protein 3acell cycle 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aCell Cyclexgeneticsxphysiology. 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Complementaryxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmentalxradiation effects 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxradiation effects 2aMeristemxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxradiation effects. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOryzaxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxradiation effects. 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReplication Protein A 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aUltraviolet Rays 0aplant proteins 0aposttranslation protein processing 0aosrpa1 gene 0adna replication protein a2 0amolecular sequence data 0asequence analysis 0aosrpa2 gene1 aIshibashi, T.1 aLorbiecke, R.1 aJacob, S.1 aSakaguchi, K.1 aSauter, M.0 tPlanta.g2003 July, v. 217, no. 3 p.457-465x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-003-1001-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20031103b20031113c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03146naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001300164245011900177300001600296500001500312520166200327650001501989650001002004650001402014650001602028650000702044650002102051650001902072650004602091650001202137650004102149650003302190650004702223650003102270650002202301650002302323653002802346653002302374653002502397700001402422773006502436852000902501856008502510930003302595945001302628946001102641655001202652IND2334119320221116193054.0030917e200307  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233411932DNAL7 a145205692pmid7 a10.1007/s00425-003-0993-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMine, I.10aExtensibility of isolated cell walls in the giant tip-growing cells of the xanthophycean alga Vaucheria terrestris  ap. 425-435.  a2019-12-04  aApical cell wall fragments isolated from the giant-cellular xanthophycean alga Vaucheria terrestris sensu Gotz were inflated with silicone oil by applying internal pressure ranging from 0.1 to 0.7 MPa, and the time-course of cell wall deformation was recorded and analyzed by videomicroscopy. Cell wall extensibility in the tip-growing region was estimated by the pressure required for cell wall extension, the amount of total extension until cell wall rupture and the rate of cell wall extension. Apical cell walls exhibited gradual extension, or creep, during inflation, which was eventually followed by rupture at the apical portion, whereas no appreciable extension was found in the cylindrical basal portion of the cell wall fragment. Besides the largest extension observed around the tip, substantial extension was also observed along the subapical region of the cell wall. The wall extensibility was dependent on the buffer pH used for infiltration before inflation. The optimum pH for the extension was about 8.0, but the cell wall was much less extensible after infiltration with an acidic buffer. Cell wall extensibility was dependent on the pH of the buffer used before inflation, regardless of that used in the previous infiltration. Moreover, pretreatment of the cell wall with a protease caused considerable loosening of cell walls, but affected the pH dependence of cell wall extensibility little. These results indicate that the extensibility of the cell walls in the giant tip-growing cells of the alga is distinct from that of plant cells that exhibit "acid growth" in its dependence on environmental pH and the role of cell wall proteins. 3acell walls 3aalgae 3aVaucheria 3aproteinases 3apH 3aplant morphology 3aplant proteins 2aAlgal Proteinsxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aBuffers 2aCell Wallxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aEndopeptidasesxpharmacology 2aEukaryotaxcytologyxgrowth & development. 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMicroscopy, Video 2aModels, Biological 0acell wall extensibility 0aalgae and seaweeds 0avaucheria terrestris1 aOkuda, K.0 tPlanta.g2003 July, v. 217, no. 3 p.425-435x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-003-0993-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20031103b20031113c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03080naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245015200162300001600314500002400330500001500354520165600369650001502025650002102040650001202061650001102073650001402084650001002098650001402108650001202122650000902134650001002143650002202153650001302175650001502188650001802203650001302221650001702234650001502251650001902266651001102285653001602296700002502312700002302337700003102360773008902391852000902480856008502489655001202574IND4457884320221116193409.0110512s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445788432DNAL7 a10.1017/S09602585100004132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalazar, Ana10aTiming of seed dispersal and dormancy, rather than persistent soil seed-banks, control seedling recruitment of woody plants in Neotropical savannas  ap. 103-116.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aA large fraction of tree species forming persistent soil seed-banks and with dormant seeds are expected to be found in strongly seasonal ecosystems such as Neotropical savannas, where seedling recruitment could be highly variable. In the savannas of Central Brazil, we studied seed characteristics (type of dormancy, longevity and moisture content) of 14 representative woody species differing in seed dispersal season. We also studied the dynamics of soil seed-banks and similarity patterns in woody species composition among seed rain, soil seed-bank, seedling bank and standing vegetation along shallow topographic gradients that differ in canopy cover. Woody species composition of the soil seed-bank largely differed from the standing vegetation, the seed rain and the seedling bank species composition, suggesting low recruitment of woody species from the soil seed-bank. Seeds of the 14 woody species remained viable for less than 16 months in laboratory dry-storage conditions. Of those, most seeds dispersed in the dry season were dormant and exhibited low moisture content, while most seeds dispersed in the wet season were non-dormant and exhibited high moisture content. Longevity of these seeds dispersed in the dry and the wet seasons did not differ significantly. This study shows that both timing of seed dispersal and dormancy appear to control timing of seed germination and seedling recruitment of most Neotropical savanna woody species, which did not form persistent soil seed-banks. This study contributes to the understanding of tree/grass coexistence and tree density variations along topographic gradients in tropical savannas. 3adry season 3aseed germination 3agrasses 3acanopy 3alongevity 3aseeds 3aseedlings 3atropics 3asoil 3atrees 3aspecies diversity 3asavannas 3aecosystems 3awater content 3adormancy 3awoody plants 3awet season 3aseed dispersal 3aBrazil 0arecruitment1 aGoldstein, Guillermo1 aFranco, Augusto C.1 aMiralles-Wilhelm, Fernando0 tSeed science research.g2011 June, v. 21, no. 2 p.103-116dCABI Pubx0960-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S09602585100004133Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03190naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245014600124300001600270500014100286500002400427520178600451650001102237650001402248650001602262650001102278650001002289650002102299650002302320650002002343650001302363650001302376650001502389650001102404650001502415650001502430650001902445650001002464651001202474700001302486700001602499700001902515773014002534852000902674856004902683655001202732IND4457884120221116193352.0110512s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445788412DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIancu, M.10aInfluence of the groundcover management system and drip irrigation on behavior of the 'Golden Spur' apple cultivar grafted on MM106 rootstock  ap. 265-271.  aPaper presented at the Sixth International Symposium on Irrigation of Horticultural Crops, held November 2-6, 2009, Vina del Mar, Chile.  aIncludes references  aThe low amounts of precipitation and their irregular time and space distribution in Romania determine many years with high soil water deficits affecting fruit yield quantity and quality. In order to quantify the effects of drip irrigation on the behavior of the ‘Golden Spur’ apple cultivar grafted on MM106 rootstock, investigations were performed between 1982 and 2004. The orchard was located on a brown, weakly-medium surface gleyed soil, on 5-6% sloped hillside. Influence of drip irrigation within two groundcover management systems between tree rows (cultivated and mowed sod strips) and on the row (cultivated and mulched) was studied in a 3-factor experiment of 2×2×2 type. The cultivated treatment between tree rows induced a significant increase in the annual trunk cross sectional area (TCSA) by 10%, in the total shoot length/tree (TSL/tree) by 14%, in the number of shoots/tree (NS/tree) by 17%, in the fruit yield (Y) by 17%, in the number of fruits/tree (NF/tree) by 6%, and in the average fruit weight (AFW) by 9%, versus the moved sod treatment. For the whole experiment, the drip irrigation treatment induced a significant increase in the annual TCSA by 16%, in the TSL/tree by 29%, in the NS/tree by 21%, in the Y by 16%, in NF/tree by 10% and in the AFW by 13%. Under the same conditions, mulching on tree row treatment induced a significant increase by 15% in the TSL/tree, by 12% in the NS/tree, by 8% in the Y, by 4% in the NF/tree and by 3% in the AFW, versus the cultivated treatment. On average over the entire period of this study and the whole experiment, an increase of 2.82 kg in fruit yield was obtained for 1 m3 of drip irrigation water. These results entirely justify drip irrigation application in most of the apple orchards in our country. 3aapples 3acultivars 3afruit yield 3afruits 3ahills 3airrigation water 3amanagement systems 3amicroirrigation 3amulching 3aorchards 3arootstocks 3ashoots 3asod strips 3asoil water 3aspace and time 3atrees 3aRomania1 aIsac, I.1 aStanica, F.1 aDumitrascu, M.0 tActa horticulturae.g2011 Mar., , no. 889 p.265-271dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/889/889_31.htm 7aarticle02560naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245010900127300001600236500014100252500002400393520109200417650001901509650001401528650002301542650002601565650001801591650002601609650002001635650001001655650001101665650002001676650001501696650002301711650002501734650002001759650001001779650001701789700001401806700002401820700001601844700001601860700001601876773014001892852000902032856004902041655001202090IND4457884420221116193030.0110512s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445788442DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJanssens, P.10aEffects of regulated deficit irrigation on pear trees cultivar 'Conference' under temperate zone climate  ap. 281-289.  aPaper presented at the Sixth International Symposium on Irrigation of Horticultural Crops, held November 2-6, 2009, Vina del Mar, Chile.  aIncludes references  aTo prevent drought stress, pear trees (Pyrus communis ‘Conference’) in Belgium and the Netherlands, under temperate conditions are equipped with a drip irrigation system.

The objective is to see the effect of a different soil moisture content during the shoot growth period. The orchard was situated on a silt loam soil, and was composed of 11 year old root pruned pear trees cultivar ‘Conference’ on Quince Adams rootstock. Each year two different irrigation regimes where accomplished and monitored by granular matrix sensors (Watermark) and gravimetric soil moisture determination. Tree water status was examined by stem water potential ((psi)stem). At harvest yield, fruit quality and fruit size where evaluated. Fruit size was negatively influenced when (psi)soil declined to -90 kPa. However a moderate depressed (psi)soil up to -60 kPa had no negative influence on production. 3aPyrus communis 3acultivars 3adeficit irrigation 3afield experimentation 3afruit quality 3airrigation management 3amicroirrigation 3apears 3ashoots 3asilt loam soils 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3asoil water potential 3atemperate zones 3atrees 3awater stress1 aElsen, F.1 aVandendriessche, H.1 aDeckers, T.1 aSchoofs, H.1 aVerjans, W.0 tActa horticulturae.g2011 Mar., , no. 889 p.281-289dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/889/889_33.htm 7aarticle03475naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245010500124300001600229500014100245500002400386520184700410650002002257650001102277650001202288650001002300650002402310650001602334650002102350650001302371650001802384650001602402650001602418650001902434650002102453650002102474650001102495650001402506650002002520650001302540650002102553650002502574650000902599650001502608650001602623650002002639650001502659650002302674650001102697700001502708773014002723852000902863856004902872655001202921IND4457883720221116193111.0110512s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445788372DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampi, P.10aEffects of irrigation management and nitrogen fertilization on the yield and quality of 'Gala' apple  ap. 249-255.  aPaper presented at the Sixth International Symposium on Irrigation of Horticultural Crops, held November 2-6, 2009, Vina del Mar, Chile.  aIncludes references  aFertilizers application in irrigation water (Fertigation) is considered to be an efficient method of fertilizing fruit trees, but some information is needed on the relationship between irrigation depth and nitrogen (N). The objective of this work was to know the response of apple tree to different levels of irrigation depth based on maximum crop evapotranspiration (ETc) and N fertilization. The experiment was carried out in 2008-09 summer growing season of apple trees Malus x domestica Borkh ‘Gala’, with a row spacing of 4×1 m (2500 pl. ha-1), seven years old, on the M9 rootstock, in a silt loam soil. The experimental design was split plots with two factors, with four complete randomized blocks. A main plot was irrigation depth according ETc: 0% (only rainfall), 50, 75 and 100% of the ETc, and a submain plot was three N fertilization levels: 0, 110 and 220 kg N ha-1. Soil water content (0-20 cm of soil depth), leaf minerals content (N, P, K, Ca, Mg), trunk section diameter, fruit total number, fruit diameter, weight, colour and firmness were measured. Different leaf mineral contents for N, K and P according irrigation depth were observed at pre-harvest. Nitrogen fertilization, however, only affected the leaf N content. Results indicate that it was a significant differences in yield, fruit diameter and weight response to the supplemental irrigation application. Yield for irrigation at 100% ETc, reached 40 t ha-1 and, for non-irrigation plants 27 t ha-1. Fruit diameters average was 71.53 and 62.69 mm for 100% ETc and non-irrigation treatments, respectively; and there were 70.97 and 67.88 mm for 220 kg N ha-1 and non-nitrogen treatments respectively. The differences in N fertilization on yield and fruit quality variables were not observed. Nitrogen application rates only affected fruit diameter but not yield. 3aMalus domestica 3aapples 3acalcium 3acolor 3aexperimental design 3afertigation 3afertilizer rates 3afirmness 3afruit quality 3afruit trees 3afruit yield 3agrowing season 3airrigation rates 3airrigation water 3aleaves 3amagnesium 3amineral content 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anitrogen fertilizers 3arain 3arootstocks 3arow spacing 3asilt loam soils 3asoil depth 3asoil water content 3asummer1 aGarcia, C.0 tActa horticulturae.g2011 Mar., , no. 889 p.249-255dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/889/889_29.htm 7aarticle03481naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245011000180300001600290520185400306650001502160650001102175650001602186650001602202650002202218650001502240650001402255650002102269650002302290650002702313650004402340650003202384650002602416650003802442650002702480650005702507650004202564653002302606653004902629653004102678653004002719773006502759852000902824856008502833930003302918945001302951946001102964655001202975IND2334649620221116193537.0031119e200308  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233464962DNAL7 a127123372pmid7 a10.1007/s00425-003-1034-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaschke, K.10aAlternation of the slow with the quick anion conductance in whole guard cells effected by external malate  ap. 651-657.  aIn previous investigations two anion conductances were discovered in guard-cell protoplasts: the quickly activating anion conductance (QUAC, R-type) and the slowly activating anion conductance (SLAC, S-type). In this investigation, effects of malate on the two anion conductances were tested in whole guard cells of Vicia faba L. by the use of the discontinuous single-electrode voltage-clamp method. Application of 1-s voltage ramps proved that QUAC displayed the malate shift of the activation threshold toward hyperpolarization also in complete guard cells. The sensitivity of SLAC to external malate was determined by responses to voltage pulses of 20 s duration at Cl- concentrations of 0.1, 3 or 50 mM. At no voltage were the currents measured at the end of the pulses in the presence and absence of malate significantly different from each other; the current-voltage relationship of SLAC appeared not to be affected by malate. However, in 32% of the cells exposed to malate, current activation in response to voltage steps occurred within 0.1 s, faster than was typical for SLAC, and activation was followed by inactivation with a half-time similar to 10 s: SLAC apparently had changed to QUAC. Simultaneously, the free-running membrane voltage depolarized at 0.1 mM Cl-, did not change at 3 mM Cl- and polarized at 50 mM Cl-, indicating that activation of QUAC increased the membrane conductance for anions and thereby drove the membrane voltage toward the equilibrium voltage of Cl-. The malate-induced changes were fully reversible at Cl- concentrations of 0.1 and 3 mM. These results reinforce the proposition that SLAC and QUAC represented two switching modes of the same anion channel (however, they do not suffice as proof); they also show that this interconvertibility can enable guard cells to control their membrane voltage rapidly. 3aVicia faba 3aleaves 3aguard cells 3aprotoplasts 3aelectrophysiology 3amalic acid 3achlorides 3aelectric current 2aAnionsxmetabolism 2aChlorinexpharmacology 2aIon Channelsxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aIon Transportxdrug effects 2aMalatesxpharmacology 2aMembrane Potentialsxdrug effects 2aPatch-Clamp Techniques 2aPlant Epidermisxcytologyxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aVicia fabaxdrug effectsxphysiology. 0aanion conductances 0adiscontinuous single-electrode voltage-clamp 0aquickly activating anion conductance 0aslowly activating anion conductance0 tPlanta.g2003 Aug., v. 217, no. 4 p.651-657x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-003-1034-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20031208b00000000c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02305naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001900149245006800168300001800236500002400254500001500278520092400293650001701217650002601234650002401260650001101284650001501295650002501310650002201335650001901357650001901376650002401395650001801419650001701437650002301454650000801477650001001485650001001495650001901505650001701524650001301541653001901554700001401573700002001587700001801607773011301625852000901738856005201747655001201799IND4463211920221116193504.0120514e200305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446321192DNAL7 a10.1016/S0925-5214(02)00194-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBernalte, M.J.10aInfluence of storage delay on quality of ‘Van’ sweet cherry  ap. 303–312.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe effect of delaying cool storage on the quality of ‘Van’ sweet cherries during and after storage was tested. Freshly harvested fruit were held at 22 °C for three different periods, 5, 15 and 25 h, before transfer to cool storage. After the delays, the fruit were cooled to 4 °C in a forced air tunnel and then packed in 500 g trays and wrapped with polypropylene film, and stored for 14 days at 1 °C and 90–95% RH and then 3 days at 7 °C (to simulate long distance transport). The fruit were then kept at room temperature for up to 4 days to study shelf-life. In the initial sample, before cool storage, cherries from the 15 h delay treatment had the highest soluble solids content (SSC), titratable acidity and were firmer. After 17 days of storage the fruit quality was well maintained. Cherries from the 15 h treatment had, in general, the highest color ratings and were firmer after 17 days of storage. 3aPrunus avium 3apostharvest treatment 3apackaging materials 3afruits 3ashelf life 3atotal soluble solids 3arelative humidity 3afood transport 3afood packaging 3astorage temperature 3afruit quality 3astorage time 3atitratable acidity 3aair 3acolor 3atrays 3apolypropylenes 3acold storage 3acherries 0asoluble solids1 aSabio, E.1 aHernandez, M.T.1 aGervasini, C.0 tPostharvest biology and technology.g2003 May, v. 28, no. 2 p.303–312-303–312dElsevierx0925-52147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0925-5214(02)00194-1 7aarticle03216naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001400164245013500178300001600313520080100329650002501130650001901155650002001174650002201194650002201216650003001238650001801268650002001286650002801306650002401334650001401358650001701372650002501389650002501414650002401439650004301463650005301506650004801559650002301607650004501630650003501675650005801710650005201768650003301820650002801853650001301881650004301894650006201937650004801999650002702047650003402074653001602108653002902124653002402153653002002177653002802197700002002225700001502245700001802260773006502278852000902343856008502352930003302437945001302470946001102483655001202494IND2334649820221116193507.0031119e200308  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233464982DNAL7 a129050232pmid7 a10.1007/s00425-003-1025-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Y.10aMolecular cloning of an arabidopsis homologue of GCN2, a protein kinase involved in co-ordinated response to amino acid starvation  ap. 668-675.  aDNA homologous to the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) protein kinase gene, GCN2, was amplified from arabidopsis [Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh.] RNA and given the name AtGCN2. The AtGCN2 peptide sequence included adjacent protein kinase and histidyl tRNA synthetase-like domains and showed 45% sequence identity with the GCN2 peptide sequence in the protein kinase domain. AtGCN2 transcripts were detectable in RNA from roots, leaves, stems, buds, flowers, siliques and seedlings. GCN2 is required for yeast cells to respond to amino acid starvation. Expression of AtGCN2 in yeast gcn2 mutants complemented the mutation, enabling growth in the presence of sulfometuron methyl, an inhibitor of branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis, and 3-aminotriazole, an inhibitor of histidine biosynthesis. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aplant proteins 3aprotein kinases 3amolecular cloning 3acomplementary DNA 3apolymerase chain reaction 3amessenger RNA 3agene expression 3agenetic complementation 3atissue distribution 3ahistidine 3abiosynthesis 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAmino Acidsxdeficiencyxpharmacology. 2aArabidopsisxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Complementaryxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologicxdrug effects 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxdrug effects 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aProtein Kinasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteinsxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 0aatgcn2 gene 0ahistidyl trna synthetase 0asulfometuron methyl 0a3-aminotriazole 0amolecular sequence data1 aDickinson, J.R.1 aPaul, M.J.1 aHalford, N.G.0 tPlanta.g2003 Aug., v. 217, no. 4 p.668-675x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-003-1025-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20031208b00000000c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02801naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001500164245010100179300001600280520109200296650001101388650002201399650001201421650002601433650001401459650002201473650001901495650002101514650002001535650002501555650002101580650002501601650001801626650004101644650002501685650003701710650001901747650002901766650004001795650003401835650001401869653003801883653003801921653002801959700001801987700001402005773006502019852000902084856008502093930003302178945001302211946001102224655001202235IND2334649020221116193441.0031119e200308  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233464902DNAL7 a126847842pmid7 a10.1007/s00425-003-1020-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHorita, M.10aProduction of fertile somatic hybrid plants between Oriental hybrid lily and Lilium x formolongi  ap. 597-601.  aSomatic hybridizations via electrofusion were performed in combinations of Oriental hybrid lilies (cvs. Acapulco and Shirotae) and Lilium x formolongi hort.

The divided protoplasts grew into calli on the culture medium containing picloram, and the calli were then transferred to the hormone-free culture medium for induction of plant regeneration. The regenerants were transferred to a greenhouse, and were grown until the flower stage. In the fusion combinations of Acapulco+Hakucho and Shirotae+Hakucho, four regenerants apparently showed different morphological features compared with their parents. The results of molecular analyses by means of cleaved amplified polymorphic sequences markers and flow cytometry confirmed that these regenerants were somatic hybrid plants. Furthermore, we examined the stability of the morphological features of the hybrids in the next generations. This is the first report to describe the successful realization of Lilium somatic hybridization via protoplast fusion. 3aLilium 3aornamental plants 3ahybrids 3asomatic hybridization 3acultivars 3aprotoplast fusion 3acallus culture 3amicropropagation 3aplant fertility 3agenetic polymorphism 3aplant morphology 3anucleotide sequences 3aelectrofusion 2aCell Divisionxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aCell Fusionxmethods 2aFertilityxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aFlow Cytometry 2aHybrid Cellsxphysiology 2aHybrid Vigorxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aLiliumxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aPhenotype 0aoriental hybrid lily cv. acapulco 0aoriental hybrid lily cv. shirotae 0amolecular sequence data1 aMorohashi, H.1 aKomai, F.0 tPlanta.g2003 Aug., v. 217, no. 4 p.597-601x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-003-1020-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20031208b00000000c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01511naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245007700164300001600241500002400257520066600281650001900947650002300966650001800989650002001007651001201027700002201039773010301061852000901164856004801173655001201221IND4447671720221116193513.0110121e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444767172DNAL7 a10.1134/S00978078080201392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBabayan, G.

The amino acid sequence deduced from clKAS IV cDNA showed 80% identity to other plant KAS II-type enzymes, 55% identity towards plant KAS I and over 90% towards other Cuphea KAS IV-type sequences. Recombinant clKAS IV was functionally overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and substrate specificity of purified enzyme showed strong preference for elongation of short-chain and medium-chain acyl-ACPs (C4- to C10-ACP) with nearly equal activity. Further elongation steps were catalysed with distinctly less activity. Moreover, short- and medium-chain acyl-ACPs exerted a chain-length-specific and concentration-dependent substrate inhibition of clKAS IV. Based on these findings a regulatory mechanism for medium-chain fatty acid synthesis in C. lanceolata is presented. 3amedium chain fatty acids 3aglycosidases 3aseeds 3acomplementary DNA 3arecombinant proteins 3atriacylglycerols 3aamino acid sequences 3anucleotide sequences 3alipid metabolism 3aCuphea 3aenzyme activity 3aseed development 2a3-Oxoacyl-(Acyl-Carrier-Protein) Synthasexgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aCloning, Molecular 2aCupheaxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aDNA, Complementaryxchemistryxgenetics. 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aFatty Acidsxbiosynthesis 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aSeedsxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSubstrate Specificity 0aO-glycoside hydrolases1 aAbbadi, A.1 aLoddenkotter, B.1 aBrummel, M.1 aSpener, F.0 tPlanta.g2002 Sept., v. 215, no. 5 p.847-854x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-002-0803-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20030801b20030801c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03033naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100001600181245010900197300001800306500002400324506007600348520152100424506003701945650002401982650001802006650001202024650001202036650001102048650001702059650001302076650001002089650001302099650003702112650002502149650001002174651001902184700002602203700001902229700001602248700001502264700001702279700001902296773013502315852000902450856008002459655001202539IND4449852920221207071358.0110225e20110301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444985292DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.01964-102doi7 aPMC30672782pmcid7 a211936752pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMerga, J.Y.10aComparison of Arcobacter Isolation Methods, and Diversity of Arcobacter spp. in Cheshire, United Kingdom  ap. 1646-1650.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe aims of this study were, firstly, to compare five published methods for the isolation of Arcobacter spp. from animal feces in order to determine the most sensitive and specific method. Second, we analyzed the resulting isolates by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) in order to investigate the diversity of the isolates recovered. Third, we investigated the ability to recover Arcobacter spp. from frozen fecal samples. Seventy-seven fecal samples from cattle, sheep, and badgers were subjected to five isolation methods, based on published methods for the isolation of Arcobacter and Campylobacter spp. Thirty-nine Arcobacter butzleri isolates were analyzed using a multilocus sequence typing scheme. The survival of Arcobacter spp. in frozen samples was investigated by freezing the fecal samples at -80°C for 7 days and then applying the same five isolation methods. The most sensitive and specific method used an Arcobacter-specific broth in conjunction with modified charcoal cefoperazone deoxycholate agar (mCCDA) with added antibiotics. Freezing of fecal samples led to a reduction in the recovery of Arcobacter spp. by approximately 50%. The 39 allelic profiles obtained by MLST could be divided into 11 sequence types (STs). We have identified the most sensitive and specific method for the isolation of Arcobacter spp. from animal feces and demonstrated that the freezing of fecal samples prior to isolation reduces arcobacter recovery. MLST analysis of the isolates revealed a high level of diversity.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArcobacter butzleri 3aCampylobacter 3aalleles 3abadgers 3acattle 3acefoperazone 3acharcoal 3afeces 3afreezing 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3aisolation techniques 3asheep 3aUnited Kingdom1 aLeatherbarrow, A.J.H.1 aWinstanley, C.1 aBennett, M.1 aHart, C.A.1 aMiller, W.G.1 aWilliams, N.J.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2011 Mar. 1, v. 77, no. 5 p.1646-1650dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.01964-103Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02341naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245007400166300001300240500002400253520114900277650001701426650001901443650002101462650002101483650002501504650002101529650002101550650002901571650001901600650001701619650002001636650000901656650002101665650002001686650002101706650001501727700001801742773010201760852000901862856004801871655001201919IND4429640320221116193313.0091207e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442964032DNAL7 a10.1007/s11103-009-9547-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGollan, Peter J.10aGenome-wide analysis of genes encoding FK506-binding proteins in rice  ap. 1-16.  aIncludes references  aThe FK506-binding proteins (FKBPs) are a class of peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase enzymes, some of which can also operate as molecular chaperones. FKBPs comprise a large ubiquitous family, found in virtually every part of the cell and involved in diverse processes from protein folding to stress response. Higher plant genomes typically encode about 20 FKBPs, half of these found in the chloroplast thylakoid lumen. Several FKBPs in plants are regulators of hormone signalling pathways, with important roles in seed germination, plant growth and stress response. Some FKBP isoforms exists as homologous duplicates operating in finely tuned mechanisms to cope with abiotic stress. In order to understand the roles of the plant FKBPs, especially in view of the warming environment, we have identified and analysed the gene families encoding these proteins in rice using computational approaches. The work has led to identification of all FKBPs from the rice genome, including novel high molecular weight forms. The rice FKBP family appears to have evolved by duplications of FKBP genes, which may be a strategy for increased stress tolerance. 3aOryza sativa 3aabiotic stress 3abinding proteins 3agene duplication 3amolecular chaperones 3amolecular weight 3amultigene family 3apeptidylprolyl isomerase 3aplant hormones 3aplant stress 3aprotein folding 3arice 3aseed germination 3astress response 3astress tolerance 3athylakoids1 aBhave, Mrinal0 tPlant molecular biology.g2010 Jan., v. 72, no. 1-2 p.1-16dSpringer Netherlandsx0167-44127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11103-009-9547-1 7aarticle01620naa a2200325 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001900115245008900134300001100223500001500234520070300249650002200952650002400974650002500998650002301023650002001046650003201066653003001098653001901128653001101147773006501158852000901223939003301232945000801265946000901273655001201282991589089590742620221116193251.0800718e197809  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI800015662DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurphy, Donna.13aAn update on the use of formulated grain-fruit products in school breakfast programs  ap. 64.  a2019-12-06  aIt was originally thought that formulated grain-fruit products would have the advantages of economy, nutrition and convenience when used in the school breakfast program. Reaction to the program, however, was negative. Five reasons are cited: these products may be deficient in micronutrients and fiber; dessert-like foods for breakfast will not serve the cause of good nutrition education; children cannot distinguish between fortified and unfortified sweets; there are convenient alternatives in the program already; and the long-term effects of highly processed foods are not known. Research is being done to determine whether or not these products should be withdrawn from the breakfast program. 3abreakfast cereals 3anutrition education 3anutritional adequacy 3aelementary schools 3aprocessed foods 3afood and nutrition programs 0aSchool breakfast programs 0agrain products 0afruits0 tNational food review.g1978 Sept.,  p.64-64x0161-24747nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19800718c00000000  aFNC  aUSDA 7aarticle04155naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001400164245011800178300001600296520169500312650002002007650001002027650002502037650002402062650002002086650001702106650001602123650001302139650001602152650002102168650002202189650002502211650001902236650002002255650001802275650002102293650002502314650002402339650007002363650003302433650002302466650002802489650007102517650004402588650003802632650003102670650005202701650005002753650002802803650002902831650001402860650004202874650004202916650003302958650002702991650003403018650003603052653002803088700001703116700001603133700001503149700001603164773006603180852000903246856008503255930003303340945001303373946001103386655001203397IND2333013120221116193116.0030611e200209  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233301312DNAL7 a122444402pmid7 a10.1007/s00425-002-0818-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaloi, M.10aMolecular and biochemical characterisation of two aspartic proteinases TcAP1 and TcAP2 from Theobroma cacao seeds  ap. 754-762.  aAspartic proteinase (EC 3.4.23) activity plays a pivotal role in the degradation of Theobroma cacao L. seed proteins during the fermentation step of cacao bean processing. Therefore, this enzyme is believed to be critical for the formation of the peptide and amino acid cocoa flavor precursors that occurs during fermentation. Using cDNA cloning and northern blot analysis, we show here that there are at least two distinct aspartic proteinase genes (TcAP1 and TcAP2) expressed during cacao seed development. Both genes are expressed early during seed development and their mRNA levels decrease towards the end of seed maturation. TcAP2 is expressed at a much higher level than TcAP1, although the expression of TcAP1 increases slightly during germination. The proteins encoded by TcAP1 and TcAP2 are relatively different from each other (73% identity). This, and the fact that the two corresponding genes have different expression patterns, suggests that the TcAP1 and TcAP2 proteins may have different functions in the maturing seeds and during germination. Because the TcAP2 gene is expressed at a much higher level during seed development than TcAP1, it is likely that the TcAP2 protein is primarily responsible for the majority of the industrially important protein hydrolysis that occurs during cacao bean fermentation. Finally, TcAP2 has been functionally expressed in the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica. The secreted recombinant protein is able to hydrolyse bovine haemoglobin at acidic pH and is sensitive to pepstatin A, confirming that TcAP2 encodes an aspartic proteinase, and strongly suggests that this gene encodes the well-characterized aspartic proteinase of mature cacao seeds. 3aTheobroma cacao 3aseeds 3aaspartic proteinases 3aprotein degradation 3aenzyme activity 3afermentation 3acocoa beans 3apeptides 3aamino acids 3aflavor compounds 3acomplementary DNA 3anucleotide sequences 3aimmunoblotting 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3aseed germination 3aamino acid sequences 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAspartic Acid Endopeptidasesxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCacaoxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aCloning, Molecular 2aCoumarinsxpharmacology 2aDNA, Complementaryxchemistryxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aIsoenzymesxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aLeucinexanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPepstatinsxpharmacology 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSeedsxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aYarrowiaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0amolecular sequence data1 aMcCarthy, J.1 aMorandi, O.1 aGysler, C.1 aBucheli, P.0 tPlanta.g2002 Sept., v. 215, no. 5 p.754-762x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-002-0818-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20030801b20030801c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01865naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245004400132300001400176520099000190650000901180650002301189650002301212650002401235650001701259650002101276650001901297650002001316653001901336653002001355700001701375773006401392852000901456930003301465945000801498946000901506655001201515991589088750742620221116193012.0810309e198009  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI810006102DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, Judy.12aA survey of health-related food choices  ap. 16-19.  aA nationwide survey indicated that Americans are influenced by health and nutrition concerns when buying food: 64% of sampled households had made diet changes during the past 3 years for health reasons. A reduction in sugar intake was the most often cited concern of households who had made a change in food choice (52%), with 91% of respondents agreeing that all persons should eat less sugar; 28% cited decreases in cholesterol; 20% cited reduction in salt intake; and 17% wanted to lower blood pressure. Only 6% of all households mentioned dietary fiber as a concern causing a change in food use. At least 1 member had tried to lose weight in 61% of sampled households. Policy makers are encouraging Americans to gradually discontinue unhealthy food practices, and nutrition educators are teaching dietary skills which promote good eating habits. It is not clear, however, how far nutrition education and intervention programs should be allowed to regulate the public's food choice. 3adiet 3aconsumer attitudes 3adisease prevention 3anutrition education 3afood choices 3anational surveys 3ahealth beliefs 3abehavior change 0afeeding habits 0aGovernment role1 aWeimer, Jon.0 tNational food review.g1980 Fall,  p.16-19x0161-24747nnas  aDNAL  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aFNC  aUSDA 7aarticle03510naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245011700184300001600301500001500317520182400332650001902156650001802175650001102193650001902204650002202223650001702245650003202262650001202294650004402306650002302350650004602373650004102419650003902460650002902499650001302528650002302541650004602564650005002610653001802660653002202678653001602700700001602716700001902732773006602751852000902817856008502826930003302911945001302944946001102957655001202968IND2333013820221116193534.0030611e200209  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233301382DNAL7 a122444412pmid7 a10.1007/s00425-002-0817-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHunnik, E. van.10aUptake of CO2 and bicarbonate by intact cells and chloroplasts of Tetraedron minimum and Chlamydomonas noctigama  ap. 763-769.  a2019-12-04  aUsing a mass-spectrometric disequilibrium technique, net uptake of HCO3(-) and CO2 during steady-state photosynthesis was studied in whole cells and chloroplasts from the green algae Tetraedron minimum and Chlamydomonas noctigama, grown in air enriched with 5% (v/v) CO2 (high-CO2 cells) or in air [0.035% (v/v) CO2; low-CO2 cells]. High- and low-CO2 cells of both species were able to take up CO2 and HCO3(-), with maximum rates being largely unaffected by the growth conditions. High- and low-CO2 cells of T. minimum showed a pronounced preference for HCO3(-) while the rates of net HCO3(-) and CO2 uptake were similar in C. noctigama. The most significant differences between high- and low-CO2 cells of the two species were the 5- to 6-fold increase in the apparent affinities of net HCO3(-) uptake and CO2 uptake after acclimation to air. The high-affinity uptake systems for inorganic carbon were almost completely induced within 4 h in both algae. Photosynthetically active chloroplasts isolated from both species were also able to take up CO2 and HCO3(-). As in whole cells, HCO3(-) was the dominant carbon species taken up by chloroplasts from T. minimum while CO2 and HCO3(-) were taken up at similar rates in plastids from C. noctigama. In addition, high-affinity uptake systems for CO2 and HCO3(-) were detected in chloroplasts preparations after acclimation of the parent cells to air. Isolation of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase revealed K(m) values of 13 and 42 micromolar CO2 for the enzymes from T. minimum and C. noctigama, respectively. These results are consistent with the presence of inducible and energy-dependent high-affinity HCO3(-) and CO2 uptake systems associated with chloroplasts, indicating that these organelles play an important role in the CO2-concentrating mechanism. 3acarbon dioxide 3aChlamydomonas 3aanions 3aphotosynthesis 3amass spectrometry 3achloroplasts 2aAcclimatizationxphysiology 2aAnimals 2aBicarbonatesxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aCarbonxmetabolism 2aCarbon Dioxidexmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aChlamydomonasxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aChlorophytaxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aChloroplastsxmetabolism 2aKinetics 2aOxygenxmetabolism 2aPhotosynthesisxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aRibulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylasexmetabolism 0aChlorophycota 0abicarbonate anion 0aChlorophyta1 aAmoroso, G.1 aSultemeyer, D.0 tPlanta.g2002 Sept., v. 215, no. 5 p.763-769x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-002-0817-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20030801b20030801c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01632naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245006400162300001600226500002400242520059300266650001300859650001500872650001600887650003000903650000900933650001300942650001800955650001900973650001400992650001201006650001501018700001901033700001701052700001701069773010301086852000901189856004801198655001201246IND4428718220221116193200.0091113e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442871822DNAL7 a10.1134/S00978078090600862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalov, A.

Small, but significant, changes were detected in the macrofaunal community sampled beneath oyster trestles compared with that found in adjacent uncultivated areas. These changes were associated with an increase in organic and silt composition and a reduction in the depth of the oxygenated layer of the sediment beneath the trestles. Water velocity was decreased by the presence of the trestles which probably led to the increase in sedimentation rate observed beneath them. Although biological and physical changes were observed, they were relatively minor compared with the extreme environmental changes associated with the suspended culture techniques used for other bivalve species and fishes. However, other studies suggest that the environmental effects associated with oyster cultivation become more severe in areas of large-scale (hectares) cultivation. 3aCrassostrea gigas 3abenthic organisms 3abenthic zone 3aenvironmental impact 3aestuaries 3afish 3aoyster culture 3aoysters 3arivers 3asilt 3awater 3aEngland1 aKaiser, M.J.1 aSpencer, B.E.1 aEdwards, D.B.0 tAquaculture research.g1996 Dec., v. 27, no. 12 p.913-924dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1355-557X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2109.1996.t01-1-00821.x 7aarticle03192naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245009200184300001800276500001500294520113900309650001801448650002201466650001201488650002201500650001101522650002501533650001101558650001501569650001901584650002601603650002301629650002801652650003701680650002801717650002301745650003101768650002501799650003301824650002801857650002801885650002401913650002401937650002801961650003501989650003102024650003702055650002902092650003302121650004502154650002402199653002802223700001802251700001402269700001702283773006702300852000902367856008502376930003302461945001302494946001102507655001202518IND2333894920221116193352.0030807e200210  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233389492DNAL7 a123551622pmid7 a10.1007/s00425-002-0826-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLytovchenko, A.14aThe influence of cytosolic phosphoglucomutase on photosynthetic carbohydrate metabolism  ap. 1013-1021.  a2019-12-04  aThe aim of this work was to examine the role of cytosolic phosphoglucomutase (cPGM; EC 5.4.2.2) in photosynthetic carbon partitioning. We have previously described the generation and characterisation of the tuber metabolism of transgenic potato (Solanum tuberosum cv. Desiree) lines expressing the StcPGM gene in the antisense orientation under the control of the 35S promoter. Here we extend the characterisation of leaf metabolism within these lines, examining properties of gas exchange, carbon partitioning, and the effect of the genetic manipulation on a wide range of metabolites including metabolites of the sucrose-starch transition, glycolysis, the Krebs cycle and amino acid metabolism. The data acquired in the present study surprisingly reveal that the photosynthetic sucrose synthetic capacity of the leaves is largely unaltered but that these plants display a reduced rate of photosynthesis, a dramatic reduction in nucleotide levels, and a general decline of biosynthesis. We conclude that these lines exhibit only moderate changes in sucrose synthesis but more complex changes on a range of diverse metabolic pathways. 3aantisense DNA 3atransgenic plants 3asucrose 3aSolanum tuberosum 3astarch 3abiochemical pathways 3aleaves 3aglycolysis 3aphotosynthesis 3aamino acid metabolism 3aphosphoglucomutase 2aAmino Acidsxmetabolism 2aBiological Transportxphysiology 2aCarbohydrate Metabolism 2aCarbonxmetabolism 2aCarbon Dioxidexmetabolism 2aCarbon Radioisotopes 2aCarboxylic Acidsxmetabolism 2aCarotenoidsxmetabolism 2aChlorophyllxmetabolism 2aCytosolxenzymology 2aEnzymesxmetabolism 2aNucleotidesxmetabolism 2aPhosphoglucomutasexmetabolism 2aPhotosynthesisxphysiology 2aPigments, Biologicalxmetabolism 2aPlant Leavesxmetabolism 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aSolanum tuberosumxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aSucrosexmetabolism 0acarbohydrate metabolism1 aSweetlove, L.1 aPauly, M.1 aFernie, A.R.0 tPlanta.g2002 Oct., v. 215, no. 6 p.1013-1021x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-002-0826-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20030903b20030905c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01478naa a2200325 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002100115245005700136300001400193500001500207520061300222650002300835650003000858650002600888650002100914650002000935650001600955650001600971653001300987653001601000773006501016852000901081939003301090945000801123946000901131655001201140991589087540742620221116193438.0800718e197809  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI800015642DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, Judy Lea.10aConference on nutrition and the American food system  ap. 60-62.  a2019-12-06  aRepresentatives from consumer groups, government, food industry, and professional, scientific and academic institutions discussed some issues raised in the debate over national dietary goals.

Cassava, however, contains potentially toxic levels of the cyanogenic glucoside, linamarin. The cyanogen content of cassava foods can be reduced to safe levels by maceration, soaking, rinsing and baking; however, short-cut processing techniques can yield toxic food products. Our objective was to eliminate cyanogens from cassava so as to eliminate the need for food processing. To achieve this goal we generated transgenic acyanogenic cassava plants in which the expression of the cytochrome P450 genes (CYP79D1 and CYP79D2), that catalyze the first-dedicated step in linamarin synthesis, was inhibited. Using a leaf-specific promoter to drive the antisense expression of the CYP79D1/CYP79D2 genes we observed up to a 94% reduction in leaf linamarin content associated with an inhibition of CYP79D1 and CYP79D2 expression. Importantly, the linamarin content of roots also was reduced by 99% in transgenic plants having between 60 and 94% reduction in leaf linamarin content. Analysis of CYP79D1/CYP79D2 transcript levels in transgenic roots indicated they were unchanged relative to wild-type plants. These results suggest that linamarin is transported from leaves to roots and that a threshold level of leaf linamarin production is required for transport. 3aManihot esculenta 3acassava 3avegetable crops 3atransgenic plants 3aroots 3aleaves 3aplant proteins 3acytochrome P-450 3amessenger RNA 3agene expression 3aenzyme inhibition 3acyanogen 3acyanogenic glycosides 3abiosynthesis 3abiochemical pathways 3anucleotide sequences 2aCytochrome P-450 Enzyme Systemxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGlycosidesxmetabolism 2aIsoenzymesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aManihotxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aNitrilesxmetabolism 2aPlant Leavesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Rootsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0acyp79d1 gene 0acyp79d2 gene 0alinamarin 0amolecular sequence data1 aSayre, R.T.0 tPlanta.g2003 July, v. 217, no. 3 p.367-373x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-003-1005-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20031103b20031113c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03549naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001500164245006500179300001800244500001500262520128500277650001601562650002101578650002501599650001201624650001901636650001201655650002001667650002801687650004001715650004101755650002001796650003201816650002001848650004101868650005001909650003501959650007701994650004402071650003102115650005302146650002202199650002402221650004402245650008102289653003402370653003802404653002002442653003502462653001502497700001802512700001402530700002002544700001802564700001602582700001702598700001802615773006702633852000902700856008502709930003302794945001302827946001102840655001202851IND2333895420221116193630.0030807e200210  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233389542DNAL7 a123551642pmid7 a10.1007/s00425-002-0834-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeidel, V.10aBiosynthesis of podophyllotoxin in Linum album cell cultures  ap. 1031-1039.  a2019-12-04  aCell cultures of Linum album Kotschy ex Boiss. (Linaceae) showing high accumulation of the lignan podophyllotoxin (PTOX) were established. Enzymological studies revealed highest activities of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase, 4-hydroxycinnamate:CoA ligase and cinnamoyl-CoA:-NADP oxidoreductase immediately prior to PTOX accumulation. To investigate PTOX biosynthesis, feeding experiments were performed with [2-13C]3',4'-dimethoxycinnamic acid, [2-13C]3',4'-methylenedioxycinnamic acid (MDCA), [2-13C]3',4',5'-trimethoxycinnamic acid, [2-13C]sinapic acid, [2-13C]- and [2,3-13C2]ferulic acid. Analysis of the metabolites by HPLC coupled to tandem mass spectrometry revealed incorporation of label from ferulic acid into PTOX and deoxypodophyllotoxin (DOP). In addition, MDCA was also unambiguously incorporated intact into PTOX. These observations suggest that in L. album both ferulic acid and methylenedioxy-substituted cinnamic acid can be incorporated into lignans. Furthermore, it appears that, in this species, the hydroxylation of DOP is a rate-limiting point in the pathway leading to PTOX.

The samples were divided into three groups based on the [NO₃] versus [As]: high [NO₃] (10-150 mg/l as NO₃) with low [As] (0-5 µg/l), low [NO₃] (0-10 mg/l) with high [As] (5-120 µg/l), and low [NO₃] (0-10 mg/l) and [As] (0-5 µg/l). Groundwater from the Seoul hard-rock and Jakarta unconfined aquifer belonged to the first group, while that of the confined aquifer of Jakarta, Manila, and Bangkok belonged to the second group and the Taipei groundwater belonged to the last group. Comparison of the hydrogeological parameters and groundwater geochemistry among cities demonstrated that the redox conditions defined the behaviour of contaminants. In groundwater from Manila and Bangkok, where impermeable marine clay deposits comprise a large proportion of the surface geology, NO₃ was depleted due to denitrification, while the As levels were higher as a result of the reducing conditions of the aquifer. Conversely, the relatively oxic environments in the Jakarta unconfined aquifers and the Seoul crystalline rock aquifer resulted in less denitrification and As dissolution. The results of this study suggest that [NO₃] versus [As] diagrams are a useful method of evaluating the pollution types and contamination processes among the different urban groundwater systems while considering the hydrogeological settings. 3aaquifers 3aarsenic 3acities 3aclay 3adenitrification 3ageochemistry 3agroundwater 3anitrates 3apollution 3arocks1 aNakano, Takanori1 aShimizu, Yuta1 aOnodera, Shin-ichi1 aTaniguchi, Makoto0 tHydrological processes.g2011 Aug. 15, v. 25, no. 17 p.2742-2754dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0885-60877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.8015 7aarticle01785naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245012900127300001400256500001500270520076100285650001001046650002401056650002301080650001501103651001101118651001801129653001501147653001701162653002601179653003501205653001901240700001501259773009801274852000901372939003301381946000901414655001201423IND9303468520221116193037.0930607e199211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930346852DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSparks, A.L.12aA simultaneous econometric model of world fresh vegetable trade, 1962-82: an application of nonlinear simultaneous equations  ap. 15-26.  a2019-12-04  aWorld fresh vegetable trade increased more than fourfold between 1962 and 1982.
